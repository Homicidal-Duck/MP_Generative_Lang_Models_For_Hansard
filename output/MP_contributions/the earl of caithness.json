["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> may i press him a little further to give me a date when the white paper will be published and to say how soon after that a decision will be made regarding this particular road <e>", "<cs> my lords i support fully the words of the noble baroness who has just spoken on this matter but we have the report so i am going to go into some detail and shall run the risk of competing with the noble lord lord sainsbury <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord lord sainsbury not only for the work he has done in preparing this report on such a technical matter but also for raising it in your lordships house tonight <e> <s> i should like to speak briefly to certain points raised by the draft directive <e> <s> i believe it is fundamental to any consideration of a directive that in the first place everyone understands what is meant by the key terms <e> <s> definitions that are precise and will be interpreted in the same way by all member states are essential to the sensible working of this directive <e> <s> this also forms the basis of harmonisation but it soon became clear in evidence to the committee that the definitions in this directive were open to different interpretations and therefore unless there are a number of changes to the document it will not achieve the purpose for which it is designed <e>", "<cs> i for one am very pleased to hear those words from the front bench because this is a problem <e> <s> as my noble friend will be aware in order to enable agricultural co-operatives to become feasible in their own right the agriculture and forestry associations act was passed in <e> <s> that was absorbed into the restrictive practices act <e> <s> however i welcome the assurance that he has given that he will look at this again because it is getting in a muddle in that the co-operatives are already governed by the agricultural marketing act and the fair trading act <e> <s> the director general of fair trading has pretty extensive powers now to look into any co-operative when it seems as though it might be abusing the purposes for which it was set up <e> <s> we are governed by stringent rules under the restrictive practices act and i am very glad that he realises that a further complication by inclusion in the provisions of the competition bill would make life very difficult indeed for the co-operatives <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for what my noble friend has said on this matter <e> <s> however he made one remark which i should like him to clarify <e> <s> he said again that the fair trading act was not the complete answer <e> <s> however there is the agricultural marketing act which covers the agricultural marketing boards and that i have been informed covers every situation raised by the bill <e> <s> therefore it is sheer duplication rather than covering any new ground <e> <s> perhaps he could confirm whether that is a correct interpretation <e>", "<cs> without wishing to press the point but in order to satisfy the people who have given me help in this matter can the minister suggest one or two areas which would prove his point <e> <s> specific examples would be most useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise two small but quite major points <e> <s> the first point relates to the overall limit on which grant can be claimed <e> <s> at the moment as my noble friend said it is on the fcgs scheme and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend when he proposes to introduce the appropriate amendment so that we can see the exact wording under clause as promised <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that the agricultural marketing boards do not want exemption from the act <e> <s> that is a total misapprehension <e> <s> they want exemption from this clause and this clause deals with the internal workings of the boards <e> <s> that is what is covered by the act <e> <s> we are not taking the boards out of the bill <e> <s> if this amendment were to be agreed to it would in no way affect the application of <e>", "<cs> which does the house prefer <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend mentioned anti-competitive practices <e> <s> would he not agree that the agricultural marketing boards are already caught under this particular heading of anti-competitive practices under clauses to of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to my noble friend land sandford for the work that he did as chairman of arcadia and for bringing these two very important matters to your lordships attention today <e> <s> it is difficult to isolate them and therefore i have found it necessary to take into consideration on an eec level the select committees report on the common agricultural policy and to go back on a national level to the strutt report <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the point was nicely put by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> he said that the act had similar powers to the powers under this bill <e> <s> it is for this reason that at this very early stage and in order to save any duplication and bureaucracy the minister of agriculture who can quite easily initiate investigations under the act is told of the wish of the director general of fair trading and to put the responsibility on to the director general of fair trading rather than the secretary of state seems to me to be eminently logical in this context <e> <s> therefore i cannot fail to disagree with my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord trefgarne because i appreciate that there is collective responsibility <e> <s> on the other hand i do not think it is the job of the secretary of state for trade to he totally <e>", "<cs> i think with the help of his right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade yes and i am sure that he is in his own right too <e> <s> i think that in this case the minister of agriculture should be given the right to say no <e> <s> this is the wrong act under which to make any investigation or reference to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> the right act is the act because it is more comprehensive and covers the extra points with which i wish to deal <e> <s> if that power is not given to the minister of agriculture there could be great duplication of work and perhaps the wrong type of investigation when the time comes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend why it was that in the fair trading act the wordsjoint actionwere inserted and not just the wordconsultation <e> <s> if the reasons that he has just given to us apply now surely they applied then <e> <s> if a matter is raised under the fair trading act joint <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to my noble friend lord dulverton for raising this important matter today and too wish to add my congratulations to the two maiden speakers <e> <s> the need for a clear forestry policy is evident as has been proved today but i hope those who finally determine that <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a couple of points that very briefly i should like to mention <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend the minister to take on board the point raised by my noble friends lord stanley of alderley and lord sandford namely that we should allow the prior approval of sssis and national parks to go to adas first <e> <s> this would save a lot of worries so far as the farmers are concerned and would create the extra confidence which is being undermined at the moment <e> <s> it would also improve a slightly invidious position so far as adas is concerned <e>", "<cs> obviously i am a little disappointed by the noble and learned lords reply on this amendment <e> <s> i should like him to consider stansted where i understand that a planning application for the development of stansted airport is shortly to be made <e> <s> it will involve an area of about acres and many farmers will be looking for land <e> <s> if they are given the advantages of being able to claim a farm loss or a home loss payment under a blight notice this will surely be for the convenience of the local authority and in the national interest <e>", "<cs> in view of the assurance given by the noble and learned lord perhaps he could write to me on the subject <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole subject of fisheries is an emotive one at the moment and therefore the committees report is most timely <e> <s> it has generally been accepted as a clear concise and authoritative document containing a great deal of sense <e> <s> as has already been said much credit for it must go to the skill of our chairman the noble lord lord walston our specialist adviser and our clerk <e> <s> i found that much of the evidence that we received did not accord with the impressions that i had formulated of the industry and that much of what i had heard read and seen prior to starting work on the report was misleading in particular that membership of the eec was a cause of the industrys difficulties <e> <s> i should like to say just a few words about the report although much of it has already been covered <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the concern that has arisen over this matter would my noble friend give urgent consideration to a consultation procedure which is rather more efficient than the one at present and furthermore an appeals procedure <e> <s> because as i understand it there is no appeal if an sssi is designated <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend please answer the point i made about an appeals procedure <e> <s> this would help to maintain the good but possibly deteriorating relationship between <e>", "<cs> my lords i was disappointed and then was made suddenly rather happier by what the minister said <e> <s> certainly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i support the relaxation of central government controls to a certain extent <e> <s> these will be dealt with locally up to a point <e> <s> looking back one can say that there have been no cases but the farming community is worried about the exceptional case <e> <s> however in view of what my noble friend the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house in the first instance if on this amendment i speak for rather longer than i would normally but it is a most important subject and i was thwarted by prior commitment from speaking on second reading and on the appropriate day of the committee stage <e> <s> on the question of principle other noble lords have argued this case in committee far better than i could <e> <s> of course it is wrong and i believe it is the thin end of the wedge for further charges to be made <e> <s> many noble lords will be aware that the farming and land-occupying community is gravely concerned at the moment about present and proposed legislation and in particular whether there appears to be an increasing role for the department of the environment at the expense of the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> we are told not to worry and that it is the government and not the individual departments that matter as there are regular inter-departmental meetings and liaison <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he please reply to my point about whether he supports what his noble friend lord belstead said <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a small technical point <e> <s> as i understand it an appeal can be made against this procedure under a planning enforcement notice where the applicant claims that the planning permission was not needed in the first instance <e> <s> however by the time that appeal has gone through he has paid to the secretary of state the fee as prescribed by the secretary of state <e> <s> when the appeal is upheld will the secretary of state refund the fee to the applicant and if so will he refund it with interest at the appropriate rate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with the leave of the house ask the minister to clarify one point <e> <s> we have heard of intentions and assurances <e> <s> can he tell me exactly where in the regulations he has mentioned there is a duty for the secretary of state to consider the objections and a duty for the local authority to submit the objections to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have read that and i remain unconvinced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the minister and his department for the courtesy and help that they have given my noble friend and me in trying to resolve the matter <e> <s> we are not far apart <e> <s> indeed we are very close but the fact is that we want it written into the bill rather than have an assurance and some regulation which we are not quite sure about <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read with interest what my noble friend has said and i hope that f shall be able to agree with him <e> <s> the matter of appeal is one of principle and f feel that i cannot withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down it might be for the benefit of the house if i were to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> za in view of what has been said and will my noble and learned friend please confirm that the appropriate authority will give consideration to disposing of the land in the first instance to the previous owner from whom they acquired it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the government for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> it demonstrates to local planning authorities that parliament and the government place a special responsibility on them to reach agreement when preparing plans with the minister of agriculture in other words to make every effort to minimise the loss of good agricultural land <e> <s> my noble friend referred to the fact that he considered it unnecessary <e> <s> although i hate to draw his attention to it i will nevertheless draw his attention in this instance to an article in <e>", "<cs> may i just clarify that the secretary of state can make an order presumably without the consent of either house of parliament but to annul it requires a resolution of either house of parliament <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> if i may follow the point raised by my noble friend lord onslow the clause deals with emergency action <e> <s> the flaw in the argument put forward by the noble lord lord kilbracken and the noble lord lord melchett is that it has to be done at very short notice <e> <s> if one has advance warning that these things will happen which the noble lord lord kilbracken seems to think will happen one can apply for a licence and everything will be all right <e> <s> but this might be over a period of a week in which case there is no chance of getting a licence <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord care to comment on the point that i raised <e> <s> although he has kindly agreed to take it away and look at it there is a precedent for using damage to property in the examples that i gave <e> <s> secondly may we have further elucidation as to whether the words substantially domesticated include red deer <e>", "<cs> i also see a problem and perhaps the noble lord lord melchett will consider it <e> <s> the problem arises as regards silage and lucern-making where birds are nesting in these grass fields or lucern fields which are harvested as he knows on a regular basis at an awkward time of year <e> <s> perhaps he could give consideration to that as well <e>", "<cs> would it be for the convenience of the committee that we look at amendments nos <e> <s> a and a standing in my name and that of my noble friend lord stanley and also dealing with airguns <e> <s> as the noble lord lord houghton said there have been numerous complaints about the misuse of airguns and many cases have been brought to my attention which show that they have been injurious though not necessarily of fatal damage to livestock and humans <e>", "<cs> the greylag <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> it was a much wider debate than i thought it was going to be when i put down the amendments <e> <s> i got the assurance that i was seeking from the government that general licences or licences of a type will be issued to deal with these birds when and if they become a problem <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee to look at the same time at amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and that of my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> it refers to the air gun air rifle and air pistol and would insert a provision in another part of the bill <e> <s> however as the government are looking at the matter with regard to birds if we could have an assurance in relation to my amendment that might help to speed up our proceedings <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> this is quite an important point <e> <s> i should like to ask the government whether they consider this amendment the next amendment no <e> <s> relating to the conservation of seals act and amendment no <e> <s> relating to the deer act as appropriate amendments to this bill <e> <s> if the existing legislation specifically on deer badgers and seals is inadequate surely the advisers to the government or to noble lords would have recommended that separate bills be introduced to deal with the appropriate problem <e> <s> perhaps the government spokesman could comment on this point before we continue <e>", "<cs> i apologise if earlier i interrupted the noble lord lord melchett at the wrong moment <e> <s> these amendments appear to be separate but as my noble friend has given an assurance to consider the matters that have been raised i hope he will consider the provision in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for those remarks <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend confirm that he is looking at the question of the words any other form of property in view of the precedent i gave him when we last discussed this <e>", "<cs> i cannot follow the noble lord lord donaldson at all in his argument because if we read the whole of subsection and in particular paragraphs <e>", "<cs> but if the nature conservancy council says to the secretary of state the farmers are disobeying the conditions of the general licence surely the secretary of state would merely revoke the licence <e>", "<cs> what i was trying to get from the government was whether they have any proposals at the moment for making a charge and if so how much <e> <s> if they make the charge will this delay the granting of a licence <e> <s> because as we discussed earlier this could be a critical question of timing for the farmer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is it not for the benefit of the consumer because the farmer is producing crops and if those crops are under attack it means the price of food might go up <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has misled the committee unintentionally again when he referred to the minister for agriculture fisheries and food not having to take the advice of the ncc <e> <s> in fact it clearly states in clause he was referring to licences at the time that the minister of agriculture fisheries and food and the secretary of state shall from time to time consult <e> <s> so that point must now be cleared up to the committees satisfaction <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the amendment and it gives me great pleasure to support the noble lord lord melchett on this occasion <e> <s> i would not comment further on the strutt report because i have spoken in depth on that before in your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that under section of the countryside act the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food must when it gives advice have regard to nature conservation and the landscape <e> <s> therefore it is already embodied in our legislation <e>", "<cs> this is an emotive issue and one must analyse the practicalities of the amendments on the marshalled list <e> <s> the amendments in the name of my noble friends lord buxton and lord craigton maintain two tiers of sssi super and ordinary but with both having a higher level of protection than is currently envisaged in the bill <e> <s> with respect <e>", "<cs> i believe that there are two tiers of sssi but at a higher level than at the moment in that my noble friend lord craigton envisages a super sssi where there would be a complete ban on all agricultural operations <e>", "<cs> i will take advice on that <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to have a look at it but the point i am making is still a valid one <e> <s> the first question is whether the ncc has the manpower finance or expertise to control the production of food and the livelihood of perhaps thousands of farmers on about million acres in this country <e> <s> the answer is surely no <e> <s> despite the hopes that they might be able to do it i do not believe that they can <e> <s> if the answer was yes then the structure of british farming as we know it today would have to change <e> <s> i do not think this is the opportune moment to arrange for such a change or to take the debate on it a stage further <e> <s> there is no question that certain sites must be protected <e> <s> the farmers themselves would be numbered among the most dismayed if no increased protection were given to our most endangered animals and plants <e>", "<cs> i will read what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it would help if the ncc told the farmers where they were designating land and also what the farmers were supposed to protect <e> <s> as was stated on many occasions at second reading the countryside is ever-changing <e> <s> it is not something to be preserved in a glass case <e> <s> our heritage which is so important to us is best managed by mutual agreement and by a good understanding between the ncc and the farmers <e> <s> i believe the government have got it right <e> <s> i think it is a fair balance <e> <s> i think that one is already seeing notwithsanding some remarks made earlier an improvement in the state of our wild life due to this happy arrangement <e>", "<cs> i will read with interest the comments made by everybody who has taken part in this debate on this amendment and on the previous one and perhaps we can come back to it at a later stage <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i should like to ask my noble friend on the front bench to confirm whether the term limestone pavement could be extended to such places as the cotswolds <e>", "<cs> could i <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i was going to point out that one of the famous quartet happens to sit on his benches too <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that my noble friend on the front bench has confused me a little more than i thought i was confused before by this part of the bill <e> <s> what i am trying to do by these amendments is to allow justice to be seen <e> <s> i am not trying to stop access to the countryside or in any way trying to alter the law relating to what i call the -year rule <e> <s> the bill as it stands as far as i understand it this was highlighted by my noble friend lord stanley means that if a right of way is claimed after years and new evidence is brought after years that new evidence is inadmissible by the fact that the path has already been dedicated <e> <s> am i right <e>", "<cs> then can i ask my noble friend what is the point of bringing forward new evidence <e>", "<cs> i will not prolong this discussion at this stage <e> <s> we will bring this back at a later stage and i hope that on consideration the noble lords lord fletcher and lord houghton will see my point and will be able to support me <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment but i would advise my noble friend to withdraw it and come back with a stronger amendment in order to satisfy the points raised by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> however like my noble friend on the front bench i do not think that the present legislation is working because in sheep were killed in this connection and a further were injured <e> <s> if that is the case and these are reliable statistics the law does not seem to be working and we ought to look into this question in more detail at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to note that the party opposite is becoming more tolerant <e> <s> it was one of their members the honourable member dr dickson mabon who introduced a similar clause affecting bulls in scotland into the countryside scotland act <e> <s> interestingly enough a question in another place answered on th february last asked the secretary of state for scotland how many cases had been brought to his attention of ramblers having been chased by bulls in scottish fields since the implementation of section of the countryside scotland act <e> <s> i would point out that the question related to being chased by bulls it did not specify dairy or beef bulls <e> <s> and it referred to fields not footpaths <e> <s> the answer which the honourable member for edinburgh pentlands the minister for home affairs and the environment scottish office gave was one word none <e>", "<cs> my lords basically i cannot support this amendment on the grounds of the compensation <e> <s> i think that the amendment is technically inadequate because it does not specify what the compensation is for how it will be assessed who it is going to and what rights those people have <e> <s> that is a fundamental part of compensation law and i have experienced cases where the clarification as to what the compensation is to be assessed on has been vague and that has led to all sorts of problems from the district valuer right through to the agent acting on behalf of the owner-occupier <e> <s> the amendment could lead to serious areas of difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i was waiting to hear what the government had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might just say a quick word <e> <s> if the noble lord lord houghton would withdraw his amendment i would withdraw mine and perhaps we might be able to put our heads together before third reading and bring forward a new amendment <e> <s> i did not have the opportunity of getting a letter from the government alas <e> <s> and perhaps i might just ask the next time when i have an amendment to be considered could they send me a copy too please <e> <s> then perhaps we could come forward with a joint amendment having considered what the government said <e> <s> i think there was something in what they said but having heard it for the first time i would not want to support the noble lords amendment and i would not want to push my own <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what my noble friend has said on behalf of the government and the support from the noble lord lord melchett i almost called him my noble friend i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may clear up one point with the government if i were to go and plant the south american beech the nothofagus which is probably the most enlightened thing that some foresters are doing in view of the beech plant disease at the moment am i guilty under the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one small point here in connection with subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord melchett is slightly exaggerating the case and perhaps the word slightly should be withdrawn <e> <s> regarding the remarks of my noble friend lord ferrers through the natural laws of compensation and if the matter is taken to the lands tribunal in assessing compensation that should be paid if any the lands tribunal will take into account whether the compensation is fair and just and what compensation has already been received by the farmer <e> <s> those are the two points that defeat his argument <e> <s> in taking those into account the lands tribunal might decide that the farmer is still entitled to receive compensation for loss of value <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with a great deal of what the noble lord lord melchett has said <e> <s> i had the honour of serving under lord sandford on his committee on rural integration and we spent a lot of time considering the matter and there was a debate on it in this house <e> <s> i am in sympathy with what my noble friend is putting forward but i do not think it can be done in four paragraphs <e> <s> it must take with it the full support of the farming community which is not there at the moment <e> <s> it has to have more thought than we are giving it at this hour <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend does not press the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful for his raising the matter but perhaps we are taking it at the wrong stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we are back on one of my hobby-horses which is compensation <e> <s> ever since the case before the lands tribunal which was in i believe of <e>", "<cs> my lords this is complicated and i should be grateful if the house would give leave to my noble friend to answer this question if a definitive map was made say in and for some reason it was wrongly mapped and had been used since until the present date which is about years and one can now bring conclusive evidence that it was wrongly mapped has the owner or occupier a right to appeal against the wrong mapping <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the complications that we still seem to be in on this matter i do not think it has been resolved satisfactorily <e> <s> i think that the best thing would be for me to withdraw this amendment and perhaps we could liaise with my noble friend before third reading in order to resolve this matter <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before i sum up i wonder whether my noble friend could answer the point raised by my noble friend lord onslow <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has persuaded me but only on one point and that is that i will lend support to his proposed advertising campaign <e> <s> he of course slightly misinformed the house about the intention of the amendments <e> <s> these amendments draw the net a little closer as to what species may be shot <e> <s> that is the point that he has not put over to your lordships <e> <s> it reduces the species that may be shot to the pest species <e> <s> under present law you may shoot at many more species and i think it is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise one point on limestone pavements <e> <s> i tried to put down a manuscript amendment but under standing orders was not allowed to do so <e> <s> at the report stage the government promised to include the words a limestone pavement order <e> <s> they have not put down such an amendment <e> <s> perhaps they could just confirm that it is their intention to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords to that i say yes but before i do so may i mention a point raised by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> a point i did not mention today but which i did mention at report stage was that some farmers have waited for well over years for a definitive map review without putting forward their case <e> <s> now i think you will find that they will put forward their case <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with my noble friend lord stanley that it was wrong drafting <e> <s> i think it was wrong printing <e> <s> it was drafted correctly <e> <s> the list of amendments that i picked up on friday showed that the amendment was put down in the form that we intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord avon and all his colleagues for the time that they have spent in dealing with very difficult and complicated points <e> <s> i feel that the bill would have been a better one and a different one had more finance been available <e> <s> the bill has shown up the deficiencies of some farmers and of the ncc but let us hope that they will work much more closely together from now on <e> <s> i know that every effort will be made by the famers who are aware of their responsibilities <e> <s> i know too that the national farmers union will make every endeavour to get across to the farmers the points about the care that they must take with the countryside and i have no doubt that the ncc will reciprocate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to the noble lord lord northfield for raising this very important matter this evening <e> <s> it is right that i should declare an interest as a director of a <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> investment in small unit workshops was in most cases and until the change in the industrial buildings allowances regulations in march an unacceptable form of investment <e> <s> the rate of return was no match for most other forms of investment <e> <s> much of that has now changed but any small unit proposition must be considered on its merits as a property transaction <e> <s> for insurance companies it has to stand very stringent analysis to show the right yield and growth potential to satisfy the actuaries for individuals partnerships and companies which can receive the benefit of industrial buildings allowances and depend on this to make any scheme viable so much depends on being able to let the units on completion <e>", "<cs> i am still slightly concerned about this point and i rise to support my noble friend lord lucas <e> <s> recently one has encountered a number of occasions when the local planning authority has imposed working hour restrictions on industrial sites <e> <s> that is a growing trend that is causing concern to industrialists <e> <s> therefore one can only expect local authorities without perhaps meaning to do so to abuse the law and the good intentions of my noble friend the minister by putting working hour restrictions on licences <e> <s> that could be very detrimental particularly in agricultural cases where working hours are crucial in order to get fresh produce to markets on time <e> <s> if one finds oneself in a situation where ones licence has not been renewed or is renewed subject to working hours conditions it will be an expensive and lengthy process to combat the local authority to prove them wrong <e> <s> what remedy does the individual have in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are to be commended for bringing forward this bill and i should also like to thank my noble friend lord avon for the way in which he explained the bill to the house <e> <s> we are all concerned about inner city dereliction and the loss of agricultural land for development <e> <s> if this bill helps to remedy the present situation it must be welcomed but the tragedy is that although well-intentioned it fails to solve the problems of derelict land in private ownership <e> <s> it is on this point that i wish to concentrate <e> <s> i am sorry if my speech sounds rather like a committee stage speech it is not meant to do so <e> <s> however i have to take issue with the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> the noble baroness read a quotation from <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for his limited support <e> <s>

close definition of independence <e>", "<cs> i would like in particular to pick up a point made by my noble friend the minister on second reading and again this afternoon on the limitations of the work that the approved inspector can undertake <e> <s> on second reading on th april he said <e>", "<cs> i was concerned by some of the remarks made by my noble friend <e> <s> i think that he said at one stage that there were instances when some plans would not be needed <e> <s> that rather worried me because the whole point that we were trying to make earlier was that we wanted plans with the initial notice we wanted plans all the way through because the approved inspector cannot do his job without the plans <e> <s> i should like to discuss with my noble friend instances where he can operate without plans <e> <s> i would think that they are few and far between <e> <s> i cannot think of one at the moment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that <e> <s> i should very much like to discuss it with my noble friend and with the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but reserve my right to bring it back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i will read very carefully what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i was only trying to be helpful to the local authority where building works had not been completed or received a final certificate <e> <s> i therefore

amendment no <e> <s> which i withdrew <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment so that we can discuss our thoughts on this before coming back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> similar representations have been made to me as they have to the noble viscount <e> <s> certain professions are very concerned that the secretary of state is delegating his powers and the advice of the professional bodies which is sought at the moment by the secretary of state will not be sought by the body which takes over the secretary of states duties <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend can reassure me that the secretary of state at the end of the day has overall control <e> <s> if he does not i think it is important that we should discuss this very thoroughly before a later stage of these proceedings <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for bringing forward his own amendment <e> <s> i am advised that it is probably in a better

charge i understand that it would put the occupier in an invidious position <e> <s> i look forward very much to hearing the thoughts of my noble and learned friend on our amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support my noble friend on this amendment i think it is important to clarify at this stage the situation with regard to an occupier making a charge <e> <s> if for example he was to make a charge of p to maintain a fence round a pond in which he has stocked some fish so that the local angling club can utilise it he appears to come under the unfair contract terms act rather than

land because it is not clear whether it is your business or not and whether it can be assessed as your business or not <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i turn to two particular points one of them raised by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley who said as usual that there is no open market <e> <s> i believe that there is an open market <e> <s> it might be restricted but whatever one values or sells one goes to the open market <e> <s> if one were to value your lordships house one would start off with the open market and then take into account all the other relevant factors <e> <s> then one would come back to the open market <e> <s> that is the way one values <e> <s> if there is a restricted market do not let us forget that it was the nfu in who further restricted the market by asking us to support succession of tenancies which some of us did not do <e> <s> if the tenants wish to be further mollycoddled let them be so at their own risk because they will lose the goodwill of the landlords <e>", "<cs> yes that rents had increased faster than net farm income but at the same time net farm income had reduced <e>", "<cs> so that the gap had widened <e> <s> the noble lord may recall as i am sure he will that in rent as a proportion of net farm income was about per cent <e> <s> but in it was about per cent <e> <s> we did not hear much from the tenants during those years <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> i know that i will irritate the nfu and the cla by doing so but that is too bad <e> <s> the more i have considered this part of the bill the more ludicrous it becomes because it is impossible to legislate for all the circumstances and factors which an arbitrator must take into account <e> <s> i just do not think it is possible <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend help me <e> <s> what if we discover something in five years time that we all consider is vitally important and we have not listed it here <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of subsection <e> <s> i have an amendment down for discussion later which deals with a surplus of farms to let <e> <s> that possibility is not listed here but if this bill works wonders and with a lot of help from the chancellor landlords are encouraged to let land there might be a surplus <e> <s> however that is not in the bill <e> <s> i know that it is covered under the heading all relevant factors and that will probably be the argument used against me but so is everything else that an arbitrator has to take into account <e> <s> it is all relevant <e> <s> i do not believe he should be restricted in the main to what is here when there could be future matters that would concern us <e>", "<cs> if there is latent value of the enterprise of the tenant there is a latent value to the landlord <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> why not <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord belstead for his reply but he seemed to devote his reply to the agricultural aspect <e> <s> i should be grateful if he could comment on my thoughts for expanding the rent to a broader basis and taking into account the earning capacity of the holding <e>", "<cs> i do not want to split hairs on this <e> <s> the point that i am trying to make is that i want the broader base <e> <s> if we go back to the act i am advised at the moment that the productive capacity of the holding is an agricultural definition rather than anything else <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend lord kinnoull since i believe that as it now stands the wording of the clause would lead to an increase in disputes between the landlord and tenant <e> <s> i believe that the wording of this part of the clause and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of my noble friends lord ridley and lord sandford <e> <s> i am making rather better progress than i made with amendment no <e> <s> which was very similar we are <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of many noble lords but i must admit that i am disappointed by my noble friend <e> <s> i really thought that we might get a better response on this amendment <e> <s> i think he is telling me fine let us have an open market rent until we get scarcity so if there is a surplus of farms we will be on open market rent and the rent will go down <e> <s> if there is a scarcity of farms had luck landlord you have problems <e> <s> i do not think that that is fair <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this debate but i do not think that that actually covers the point i am making <e> <s> however i think we should press on <e> <s> i should like to take up my noble friends kind invitation to discuss this with him and i shall certainly do so <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord kinnoull has dealt with the problem of bare land <e> <s> i would inform the committee of an instance in the cotswolds where i let <e>", "<cs> when i moved the amendment i said that i did not know what the right formula was <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord walston might come up with a solution for me <e> <s> i am sad that he did not <e> <s> the point that i am trying to get across is that we have created a vacuum in which the arbitrator cannot make a decision <e> <s> he has not been told how to calculate the rent <e> <s> he is told the relevant factors but the basis which at the moment is open market is excluded <e> <s> having got a vacuum all i was trying to prove was the point that you put him in that situation there may not be comparables because the rented sector has so diminished <e> <s> how is the arbitrator to assess the rent <e> <s> what is the fair compromise <e> <s> i had hoped that noble lords would have come up with some ideas to try to solve the problem <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend my noble kinsman lord swinton how would he apportion the rent <e> <s> let us put my noble friend in the position where there are no comparables because there is a limited tenanted market <e> <s> how is one to assess it given no base line <e>", "<cs> as many arbitrators have said to me if the bill goes through unamended it will make the arbitrators job extremely difficult and much harder <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends on the front bench will take this point into account when reconsidering the whole of clause <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the amendment does not do the job that it was intended to do <e> <s> i certainly shall withdraw it but this provision is very difficult for a layman to understand <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend and near kinsman <e> <s> i have made a lot of progress recently <e> <s> i shall certainly withdraw the amendment and i look forward to hearing what my noble friend has to say at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps this is an opportune moment to refocus on agriculture and to pick up one point made by the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> he referred to the number of tenancies as a result of his beloved act <e> <s> he produced a graph that a firm of land agents had given to him which showed that the trend of loss of agricultural land to tenancies was on a continual decline <e> <s> there is a fallacy in his argument because if his act was to be a success the graph should have gone up not down <e> <s> to take the graph to its logical conclusion one reaches the stage where there are only two tenancies left in the country <e> <s> if we then lose one the noble lord will say that that is marvellous because we have lost only one tenancy <e> <s> in fact we would have lost per cent <e> <s> the crucial point is that since the percentage loss of tenanted land in this country has increased dramatically over the previous years <e>", "<cs> if this amendment is carried i shall not be able to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it might therefore be for the convenience of the committee if i mention a few points relating to it now <e> <s> the basis of that amendment is very much in support of the amendment that we are discussing at the moment <e> <s> however mine is slightly more moderate in that all the tenancies created between and the passing of this act should have security <e> <s> my argument for saying this is that up to the tenancies although they were annual agricultural tenancies were effective for the life of that tenant <e> <s> that is a contract that two parties entered into in good faith <e>", "<cs> having listened very carefully to the noble lords speech would he agree that the argument he used to support the tenants case can be used with exactly the same words to support the landlords case for tenancies pre- <e>", "<cs> the point is that landlords entered into an agreement in the belief that the tenancy could be reconsidered at the end of that tenants life <e> <s> the arguments which the noble lord put forward for maintaining the act can be put forward in exactly the same way for maintaining the landlords position pre- <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the reply from my noble friend <e> <s> i have no wish to press the amendment <e> <s> in cases where succession has already taken place my amendment would have no effect because that would be the current tenant and that would be the end of the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while we are discussing the problem of retirement may i refer to a point which i made in my second reading speech namely the tenant who wants to retire but who has no successors and the landlord who agrees that the tenant can retire and who wants to relet the holding <e> <s> a problem arises where the tenant cannot afford to retire <e> <s> at second reading i raised the point that the tenant should be allowed to assign his tenancy for a capital sum as is allowed in the commercial world <e> <s> i have been unable to put down an amendment for this stage <e> <s> i apologise for the fact that i got totally bogged down with the drafting <e> <s> as so many amendments relating to retirement were put down i thought that i would wait for this discussion and come forward with an amendment at the report stage <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will take this matter into consideration when thinking about the problem of retirement <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment too <e> <s> it follows logically from amendment no <e> <s> which we discussed on the first day of the committee stage which was an amendment moved by the noble lord lord gibson and myself <e> <s> everything has been said and therefore there is nothing more for me to say but i hope that my noble friend would give it a warm reception <e>", "<cs> if that concerns the noble lord i am very surprised that he did not support the noble lord lord gibson and myself on amendment no <e> <s> when we specifically asked for these matters to be taken into account in rent reviews <e>", "<cs> i was somewhat disappointed by my noble friends reply because i feel that once again with all due respect he has missed the point <e> <s> the point is that in future more and more tenants will be looking for means of raising income to support their way of life other than just pure farming and the definition of good husbandry and good estate management under the act is a purely agricultural one <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i have confused my noble friend and kinsman <e> <s> the point i was trying to get across was this <e> <s> let us take the example of a new tenant coming into a viable farm <e> <s> i perchance own acres adjoining his farm which i do not want to farm but i might want those acres back in years time <e> <s> that land can be given to the tenant on a tenancy but the tenant in the first place having agreed that i might want it back <e> <s> it is an uncommercial unit in its own right <e> <s> it is not absorbed into his existing holding and therefore does not become a commercial unit <e> <s> it remains uncommercial but it does serve the purpose of providing more land for adjacent tenants to farm <e> <s> this is perhaps something we ought to discuss in more detail between now and the next stage <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose this question that clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> this problem first came up in the working party and the rics was approached on the matter <e> <s> they said at the time

appeal on a point of law to a court <e> <s> i do not think that the lands tribunal is the right vehicle for an appeal of this type <e> <s> as regards an appeal on fact that is very dangerous <e> <s> we have a number of other bodies in the industrial world wanting to appeal on fact and this could lead to all sorts of difficulties for an arbitrator <e> <s> if an appeal was made on fact he might be guilty of misconduct in its technical sense while not <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord divides the committee if that is his intention i would point out that we do not know what the new clause is going to be <e> <s> would it not be more sensible to let my noble friend lord belstead bring back the new clause because that might allay all the fears <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly support the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> i think this institutional bashing by certain members of your lordships committee and of another place is not good for agriculture and we must divorce ourselves from any association to that effect <e>", "<cs> we have had the desired effect of a good debate anyway <e> <s> my noble friend lord middleton said that this would last for three generations <e> <s> it would not because that part of the act would be repealed and therefore it is for the lifetime of that one tenant only <e> <s> i am grateful for the support of my noble friend lord northfield if i may so call him <e> <s> he said that the true commercial wind is blowing through agriculture <e> <s> he is right <e> <s> it is beginning to happen at long last but it is going to take some time before they have to face reality <e> <s> i believe that in years time something along these lines will have to be brought in <e> <s> meanwhile i withdraw the amendment and look forward to re-introducing it in the next bill <e>", "<cs> i certainly will do so <e> <s> the reason for the amendment was that we regularly have these words in agricultural acts and i thought that they were suitable on this occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i am concerned about a landlord being liable for crop damage in my instance of a large number of geese coming in <e> <s> i think that this is something i should like to look at again from a conservation point of view <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that reply from my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that i may have misunderstood the purpose of the paragraph <e> <s> the point that

excluding this from the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord belstead for all the time that he has devoted between committee stage and now in trying to arrive at a formula that he believes would be acceptable to everyone taking into account the manner in which he has been pushed and pulled <e> <s> the proposal is a great deal better than what we had originally

positive discussion on the words appreciable scarcity at the committee stage because my noble friend lord belstead had already agreed to look again at the rent clause <e> <s> at that time the

pressures of conservation recreation and the other uses to which farm buildings can he put i wanted the whole matter to be brought under an agricultural tenancy and thus broaden the scope <e> <s> that

must go down rather than the one in the bill <e> <s> where the rogue farmers have broken the code my research shows that quite plainly it is the local authority by-laws their inadequacy and inconsistency that are to blame for not bringing those farmers to account <e> <s> they ought to be brought to account but they are not <e> <s> the case which my noble friend lord alport mentioned was a classic case where the by-laws were so ineffective that the nfu told the local authority do not take this man to court because your case is so weak <e> <s> what did the local authority do <e> <s> it took the man to court and had costs awarded against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was actually coming on to that point and my noble friends intervention has probably provided a very good introduction to it <e> <s> in regard to the matter of fires i think that i can best reply by referring to an answer given by the honourable member mr mellor in another place on rd november <e> <s> in reply to the honourable member mr tom cox he said as reported at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed as the noble lord has said the area has excellent soil which the rest of the country does not benefit from

clauses and the local authority could ban it as soon as this dreadful bill is passed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues the committee stage before he proposes to re-write the bill would it not be more suitable to bring in a new bill with all the amendments because this bill now seems to be totally out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i would sympathise with my noble friend lord stanley on this amendment <e> <s> in fact it is remarkably similar to one which i moved in committee <e> <s> however i moved it in committee for a very different reason <e> <s> in his opinion earning capacity includes profit <e> <s> i wanted earning capacity included to broaden the base of the rent as <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment affects the paragraph in the bill which gives me most concern and many of us have spent months trying to persuade my noble friend the minister and the national farmers

worries me greatly that the nfu cannot even accept this minor amendment <e> <s> i hope that i am proved wrong in due course but i believe that this paragraph more than any other in the bill will be

friend for moving this amendment <e> <s> it is of great help in clarifying the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord belstead for all the time and trouble that he has taken in listening to and in some cases accepting my amendments <e> <s> we have not agreed on everything and i should like to see some further amendments a matter which i shall pursue <e> <s> however the parts of the bill which i disliked are a great deal better and a great deal more workable than the original parts that were given a second reading in this chamber <e> <s> that is due largely to his efforts and to those of my noble kinsman lord swinton <e> <s> landlords and tenants in fact the whole of agriculture have cause to be grateful to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move

will not be affected under these provisions <e> <s> but the houses will be affected because as has been so eloquently pointed out already under the leasehold enfranchisement act those houses can be

<e> <s> i think he said that in order to obtain a mortgage on a flat the normal unexpired period of the lease must be years <e> <s> if that is so why should somebody who perhaps does not need a mortgage on a flat be prevented from taking a long lease when the head leaseholder still has an unexpired term of years <e> <s> if a person does not require a mortgage why can he not exercise the same rights as a person with a house to get a long lease on a flat <e>", "<cs> i am not terribly pleased with the amendment because i do not think that it goes far enough <e> <s> however i have taken a great deal of note of what my noble friend lord bellwin has said and of the fact that he has found paragraph of schedule expensive to administer and unsatisfactory in other ways <e> <s> it was for that reason that i did not move my amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i should have liked that amendment to have been accepted by the committee <e> <s> however i accept what my noble friend and others

a tenancy and it disposes of that land will it be sold to the tenant or to a third party so that it can remain tenanted <e>", "<cs> i quite like the thoughts behind this amendment but i really did think it was put over in a way which would frighten everybody in any aspect of having a secure tenant <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he has acknowledged the point that the word financing is going to cause problems <e> <s> my noble friend the minister did say he was in sympathy with the proposal <e> <s> i have said i am in sympathy with some of it <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend he is not sympathetic to all of it <e> <s> why does not the noble lord lord evans of claughton withdraw this amendment go to the landlords and say what information can we produce <e> <s> it is not going to be done in four lines it is going to be a schedule relating to various aspects <e> <s> this is surely the wrong way to approach it <e> <s> i do ask him to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i

onslow does not think it is a good thing to build houses i should like to talk to him about that a little later <e> <s> it is a point and the noble lord lord airedale brought it home to the committee <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend on the front bench whether in due course he will write to me on the two points that i have raised with regard to existing law <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> what an interesting debate we have had <e> <s> i should like to take up two points and first the point of the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> i would willingly at a later stage bring forward an amendment to limit the height of stubble if that is of concern to him <e> <s> the stubble has to be below a certain height in order that you can burn it without licence <e> <s> the second point was made by my noble friend the minister on which i think he was wrong <e> <s> he thought that i wanted to exempt stubble burning from the by-laws <e> <s> that is the last thing i want to do <e> <s> i want to make it absolutely certain that even if someone gets a licence he should be subject to the by-laws and subject on a national basis <e>", "<cs> as my name is to this amendment i should like to make one point that is whether it will he quicker to have the licence done by the ministry or by the local authority <e> <s> i think it would be longer with the local authority because one would have to wait for an answer from a committee rather than from a delegated person <e> <s> i do not think the local authority would delegate the power to one person when it came to a question that has aroused so much public interest <e>", "<cs> i hope that we will not get into a long debate about the model by-laws because my noble friend lord alport is going to withdraw his amendment and we can discuss this aspect in detail <e> <s> as i understand it the reason why highways are not covered in the by-laws is that they are already protected by statute they are protected by the highways act and a by-law cannot duplicate what is already in statute <e>", "<cs> this is one amendment which i cannot accept and i hope my noble friends will support me <e> <s> i do not think it is going to cure the problem <e> <s> there are two really important points to take into consideration weather conditions have already been mentioned by my noble friend lord stodart of leaston <e> <s> there are going to be circumstances in which one will need to burn particularly the further north one goes in this country <e> <s> where you have a late harvest and in order to get the ground ready to accept the winter oilseed rape or winter corn the only way to get rid of the straw will be to burn it <e> <s> therefore there is always going to be a need to burn it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord alport that the amendments which some of us suggested originally have been taken on board and i think that the bill has been improved <e> <s> when it comes to licensing i am still against it <e> <s> i do not see the point of it <e> <s> this point has been exemplified in the last days by our spring drought <e> <s> we have had fires all round the country in heather burns without a single farmer setting fire to it <e> <s> in we had a lot of problems with straw fires and over per cent <e> <s> of the fires to which the fire brigades had to be called were started as a result of vandalism or by accident <e> <s> is licensing going to solve that problem <e> <s> i do not believe so <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> in moving this it might be for the convenience of the committee if i state that we shall not be resuming the proceedings on this bill for an hour until nine minutes past eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until nine minutes past eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords a supply of drugs is just one of many matters taken into account by those who are developing plans for civil defence in the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the kind words of the noble lord in the initial part of his supplementary question <e> <s> with regard to the bmas report the government do not accept the view that civil defence planning is pointless or that it can be interpreted as a preparation for war <e> <s> we believe that the country should have the capacity to respond to the threat of war <e> <s> so far as the dhss and the nhs are concerned that means making plans among other things to meet the needs of the casualties of war both nuclear and conventional <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not believe that a nuclear war will happen but i can assure the noble lord that there are adequate supplies of drugs available <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked a number of questions <e> <s> with regard to the restricted shelf-life we are aware of the problems associated with that in respect of certain essential drugs but separate stockpiling may not be necessary <e> <s> it really depends on what you call a stockpile <e> <s> there are a number of supplies of drugs held by manufacturers and hospitals <e> <s> there is also some reserve in the distribution chain which by its very nature is widely dispersed throughout the country and involves hospitals wholesalers retail pharmacists and family doctors who dispense medicines for their patients <e> <s> there are no specific stockpiles in bunkers and warehouses <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first point i do not have an answer <e> <s> i shall of course check it out and let my noble friend have an answer <e> <s> with regard to the second point on civil defence of course her majestys government are fully aware of all the things that could happen under civil defence and the appropriate measures are being taken <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord and i am sure he will also draw this point to the attention of the bma <e>", "<cs> my lords we have come to the end of a very interesting debate on this bill <e> <s> i am grateful to the many noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> before turning to the more detailed points which have been raised on the various aspects of the bill i should like to make some general remarks on the provisions upon which much of the debate has concentrated--namely those contained in clauses and <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord colwyn mentioned the question of dental deputy members for fpcs <e> <s> it is a long established principle adopted in respect of deputies that provision should be made for only one where the profession or other group has a single representative on the fpc <e> <s> to go beyond that would be to open up the possibility of deputies for all parties <e> <s> this would obviously have undesirable results so far as continuity of experience is concerned <e>", "<cs> in the future my lords <e> <s> the noble lords lord banks and lord beaumont of whitley raised the question of the introduction of an earnings rule as a means test for the long-term cda <e> <s> i covered this point a moment ago <e> <s> there is no intention of means testing national insurance benefit <e> <s> there always has been an earnings rule to determine entitlement to the extra benefit for an adult dependant <e> <s> the proposed earnings rules for cdas simply ensure that the extra benefit for a child goes only to those beneficiaries for whom it was intended <e> <s> i am sure we would all agree that that is very laudable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> is the noble lord on amendment or amendment <e> <s> i am not clear <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i say that i am grateful for the welcome that noble lords opposite have given to me <e> <s> indeed i look forward to many discussions with them on scottish matters <e> <s> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will kindly allow me to intervene i am sure he would agree that wages for the average manual worker are now higher in scotland than in england <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lady will give way when winding up at this stage it is not normal to ask further questions <e> <s> i beleive that is the normal procedure of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords following last years review of future dental manpower needs the intake of the united kingdom dental schools is to be reduced by per cent <e> <s> in the autumn and we propose to undertake later this year a further review of future dental manpower needs <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of points have been raised <e> <s> with regard to the future of the dental service we believe that we should move over to prevention rather than the piece-work and repair service <e> <s> that is why we are about to launch our pilot study into capitation and have given priority to dental health education programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not conversant with the exact figures that the noble lord has given but i can assure him that every year i think in the past years the number of people attending dentists has gone up <e> <s> despite some increases in charges under this government the number has gone up steadily year by year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give the noble lord lord kilmarnock an answer on that <e> <s> i will however write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords this government are doing everything they can to make the situation better for patients <e> <s> if more patients would go to dentists that would also help to solve a lot of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall read it <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot be confident about future manpower needs because it is such a highly complex problem as my noble friend will be aware <e> <s> however we consider the per cent <e> <s> reduction in dental school intake to be fine tuning that will improve the position <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we shall keep a check on the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the point about some patients not being able to get nhs treatment i am sure that the position is much better than it was several years ago when many dentists were providing only selective items of treatment under the nhs but i recognise that there are still a few areas where difficulties remain <e> <s> any patient seeking an nhs dentist should ask the local family practitioner committee which will usually be well placed to advise people <e> <s> with regard to my noble friends further supplementary question on the dental strategy review group report of it is still current <e> <s> it is not to be revised <e> <s> we have in fact implemented a large number of the reports major recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords the value of the service provided by the chartered physiotherapists is fully recognised by her majestys government <e> <s> members of this profession play an important part in the treatment and rehabilitation of patients both within the national health service and in private practice <e> <s> within the national health service the employment and use of physiotherapists is a matter for individual health authorities and depends largely on local needs and the resources <e> <s> the work of physiotherapists in private practice is not a matter for which her majestys government have responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords with the encouragement of this government the majority of health authorities throughout the country already provide in various forms a physiotherapy service in the community which can include treatment of patients in their own homes <e> <s> the form and extent of the services provided will depend on local needs and circumstances <e> <s> the government accept that the contribution of the profession to preventive education generally is an important one <e> <s> how this contribution can best be developed is currently under discussion between the health education council and the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i too have benefited from physiotherapy and i think that the physiotherapists are doing a marvellous job <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know specifically about the west midlands <e> <s> as i have said it is a matter that varies from area to area and is kept under constant check <e> <s> but i will draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the points raised by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add to my last answer <e> <s> i will of course make sure that note is taken of these points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware

with the society <e>", "<cs> my lords i would think that at the moment gps can refer direct to a physiotherapist <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i can <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that there are about whole time equivalents in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom recognises the need for urgent action to be taken to reduce the rate of growth of the worlds population for humanitarian reasons to achieve higher standards of living and to improve the quality of life <e>", "<cs> my lords attitudes in developing countries have changed dramatically in the last years and there are now some countries accounting for almost per cent <e> <s> of the population of the third world which have policies aimed at providing family planning services <e>", "<cs> my lords i will pass on to my right honourable friend my noble friends thoughts and comments <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i want to say that in this matter i was not aware there was any complacency on the part of her majestys government <e> <s> we take it very seriously <e> <s> the united kingdom delegation is expected to be led by a minister and it will include officials from the foreign and commonwealth office the overseas development administration and the office of population censuses and surveys <e> <s> the leader of the united kingdom delegation will be making a speech at the plenary session of the conference <e>", "<cs> my lords what expertise and benefit we can bring to the conference with regard to family planning we certainly will bring <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord winstanley tempts me down a very different path <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a <e>", "<cs> my lords an increase in the worlds population from billion now to a forecasted billion in the year will mean that more food is required <e> <s> but taking that a stage further i really do think is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord gisborough will be aware the world population plan of action in stressed the need to promote improved methods of identifying extracting renewing and utilising scarce natural resources and that will again be covered in the mexico conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read my noble friends remark with interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in moving this amendment i propose to touch on some of the other changes of importance that have been made to the bill and then with the permission of the house i shall move amendments nos <e> <s> to en bloc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and the noble lord lord boothby <e> <s> we are very grateful for the support and help that they have given us in trying to make this a better bill <e> <s> it shows that this government do take matters away and read very carefully what is said in this house and it also shows that they are flexible enough to amend the bill for better when the arguments are conclusive <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spoken to the rest of the amendments and with the leave of the house i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive <e>", "<cs> we have had a long debate on this matter and we have covered a lot of the ground in the first amendment as well <e> <s> the government when studying the office of fair trading report gave serious consideration to the merits of allowing self-selected reading glasses <e> <s> i accept the evidence which is quite clear that they cannot ruin adult eyes <e> <s> the noble lord lord northfield reminded me of the happy hours we spent on the agricultural holdings bill <e> <s> we made great strides in liberalisation which this government are doing now <e> <s> we are persuaded of the merits of requiring a sight test before glasses are dispensed <e> <s> this is in line with the thinking and practice of most western countries <e> <s> such sight tests perform a valuable role in ensuring that glaucoma and certain other serious eye and general diseases such as diabetic retinopathy cataracts vascular abnormality macular degeneration i could go on for a long time but i do not wish to bore your lordships are detected <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson raises an interesting point <e> <s> we still have an open mind on the time for which a prescription should be valid <e> <s> some have suggested that this should be as short as one year <e> <s> however our view is that two years would be an appropriate period <e> <s> this view is backed by the views of the faculty of ophthalmologists and the ophthalmic group committee of the bma <e> <s> we are still open to listen to other views and to receive other evidence <e> <s> because views differ and indeed could well change in the light of scientific discoveries i believe that the time should be specified in subordinate <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i too should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i start by saying yet again and i should like to stress it as would my noble friend lord glenarthur that the medical evidence is quite clear that glasses however complicated or powerful cannot damage adult eyes <e> <s> it is also widely acknowledged that the more powerful the prescription the more noticeable symptons of dispensing errors will be <e> <s> there is therefore no reason <e>", "<cs> no we will not bring forward an amendment <e> <s> we will have it in orders <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord ennals would be to require the secretary of state to make orders controlling the advertising of optical appliances other than by registered opticians or doctors <e> <s> we see no need for this sort of bureaucratic arrangement for regulating advertisements or publicity involving glasses by either manufacturers or retailers <e> <s> advertisements for glasses like other things will be subject to the trade descriptions act the law on misrepresentation and the codes of the advertising standards authority and the independent broadcasting authority <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can add much to what i have already said <e> <s> however i omitted to thank the noble lord lord northfield for his welcome of our proposed relaxation of advertising <e> <s> the point that the noble lord raised with regard to this amendment is not covered elsewhere in the bill <e> <s> however any constraints on the optical profession are in effect self-imposed <e> <s> we are having to take legislative powers in order to force the goc to liberalise <e> <s> no doubt they will bear in mind the disadvantage under which this will place them <e> <s> they can revise the rules themselves <e> <s> no doubt they should have done so by now <e> <s> we see no reason why the goc needs so many rules <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord kilmarnock has said much of the ground has been covered on a previous amendment but i shall try to answer some of the more specific points that have been raised <e> <s> it is worth recapping that it is inherent in our approach to clause and to schedule that indiscriminate subsidy of the cost of glasses is unneces-sary <e> <s> any financial subsidy should be directed towards those who need it <e> <s> income is not directly related to optical need <e> <s> there is no logical justification for subsidising all users of powerful glasses <e> <s> noble lords will be able to think of many people who while needing somewhat special glasses are in a position to afford the cost themselves <e> <s> where financial need exists it should be recognised and we will help in those circumstances <e> <s> financial subsidies should meet financial needs <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that it is the doctor <e>", "<cs> the hospital doctor <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock raised the question of means-testing <e> <s> frankly i believe that means-testing is essentially right because it enables us to focus resources where they are most required <e> <s> the noble lord also referred to a comment made by my noble friend the minister for health <e> <s> i can help him in his search for the answer he can find it in <e>", "<cs> of course i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> it is right and proper that i should do so and i undertake to do so <e> <s> i can assure him that the government are equally concerned <e> <s> i believe that we have it right at the moment but we are very concerned that those who are on low incomes should not unnecessarily suffer <e> <s> that is why we are in a position to give financial aid to those who really need it <e>", "<cs> i thought that i covered the point about out-patients <e> <s> if the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> it will not be available <e> <s> i do not want to repeat what my noble friend lord glenarthur said on the previous amendment about our remaining thoughts <e> <s> in view of what i have said i hope that the noble lord lord kilmarnock will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> of course i do not take it amiss <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will with his usual diligence study my reply <e>", "<cs> it was clause <e>", "<cs> i do not think the government will come forward with an amendment <e> <s> we shall certainly read very carefully what the noble lord has said but we think that we have it right <e>", "<cs> may i speak to both of these amendments <e> <s> the first amendment would alter the constitution of the companies committee of the goc to give corporate bodies majority representation <e> <s> the second amendment no <e> <s> would change the constitution of the general optical council to include a representative of the federation of optical corporation bodies thus altering the goc constitution <e> <s> i do not believe that it is appropriate for parliament to amend the constitution of the goc in this bill <e> <s> the schedule to the opticians act allows the privy council by order and after consultation with the goc itself and other bodies or persons to alter the membership and qualifications of members of the goc to reflect changes in circumstances <e> <s> such orders are made in the form of statutory instruments and can be annulled by resolution of either house of parliament <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disappoint the noble lord lord ennals but this is not something we would wish to see because it is our guiding principle that we should have the best man or woman for the job <e> <s> however i can assure him that we shall look for a measure of lay and professional balance in chairmanship throughout the country as a whole and in the first round of appointments to the need for a degree of continuity of experience <e> <s> i hope that the <e>", "<cs> is this for existing or future chairmen <e>", "<cs> i think that we all have much sympathy with the view of the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord ennals and indeed the noble lord lord kilmarnock and my noble friend lady cox on the spirit of the amendment and that those involved in <e>", "<cs> it is certainly our intention to ensure that where any fpc has within its locality more than four districts all will be represented on the committee <e> <s> this arises only in five cases and it is our intention that these should be dealt with by enlarging the membership of the fpc under paragraph of this schedule rather than by using one of the secretary of states seven appointments <e> <s> in doing so we will of course maintain the balance on the committee between the contractors and non-contractors <e> <s> i hope that this covers the worry that the noble lord lord kilmarnock has and that he will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we accept that community nurses should play a part in administrating the family practitioner services and that this should be underpinned by the appointment of such a nurse to each fpc <e> <s> this has always been our intention but it is <e>", "<cs> the present arrangements ensure representation of the independent contractors to the committees who provide the family practitioner services <e> <s> these we have carried forward into the new legislation <e> <s> home nurses and health visitors are employed by the dhas as are other health care professionals such as physiotherapists occupational therapists and speech therapists <e> <s> we hope that they will all be represented on fpcs but we do not intend to write them into the bill <e>", "<cs> for exactly the reasons that i have given <e> <s> under those circumstances i hope that the noble lord lord kilmarnock will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i may perhaps intervene at this stage <e> <s> without any commitment let me say that i shall of course take the matter away and have a look at it <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment seeks to break the long-established principle which has been adopted in respect of deputies that is that where there is a single representative for a profession there should be provision for a deputy <e> <s> it would be unrealistic to expect that such a member would be able to attend every meeting and thus in his absence his group would be unrepresented <e> <s> this does not apply to dentists and pharmacists who have three and two members respectively <e> <s> we consider that to extend the appointment of deputies to groups on the committee with more than one member would have undesirable results so far as continuity of experience is concerned <e> <s> if these amendments were carried it would open up the possibility of requests for deputy members for the health and local authorities who have four members each and even for the doctors who have eight members <e> <s> this could result in eight deputies eligible to attend meetings or over a quarter of the entire membership <e> <s> we do not think that it would be desirable to create such a floating body of members with the threat it would present to consistent policy-making from one meeting to the next <e>", "<cs> i briefly add to the words of my noble friend that the penalty in scotland under the common law for abduction by a third party other than parents is of course far greater than in england because the high court can go up to life imprisonment <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to confer upon community health councils the right to enter and inspect premises controlled by the fpcs <e> <s> however the only premises controlled by the fpcs are those which they and their staff occupy <e> <s> the premises from which the independent contractors operate which

<e> <s> that would mean a growing burden on the economy that could only be met through higher contributions and higher taxes <e> <s> each per cent <e> <s> increase in pensions and other long-term benefits costs about million in public expenditure <e> <s> over time therefore the extra costs that would result from this amendment would be very substantial indeed <e> <s> in the governments view it

provision of posts in relation to population neither northern nor yorkshire regions are significantly different from the national average <e> <s> it is possible but it is by no means certain that a more even distribution in training posts would improve the recruitment position in these two areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals knows better than i do how sympathetic the department

i have investigated that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords if it would help i am sure it would be welcomed but i do not think that specifically on its own it would be of particular benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord northfield was a little unfair and incorrect in what he said when he opened his remarks <e> <s> we have taken very seriously the suggestion of my noble friend lord orr-ewing <e> <s> we have considered carefully everything that has been said in another place and in this house with regard to this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord glenarthur and i

confirm to the noble lord as he has already pointed out that the government are concerned about this and we are making very serious efforts to get this particular point right <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to give statutory effect to what was always the clear intention that on every fpc there should be a nurse a health visitor midwife or district nurse with recent experience of providing services in the community <e> <s> the government have always acknowledged the need for a nurse member of the fpc <e> <s> when my noble friend lady cox together with the noble lord lord kilmarnock and the noble baroness lady robson raised this at committee stage we did agree to look at this question again <e> <s> although we still believe that administrative action would be sufficient to ensure that there will always be a nurse member on the fpc we now think it right to accept this amendment in order to put the matter clearly beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an area on which we have already had quite a lengthy discussion in committee and it was raised at the meeting with the noble lord lord stallard and other noble lords on nd july <e> <s> i will not therefore detain the house by repeating in detail all of the arguments for the age rule <e> <s> i think it is sufficient to say that our first priority in seeking a replacement for ncip and hncip was to preserve entitlement to benefit based simply on a test of incapacity for work for those disabled at birth or in childhood who because of their disability have never had the chance to work and build up a contribution record <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not what my noble friend thought <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard mentioned the question of monitoring <e> <s> we have discussed this before <e> <s> we will monitor continuously and reports will be received on a regular basis <e> <s> as the noble lord is well aware one of the best places for monitoring is this house and he can put down a question on progress at any time <e> <s> as i have said we will monitor continuously and if we see something not working to our satisfaction we will take immediate steps to rectify it <e> <s> finally as i have made clear on a number of occasions we shall be prepared to reexamine the rules if our monitoring shows that this is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may just correct that <e> <s> in essence that is what i said <e> <s> what i was saying was in relation to the disincentive effect of age was that there will be a disincentive wherever we put the age limit and the only way one can get round that problem is not to have an age limit <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that the right solution is to leave the age of and let us see how the monitoring works <e> <s> if it does require a fundamental change thereafter we can reconsider it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think at this point it is worth stating that the invalid care allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords i know it is it is exactly the point <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes has generated considerable sympathy for the principle of what she proposed in introducing the new clause <e> <s> however there are a number of factors which prevent me from giving her the answer she would like to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords the problems of loss of social life would be true in regard to some married women too i have no doubt but i hope that noble lords will acknowledge that the position of married women in general is much more variable and less clear-cut <e> <s> despite social changes there is still a large number who would not in fact have been earning especially where there are young children <e> <s> in other cases even where the wife has some earnings the husband will also be providing for her to some extent out of his earnings and where he is sick or unemployed including of course those cases where it is the husband who is the disabled person to be cared for he will normally be receiving a social security benefit and probably a dependency increase for his wife <e> <s> that group of people would therefore gain little or nothing from this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment like the one discussed in committee would restore the link with prices or earnings and would mean that over time pensions and other benefits would rise faster than both prices and earnings <e> <s> this is what the noble lord <e> <s> lord banks referred to as the ratchet effect <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of

totally irrelevant to the question on the order paper <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords first two supplementaries the responsibility for the issuing of building warrants rests with local authorities <e> <s> there has been a relaxation by the secretary of state of certain regulations separating the area between bathrooms and living accommodation <e> <s> as far as i am aware at the moment no other regulations have been breached <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the main point of the noble lords supplementary question concerned a relaxation of building standards <e> <s> as far as i am aware my right honourable friend the secretary of state did not relax the building regulations he relaxed the space regulations which are totally different <e> <s> as the noble lord might be aware and i am sure he is there are no space regulations in england and wales <e> <s> it is an historical event in scotland <e> <s> to deprive the scottish public of a wide choice of flats such as solo flats

about the university hospital of wales which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are still a number of misconceptions in the minds of the two noble lords who have responded to the statement for the opposition parties <e> <s> i should like to deal first with these two matters <e> <s> the first is the question of the writ being out of time <e> <s> the writ was not out of time <e> <s> at the time the writ for negligence was issued the law was that it had to be done within six years of the date the damage was notified <e> <s> the writ was put in by counsel within that six-year period <e> <s> in regard to the other writ that is the one which can be issued <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock is much more experienced in the question of rateable values lands and heritages than i am and it would be foolish of me to cross swords with him at this particular time on such matters <e> <s> when it comes to the tone of the list my understanding is that the tone means the general average level of values in cash terms <e> <s> it is not about the balance of the list <e> <s> as to what the future holds for residential property <e>", "<cs> my lords internationally we are in regular contact with the centers for disease control in the united states and the world health organisation aids reference centre in paris which collates aids data from european countries <e> <s> in december the european parliament called for an emergency programme of research into aids as part of the communitys health and research programme <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally agree with my noble kinswoman on that point and in fact the government have produced interim guidelines which were drawn up by the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens on the safe handling of aids patients <e> <s> we are strengthening our efforts to dissuade all those in aids high risk groups from donating blood and through the health education council we are promoting greater awareness of the risks of the disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that on this occasion it was a long answer rather longer than we would have wished but this is the first question in this house on aids <e> <s> it is a very important subject and there is a lot of misinformation to correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the remark that our efforts in this connection have been derisory <e> <s> we have gone into this in some detail <e> <s> we are learning by the week about this very nasty disease and therefore we had to consolidate all the information we had before we could issue appropriate guidelines <e> <s> with regard to making this a notifiable disease there are pros and cons <e> <s> if it were notifiable it would be the only notifiable sexually-transmitted disease and we do not wish to put those people who have aids into the category of being lepers <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not intend to starve the medical research council of funds in fact we are giving it more funds on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am aware of the article to which the noble earl is referring <e> <s> we believe it to be the same virus that the french and the americans have discovered but they have given it different

patient who nurses know about <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right on saying that they are extra funds and we shall continue to give extra funds wherever there is a special project on this which is worth it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i was merely trying to explain the possible disadvantages of notifying it <e> <s> the government are actively considering this at the moment but a decision has not been made <e> <s> i am sorry if i misled the house <e>", "<cs> my lords on that last point all the countries involved with aids have now made it

defend themselves against any attack from the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> we have considered carefully the responses to our consultation paper with regard to the limited list from all doctors

lords with the leave of the house i should like to try to sum up some of the points that have been made in this interesting debate which by and large i have enjoyed <e> <s> what i have not enjoyed listening to is the very blatant partisan approach by some noble lords opposite which does no good to the national health service and only goes to lower morale <e> <s> i say straight away that i shall

ancient monuments and historic buildings formerly undertaken by the department of the environment <e> <s> consideration was given at the time to the establishment of a similar commission in scotland

<s> our information is that million people in japan receive naturally fluoridated water <e> <s> he referred to chile which had stopped fluoridating <e> <s> it is often alleged that fluoridation in chile ceased as a result of prof schatzs work <e> <s> this is not the case <e> <s> the latest information we have is that million people in chile receive artificially fluoridated water <e>", "<cs> my lords we have set up an independent working party under the chairmanship of professor ian mccoll to review the services provided through artificial limb and appliance centres in england <e> <s> we expect that its report will indicate any advantage there might be from the wider provision of artificial limbs and components made overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the point concerning sockets which relieve pain <e> <s> british sockets relieve pain equally as well as german sockets <e> <s> yes i think that competition is healthy <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble baronesss first point yes some sockets can be ill-fitting but this is probably due to wrong alignment and wrong fitting in the first place <e> <s> we are taking steps to correct this in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that the committee can consider a number of matters including the wider provision of artificial limbs and components made overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that we should provide the best fitting service and that is why arrangements are in hand to establish a prosthetic training school at roehampton <e> <s> it is due to open in may of this year <e> <s> as to the importation of artificial limbs a company operating from a member state of the european community should meet no obstacles to selling its products in this country which british manufacturers do not experience <e>", "<cs> my lords it is to be hoped that that will be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i will pass on the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not accept the suggestion that hospital patients lives have been or will be put at risk because of lack of funds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch has done it again <e> <s> he asks me a very general first question about an industry that has been financed by this government to a record sum of / billion employing something like a million whole-time staff <e> <s> he then asks me a very detailed question about intensive care cot units <e> <s> perhaps i may provide a written answer to him and i will put a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> i would also confirm that the increase that we have given to the national health service is per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree entirely with the noble lords last statement <e> <s> we discussed this matter fully on th february as he will recall <e> <s> the governments position was put clearly before the house <e> <s> as to closures the noble lord knows a lot about closures <e> <s> he closed hospitals in the five years that he was in charge of the health service <e> <s> with <e>", "<cs> my lords the waiting list is some fewer than it was in september and some fewer than it was at the peak of when the noble lord was in office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> we had a very good debate as i have said on th february <e> <s> we would welcome another <e> <s> our record is extremely good and is better than that of any other government <e>", "<cs> my lords on that detailed point i have said that i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> we are putting the care of the patient first <e> <s> that is why we are spending record sums and increasing manpower <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i can confirm that the department is in regular touch with a whole range of organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i did not know that specifically <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord gray of contin i beg to move that the draft docks and harbours rateable values scotland order which was laid before this house on th march this year be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill so ably introduced by my noble friend lord colwyn and to express the governments support for it <e> <s> before i do so i should like to thank the noble lord lord ennals for his kind remarks about my noble friend lady cox <e> <s> personally i am pleased that the ratio of smoke in the chief whips office will be reduced <e> <s> however i would also point out that on his side of the house there is a certain whip in the opposition whips office who also complains about the smoke <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor has support from a noble friend of mine sitting not very far away <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe so <e> <s> we want the widest possible consultation that we can get in order to get the directions right <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has moved his amendment <e>", "<cs> the answer that i was about to give has already been given by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> also i do not think that my noble friend lord kinnoull actually made any argument for wanting to get rid of fluoride <e> <s> he did not say anything about that <e> <s> he said that he wanted to get rid of fluoride but for no particular reason <e> <s> he has not made a case for it <e> <s> i would rest my case there <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will withdraw his amendment and if he wants to come back with a more salient amendment later we could consider it then <e>", "<cs> first i must apologise to my noble friend lord kinnoull <e> <s> if he thought that i was being discourteous i did not mean to be <e> <s> it was merely that as in my view a major hole had been drilled in his amendment it seemed better to ask him to withdraw it and come back <e> <s> i apologise if i was discourteous <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady gardner of parkes is absolutely right <e> <s> on second reading the noble lord lord energlyn referred to the west midlands in connection with heart disease <e> <s> i did not specifically take him up on that as it was fairly early in the morning but i would certainly enter into an argument with him about any of the west midlands statistics because no one can conclusively prove that fluoride was the cause of those statistics <e>", "<cs> i do appreciate that <e> <s> we too are concerned that the level of fluoride should not be exceeded <e> <s> i go back to my original answer <e> <s> the upper limit is ppm <e> <s> perhaps when we reach later amendments in the committee stage which deal with the monitoring and how we are going to supervise that would be the time to deal more fully with the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> i believe that i am correct in thinking that in debating amendment no <e> <s> we are speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and i am grateful for confirmation from my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i thoroughly appreciate the concern behind the amendments and the concern expressed by the noble lord lord monson my noble friend lord sandys and the noble lord lord energlyn for anybody handling any sort of chemical from garden sprays right through the whole ambit to the handling of chemicals in major industrial plants <e> <s> for this reason the government have taken a variety of actions and indeed the safety of those engaged in fluoridation schemes is already fully taken into account <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the reasoning of my noble friend lord sandys in moving this amendment <e> <s> i have to tell him that when a water supply if fluoridated the fluoride concentrations are already continuously recorded by an automatic monitor in most cases <e> <s> in a few schemes there is regular monitoring but it is carried out manually <e> <s> the fluoride dosing is stopped automatically if it reaches mg per litre and sometimes the cut-off point is set at less than mg/litre <e>", "<cs> a great deal of what i said in reply to the previous amendment moved by my noble <e>", "<cs> the government will reflect on all the arguments that have been put forward tonight and i know indeed that tomorrow morning my noble friend and i will be perusing <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment my noble friend lord kinnoull related it to fluoride again but i wonder what the effect would he if consumers were entitled to demand and water undertakers were required to supply information of this nature for the other or so chemicals which water authorities can add to their water supplies <e> <s> even if only fluoride were singled out for this treatment and not hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid aluminium sulphate or chlorine i can envisage the offices of water authorities expanding to contain the staff who would be needed to provide the information <e>", "<cs> i understand that bottled water does not contain a fully detailed breakdown of its constituents and you can buy it in a supermarket with nothing at all on it <e> <s> indeed the noble viscount lord monckton of brenchley who alas <e> <s> is not here said on second reading that he preferred bottled water <e> <s> in many cases such as in vichy water the fluoride level is considerably higher than any artificially fluoridated water supply in this country <e>", "<cs> not the same undertaking that i gave about the earlier one <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say how grateful i am to my noble friend lord campbell of <e>", "<cs> no his judgment was that it was <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i accept the thought behind this amendment which is that no new public health measure should be introduced without adequate monitoring for the initial period <e> <s> there seems to be a total misunderstanding of the present situation and this was revealed by the comments of my noble friend lord moyne and of the noble lords lord energlyn lord monson and lord prys-davies <e> <s> i would remind the committee that fluoridation has been carried out in this country for nearly years and that precisely the kind of monitoring suggested in the amendment other than with regard to plants and aquatic life a subject to which i shall return has already been carried out and the results published <e> <s> i can refer very briefly to the knox report which i can recommend to my noble friend lord moyne for being very good heavy reading full of scientific information and having an extremely knowledgeable list of contributors <e>", "<cs> we believe that there is no firm evidence that fluoride corrodes water pipes and fittings at a concentration of one part per million <e> <s> in hard alkaline waters the addition of fluorosilicic acid to give mg per litre of fluoride will have no effect on either the ph or the alkalinity <e> <s> even in very soft low alkaline waters with low ph the effects of the acid if any on the ph will be only marginal <e> <s> very soft waters are more corrosive than hard waters and it is common practice in this country to correct the ph in such waters to reduce their corrosive effects <e> <s> the largest and longest-lasting fluoridation scheme in the country is in birmingham which receives very soft water from the elan valley <e> <s> there is no evidence of any greater corrosion in birmingham since the introduction of fluoridation some years ago <e>", "<cs> i went into the health aspects of fluoride when discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think it would be wrong to go through them all again <e> <s> however with due respect to my noble friend lord sandys i think to repeat the same argument now would not be in accordance with the tradition of this chamber <e> <s> i must make it clear that we are certainly prepared to inform health authorities of major studies on the safety of fluoridation <e> <s> hence my department recently issued to all health authorities a copy of the report of the knox working party on the alleged link between fluoridation and cancer <e> <s> thus all our health <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to go a little further into that <e> <s> the noble lady lady saltoun is extremely well liked in this house and highly thought of <e> <s> i believe there is even a fluoridation society <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i do not allege that there is no risk as the noble lord said <e> <s> it is independent and government scientists who have proved that there is no link <e>", "<cs> there have been tests on animals <e> <s> nature has assisted because there is fluoride in everything that they eat and in the water that they drink <e>", "<cs> returning to the amendment i think that the best thing i can do is to confirm what my noble friend lady gardner of parkes said <e> <s> i can assure the committee that adequate powers are already available to halt fluoridation should it ever be considered harmful <e> <s> i think that that answers the point of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> we support this amendment but the power already exists in common law for a person to sue for damages against either a statutory water undertaker or a health authority <e> <s> therefore this amendment is redundant and it is not necessary to put it in the bill <e>", "<cs> the government do promote this as did the noble lords government when they were in office <e> <s> they promote it by indemnifying water authorities against actions over alleged damage to health <e> <s> neither in the clause nor in common law is there an automatic right to compensation <e> <s> the claimant will have to prove the damage <e> <s> that is standard practice <e> <s> i remind the committee that no one has ever sued a health authority or water undertaker for damages arising from water fluoridation <e> <s> it is there in common law if needed <e> <s> the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords following the recent closure of the south london hospital for women the south west thames regional health authority intends to dispose of the building and realise its full market value <e>", "<cs> my lords the wandsworth health authority has given an assurance that wherever possible it will continue to provide patients in the specialties of obstetrics gynaecology general medicine and general surgery with the choice of being seen and treated by male or female doctors at other hospitals within the district <e> <s> with regard to the womens national commission i confirm that the government are currently considering that report <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons for the closure were well debated in this house at an earlier stage <e> <s> i confirm that the closure is part of the improvement and rationalisation of acute services planned for the wandsworth area and releases resources in the short term to help improve services for the mentally ill and in the longer term for the future development planned for st georges hospital <e>", "<cs> no my lords the policy is to achieve the best price and to reinvest in the health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little difficult for me to be specific because it is the responsibility of the individual health authorities <e> <s> they are aware that certain women want to be treated by women doctors and they will try wherever possible to ensure that this happens <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will agree with me that there are a number of difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> we are very concerned about the ethnic minorities but i understand that for the purposes of medical treatment it is not in any faith forbidden that they be seen by a male doctor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not catch the first part of the noble baronesss question <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of the endowment fund itself is a little wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i gave the house the impression that i categorically stated that i said only that i understood it <e>", "<cs> because my lords in view of the report of the select committee on procedure of the house i considered that supplementary to be slightly wide of the question on the order paper which relates specifically to the disposal of the south london hospital for women <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend lord sandys for putting down this amendment as it gives me the opportunity to state categorically that the aim of this amendment is already precisely met by existing regulations <e> <s> the majority of water authorities use hexafluorosilicic acid solutions for fluoridation and some limited use is made of sodium hexafluorosilicate <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised that the noble lord lord houghton is not slightly better informed <e> <s> that is unusual for him because at our previous committee stage i mentioned some chemicals which are already added to water and there are over of them <e> <s> i suggest ammonia chlorine hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid as examples <e> <s> i promised that a copy of the list would be put in the library and that has been done <e> <s> therefore fluoride in itself is not a one-off in this case <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for those helpful words <e> <s> referring to my noble friend lord sandys i can assure him that there are appropriate regulations covering the point he raised <e> <s> they are not the same but they are appropriate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord kinnoull mentioned a number of points before coming to the meat of his amendment and i shall try to reply to those <e> <s> we understand the very strong feelings on this matter <e> <s> they became very apparent in another place and they are very apparent in your lordships committee <e> <s> we have very carefully considered the arguments both for and against this measure because there are equally strong arguments <e>", "<cs> i really cannot accept that <e> <s> we are not breaking new ground on this <e> <s> we are merely putting the law back to the situation that on both sides of the committee we have believed it to have been for the last years <e>", "<cs> the government do not believe that fluoridation represents mass medication in the sense in which that term would normally be used <e> <s> the benefit of fluoridation was first discovered by observing the dental health of people living in areas where the water supply contains natural fluoride at the required concentration <e> <s> it is arguable that these people are not subject to mass medication and that there is no significant difference between people living in areas where fluoride is naturally present at the optimum level and that is about half a million in this country and million worldwide and those people living in areas where the fluoride content has been increased in order to replicate this naturally occurring level of benefit <e>", "<cs> i was interested in the remarks of the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> doubtless he will let my noble friend have a copy of that report this evening so that we can take a look at it too <e> <s> i was grateful for the comments of my noble friend lord colwyn <e> <s> i can tell him and the rest of the committee that besides the evidence that he stated there was a report of the royal college of physicians which reviewed the studies relevant to claims that fluoridation caused harm through osteo-arthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders <e> <s> they concluded <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have to repeat so often that there is no evidence but it really is restating the case as a result of matters put to me by noble lords <e> <s> with regard to my noble friends last point that that report was the sole basis of this bill i can assure him that it was not <e> <s> there is a mass of evidence including the recent knox report and many other studies which has convinced us that i say it again there is no evidence <e>", "<cs> may i say that the point is that the next amendment cannot be moved if this one is accepted and therefore my noble friend was merely trying to help the committee in her normal generous way <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> we are strictly out of order in debating amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> my noble friend raised the point that she did on amendment no <e> <s> for the benefit of the committee <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will be brief in concluding his remarks <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did say he would be brief <e> <s> i think he is now abusing the privileges of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do now adjourn until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords this government like their predecessors have chosen to regulate tobacco promotion mainly by way of voluntary agreements <e> <s> when the time comes to review the present agreements we shall take account of all the relevant circumstances including the views of the medical profession <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that the act banned tobacco advertising <e> <s> perhaps i may just correct her it was cigarette advertising on television that was banned <e> <s> no my lords i think that the voluntary agreements which have been in effect since have been beneficial <e> <s> cigarette sales which stood at billion in are reported as being billion in while the proportion of adult smokers in the population has fallen from per cent <e> <s> in to per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> that is not a bad record <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally agree with my noble friend lord orr-ewing that voluntary agreement is the best <e> <s> i think that there is benefit from sponsorship of the arts provided that it does not encourage particularly young people to smoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot confirm the figure of million because that matter involves a private agreement with the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with the noble lord lord ennals that there is a very great difference between cigarette smoking and cigar smoking <e> <s> cigarette smoking is reported to be much worse though i would not know because i do neither <e> <s> i think in a free society such as ours we must be cautious about banning an activity by legislation unless there is firm evidence to support such action and there is no such evidence at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any noble lord being sponsored by a tobacco company but i am sure that the companies will now be carefully looking at the noble lord for the next years <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i think the policy of this government as of all governments in the recent past that we should get across the message of good health to everyone <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am sorry if i missed that point <e> <s> one agreement on sports sponsorship runs out on st december this year <e> <s> one on tobacco products advertising and promotion and health warnings expires on st march next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord rea noticed that my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer increased the tax by about twice the rate of inflation in the last budget <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that we are doing everything that is justified at the moment on a voluntary basis which is the most effective way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that we should make every effort <e> <s> we have had one of the largest reductions in smoking in the last years <e> <s> there is i believe more good news to come on that front <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether or not we have the sdp with us at the moment <e> <s> i stand up briefly to say in respect of all my noble friends amendments that we give them very warm support and hope that the committee will accept them as they are <e> <s> i think that they improve the bill substantially <e>", "<cs> my noble kinswoman lady masham seeks by this amendment to protect a patient pursuing a complaint or the subject of a complaint by a relative or friend from any possibility of reprisals by <e>", "<cs> i remember dealing with this very fully on second reading and i think i assured your lordships then that there would be full consultation to get the guidelines right <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may say to my noble kinswoman that i hope i have reassured her <e> <s> we have taken this amendment well on board in our thinking and i hope she will agree and also that the noble lord lord colwyn will agree that the place to put it is in the directions <e>", "<cs> alas it is not up to me to say it is not my bill <e> <s> it has been discussed <e> <s> all the amendments down this evening have been discussed at a high level in my department but i am afraid i cannot answer my noble kinswoman directly <e> <s> it is not up to me <e> <s> it is up to my noble friend lord colwyn to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do now adjourn during pleasure <e> <s> i confirm that we will not come back to the local government bill until a quarter to nine <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord campbell of croy said it may be inappropriate to have this debate in your lordships house <e> <s> but i think it is highly appropriate and as the noble lord lord ennals pointed out highly opportune <e> <s> therefore i <e>", "<cs> my lords so was i listening to the radio <e> <s> it is obviously something that has great potential for the future and we shall be looking at it carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read very carefully as will my noble friend lady trumpington and my right honourable and honourable friends in the dhss everything that has been said tonight <e> <s> if we can learn anything from what has been said as i know we can it will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> if i have not answered any noble lords any noble baronesss or my noble kinswomans points i shall of course do so in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords all aspects of state financial provision for retirement have been considered as part of the social security review <e> <s> the government hope to publish their proposals in a green paper soon after the whitsun recess <e>", "<cs> no my lords unfortunately the noble lord lord molloy is wrong <e> <s> he will have to wait and see what is in the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> indeed i read his letter in the <e>", "<cs> my lords a green paper is a green paper and is there for consultation and there has been fantastic consultation in preparing it <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> the reasons for the social security review on a wide basis are well known to take account of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about the noble lords inference about what i should know <e> <s> i know that pensions have been more than protected under this government as promised <e> <s> as for the oppositions policy on social security i am not sure that any of them know <e> <s> i sympathise in particular with the noble baroness opposite who has to stand there speaking for the opposition when mr meacher comes out with some of the remarks that he does <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i am sure that it is more than clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy and the government are on common ground <e> <s> we want to see the best for the pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must congratulate the noble lord lord pitt on his very good introduction of this bill <e> <s> the government are gravely concerned at the appalling toll of disease and early death caused by smoking <e> <s> your lordships debated these matters on th june last year and noble lords who spoke then were virtually unanimous in their condemnation of smoking for causing an enormous amount of unnecessary suffering and death from diseases such as lung cancer coronary heart disease and chronic bronchitis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords but all i was asking for was the official opposition view which we still do not have <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be helpful if in speaking to this amendment i refer also in a little detail to the accompanying schedule to which it closely relates <e> <s> i have to say that neither this proposed new clause nor the schedule has any scientific or medical basis and they are entirely unjustified <e> <s> if agreed they could only serve to raise quite unwarranted alarm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i was only stressing it which rather proved the flaw in his argument <e>", "<cs> oh my lords i should love to answer that in great detail <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend about various countries in europe <e> <s> i can tell him about sweden and the netherlands where they still want it <e> <s> i can tell him about the problems of water supply in france from all the little different sources and how uneconomic it is <e> <s> if my noble friend would like me to go into a lot of detail on that perhaps he will please put down an amendment <e> <s> i should be very happy to deal with it all and so would my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i think he is being grossly unfair <e> <s> the government base what has been said today on firm and independent evidence <e> <s> it is not just the governments view it is independent and very superior medical advice <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has already spoken i feel that it is only right to speak once more from these benches in this sense on her behalf <e> <s> i would just remind <e>", "<cs> there is no point of order <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear that the procedure of this house is that it is the whip on duty and i am the whip on duty in lieu of the chief whip <e> <s> we are discussing the procedure of the house but i should like to remind the noble lord we are still in the report stage <e>", "<cs> one my lords recently installed at the supra-regional assay service laboratory at southampton general hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not too certain about the export potential for this product as the question on the order paper relates to its use with or on order for the national health service <e> <s> i can perhaps help my noble friend a little by saying that we will study the results of the work at present being carried out at southampton to see if there is beneficial use for the machine <e> <s> if there is then i am sure that it has export potential <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to hear that the noble lord lord ennals knows quite a lot about this machine <e> <s> he spoke to my officials i know recently about it and i hope that i shall give the same answers to him as they did <e> <s> with regard to research the plasmaquad is a research-orientated machine <e> <s> its cost varies between about and as the noble lord rightly says <e> <s> as to whether we should be spending this money on it the plasmaquad was acquired by southampton university with grant support from the department of the environment for the purposes of isotopic lead studies <e> <s> therefore there has been no cost to date <e> <s> if there is beneficial use in the national health service then as the noble lord will be aware it will be up to the district health authorities to order it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to keep such an important machine a secret <e> <s> one of the great benefits of this house is its number of experts and there are many in the house who are more expert on this subject that i am <e> <s> i can briefly say that it is a machine that measures not only the quantity of lead in the blood but also where the lead came from <e> <s> this could be very useful for environmental purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> we have no plans to make any changes to the vaccine damage payments act <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise what a very sensitive subject this is <e> <s> i think that in many respects although there might be regret and puzzlement as the noble lord said there will be a general welcome that we are moving towards a more comprehensive scheme for the disabled which is the reason why we are not increasing the payment <e> <s> it would not be reduced by two-thirds as he said <e> <s> i beg your lordships pardon i misheard the noble lord <e> <s> i shall move on to his next point which was that we were content when in opposition to call the payment derisory and that the vaccine damage payments scheme was just an interim measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the pearson report said that the people in question are in a special category <e> <s> but as my noble friend is aware from the two debates that we have had one last year and one on th may of this year neither the last government nor this government have accepted all the points in the pearson report <e> <s> with regard to my noble friends point that the vaccination is to protect the community i can only refer him back to what my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said in the debate on th may which was that in the governments opinion it is not <e> <s> it is to protect the child and not the community <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords last point it was not protection of the community it was protection of the individual as i have already stated <e> <s> the noble lord said that many people would be disappointed <e> <s> i would only say to him that on the th may his noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones said at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry the noble lord lord henderson feels that i have not given a satisfactory answer <e> <s> i think that any changes we would make to this scheme would only increase the preference which would run counter to our general aim of working towards a more coherent system of benefits for disabled people irrespective of the cause of disability <e>", "<cs> my lords the government too would like it to be now but the survey is such a detailed and complicated one that i am advised that it will not be ready until early <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton and i confirm that i shall draw these views to the attention of my right honourable friends and my noble friends <e> <s> as we are always looking into this matter i am sure they will be most interested in what has been said today <e>", "<cs> my lords the vaccination is undertaken on a voluntary basis with guidance from the best medical advice that an individual can get and it is a matter for the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure and i would confirm that we shall not return to business until

are giving further thought to the position of young people in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the situation that happened two years ago <e> <s> we are looking carefully at how

commissioners under powers contained in the plant health act <e> <s> this is also backed up by further powers under the tree pests great britain order which enables the commission to take immediate action <e> <s> further controls are undertaken by the forestry commission by the setting up of pheromone-baited insect traps at major ports certain sawmills in the vicinity and other locations where wood is stored for long periods <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that aspect has been checked carefully <e> <s> bearing in mind the noble lords concern however i shall raise the matter again with the department <e>", "<cs> my lords our priority is to provide aid to the poorest nations of the world <e> <s> nicaragua is by no means the poorest country in central america which is in comparison with

programme is continually under review <e> <s> it is aimed principally at the poorest countries <e> <s> as i said in my original answer nicaragua does not fall into that category <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> as i said in my previous reply such matters depend on the countrys standing with the international financial institutions <e>",

i cannot add to it we look at each situation on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord that information at this precise time because i do not have the dates he requires <e> <s> however i can tell him that this matter is the subject of continuous negotiation and review <e> <s> if i am able to be more specific than that i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect to the noble lord that is wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy mentioned british aid to nicaragua <e> <s> that aid currently consists of a small number of scholarships in the united kingdom support for small development projects co-financed with british voluntary agencies and assistance to nicaraguan <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in an earlier reply that we are not blocking any loans <e> <s> it surprises me that the noble lord who is normally so well informed has not read the written answers in another place on th may which dealt quite fully with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have received no evidence that this is happening <e> <s> the early signs are that the governments measures to promote fair competition in the optical market are working effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is a suspicion i should very much like it if the noble lord could produce firm evidence so that we can have a look at it <e> <s> with regard to the dispensing of the prescription and the selling of the finished article as he will be aware in april this year regulations came into effect under the health and social security act passed last year which enable unregistered opticians to dispense spectacles on condition that there is a prescription <e>", "<cs> my lords we return to the happy territory of july last year <e> <s> i remember well debating this issue with my noble friend <e> <s> it was agreed by the house and passed as an act of parliament that to dispense spectacles one must have a prescription <e> <s> until it has been proved that that policy is not working satisfactorily i think it is right to stick to it <e> <s> even if one gets a prescription one can go to a non-registered ophthalmic optician to obtain spectacles <e> <s> i think the success of the governments policy is proved by the fact that one can now obtain glasses with prescription for as little as <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the manipulation of prescriptions i think as we discussed in july last year when the bill was going through this house it is very important that a person is protected <e> <s> that is the reason for the prescription <e> <s> there will be statistics later in the year to show whether there has been a change in prescribing since the regulations came into effect on st april <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that about two-thirds of low-powered spherical corrections were added to prescriptions even before the act came into force <e> <s> thus this has already happened in the normal method of prescribing <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect i think the noble lord is entirely wrong <e> <s> i think the governments action was absolutely right because it has brought down the price of spectacles <e> <s> when was the noble lord last able to go with a prescription and buy a pair of spectacles for as little as <e> <s> i think that what we have done has been a very great success <e> <s> of course as the noble lord will be well aware there are two extremes there are a few opticians who still want everything to be done by the registered ophthalmic opticians and there are those like the noble lord lord rugby with a perfectly valid point of view who want ready-made spectacles available <e> <s> i am sure that what the government have done has been proved to be very successful <e> <s> i am sure that if the noble lord goes round the country he will not find much support for his view that we should go back to spectacles <e>", "<cs> my lords from the noble lords question we have the exact point <e> <s> the noble lord says that some of these additions to the prescription are not necessary <e> <s> the government think that they are necessary in order to protect the patient the customer <e> <s> as i said in an earlier reply to the noble lord lord harris of high cross this is not something new <e> <s> this is something that has been happening for a long time in prescribing <e> <s> the latest figures which are up to st april this year show that at least two-thirds of prescriptions have exactly these matters which my noble friend is now raising <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had very detailed discussions with many eminent registered ophthalmic opticians and senior people in the eye service <e> <s> yes they are disappointed <e> <s> they are <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first point made by the noble lord this is exactly the reason why we considered it necessary that spectacles should not be dispensed unless there was a valid prescription within a two-year period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that but i am very happy to answer the questions that the house puts to me <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady trumpington i beg to move that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very useful and most interesting debate this afternoon <e> <s> it is clear that the subject is very much one of still great controversy in your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps i may make some general points first <e> <s> i am grateful for the welcome that all noble lords have given the bill limited as it is <e> <s> i should like to refute the allegation that the bill has come in just because of the baby cotton case <e> <s> no my lords that cannot be accepted <e> <s> ministers were worried about this problem for a very long time <e> <s> an example of their worry was the fact that my right honourable friend commissioned the warnock report in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend prevented me from going on to say that this is a matter i shall look at and to which we shall no doubt come back at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend because he did raise the point about whether or not we would bring forward a white or green paper <e> <s> the warnock report alone has raised such a number of controversial matters throughout the country that we in the department are having great difficulty in finding anything to put together <e> <s> of course i cannot forecast what will appear in the queens speech <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that we are trying to introduce a bill as soon as possible <e> <s> perhaps i may refer again to my opening speech and the quotation of my right honourable friend the prime minister who earlier this week in another place said that the government plan to introduce a comprehensive bill on these matters as soon as practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is estimated that in england per cent <e> <s> of children born in and per cent <e> <s> born in had been immunised by the end of <e> <s> the difference in those figures reflects the large number of children who were immunised in the second year after birth <e> <s> figures are not available on a district basis for children born in because of boundary changes in that year <e> <s> for children born in and vaccinated by the end of the lowest estimated rate is per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her questions <e> <s> if i may rather lump the answer together yes the government are very concerned that we get our policy across on a voluntary basis <e> <s> we try to explain to parents through various means with booklets and with the help of educationists the pros and cons to give them an informed choice and present the true picture <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope to get the children before they get to the education process <e> <s> the ideal is to try to immunise all children in their first year of birth with a further booster between the age of and years as the noble baroness will be aware <e> <s> we monitor carefully what the districts are doing <e> <s> where low rates are identified those are discussed with the appropriate regional health authority with a view to remedying the situation <e> <s> in the area that has the lowest rate which is in a part of london we have an agreement with the rha that the situation will be dramatically improved and we hope that that will be so in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect i think that the noble baroness has in fact moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an almost rare occurrence to be able to agree with every single word of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> now that he has been able to agree with me as i am with him i am sure that the health service will go from strength to strength with ever-increasing good will from the government <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord colwyn for the way in which he has introduced this bill for his hard work and for his amendments <e> <s> i think that the bill will be a great step towards better communication with the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is an opportune moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> in order that we may take the second statement i beg to move that this house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lords lord kilmarnock and lord stallard and the noble baroness lady jeger have said <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady jeger referred to clause <e> <s> i have a good deal of information for her on clause but perhaps the noble baroness can wait as perhaps can the noble lord lord stallard who started off on clause <e> <s> i have something to say on tax in due course <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble lord does not think i have been fair <e> <s> i have spent quite a long time on the people who would lose and on the amounts some people would lose <e> <s> but the number of people who will lose the full amount is very small <e> <s> i must make it absolutely clear that nobody is going to lose money <e> <s> there is no cash reduction here <e> <s> they might not gain as much if the upratings had gone on both but as is clearly set out in the memorandum to which the noble lord has referred there is a saving on this clause <e> <s> although this clause and clause stand clearly on their own two feet there is in our view considerable merit in looking at them to some extent together for the benefits that we can give under clause <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord lord banks with great care but i am sure he will not be surprised to learn that i cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out the social security no <e> <s> act provided for invalidity benefit and the short-term benefits to be uprated by per cent <e> <s> less than would otherwise have been due <e> <s> this was part of the government programme for reducing public expenditure <e> <s> the fact that the government have been able to restore the abatement in advance of bringing the benefit into tax does not mean that it would be right to restore the abatement retrospectively and so negative the provisions of the act <e> <s> the fact that the government are restoring the abatement before <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment he referred to what he said was a major admission by the government this evening that they still propose to tax invalidity benefit <e> <s> in fact it was not a major admission because it has been well known for some time <e> <s> i reiterate that it is because we have been able to raise the tax thresholds over the years that we have been in office that we have been able speedily to bring in this piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> i understand the points which the noble lord and the noble baroness have made <e> <s> however with due respect i believe that they are based on a misunderstanding of the purpose of this new clause <e>", "<cs> no there is more than one case which as i said i do not want to go into in too much detail <e> <s> other local authorities are viewing that case with a great deal of interest <e> <s> if that case succeeds they are ready to jump on the bandwagon of abuse <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord that the great majority of councillors behave sensibly <e> <s> this is purely a reserve power to be used as a last resort to stop abuse <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord who knows about these matters far better than i do does not want to see the type of abuse that is being perpetrated in some areas extended and continued <e> <s> it is for that reason that i discussed this carefully with the officials and i am now convinced that this power is necessary to stop the limited number of councillors who are abusing the present system <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has given us a pretty good canter over this clause <e> <s> i admire her <e> <s> i think she is a great stayer in heavy going <e> <s> my noble friend who is a true thoroughbred if ever there was one when faced with heavy going sent for her whip <e> <s> successive governments have recognised the unfairness of asking people to chair these boards without any provision for pensions and there is a clear commitment to rectify the position even by the party of the noble baroness <e> <s> over the years the chairmanship of each of these boards has become close to a full-time occupation <e> <s> the chairmanship of the tote requires a full-time commitment and each chairmanship of the other two boards calls for three days a week <e>", "<cs> i think that as they are career employees they have been treated separately from the other employees of the board <e>", "<cs> notwithstanding that we have covered this ground before i am very well aware of the strength of feeling that invalid care allowance arouses <e> <s> the words which the new clause is designed to omit from the social security act clearly discriminate against married women and cohabiting women and i would not attempt to pretend otherwise <e>", "<cs> it is too early to anticipate the judgment and much of what the noble baroness has said depends on how the judgment when it comes is phrased <e> <s> the reference to the court has only just been made by the commissioner and therefore an early response is not expected <e> <s> when we receive the decision of the social security commissioner in the particular case of mrs drake we will consider the implications and what the correct course of action should be at that stage <e>", "<cs> i think this is an opportune moment for the house to resume and in begging so to move i think it would be wise to confirm that we shall not return to this bill before twenty-five past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it is with some trepidation that i rise to debate this matter with such a noted expert as the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with some of the general points first and particularly with the two points raised by the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> she said that it was pointless to discuss the amendments of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i tried to make it clear in the preamble to my answer to the first amendment that it certainly is not <e> <s> this is very relevant <e> <s> we certainly welcome the debate on the wider issues as well as the principle of this very limited bill and everything that is said today will be borne in mind for future legislation <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is plainly keen to extend the scope of the bill to give further deterrence to those who would wish to enter upon the dangerous practice of surrogacy <e> <s> but i would refer again to the principle that the interests of the child should be our paramount consideration and i suggest that the amendment unwittingly runs counter to that important tenet <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that at the moment we are talking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support for the governments point of view from the noble baroness lady warnock the noble lord lord prys-davies and the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies and particularly from my point of view from the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> we have crossed swords before and we shall doubtless do so again but i think he is learning that we are not always wrong <e> <s> it is a good thing <e> <s> i hope he will come around fully to our point of view in future <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this clause stand part debate <e> <s> i remind the committee that this bill has the objective of prohibiting only commercial agencies <e> <s> it does not bite on non-commercial agencies which do not take fees <e> <s> before my noble friends lord swinfen and lord craigmyle get too depressed i refer them to clause and ask them to read that clause very carefully <e> <s> the effect of that provision is that if any agency fixes up a surrogacy and at any subsequent time receives any money from the surrogate or the commissioning parents or even anyone connected with them it commits an offence unless it can prove that the payment had nothing to do with the arrangement made <e> <s> this prevents a body from seeking donations instead of charging fees for what it does <e> <s> i think that that will deter a lot of people <e> <s> i realise that the majority of the warnock committee recommended <e>", "<cs> as i understand the position if it can be proved that the legacy was as a result of a surrogacy agreement then there is trouble but for whom i am not quite sure <e> <s> perhaps i should look into that <e>", "<cs> may i deal briefly with the point that my noble friend lord swinfen raised on clause stand part <e> <s> i was right in saying that the agency that accepts a legacy will be liable to prosecution unless it can be proved that it was not given as the result of a surrogacy arrangement <e>", "<cs> i missed the point that my noble friend was trying to ask me <e>", "<cs> it is not only the level of fine it is the imprisonment that is also a deterrent <e> <s> as i understand it the commercial agency existing at the moment has said that it will not operate because of the threat of those two things <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> if he takes the logic of his argument further and i hope he will consider this it may be that that particular person is going to break the law regardless of the level of fine or the term of imprisonment and that is when the attorney-generals powers can be used <e>", "<cs> my lords retirement pension widows pension child benefit mobility allowance attendance allowance and war pension can now be paid by credit transfer <e> <s> the exercises to invite existing beneficiaries to change their method of payment are not yet complete but new claimants can choose payment by credit transfer from the outset if they so wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish they would extend free facilities to all of us i think it would be beneficial <e> <s> such concessions are of course a matter for individual banks but this is a good example of the free market where pensioners can move to the bank offering the best services available <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear it my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble viscount that there is any loss to pensioners <e> <s> some are paid weekly and some four-weekly and some are paid every weeks regardless of whether that is done by automated credit transfer or by pension book <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord airedale has put his finger on a very good point indeed <e> <s> the government are aware of the importance of the post office network <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i would say to my noble friend that he cannot speak for a second or even third time at this stage of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords this promotion conforms to the requirements of the voluntary agreement by which such matters are regulated <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has timed his question well <e> <s> in fact my right honourable friend and the parliamentary under-secretary for health are meeting the tobacco industry this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure that the remarks today plus those made in the debate on nd may will be borne in mind when negotiations continue <e>", "<cs> no my lords i beg to differ from the noble lord <e> <s> the figures show that there has been a steady decline in smoking <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not believe that there has been a collapse of the voluntary system <e> <s> i believe that it has worked well <e> <s> so far as i understand all advertisements have conformed to the present code <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of the noble lords question is i believe hypothetical and difficult to answer as a result <e> <s> with regard to the second part of his question i am not sure how long the new agreement is going to last <e> <s> the last one existed for a number of years <e> <s> it is therefore difficult to do this every year as the noble lord wishes <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> there are a number of points in the voluntary agreement <e> <s> in fact it is quite a lengthy document with an appendix attached <e> <s> so far as i understand it the advertisement does not contravene the voluntary code <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i understand it is not <e> <s> however if i am wrong i shall of course write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord and doubtless a copy will also be sent to the noble lord lord jenkins <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows i am not certain that what i said was true <e> <s> i shall of course pass his remarks on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft order laid before the house on rd june be approved <e> <s> this order is brought forward under section a of the deer scotland act which gives the secretary of state power to regulate the classes of firearms ammunition and other equipment which may be used in scotland for killing deer <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a full and interesting debate this evening and i am very grateful to all noble lords who have taken part for the general welcome that they have given this order <e> <s> i turn first to answering some of the points this evening and if i miss any i shall write to the noble lord concerned <e> <s> i turn first to the noble lord lord northfield who as he forewarned me gave criticism to our first order <e> <s> i should not like the house to think that the first order was out of order <e> <s> in fact it was a perfectly legitimate order and it was open to the department to make an order in the form of the draft <e> <s> he might have disagreed with it but it was certainly not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until ten minutes to eight which i believe is the agreed time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the noble lord lord carmichael has said because he has elucidated the situation for me <e> <s> when the noble lord moved the amendment he introduced many points which i had not realised were intended to be covered <e> <s> the amendment is tabled in the name of fair competition and the maintenance of quality and safety standards <e> <s> in our view it is both unnecessary and misconceived for two reasons first that taxis are subject to lower standards of quality control than are buses and secondly that making the sharing of taxis subject to the agreement of the county council would in some way improve the situation <e>", "<cs> i think there was a misconception that it was on safety arising from the way the amendment was worded whereas the noble lord lord carmichael was on a subsidy point <e> <s> county councils are given no powers in the bill to veto bus services <e> <s> the concept of such veto is contrary to the fair competition spirit of this bill but notwithstanding what i have said i shall look at the points that the noble lord raised when he moved the amendment <e> <s> in the meantime i hope he will withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i have covered some of this ground and i can assure the noble lord that such consultations as he requires have already taken place between officials at the department of transport and the london trade that is the london taxicab trade on this particular matter <e> <s> indeed the london trade have always been consulted about matters affecting taxi operations in london and i see no reason why this situation should change <e> <s> given that i believe that the noble lords amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> consultation is existing and will continue <e>", "<cs> this amendment to clause would force any taxi-licensing authority making a scheme for shared taxi services to designate separate ranks for shared and exclusive taxi services <e> <s> i can fully understand the concern that has led to this amendment being tabled by the noble lord lord tordoff and so ably supported by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> the taxi trade especially in london can envisage problems occurring at what are now very busy and congested taxi ranks if shared services were also permitted to operate from them <e> <s> a shared taxi waiting for second or subsequent fares might block such a rank <e> <s> however i am sure that noble lords can think of a great many taxi ranks where no such problems would occur <e> <s> moreover there may be places where there is simply insufficient road space to allow the designation of two ranks <e> <s> it may be sensible in some cases to designate separate ranks and the clause as it stands does not prevent this <e> <s> i am sure we can rely on the licensing authorities in consultation with their local taxi trade to locate and designate such ranks as are necessary without this extra restraint <e> <s> the powers are already there for them to do so and we are sure that they will <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising this <e> <s> i think the matter is taken care of in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for explaining the thought behind the amendment <e> <s> as he points out the amendment as it stands does not cover the point that he was raising <e> <s> i would say to him that i should like to consider with my noble friends and the department the exact point that he has raised and perhaps i can write to him and we can discuss this at a later stage <e> <s> i assure him that i shall look at it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will by now be familiar with the objective and content of the bill and my priority today is to express my gratitude to your lordships for giving this bill such a speedy passage <e> <s> the government announced only in march their intention to bring forward legislation this session to prohibit commercial surrogacy agencies and advertising of or for surrogacy services <e> <s> i think that this is a small but useful measure <e> <s> i say that because one of the commercial agencies operating in this country has already announced that it will cease operations <e> <s> with due respect i think that that is the best vindication of this limited bill <e> <s> a larger bill will raise greater emotions and will as we have heard today be highly controversial <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first pay tribute to the community bus movement <e> <s> it is a fine example of british self-help and voluntary effort <e> <s> those who brought it to birth in the s deserve our thanks for their imagination and hard work <e> <s> i believe that among others the noble lord lord carmichael and the noble baroness lady stedman played a major part in that <e>", "<cs> i think this is an opportune moment to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> in moving that motion i confirm that we shall not come back to consider this matter further until oclock <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising these amendments which in fact arise from a misunderstanding of clause <e> <s> if he has discussed the matter with the department which he says he has he will of course know the answer but for the benefit of the rest of the committee may i just reiterate that this is an error and indeed the department has had to cross through a sentence from the notes on clauses circulated to your lordships which made the same mistake <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i detect a welcome shift of policy by my noble friend <e> <s> here we have a constuctive amendment <e> <s> i accept the principle <e> <s> unfortunately it is technically defective in a number of ways <e> <s> if i give the undertaking that we shall come back to it on report i hope that my noble friend will withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i should be very happy to do so <e> <s> one of the intentions behind clause is to require the controlling authority to exercise control over its public transport company so that the company does not engage in activities which the controlling authority had no powers to engage in before it set up the company <e> <s> as drafted however a public transport company would not be able to engage in any activity which its parent authority had had powers to engage in but had not carried out <e> <s> we believe that this would be unduly restrictive on the public transport companies and the amendments put the situation correctly <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies the noble lord lord shepherd and i am grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to explain them <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the argument which has been so well advanced by my noble friend but if i may say so i think he may have given the committee the impression and i certainly had the impression from what he said that the limitation on a public transport companys powers would be tighter and more significant than is the case <e> <s> first of all let me say that i think it is entirely right that as long as the company is controlled by the local authority it should not be allowed to diversify into completely new activities which are beyond the authoritys own powers <e> <s> we could not have companies effectively used as a means of extending the authoritys own activities into areas which are quite beyond the proper scope of the public sector <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for so succinctly putting her case <e> <s> while thanking the noble lord lord tordoff for his apologies in getting it wrong the last time we were here with due respect i think that he has got it wrong again as i shall try to explain <e> <s> we have heard it explained that as the bill stands in many cases public transport companies will be audited by different auditors from the auditors of the parent authorities <e> <s> i confirm that this will generally be the case because the cipfa auditors who are appointed by the audit commission to carry out the audit of most local authorities would not be permitted to audit passenger transport companies under clauses and <e> <s> the broad question of which accountancy qualifications are required for the audit of public companies is a matter for my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry and i hope that noble lords will agree that we shall have to think very carefully before entering into changes to this bill which effectively provided for exemptions to those qualifications as these amendments would do <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> i also confirm that we shall not come back for further consideration of the transport bill until oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are not aware of any reasons why there should be difficulties with the supply of magnifying aids where these are required as a tool of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord rugby in particular for giving me advance notice and sending me a copy of what he intended to ask <e> <s> i can tell him that the office of fair trading published a report on opticians and competition in december <e> <s> as a result of that report the association of optical practitioners withdrew a particular restrictive practice about which the noble lord was concerned as it did another restrictive practice concerning empty frames <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are magnifying aids they can be obtained without prescription <e> <s> if the spectacles or goggles are required to remedy a defect of sight then a prescription will be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i can <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend has to wear glasses which are purely magnifying aids <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord carmichael said this amendment deals with the general statutory procedure which applies to rail closure proposals by the british railways board and/or london regional transport <e>", "<cs> i am glad to see that the labour benches are now empty and so i shall continue <e> <s> i shall start from the beginning <e> <s> these are all technical amendments <e> <s> taken together they ensure that ptes have the same powers to support bus substitution services inside their areas and outside them as they have under existing legislation to support rail services and that the arrangements covering the ptes role in relation to proposals to withdraw bus substitution services in their areas and within miles of their areas is parallel to that which applies to rail services <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> as we suspected these amendments are designed to fulfil what the noble lord thought was the commitment made by the government in another place during the passage of the lrt bill in to amend legislation to give the transport consumer bodies a statutory role in relation both to fares and to reductions in br services <e> <s> while i would be very quick to reassure the committee that it remains our firm intention to fulfil that commitment these amendments do not and i believe that there are good reasons why they are inappropriate <e> <s> our commitment was to establish a role on the structure and relativities of fares <e> <s> these amendments give the consumer bodies a statutory role which would enable them to comment on fare levels <e> <s> that is something that was not our intention <e>", "<cs> my lords claims to family income supplement are made jointly by couples and the woman is generally the payee with the man as alternative payee <e> <s> supplementary benefit is usually paid to the claimant but in certain circumstances it can be paid to a third party on the claimants behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will agree that in the case of family income supplement where it refers to a husband and wife they should both be responsible for bringing up the family <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there are some worries on this front but i think it is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stallard is indeed right when he says that social security is a complex area <e> <s> as he says we have brought out a green paper which is the subject of discussion and we would welcome any comments for discussion and consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble and learned lord an answer at the moment <e> <s> i am seeking advice <e> <s> presumably the sooner we pass the bill and get it on the statute book the sooner the alterations can take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise of course the positive intention behind the amendment which we discussed in committee <e> <s> i acknowledge the extra work that the noble lord lord carmichael and my noble friend lady elliot have put into the amendment during our weeks away <e> <s> as the noble lord lord carmichael said the point of the amendment is to ensure that the office of fair trading reports quickly on complaints of anti-competitive practices so that operators are not driven out of business before any action can be taken <e> <s> i have to ask the house to resist the amendment because i really do not think that it would be appropriate to make some special provision of this kind in competition legislation for the bus industry alone <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not necessarily agree that the fact that there is not a sub-office in scotland makes the procedure any slower <e> <s> i believe that the officers within the office of fair trading are responsible people <e> <s> if a case is ugent it does not matter with modern communications whether it is in wick edinburgh penzance or london <e> <s> they will do the job as quickly as possible <e> <s> it is wrong to say that just because they are in london this will delay matters <e> <s> however on the point of a sub-office in scotland i hope that my noble friend lady elliot will take up the proposal with the department of trade and industry <e> <s> i am all for creating more jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords we have covered a fair amount of ground by this one amendment and we have been liberal in our interpretation of the law <e> <s> but i am happy to try and help wherever i can <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord carmichael is so sceptical of the value of taxi-sharing and a bit fearful of its consequences <e> <s> taxi-sharing has been tried elsewhere in the world for instance in many australian cities and it works <e> <s> we are convinced that it can work in this country and that it can mean more business for the taxi trade and a better deal for the passenger <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall reply to the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> at first sight it looks odd and i agree with the noble and learned lord but it was the way in which the town police clauses act was drafted <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will bear with me and wait until we reach his amendments later amendments nos <e> <s> and i can go into this matter in some detail because i have a lengthy speaking note on it <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord can wait until then but is still not satisfied thereafter perhaps we can go into the matter further at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful discussion on taxis as i knew we should <e> <s> if i may briefly deal with the amendment before us amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord renton it would restrict a councils discretion to grant licences rather than limiting its power to refuse to grant them <e> <s> it would be more restricting than the present position giving the established taxi trade the right of appeal against the granting of licences even in those areas where the district council does not at present exercise strict limitation <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to establish more firmly the right of a district council to limit taxi numbers by fettering its discretion to do otherwise <e> <s> i cannot believe that that really is the will of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has raised a detailed question of legal drafting <e> <s> as i understand him he is questioning whether a textual amendment to an act should be couched in the terms of the act being amended even if as in this case they are archiac or whether the modern interpretations should be used <e> <s> i think there can be little doubt that the modern interpretation of the commissioners is a district council <e> <s> the local government miscellaneous provisions act modifies the way in which the act is applied and is framed throughout in terms of district councils <e> <s> that act would simply not work if the council were not the commissioners for the purpose of the act <e> <s> to refer now to the commissioners in an amendment made in would i am advised cause doubt as to whether we really did wish to refer to district councils if we had meant that why did we not say so and send them round the tortuous route of the public health act and the local government act to establish that that was in fact what we meant <e>", "<cs> my lords before coming on to amendment no <e> <s> may i just revert to a point that the noble and learned lord lord simon raised earlier in the proceedings <e> <s> he raised a technical point of drafting in connection with amendments nos <e> <s> and to clause i have been advised to direct the attention of the noble and learned lord to subsection of section of the town police clauses act <e> <s> this states in terms that the act of shall be deemed to be incorporated with the public health act <e> <s> i hope that this meets the point of the noble and learned lord but if not i shall be happy to discuss it further with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton for raising this particular point about the future <e> <s> before dealing with that perhaps i may first deal with clause <e> <s> the purpose is to cure a technical fault in the legislation relating to eight-seater passenger vehicles <e> <s> at present passenger vehicles with eight passenger seats hired as a whole with the services of a driver and which ply for hire are neither public service vehicles nor taxis <e> <s> this subsection brings them within the scope of the taxi code <e> <s> this is a technical but necessary amendment to existing legislation that should stand part of the bill <e> <s> however i take on board what my noble friend said and i shall raise it with the draftsmen as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i think that i mentioned consultations <e> <s> if i did not i apologise as i meant to mention the fact that there would be consultation because as my noble friend rightly points out we have discussed this aspect <e> <s> if from the consultations and investigation into the whole of the taxi and hire car legislation it becomes evident that further legislation is required and amendments to the current legislation are also required that will be undertaken at a suitable time which as my noble friend knows better than i depends on various other factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord teviot for moving his six amendments <e>", "<cs> why <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord belstead i say no more than that this amendment is entirely acceptable and i thank my noble friend for tabling it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed recall the words of my noble friend lord trefgarne <e> <s> he i know is very disappointed not to be handling aviation now <e> <s> with regard to any pooling agreement as i said in my original answer this surely is a commercial decision for the airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree that fare fixing is undesirable and can be against the consumer interest in most cases <e> <s> but the noble baroness is absolutely right in saying that on a few routes airline co-operation may be necessary to maintain the viability of the route <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is a matter of more than bilateral agreements <e> <s> we are seeking through the council of ministers to get a much more comprehensive attitude of the ec to a more competitive airlines market <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right but i must point out to him a fact that he knows better than i that in america it is a purely internal market but that europe is an international market as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree that the competition rules apply in principle to air transport <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will support us in our endeavours with the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the second part of the noble baronesss supplementary questions no that is not what i said <e> <s> so far as the first part is concerned would the noble baroness remind me of the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer is that in some cases they can lead to higher fares but in those cases it is probably the air route itself that is being saved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not exactly sure what my noble friend lord trefgarne said and perhaps it would be advisable if i did not comment specifically on that at the moment but wrote to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains our view that the bill as it stands would not prevent the continued operation of the services to which my noble friend lord teviot and the noble lord lord tordoff have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff interrupted me just at the point where i was going to go on to clarify the first part of that sentence <e> <s> if i may start again it is our view that the bill as it stands would not prevent the continued operation of these services since the objective of carrying passengers within to or from the area referred to in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the very clear exposition and arguments put forward by my noble friend lord teviot i must take issue with him straight away and say that i do not agree with his assumption that the ptes will have the vast problems he has portrayed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures with me at the moment <e> <s> however i do not anticipate a reduction if any reduction there be of the order forecast by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> that is my point <e> <s> to return to my comments in reply to my noble friend lord teviot <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i did not challenge his figures <e> <s> i accept his figures <e> <s> i only questioned whether he expected a reduction in services of buses out of a total of buses <e> <s> that is the question i put to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> passenger transport companies my lords <e> <s> i thought my noble friend had taken that on board <e> <s> he has been on this bill for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to my noble friends explanation of the work that district councils must complete in order to form public transport companies and to draw up proposals for the transfer of property rights and liabilities <e> <s> i am not going to disagree with his view that the work involved is substantial i know that it is <e> <s> i would also like to acknowledge that many district councils are already approaching the task constructively and that the association of district councils has done a great deal in attempting to assist their planning <e> <s> i can say on behalf of the government that we are very grateful to the adc <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will pass on those remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive <e>", "<cs> my lords to clarify the situation i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> a band a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall of course that i drew back from that and from continuing with the rest of the sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean the lib-lab pact <e>", "<cs> my lords may i commend my noble friend on his brevity <e> <s> i am afraid that i have to tell your lordships that i shall not be as brief because as my noble friend said it is important that we cover this ground fully <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to what my noble friend has just said and have reread what was said in committee <e> <s> we shall be covering a lot of it for a second time but on this occasion in view of the interest of the noble lord lord shepherd who alas <e> <s> is not here i think i should deal with it in a proper manner <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by saying that i am very happy to reassure the house that it remains our firm intention to fulfil the commitment to which the noble lord lord tordoff has referred but i believe there are good reasons why it would not be appropriate to do so by means of this new clause <e> <s> first i explained to the committee on th july the reasoning behind the nature of the commitment of the government <e> <s> like the noble lord lord tordoff i do not want to go over that ground again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carmichael put up an amendment and then shot it down himself and in doing so the noble lord took a great deal of my speech <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord that we must wait for the full minutes of the meeting <e> <s> with due respect to the noble lord lord carmichael i hope that noble lords will not take what he said as an absolute definitive result of the meeting <e> <s> i have heard some reports of the meeting which i knew was taking place this afternoon but in fairness to those involved i believe that we ought to wait for the full minutes to be circulated <e> <s> since the committee stage it has now become more than apparent that the government have not been sitting idly by and that consultations are continuing <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord carmichael has said i do not think that there is any need for me to say anything further <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by reassuring your lordships that the government are by no means in any way complacent about these problems <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff put it very well when he said that there was public concern about the problems <e> <s> perhaps i may remind your lordships that there are three problems which need a solution it is not one single problem <e> <s> they are the tourist coaches the sightseeing coaches and the commuter coaches which all have to have slightly different solutions in order to try to tackle what on the surface looks essentially like just one problem <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may correct one small point in the supplementary question of the noble baroness <e> <s> i said that my right honourable friend hopes to attend the meeting <e> <s> it is not definite but he certainly hopes to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords the members of the association of european airlines are numerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read and am aware of what has gone on before <e> <s> but this government and increasingly the european governments most notably of the scandinavian countries are all moving towards a more competitive field but without damaging safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i really must congratulate the noble lord lord underhill at least on his ingenuity in devising a group of amendments which succinctly overturns virtually the whole purpose of abolishing road service licensing and replacing it by registration <e> <s> i also must take issue with him on what he said about it not being discussed before <e> <s> a quite similar amendment to this was discussed at length at committee and amendment no <e> <s> with those linked with it was voted on and defeated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> there is a mistake on the marshalled list and perhaps this would be an opportune moment to clarify the position <e> <s> schedule starts with amendment no <e> <s> so the marshalled list is wrong for a number of amendments from no <e> <s> onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am totally persuaded by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carmichael said the amendment was first moved during the report stage <e> <s> i said at the time that we did not believe that there would be significant problems with surplus vehicles in the ptes and that there was therefore no need to provide for executives to retain their powers to hire out vehicles <e> <s> i also said that i had reservations about the very idea of the executive maintaining its powers in this sphere while it was administering the tendering system <e> <s> my noble friend lord teviot however explained at report stage that the amendment was intended to ensure that the secretary of state had the power to postpone the removal of executives powers to hire out vehicles if the need arose <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must apologise if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> it shows how much we missed my noble friend at report stage <e> <s> he will find out everything if he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now come to the end of our consideration of a long controversial and complex bill <e> <s> we have spent altogether some hours discussing its provisions in detail <e> <s> we have voted times we have added new clauses and a new schedule and we are sending to another place around amendments for consideration and the noble lord lord tordoff says that we are making no headway <e> <s> it has been an arduous exercise for us all but your lordships house has conducted itself throughout with remarkable patience and thoroughness <e> <s> the bill leaves this place improved in a number of important respects <e> <s> shortly i should like to mention just some of those and the more significant changes that we have made <e>", "<cs> no my lords what i said was that the government and the corporation had worked together and we knew what the corporations strategy was and we made the appropriate comments <e> <s> the noble lord is a little premature in getting up to intervene because i am going on to deal with some of the specific points he has just raised <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i said <e> <s> i fear that the noble lord misheard me <e> <s> i said that you are talking of two different types of mill and the closure of the alphasteel mill will enable bsc to redistribute that capacity within the hot rolling mills which includes ravenscraig <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware it is for the three-year programme which is the same for all the hot rolling mills <e> <s> thus to link ravenscraigs future to that of gartcosh is i hope i have proved misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not hear me aright <e> <s> what i said was that the government are considering and are encouraging others urgently to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fortunate that redevelopment measures are already in place around gartcosh specifically to cope with these problems which are not new to the area <e> <s> the scottish development agency has two integrated projects run in conjunction with the local authorities in coatbridge and in motherwell which already have made significant achievements in simulating new business development <e> <s> they are attracting companies to locate in these towns and improving the physical and commercial environment of the area <e> <s> these projects will continue until in coatbridge and we hope in motherwell and we have made clear our expectation that they will make a contribution to the work that needs to be done to create more jobs when gartcosh closes <e> <s> there are other economic initiatives at work in the area also supported by the government through the scottish development agency which will also be able to make a contribution to this work <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i thought that i had answered the noble viscounts question but we are awaiting the consulting engineers decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked a number of supplementary questions which would provide an interesting debate in their own right <e> <s> the consulting engineers for the leatherhead-reigate section were w s atkins and partners <e>", "<cs> my lords the contract for this particular section of the motorway was one designed by the institution of civil engineers and the conditions of contract fifth edition provide for the appointment of an independent engineer to supervise the works <e> <s> we are looking at the whole question of the role of the consulting engineer <e> <s> this is under discussion at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i was very pleased to read some of the press articles from people in nearby local towns who were delighted when the section was opened <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course wrong <e> <s> the section is open traffic is using it and it is perfectly safe <e> <s> the contractors started as bovis-birse <e> <s> the bovis section then sold out to a mr farr under the terms of the contract and this was allowed for <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend that we shall without delay consider all the matters which are relevant to the speed of vehicles on motorways <e> <s> however let me take the opportunity to remind the house that it is seven times safer to drive on a motorway than it is on the average of all the other roads of this country <e> <s> motorways are used for about per cent <e> <s> of all mileage travelled but only l per cent <e> <s> of all accidents occur on motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right and we have produced a pamphlet which has gone out to a number of people indicating exactly that <e> <s> it has reminded them also that it is not only the fast lane but the middle lane as well that they should not be driving in if the inside lane is free <e>", "<cs> my lords we can do quite a lot but a lot is up to the motorist to keep his rear lights clean <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right about enforcement but this is a matter for individual chief constables <e> <s> however i can assure the house that my honourable friend the minister of state is discussing with the minister of state at the home office whether more can be done in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill is right to raise specifically the question of coaches and lorries <e> <s> we are looking carefully at every aspect of the speed and safety of coaches on motorways and we shall announce our conclusions as soon as possible and make them widely known <e> <s> with regard to enforcement i can only say again that this is a matter for individual chief constables and is being followed up by both our department and the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the faster one goes the more horrific the accident will be <e> <s> i think that there is a duty on everybody regardless of whether they are driving on a motorway or on a road in the suburbs or in any town one cares to choose to take extra care and particularly in winter weather <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope you do not pass on the inside lane <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that enforcement plays one part in it but surely he must agree with me that for the rest it is up to the individual motorist to play his part in it as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem with that is the question of enforcement <e> <s> we shall be looking at matters including that one but i think all members of the house would agree with me that it is rather pointless to make a law which cannot be enforced to a reasonable degree <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell your lordships that in france the speed limit on motorways is miles per hour and they have a death rate per million car kilometres of whereas ours is <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said in reply to an earlier question was not an announcement <e> <s> if i remember rightly the announcement was made by my honourable friend the minister for transport immediately after the tragic accident to a coach on the m last month <e> <s> we are looking into every aspect of speed and safety of coaches on motorways <e> <s> we are collecting evidence from a number of sources <e> <s> i understand that it is a departmental inquiry and when the results are known i shall ensure that the noble lord knows about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord winstanley for misunderstanding him <e> <s> i thought he meant that they were so covered in dirt from going up the motorway that no one could see them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original reply our review of the speed limits started in and was fully undertaken last year and earlier this year <e> <s> we see no case for changing the overall speed limit either up or down <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> the speed limits have contributed to a lessening of pile-ups in accidents on motorways <e> <s> indeed he only re-emphasises the point i made earlier that we must all drive with more care <e> <s> in relation to his average speeds these do not accord with the figures that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for not knowing the answer <e> <s> the question on the order paper regarded serious accidents on motorways <e> <s> i should be happy to look into his point and to write to him if that would help <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness and sympathise with her <e> <s> no one is keener to take action on this matter than we are <e> <s> the situation at present is not acceptable <e> <s> the patience i think will run out at the end of next year if no agreement has been reached by the time we have ceased our term of presidency but let us hope that we can make progress during the next year because that is by far the best way to proceed rather than by taking the matter to the european court of justice <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think that with regard to the last point the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has absolutely the right point <e> <s> that is why it is better to do this thing through the council rather than by going through the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware day-to-day enforcement is of course a matter for the police <e> <s> noise limits on new motorcycles have applied from and were most recently tightened in <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport introduced regulations last year which require replacement silencers for motorcycles first registered from the start of this year to be marked to show compliance with a british standard <e>", "<cs> my lords enforcement of noise on motorcycles is a matter for the police and among all their other duties i think that they undertake this one very well <e> <s> with regard to noise meters similar to other items it is very difficult to track the noise of a motorcycle properly given all the other traffic and noise that is going on around <e> <s> this has <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the figures for the last months but the most recent figure that i have is that prosecutions took place in <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that noise can be a nuisance <e> <s> with regard to the extra work that he would like the police to undertake on this matter i should like to discuss that with my noble friends in the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see difficulties in going down that route <e>", "<cs> my lords the subcommittees report in may was very useful and we are very grateful for all the work that was done by noble lords on that <e> <s> with regard to the suggested check-points i am absolutely in agreement but we must first of all devise a system which will be effective to entrap the person who is making a noise above the stipulated decibels <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed i am aware there is much concern about motorcycle noise <e> <s> with regard to general agreement on existing legislation and regulations i would disagree with the noble lord because we are seeking to make the regulations even more stringent so as to reduce the noise level <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord and others of your lordships will be aware there are regulations before us in the community and we want to reduce the decibel level below even what is suggested in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i will take up my noble friends point and discuss it with my honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is in actually proving that the noise is above the stipulated decibels <e> <s> it might sound loud to us but given the other noise that is going on in a roadside situation it has sometimes proved very difficult for the police to pinpoint the noise at that stage <e> <s> once you take the person concerned round the corner on to a straight bit of road where there is no other traffic he can control the motorcycle in a different way so as to make less noise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is right on that point but the problem comes with somebody who deliberately flouts the law with a smaller machine <e> <s> it is not the big machines that are the worry it is the smaller machines of under cc <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> we appreciate that that is one of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we also ought to prosecute those who let their machines fall into disrepair <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course wrong <e> <s> there were successful prosecutions in <e>", "<cs> my lords what was passed by parliament in its wisdom is something we do not want to look back into at this stage <e> <s> what we want to look forward to is making a very out-of-date and inefficient service into a highly competitive one <e>", "<cs> no my lords with due respect to the noble lord i do not think that is the case <e> <s> what the chairman of lbl has said and this is quoted in <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said about the inefficiency of london buses is appreciated because the first round of tendering led to a per cent <e> <s> increase in services plus a per cent <e> <s> reduction in costs <e>", "<cs> no my lords what we are comparing is like with like which is bus driver with bus driver <e> <s> when the initial routes were put out to tender lbl lost about per cent <e> <s> of the routes <e>", "<cs> no my lords the increase in fares was announced in september <e> <s> at the time the rate of inflation was per cent <e> <s> and the increase in fares was per cent <e> <s> overall <e> <s> the remit to lrt is to increase fares broadly in line with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that with his vast experience the noble lord is better qualified than am i to answer that question <e> <s> however it is not purely busmens pay we are discussing but the whole efficiency of the operation <e> <s> when compared with other operators it appears that lbl was less efficient or it would not have lost per cent <e> <s> of its routes when it tendered for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware not all london buses are run on a one-operator basis <e> <s> i think that my noble friend mentioned other garages too at one stage earlier on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am prepared to debate this with noble lords at any time <e> <s> now that my noble friend has confined his remarks to the outer areas which are increasingly one-man operated perhaps i may say that this is in competition with other operators which are one-man operated and in most municipal areas <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> tendering is not a government requirement it is a statutory obligation under section of the act as the noble lord knows <e> <s> if by tendering lbl are able to increase their services by per cent <e> <s> plus a reduction of per cent <e> <s> in costs surely that suggests some inefficiency in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> there is an increasing number of people who are against the link <e> <s> however i think that there is an increasing number of people who are for the link because of the advantages that it can offer to this country <e> <s> i was in scotland recently and i was tackled on this matter <e> <s> i think that scotland has a lot to gain from a link <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware the united kingdom-french study group reported on this matter in and a copy of the report was placed in the library <e> <s> it is for the usual channels to decide whether or not there is to be a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a considerable amount of public consultation <e> <s> this consultation has been undertaken by all those who have submitted schemes <e> <s> there have been advertisements in the papers <e> <s>

consultation and if there is to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness and i shall pass on those remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the anxieties which are being taken into account in the assessments being carried out at the moment <e> <s> i am also aware of the increasing frustration of those who long to see a channel tunnel and who have been debating this at the slowness that it has taken to reach this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course open for those at public inquiries to keep matters proceeding for quite a long time <e> <s> i believe that that is well understood <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to confirm that that is being taken into account at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now considered on report <e>", "<cs> absolutely my lords <e>", "<cs> if i may quickly reply to that as the noble baroness has kindly mentioned me by name <e> <s> we offered four acres which we were going to acquire compulsorily for the two acres of meldon woods <e> <s> we did not know until the inspector reported that there was further <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i must come in at this point <e> <s> i did not interrupt the noble lord lord stallard when he said something similar <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has not misled either house <e> <s> i am a little surprised that some noble lords did not appear to hear what my noble friend the lord president said <e> <s> he said that the joint committee reported in april that the report was discussed in june and that it was decided by the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i said to this house <e> <s> i am afraid that the noble lord is totally wrong <e> <s> he should read <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect the noble lord has misinterpreted what i said and has misled the house i believe <e> <s> if he will read what i said in my opening speech about the consideration of the hybrid bill about the motion to annul the orders by lord foot and the motion in the other place he will see that it was taken by all those involved that it should go to a joint committee and the petitioners were memorialised by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> so do i my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord fails to take into account is that there is a long-term trend but a greater proportion of pedestrians and pedal cyclists are hit by cars and vans <e> <s> the reason for this among other things is that car traffic is growing faster than other traffic and that the increase in lorry traffic is making much more use of motorways and by-passes which this government are building at a rapid rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree with the noble lord on his last point <e> <s> we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that on the last point my noble friend had better speak to the glc or the boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i can confirm his figures <e> <s> in addition to the figures he gave there has been a reduction of slight injuries since the seat-belt laws came into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the regulations have to be reconsidered by parliament by both this house and another place by st january next year <e> <s> the timing of the debate is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there are a number of factors which have accounted for the reduction in the loss of lives since the introduction of seat-belts and i think that it would be wrong to highlight too many individual ones <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the welcome to the order given by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> she took me rather wider than the order into the law of the sea convention <e> <s> i heard clearly what she said and i shall certainly pass it on to the right quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for welcoming this statement <e> <s> he asked me a number of questions one of which was whether the policy on tolls would be reviewed <e> <s> i think that we have to wait until the transcript of the judgment is received which i understand will be in about days time <e> <s> when we have studied that of course the policy on tolls if that is affected by the judgment will be considered <e> <s> the noble lord also asked me what decision we would make on the judgment <e> <s> i am afraid that the answer is the same <e> <s> until we have seen the transcript of the judgment we do not know what action should be taken and how we should proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn i do not know the precise amount of money that was taken during the period when the tolls increased <e> <s> i can tell him if it is helpful that the tolls on cars rose from p to p the tolls on motor-cycles dropped from lop to nothing and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the welsh will be crushed in the rush by the scots to get there first <e> <s> no i do not think that is a practical proposition because we do not know who has gone across the bridge and there would be no way of proving as i am sure the noble and learned lord will understand better than i that they had done so <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend mean that we should increase the toll for motorcyclists to compensate them for when they did not pay anything <e>", "<cs> but my lords they are at the moment going across free and the tolls will revert to the figures as soon as the machinery is altered <e> <s> i think that that is the fair and reasonable thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mulley for those two questions <e> <s> as i understand it the tolls are increased as a result of the severn bridge tolls act which parliament approved and tolls can be increased when considered necessary <e> <s> so i think that when the legislation was drafted provision was made to increase the tolls and provision was made for an appeal as took place in this case <e> <s> once an appeal has been made it then automatically goes to a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not fully understand what the noble lord requires me to give him further details about <e> <s> the noble lord has an opportunity to speak later and perhaps if he raises that matter again then and is a little more specific i shall be able to tell him more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a valid point and perhaps he highlights some of the curiosities of the british character <e> <s> however let it not be forgotten that it was the party opposite which made it clear in when they revived the channel tunnel hybrid bill that there would not be a public inquiry <e> <s> furthermore only last week the select committee in another place recommended that the precedent be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with very great interest to our debate today <e> <s> it is clear that there is a great deal of interest and expertise in your lordships house on the subject of the fixed link <e> <s> the debate has fully and admirably served the two purposes i outlined earlier <e> <s> while on the subject of expertise we were very lucky to have speaking in our debate today my noble friends lord soames and lord boardman and the noble lords lord mulley and lord layton who are all associated in a major way with one or other of the schemes <e> <s> their expertise has added greatly to our debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying the position and for re-affirming now the stance taken by his party that there would be no public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be possible to do nothing else than chastise editors for incorrect information in papers <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would like to set up a new department <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment i cannot remember but i do not believe that it is as such <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the debate is to bring forward points to my right honourable friend and that is one which will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords while we might be interested in finding out whether we can get the information from the japanese is another question <e> <s> we will reflect carefully on what noble lords have said <e> <s> i shall ensure that all the arguments that i have heard are fully reflected in the assessment <e> <s> provided that the criteria laid down are met the spectacular civil engineering project of a fixed link across the channel financed by private capital backed by political will and approved by parliament must be given its chance <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness ended on that note let me say that it is up to the noble lord <e> <s> but having encountered the problem of trying to change magistrates court fines in earlier legislation i can see problems and i should hate that to delay the speedy progress of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his yuletide felicitations and we reciprocate them from this bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lord specifically but my understanding is that it is part of a national policy and that the verges are necessary for the maintenance of the carriageway itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot assure the noble baroness on that front because as she knows there is one project that house has lust considered at a place called okehampton which the noble baroness knows well and we are awaiting royal assent later today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving a better answer than i did <e>", "<cs> my lords the fault that they were not bypassed lies in the dramatic reduction in the capital spending undertaken by the last labour government <e> <s> as i said we have increased by per cent <e> <s> in england particularly in volume terms and we are now spending a record amount of money on bypasses <e> <s> this year miles of new motorway and trunk road have been opened that is more miles than last year <e> <s> as the noble lord knows the autumn statement increased spending by per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively on the period <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that there are towns of special historic interest in england of which have been bypassed and have bypasses planned <e> <s> the remainder will be considered in the light of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly pass my noble friends remarks to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> while under the glow of what we have done i can assure my noble friend that although our planning procedures may be rather slow many of our schemes are being completed ahead of schedule as he will know from the opening of the m junction today <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there is very close co-operation between the two secretaries of state at the moment <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the whiddon down stretch just before okehampton has been taken out of the national park <e> <s> this is of great benefit and shows that we are trying to solve this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it very much depends on the contract involved <e> <s> on road maintenance as my noble friend knows we have in the very recent past made tremendous progress on incentives and we are looking at ways in which this can be taken forward <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it they are but if i am wrong i will write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a duty of the glc to consult the police but i think that in this instance it did not take the polices advice <e> <s> the police expressed the view that the lanes would cause congestion for general traffic and make it difficult for them to ensure free access to parliament and the glc thought differently <e> <s> as to whether this was a deliberate attempt to snarl up traffic i think we are all entitled to our own opinion on that <e>", "<cs> my lords as to whether it is unfortunate to have questions that is not in my hands <e> <s> noble lords are entitled to put down any question and we shall do our best to answer them <e> <s> as to whether this will relieve congestion one of the reasons we do not think that it is necessarily a good idea is that westminster city council has recently announced a comprehensive review of traffic and environmental conditions in the parliament square area which my department is jointly sponsoring and it would be better to await the outcome of this before proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my understanding and we look forward to st april when westminster city council takes on this responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords on st april these bus lanes and these signs in fact they should be covered up but apparently the wind has taken the blacking-out markings off the signs will be the responsibility of westminster city council and i hope that it will make a decision fairly speedily <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a restriction on what the glc can do <e> <s> parliament agreed that the limit of any scheme should be and that if it were above the permission of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment would have to be sought <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time it was impossible for us to determine whether the rail link would be economic but as the noble baroness points out in her question such a rail link had to be financially justified according to paragraph of the white paper <e> <s> such a scheme was put before us in november and my right honourable friend is giving it urgent attention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is absolutely right when she says that the scheme will not come into effect until or just thereafter <e> <s> however my understanding is that the scheme is financially justified and must therefore stand on its own feet <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> yes i recall that many noble lords and members in another place said that a rail link was essential <e> <s> one has been presented to us that is financially justified and my right honourable friend is considering it <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i think the two are not related in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is capacity at liverpool street station <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware a bill has been laid before another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove on the heathrow question without notice <e> <s> however i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> if there is not a rail link there will be extra pressure on the roads but a rail link that is financially justified has been proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is with her great knowledge more aware than i am of airports and what happens at them <e> <s> as i understand it there is an expected increase in the number of passengers at stansted from about million at the moment to million or million <e> <s> that should justify it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is more advanced than i if he knows that there is a channel tunnel <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i would confirm to my noble friend that we wish to encourage the work and in fact expand it <e> <s> as my noble friend probably knows the monopolies and mergers commission reported on the th december last year and we are looking at this report to see whether we can improve the competitive position <e>", "<cs> my lords the airports will be subject to the normal competition rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it varies from airport to airport but some of our airport shops are very competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i think they are very competitive with the duty-free goods which can be offered on the airlines themselves <e>", "<cs> better people than i my lords have given consideration to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether that comes within the report of the monopolies and mergers commission but as we are undertaking a study of it i shall bring the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware it is justified in everybodys mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the logic behind the argument of the noble viscount but the profits from these shops go towards reducing the cost of airport charges for other passengers as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall write to the noble baroness on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the warm response given to the statement by the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff <e> <s> i believe this is an historic statement and one that is properly repeated in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with both noble lords that there should be a good rail link to the rest of the country <e> <s> a section of it is in position at the moment and i am sure that british rail will seek to improve this where commercially justified <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked me whether the government would make sure that the work incurred by this project would be distributed fairly round the country <e> <s> that is something in which the government would not seek to intervene <e> <s> it is a matter for the concessionaires themselves <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill ended by referring to a road tunnel <e> <s> of course he must not prejudge the situation <e> <s> there is the possibility of a road link which might be a tunnel or a bridge <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be for parliament to decide the result following the select committees deliberations <e> <s> although the select committee might agree with a point of a petitioner if it comes to the amount of detail that my noble friend mentioned it will be for parliament to decide and for the concessionaire to take it forward as a result of what parliament decides <e>", "<cs> my lords first i agree with my noble friend that this matter has not been dealt with in undue haste <e> <s> i think we have been discussing it for close on years and have had two false starts so perhaps it might be a case of third time lucky <e> <s> i confirm that the consultation that we propose in kent will be for real and not just mounds of paper <e> <s> this is very important <e> <s> i will certainly draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state and my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary the point that my noble friend made with regard to an effective rail link because i too think this is very important <e> <s> there is government enthusiasm <e> <s> the procedures certainly in this house are up to us to decide so i should not like to influence that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that if the hybrid bill takes longer to get through parliament and to reach its conclusion than we have suggested at the present time work will not start <e> <s> although the treaty might be signed next month and we hope will be signed next month it will not be ratified until the hybrid bill has passed through its procedure in parliament and until it has passed through its procedure in parliament and the treaty has been ratified no work will be able to start <e> <s> as to whether that will take longer than we estimate at this stage we shall have to wait and see <e> <s> the noble lord has much greater experience of the length of time hybrid bills take than i have but we hope that it will not be unduly delayed <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn asked me whether the normal planning procedures were being subsumed by the hybrid bill <e> <s> to some extent they are because this is a national matter <e> <s> though it is local to kent it is also of very great national importance and therefore it is right that parliament should decide but a great deal of the normal planning procedures will be dealt with by the kent county council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> to my knowledge there certainly will be an access point in london which is fairly well outside kent <e> <s> but i think that we shall have to wait for the white paper in order to see the details <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend that we have given this matter thought <e> <s> there are very great advantages both in what he suggests and in letting both houses have their own committees <e> <s> we have not reached a final conclusion on the deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be a good deal about ferries in the white paper and we have given this matter very careful consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend lord bessborough that we have considered this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may clarify the point to my noble friend i did not say all normal planning procedures i said some because that is where parliament comes in <e> <s> with regard to compensation i understand that the appeal mechanism will work as at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me whether this is the age of the train <e> <s> i think it is the age of improved choice for people coming through france and through this country to get from one side of the channel to the other <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for british rail and the french railways <e> <s> i understand that they have an agreement in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer my noble friend lord onslow parliament is paramount in these matters not the select committee <e> <s> as to whether there is a whip put on by the opposition parties or by my own party that is entirely a matter for the respective chief whips <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lady and say no it is on a permanent basis <e> <s> i tried to make this clear in my opening remarks and i apologise if i did not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very interesting and useful discussion on seat belts and i would only comment to the noble lord lord monson that though the press seemed to think that it was a foregone conclusion when last week the house of commons decided the issue on a vote with a very large majority i have never ceased to remind people that there is a second chamber which does give these matters detailed and long consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> i was just saying that it is not proven <e> <s> the studies undertaken are consistent <e>", "<cs> my lords that could be covered i believe by a construction and use regulation which would be simpler than bringing it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for parliament to decide these regulations in front of us <e> <s> as the noble lord lord somers i believe said there are a number of things that we have to face in everyday existence that are controlled by parliament <e> <s> the wearing of seat belts could be another of those if we agree the motion in my name which i hope the house will support <e>", "<cs> my lords at the meeting in the hague on th january both the commissioner for competition matters and the commissioner for transport were present in the hague and made it clear that the commission has now started detailed preparation of possible court cases against member states <e> <s> such cases may become essential if progress remains blocked in the council <e> <s> i hope that the commissions latest moves will persuade other member states including france of the urgent need for quick discussions which introduce real competition <e> <s> nothing less will do in our view <e>", "<cs> my lords i well remember what the noble lord lord underhill asked me on both occasions <e> <s> there was a general discussion but we must proceed with competition and co-ordination at the same time <e> <s> we cannot do one without the other as the noble lord said <e> <s> but competition is the most important first step <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we shall have to wait and see what happens on th march <e> <s> my understanding is that the commission are taking matters a stage further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the preface to his question <e> <s> as the house will realise i cannot give detailed answers on many points relating to security but there is going to be a tightening up in the procedure of employment at airports <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be right for me to comment but i shall pass on the remarks of the noble lord to my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are in regular touch with the airports authority <e> <s> as the house will probably like to know there are more than staff who need to go airside and therefore it is probably impracticable to vet them all <e> <s> but there is increased vigilance to make sure that such things as addresses correspond with names <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the solution is to rid the world of terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to baggage since september airlines have been legally required to reconcile passengers boarding their aircraft with hold baggage with those passengers who have checked in so there has been a stricter control on baggage as from september last year <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that some baggage will have to be taken on board provided that is carefully screened and can be checked to passengers on board that aircraft i do not think the amount is so relevant when those precautions are taken <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are aware that other airports do have armed police <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier in reply to i think my noble friend lord campbell of croy we are tightening up and we shall continue to tighten up <e> <s> it is an extremely difficult area but we shall be vigilant in all respects <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords we shall continue the good progress that the dutch are making <e>", "<cs> my lords the italians and the greeks have been rather slow to realise the benefits of a liberal market but we are exerting pressure from this country and the commission is doing so as well <e>", "<cs> my lords what i mean by real reform is lower prices that are advantageous to the passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mention co-ordination because i knew that the noble lord would do so <e> <s> i can only refer him to my answer on rd january <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very good question but it does not relate to the original question <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a separate question we shall seek to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble lords support for the governments hope of getting an ec policy <e> <s> i hope that he will use every endeavour to make sure that his friends in europe follow him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the number that are registered nor whether they have to be registered <e> <s> some are entirely portable and do not need to be registered as i understand

throughput is about half a million <e> <s> we are not reluctant to give information about stansted <e> <s> the noble baroness and the house will be aware that any project of the size of stansted is bound to be loss-making initially before it gets into full gear <e> <s> i do not think that this will affect regional airports <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness disputes the figures that my department have given me and notes that i wrote to her <e> <s> i can only stand by what my department give me <e> <s> they say on present traffic flow that the capacity of stansted is million <e>",

house that there are not european regulations as such <e> <s> each individual country has different regulations <e> <s> i think that until there is harmonisation there seems to be no demand in europe

delighted to hear that <e> <s> i think that the point of local authority and other support for local lines takes me on to the question of the heritage and the maintenance of the line a point made

extracts from the white paper <e> <s> she was indeed quite correct in saying that at that time the estimated capacity of stansted was million passengers per annum <e> <s> as i said in my reply to the noble baroness on her earlier question which again was correct on present traffic flow the capacity is million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for saying that she will now table the written question <e> <s> no my lords i do not think the words are meaningless at all <e> <s> it is on the present flow which has become increasingly peaky <e> <s> perhaps i may inform the

reason when japan and boeing engineers were working on the plane <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fair to say that i cannot be more explicit <e> <s> this is a matter dealt with on an international basis between the country of origin of the plane and the operator <e> <s> the members who are signatories to that undertaking have behaved to my knowledge responsibly in the past and i understand are behaving responsibly in this instance <e> <s> i do not however have figures to help the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a matter i believe for the country of origin and the aircrafts engineers <e> <s> when one is dealing with specialised aircraft of this nature it is common for the engineers from the country of origin to be present to supervise repairs and maintenance <e> <s> if they are not made welcome it soon becomes known that the member state concerned is not fulfilling its obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be an extremely difficult task to supervise every user country when one bears in mind that such cracks as have been discovered are likely to occur within the structural stability of a plane <e> <s> if one was to follow this up for every single minute crack that occurs in all planes but is not to the detriment of safety we would be taking the matter to an extreme <e> <s> if a member state of the international organisation does not fufil its obligations this soon becomes widely apparent <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope very much that the transport costs will be reduced <e> <s> we are in fact doubling the opportunities for british exporters <e> <s> they are at the moment limited to air and ferry traffic <e> <s> by permitting the channel tunnel we shall also be allowing road/rail traffic and pure rail traffic <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we have touched upon this matter before in debates in your lordships house <e> <s> where british rail and other forms of transport see advantages in using the whole country i am sure that they will do so on a commercially justifiable basis <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that with this governments help to industry it will be the exports that matter <e> <s> i am sure that british companies will rise to the opportunities that we can offer them <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the ports themselves there is bound to be some effect i think on the short sea crossings in the channel area <e> <s> we believe however that the long-term effect on ports more distant from the channel tunnel will not be as great as some people anticipate <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that by building the channel tunnel we will offer four different opportunities for our exporters <e> <s> the competition generated by four different forms of transport can only be for the benefit of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right when he stresses the importance of rail traffic going through the tunnel <e> <s> as my noble friend lord jellicoe chairman of the british overseas trade board said this morning western europe is by far the largest market for our exports and accounts for something like per cent <e> <s> of our total world exports or billion <e> <s> i understand that the british overseas trade board feels that the channel tunnel will assist our exporters <e> <s> the noble lord is right in what he says about the new opportunities for rail <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that it is right for the potential investors to be offered the assessment of likely traffic and costs by those undertaking work on the tunnel and not by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords it might have been helpful but as the noble lord will appreciate it would have been wrong to release a lot of commercially confidential information contained in the assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords much has yet to be decided and british rail together with potential concessionaires are giving urgent consideration to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the noble lord correctly <e> <s> however i think that even he would appreciate that a lot of this stuff was commercial and therefore confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is perhaps more optimistic than i am <e> <s> i think that if we had had any more reports we might not have had the opportunities facing us at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the company goes on to the stock exchange is up to the company and not up to the government but i can confirm that my noble friend is right because the consortiums articles of association prevent it from going public before at the earliest <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i disagree with the noble lord on a fundamental point <e> <s> it is not necessarily the same workforce because the numbers have increased since nfc was privatised <e> <s> before that the numbers were going down <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to reach agreement within the council and by voluntary means <e> <s> as the house will know because i have said it before at the moment we have the dutch presidency to be followed by our own and if we do not make significant progress by the end of the year we shall probably have to resort to other means to get liberalisation of the air market <e>", "<cs> my lords we are making a little progress in creating a more realistic attitude among our friends in europe <e> <s> but notwithstanding the progress that we are trying to make in brussels we have recently secured italian agreement to the introduction of a new service to milan by british caledonian and i am pleased to be able to tell the house that we have recently secured spanish approval for new routes mostly from regional airports in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i think a repetitive question deserves a repetitive reply <e> <s> government policy remains consistent with what i said before <e>", "<cs> my lords that indeed is one option <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed we shall do our best to secure agreement when we are president of the council <e> <s> if we fail in our attempts we shall try by every other means possible to liberalise the air market of which one means is certainly going to the european court <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that waiting at any station bus underground or rail is a pretty uncomfortable experience <e> <s> i can tell the house and my noble friend that since the average waiting times for high-frequency services have shown no deterioration and that punctuality on timetabled services for the last quarter of showed an improvement on the previous years figures <e>", "<cs> my lords with the improvement in the services as the noble lord will be aware lrt in their report for said that they had had their busiest year ever on the underground with passenger miles up to an all-time high <e> <s> i hope that he is assured that the management is doing all it can to bring the service up to a better standard than it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot recall the situation either before or during the war but if that is a specific point i hope that my noble friend will take it up directly with london regional transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill fulfils the commitments to legislation that the government made in the airports policy white paper which was published last june <e> <s> its purpose is to establish a framework for the uk airport industry to take it into the s and beyond <e>", "<cs> my lords as i expected this has been a very interesting and constructive debate and at the start of my closing remarks i should like to give an assurance that i shall study with great care all that has been said this afternoon <e> <s> i fear that i shall not be able to answer everybodys questions <e> <s> the noble baroness lady burton of coventry asked me five questions <e> <s> i think that there are speakers on the list and if i spent one minute on each i believe that i would wear the houses patience <e> <s> no doubt at the committee stage we shall return to the detailed points that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords is the number for the airports <e> <s> the number of concessionaires or licensees may be different <e> <s> the noble lord must not confuse this in his mind <e> <s> if one looks at the list of airports and their turnover one will find that the million figure is a logical target and cut-off point <e> <s> wherever one draws a cut-off point in these discussions and we have been through this before there are always arguments on both sides <e> <s> however we believe that the million figure is about right <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot remember exactly i do not have it with me <e> <s> perhaps i may deal with this with the noble baroness <e> <s> i know that she raised it when we came to the white paper debate but as i have quite a lot to get through may i leave it there for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i said i would do and i shall <e> <s> the second runway would cause serious environmental problems in the area and would entail extremely high costs of construction <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness pre-empts me i was going on to say that i further understand that it is routine for a private bill in such circumstances to appear on the order paper in the rather repetitive but amusing way that the noble baroness described <e> <s> but i go back to the point that it being a private bill it is up to the chairman of ways and means in another place to arrange for a time for further debate <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case it will operate as a separate company within the london hub of the three london baa airports <e> <s> on a general point of the noble lord lord dean if passengers want to come to the south-east and there is no provision for them to come to the south-east they will as several noble lords and in particular my noble friend lord campbell of croy said invariably go to european airports <e> <s> that is from where the competition comes as much to the south-east as it does to manchester <e> <s> on manchester it is worth bearing in mind that there has been a substantial growth under this government in passengers at manchester from million in to million in <e> <s> the number of points served from <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i covered the general gist of that question <e> <s> i am sorry if i did not answer my noble friend in detail <e> <s> i think perhaps that is one point of detail to which we should come back on committee <e> <s> i look forward then to resuming the discussion with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness raises a number of points which she also raised on monday st april <e> <s> my reply to her rather amusing repetitive account about a private bill is that it is not a government bill <e> <s> the rail connection to stansted is a matter for a private bill and it is common for it to be put down on the order paper weekly <e> <s> a decision as to when it should be heard in another place is up to the chairman of ways and means and not to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not be heard tonight because the chairman of ways and means not the government is the person responsible for selecting when the second reading should continue <e> <s> as the noble baroness will understand the rail link has two parts to it <e> <s> it has the investment part which we are considering and it has the statutory part which has to go through both houses of parliament <e> <s> that at the moment is in another place <e> <s> a number of points were raised on the statutory part and these are being considered by british rail with certain people in the locality and with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have certainly tried to explain to the noble baroness and to the house british rail is pursuing its application <e> <s> as i said a number of points have been raised since second reading and at second reading in another place <e> <s> these affect the investment appraisal and we are discussing it with british rail <e> <s> i think it is proceeding as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> yes it is the governments policy that a rail link is a desirable feature of the development of stansted but on the condition that it is economically viable in accordance with the usual terms <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said i am not conversant with procedure in another place and therefore i shall not comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the house that we wish the matter to proceed as speedily as possible and we are awaiting further discussions with british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff asks me a question which he asked me earlier in the year <e> <s> the future of stansted does not depend on a rail link <e> <s> similarly there is no rail link to heathrow at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that the government wish to proceed with the rail link provided that it is economically viable within the terms <e> <s> as a result of the second reading in another place a number of points were raised which affect the appraisal and therefore we are still considering it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right to remind the house of the underground rail link <e> <s> the noble baronesss question referred to a british rail link so that is why i answered as i did <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all like stansted to become the successful airport which it can become <e> <s> it does not necessarily depend on having a rail link <e> <s> it would be a tremendous advantage if it did but the rail link has to be financially justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there are a number of people who do not want a lot of good things to happen <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> having had long discussions in this house with the noble lord lord alport i realise that he comes from essex <e>", "<cs> in moving that the house do now resume i suggest that we do not return to further consideration of the gas bill until five minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware there are two different operators <e> <s> london regional transport operates the underground service to heathrow and british rail operates the service to gatwick <e> <s> therefore it is not surprising that one has a slightly different price structure together with the fact that they are at different mileage points from the centre of london <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his reference to the success of the gatwick british rail link <e> <s> i used it recently and i found it very efficient <e> <s> i do not have the precise figures but i understand that about per cent <e> <s> of the passengers use this mode of transport <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the case as i understand it but i am advised in fact i have found out myself that it is possible to do that with other destinations by using saver fares and other such benefits offered by british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is special to gatwick <e> <s> indeed i have had experience of being able to buy a ticket to a destination further down the line than the stop to which i wanted to go for considerably less money <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that it is the responsibility of the operators but as the noble lord will be aware my right honourable friend the secretary of state set out guidelines for both lrt and british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only concur with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of airports in the north was discussed fairly fully last monday on the second reading of the airports bill <e> <s> with due respect to the noble lord it is not entirely relevant to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the managers responsible at british rail will note my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords if my memory serves me aright i had the help of a porter quite recently at victoria but i shall check on the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asked her question of her majestys government and it was indeed her majestys government who replied <e> <s> with regard to the judgment of the european court yesterday it is very <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed pass on the compliments of the noble lord to my noble friend <e> <s> but we hope that we shall be able to succeed where my noble friend has not by negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government asked for the report <e> <s> the comments and recommendations to a large extent support the governments policy <e> <s> we have therefore not considered it necessary to issue a further green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with my noble friends the leader of the house and the chief whip beside me i can do no more than remind them of the request of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that the garage is closing because it lost six out of its seven routes following competitive tendering by lrt and the essex county council <e> <s> what is going to happen to the staff is of course a matter for london buses limited <e> <s> i understand that they have held discussions with staff representatives <e> <s> we also understand that lbl are offering to move staff to suitable vacancies at other garages and are offering voluntary severance on terms which are much more favourable than the legal minimum to those who prefer to leave <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords last point <e> <s> it is solely because the bus service is so bad that we introduced the transport act last year to improve matters <e>", "<cs> my lords let me rise straightaway to pay a sincere tribute in which i am sure the whole house will wish to join to the valuable work of my noble friend lord rochdale and his colleagues <e> <s> i am sure i can speak for the house as a whole in saying how indebted to them we all are for the careful and thorough study they have made and the valuable report they have produced <e> <s> i am particularly grateful because this has certainly been a tremendous help to me in my job <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may be permitted to respond to some of the points put to the government during the course of the debate <e> <s> we have certainly had a useful debate and a thorough one ranging rather more widely than simply covering the select committees report <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord rochdale and his colleagues feel very pleased that they have stimulated so much interest in the house and indeed to stimulate a speech of such excellent quality from my noble friend lord strathclyde is something on its own <e> <s> i too should like to offer him congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say there was no evidence <e> <s> i said that there was a lack of hard evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the report more than once but i shall be happy to look at it again and discuss it with the noble lord at any time <e> <s> the noble lord lord shackleton and the noble viscount lord bledisloe mentioned lights and particularly the role of trinity house the northern lights board and the commission for irish lights <e> <s> we are at the moment progressing with two new studies one on the future use of lights particularly bearing in mind the new satellite communications systems that will be available in the next three or four years and the other on whether the existing distribution of light dues is a fair one <e> <s> we are making progress on both those fronts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is hasty tonight <e> <s> perhaps he wants me to finish in a hurry but i was coming to his point in a minute <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to receiving the information of the noble lord <e> <s> i shall do my best to satisfy him on these points and i think it probably is the right way to proceed if he agrees with that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it there are a number of unidentified aircraft that come up on the screen but when these aircraft are identified it is then determined whether or not they are gliders <e> <s> there are in the reports a breakdown between the gliders which sometimes can be motorised in which case the british gliding association say they are not gliders because they are motorised or civil aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton will know it is sometimes extremely difficult to pick up a glider on a radar or to see it visually against a cloud background because of its design and natural colour <e>", "<cs> if the committee will permit me a preamble as it did the noble lord lord underhill i should like to thank the noble lord for his kindness and his constructive attitude <e> <s> i remember from my days on the cross-benches before joining this party that i sometimes found it frustrating when the government did not accept amendments that i had tabled <e> <s> afterwards when the dust had settled i realised that i was trying to put into reverse the vehicle that the government were moving in a particular direction <e> <s> it was therefore not surprising that they would not accept the amendments <e> <s> however i shall listen carefully <e> <s> any constructive amendment that takes us forward will of course be considered with the utmost care <e>", "<cs> there is also the argument that some people are very alarmed that the government still retain too much power <e> <s> the noble baroness went on to say that the government should subsidise any other airport as well <e> <s> it is pleasing to see the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal here <e> <s> she will know better than i of the recent developments at birmingham where the government paid some million in subsidy <e> <s> i hope that this answers the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> she went on to refer to that lovely example of hers the br stansted bill <e> <s> she gave the reply that i was going to give <e> <s> it is a private bill <e> <s> it is therefore not for the government to say when it is debated <e> <s> the noble baroness will know from her experience that the normal procedure in another place far be it from me to comment on the procedure in another place is that it goes down weekly <e>", "<cs> yes and what the noble baroness says takes me on to the point made by my noble friend lord broxbourne <e> <s> it was because of this potential over-development at stansted that my right honourable friend the secretary of state set out in the white paper agreed by parliament that the development of stansted cannot go above eight million although it has the potential to go up to million without further parliamentary consent <e> <s> it has to come back to another place and to this house if larger development is to be permitted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may state at the beginning that the government as has been said so often from this dispatch box welcome the development of employee involvement in the industries in which they work <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord auckland will be aware we believe that this should be voluntary and thus we are opposed to prescriptive legislation in this area because this would be detrimental to the spirit of harmony and cooperation necessary for employee involvement to be truly effective as was clearly pointed out by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> i did not say duplicated i said along the lines of <e> <s> as we have not finalised our proposals we should of course welcome the noble lords input into it <e> <s> i am sure that many employees regardless of what scheme we propose will choose to purchase a substantial holding in the privatised baa recognising its potential for growth and profitability in the private sector <e> <s> but this is not something that we believe we should legislate on and attempt to impose an arbitrary level of employee ownership <e> <s> indeed it is not at all clear how in practice we could achieve this <e> <s> presumably shares would have to be given free to employees with some bar on their resale or else further shares would have to be given to maintain the per cent <e> <s> level when employees sell some of their holdings as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter pointed out and whether or not it is in a trust <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord interrupted me i was saying that it was in regard to trusts <e> <s> i do not think it makes that amount of difference because the trustees themselves have certain duties <e> <s> if they feel that the shares ought to be sold for the benefit of those participants of the trust and they are under a bar not to sell them they have certain difficulties as i envisage it in trying to achieve the best for their members <e>", "<cs> of course i will <e> <s> i think it would be helpful if the noble lord would like to enlarge on his remarks perhaps not now but by <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord and at this stage i welcome his taking up the batting for the opposition <e> <s> is he also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> so far this has been a classic house of lords debate <e> <s> in minutes we have had six speakers who have each put over the points that they wanted to make very punchily <e> <s> i think it shows that a short speech is more effective than a long verbose one because one tends to lose the point <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to this debate because i am under absolutely no illusions as to how seriously your lordships take this matter <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state and i were discussing it this morning and we both agreed that the debate today would play an invaluable part in helping us to make up our minds on the final thoughts about it <e>", "<cs> i hope i shall come on to that point in due course <e> <s> airports would only be of value to the investor when used for the purpose for which they are intended to provide a service for airlines and their customers <e> <s> if a certain section of shareholders run down that airport the noble lord lord williams has just reminded me of the point made by my noble friend it is investing money to no great degree of remuneration which would cost it dear <e>", "<cs> i hope that it will be before report stage <e>", "<cs> i am not sure about that but i hope that if it is announced before report stage it will <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the extra contribution of the noble lord lord sefton of garston <e> <s> i was delighted to be taken back to the shipping world for a moment and to the liverpool docks and harbour board <e>", "<cs> i do have something to do with the shipping in liverpool and quite a lot to do with liverpool docks at the moment as i hope the noble lord is aware <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is tempting me into a long shipping debate <e> <s> i am delighted to be <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord does not choose to divide the committee <e> <s> i want to study everything that has been said today <e> <s> i cannot over-emphasise that point <e> <s> the matter is seriously under discussion in my department at the moment <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state the minister for aviation and myself were discussing the matter only this morning <e> <s> with due respect to the noble lord it would not be beneficial to divide the committee now <e> <s> at a later stage that might be the right thing to do but i hope that the noble lord will not choose to do so while we are still formulating our final thoughts <e>", "<cs> i am happy to give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> we have never sought to hide from parliament or the public the facts about our privatisation programme <e> <s> the reason for that is that we are very proud of our policy a policy that is giving freedom and incentives to the managements of some of our greatest industries to go out and compete with the rest of the world <e> <s> noble lords can be assured that we will continue to proclaim our success <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for his explanation of this amendment <e> <s> i originally thought that it would be grouped with amendment no <e> <s> but when i heard that this was not the case i thought that there must be something devilishly subtle about it and that some labour party ploy was in view but i am glad that it is not <e>", "<cs> perhaps with lord williams no perhaps with lord graham yes we do not know <e> <s> of course i shall take it back and look at it because it relates to what i said on amendment no <e> <s> and i think it would be wrong to take up the time of the committee now in going back over what i have already said <e>", "<cs> i thought that the liberals were quite happy to lend their name to anything which was a nasty ploy <e>", "<cs> the noble lord expresses concern that by writing off the baas debts we seem to be indulging in a give-away of public money to a shortly-to-be-privatised company <e> <s> i can assure him that this will not be the case <e> <s> the debts in question are those of the baa to the national loans fund <e> <s> as the noble lord said those totalled about million in fact i have a figure of million as at th september which is a small proportion of the baas total value <e> <s> the national loans fund is the government fund which is used for making loans to all nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that helpful intervention which allows me to reiterate that i was referring to clause rather than to clause because the matter has to go to the holding company first <e>", "<cs> at this stage i cannot give the noble lord an answer <e> <s> i do not think that we have finalised our thoughts on the matter purely because it is too far away from the appointed day when these <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill said baa provides a generous pension scheme for its employees <e> <s> pensions which are index <e>", "<cs> these new clauses would impose upon the baas successor company and its subsidiaries requirements that would exceed those placed on any other private sector company or for that matter any employers in the public sector <e> <s> the agreement of all recognised unions would be required before the introduction of any change in employees terms and conditions that might include some element unfavourable to their members <e> <s> i do not believe with due respect that the noble lord lord carmichael has made a case for putting this group of employees in a privileged position one of having statutory protection against changes in their terms of employment additional to those existing for other employees <e> <s> they will have like other employees the protection of the employment protection consolidation act against any unilateral change in their terms of employment that amounts to a constructive unfair dismissal <e>", "<cs> as the bill is drafted a passenger transport authority owning an airport may at the direction of my right honourable friend the secretary of state form an airport company and transfer to it following approval of a scheme the assets of the airport <e> <s> but it may not hold shares in that company or do any of the other things which a principal council may do in respect of an airport <e> <s> this was a quite deliberate decision taken by my right honourable friend because the government did not see ptas as an appropriate body to hold shares in an airport to deal in such shares to provide certain services to an airport to make loans to it and the other things which principal councils are enabled to do under clauses to of the bill <e> <s> we believe that public sector shareholdings in the public airport companies should be held by directly elected bodies rather than indirectly elected ones <e> <s> the proposed amendment would reverse that policy <e>", "<cs> i thought i had given that answer <e> <s> i apologise to noble lords opposite if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> it was obviously my fault <e> <s> may i try once more <e> <s> clause defined principal council for the purposes of part ii <e> <s> the definition omits passenger transport authorities <e> <s> however clause effectively brings the ptas within the definition for the purposes of clauses and only that is the formation of a company and the transfer of assets <e>", "<cs> i accept the noble lords offer with alacrity <e> <s> i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> perhaps i had better put a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> the effect of the proposed amendment would be to require consultation before my right honourable friend the secretary of state can issue directions to principal councils to form airport companies <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has said that the timetable was tight <e> <s> although tight we believe it to be a practical one <e> <s> i agree when the noble lord lord underhill says that i would consider this amendment to be unnecessary <e> <s> clause already provides that my right honourable friend may revoke any direction given under subsection at any time before a company is formed <e> <s> thus if a principal council is convinced that the formation of a company is unnecessary and is able to persuade my right honourable friend that that is so any direction already given may be revoked <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble lord is correct in suggesting that it would be the local district councils <e>", "<cs> i might not be able to go as far as saying that it is a sensible amendment <e> <s> of course i will look at it <e> <s> the noble lord can be assured that i shall <e> <s> i cannot guarantee that i shall come forward with an amendment at report stage <e> <s> i shall look at this if that is helpful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> as clause is at present drafted airports are within the scope of the million criterion <e> <s> the proposed amendment if put into effect would we believe exclude from the provisions of clauses and six airports not seven <e> <s> i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> we believe that the six excluded are blackpool bournemouth exeter humberside norwich and southend <e> <s> as i understood it the noble lord lord underhill believed that liverpool would also be excluded <e> <s> however looking at the latest figures i have available the passengers going through the terminals at liverpool were and with a turnover estimated of million i believe that it would be caught even by the scheme of the noble lord <e> <s> does he have different figures from me <e> <s> i do not want to get into too much detail at this point <e>", "<cs> that alone highlights the problem which i mentioned at second reading that wherever one draws the line one has a problem <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not say all local authorities i was very specific in saying a politically dominated local authority <e>", "<cs> the definition which these amendments seek to change is important because it sets out what must be included in the threshold criterion which in turn determines which local authorities shall be required to form airport companies <e> <s> we selected annual turnover because all things considered it was the best indicator available of airport activity <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be helpful if i said another quick word here without delaying the committee <e> <s> it is the governments intention that when the local authority airport companies are set up they will be viable enterprises <e> <s> we do not foresee the situation where we are creating an entity purely for it to go down <e> <s> that would be entirely wrong and that is contrary to what we propose <e>", "<cs> it is a flexible provision which is normally written in <e> <s> i think the provision <e>", "<cs> i should refer the noble lord to clause <e> <s> the first part of the sentence reads <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord foot was absolutely right in the first part of his statement which concerned the flexibility of the secretary of state <e> <s> as the bill proceeds through both houses of parliament and it becomes clearer it is easier for the secretary of state to make the decision with regard to exeter <e> <s> we shall be issuing guidance shortly <e> <s> we are in consultation with devon county council <e> <s> all i can usefully add at this stage is that we hope it will not be too long before the decisions are made on this <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am confused <e> <s> i had hoped my noble friend would have elucidated the amendments for me but i fear i am even more confused than i was before <e> <s> i do not think the scenario he painted was the correct one <e> <s> the direction in clause to form a company is before such date as specified in that direction <e> <s> clause does not create <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord williams and i am sorry if i appear to be stupid <e> <s> i will try not to be but i think the confusion has arisen because my advice conflicts with what the noble lord has said and with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> to our minds the words which it do not restrict the local authorities <e> <s> i should like to look at this again <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend would see fit to withdraw his amendment and i will discuss it with him <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord underhill will clarify whether he would like me to speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and and deal with all the amendments including amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill as at present drafted requires principal councils when preparing schemes for the transfer of aerodrome assets to airport companies to take into account any advice given by my right honourable friend the secretary of state as to provisions that he regards as appropriate for inclusion in transfer schemes <e> <s> the purpose of this provision is to ensure that schemes properly reflect government policy on the establishment of airport companies and that policy is simply the setting up of companies which can operate in an efficient commercial manner <e>", "<cs> indeed i shall come to it in a moment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart does not like it either <e> <s> principal councils would be required to take into account the provisions which any or all of these organisations regarded as appropriate <e> <s> it is quite clear that the interests of airports and airlines will differ on a number of points <e> <s> indeed it is probable that the interests and advice of individual airports will differ from each other and likewise with airlines <e>", "<cs> i think it may be helpful at this stage if i explain briefly how we propose to consult on the guidance to be given to local authorities on transfer schemes <e> <s> my department plans to issue draft guidance later this month to local authority associations and airports <e> <s> we would not issue final guidance under clause of the bill of course until <e>", "<cs> i have taken the amendment seriously <e> <s> i fully understand why the noble lord lord underhill saw fit to table it <e> <s> the government are anxious to ensure that the conditions of employment of local authority employees who become airport company employees are not prejudiced <e> <s> the conditions of the employees who would be transferred are except for pensions already protected under the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations and can suffer no diminution <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord <e> <s> lord dean talking about pensions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining his point further <e> <s> i think he is mistaken <e> <s> if a local authority which controls per cent <e> <s> of the shares of the local airport company wishes to seek private finance it does not have to sell per cent <e> <s> of the shares to achieve that aim <e> <s> as well as receiving money from the local authority it can receive money from the private market <e>", "<cs> i made it in the light of my knowledge of the bill <e> <s> i am ready to be corrected by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that we are not forcing local authorities to sell per cent <e> <s> it is entirely up to them if they wish to do so <e> <s> obviously they will not have some of the benefits that they have with the backing of the local authority if the controlling interest in the airport is sold but they will obtain a lot of the benefits of the private sector <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the situation is any different from the present one <e>", "<cs> i would turn it round the other way and say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state is most unlikely to accept a scheme that excludes the employees from the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations under which they can suffer no diminution <e>", "<cs> i realise the importance of these amendments the one in the names of the noble lord lord tordoff lord underhill and lord carmichael of kelvingrove and amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord dudley <e> <s> these amendments seem to have the main purpose of ensuring that the new airport companies take on the full liabilities connected to any assets which are transferred to them or vice-versa that any liabilities are accompanied by matching assets <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the interventions of my noble friend lord butterworth and the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> i think that they only serve to underline that we should all take this matter away and look at it again which i promised to do earlier when speaking directly to the amendments <e> <s> i hope that we can achieve a situation that will satisfy my noble friend lord butterworth which coincides with our thinking that we want to set up viable companies with a continuing prospect of viability and to look at each transfer scheme on its merits and take into account the financial arguments put forward by each local authority <e>", "<cs> i think it will depend upon the scheme put forward by the local authority to cover the noble baronesss point <e> <s> it will vary from scheme to scheme <e> <s> however this is another point i should like to look at in more detail tomorrow <e>", "<cs> with due respect i thought i had covered that when i said that when considering each individual transfer scheme we would take into account the financial arguments put forward by the local authorities and doubtless the points advanced by the noble lord lord tordoff would be exactly the sort of financial arguments put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the house appreciates my noble friends concern for spare tyres and that was very visible before easter <e> <s> we are satisfied that using a temporary-use spare whether of crossply or radial construction is safe up to a maximum proposed speed limit of miles per hour <e> <s> tests conducted by the trrl included tyres of different construction <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware those temporary-use spare tyres have been used for a long time in europe and in america without detriment <e> <s> as to the precise definition of a short distance because it is a temporary-use spare it is designed to enable motorists to reach either home or a competent repairer <e> <s> as i understand the position the tyre can be used without detriment as long as the tread remains legal <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulation requires a warning notice to be displayed on the temporary-use wheel and instructions given in the owners manual <e> <s> i believe that that together with the fact that the wheel has to be of a different colour will remind any user of the wheel of that necessity <e>", "<cs> my lords although we welcome the noble lord to the highlands we all look forward to getting up to the highlands for some fresh air and away from the smog of london his position will be no different from that when he is using a traditional tyre provided he abides by the regulations and does not drive faster than miles an hour <e> <s> if the noble lord visits the highlands he will find that in most villages there are garages that will be able w look after him <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some countries in europe that have faster speed limits than this country and they are happy to use those tyres <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff for their welcome of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> that is a more accurate description <e> <s> that is what i was trying to say <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond now to the noble lord lord dean of beswick and clarify the point about doncaster <e> <s> the existing work is declining as the noble lord knows and as the house knows <e> <s> however there are three facilities that will be located there <e> <s> one is the wagon building which <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail does want to make use of the very high skills of its work force wherever possible <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord saw fit to criticise brels efforts which have been of enormous success at shildon and horwich <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but as i was trying to point out the noble lord seemed to be criticising brels efforts in seeking to work with local development agencies because there would be too many of them <e> <s> i think that we need to give every support to brel for the management and the unions to work together with the local development agencies in this matter because i am sure that that is the right way forward <e> <s> with regard to privatisation as the noble lord will know that is a completely separate issue and british railways believe that the restructuring of brel is needed irrespective of the future ownership of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord marsh for those comments <e> <s> i think that there is a great deal of truth in them <e> <s> this is one of the problems of trying to achieve a modern railway with modern rolling stock inevitably alas it will lead to reconstruction <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the house an answer to that precise question of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i agree with his question one of his many earlier questions with regard to improved productivity by br and this is noticeable in an improving rail service <e> <s> i do not think that he can accuse this government of reducing the railways in any way whatsoever <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for asking the question so that i can explain the situation to the house <e> <s> at shildon so far jobs have been found and the potential is to rise to over the next two to three years <e> <s> at horwich the figure is jobs and the potential will rise to over the next two to three years <e> <s> unfortunately swindon was a late starter because i have to say with regret the unions did not talk to br who could therefore not talk to the local authorities <e> <s> however discussions are now under way <e> <s> at long last they have got their act together as it were and we are hopeful on this front too <e> <s> that is why i say that if the unions and management can get together as soon as possible and talk to the local authorities and the local development agencies we may hope for much quicker results <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that both the questions of my noble friend lady elliot of harwood are detailed matters for br and i shall be happy to make sure that they are passed on to them <e> <s> as a regular user of the railway the noble baroness will realise that there has been substantial capital investment which has led to new and better rolling stock and engines and that there has been no shortage of investment under this government <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect the noble lords comments bring us into a far wider ambit and concern the whole of british rail and the network rather than brel specifically <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the precise details for which the noble lord asks but i shall look into the matter for him <e>", "<cs> our discussion today continues somewhat that of last thursday and in particular our debates on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> during our discussion on those amendments i explained to the committee why i believed it would not be appropriate for the government to compensate authorities for the costs that were under discussion at the time <e> <s> i recognise however the very sincere argument put so ably by my noble friend lord dudley that some local authorities would face financial problems if we left all of the outstanding airport debt with local authorities rather than transferring it to the airport company <e> <s> i believe that this debt will be short-term but none the less a real problem <e> <s> but in the long-term our aim and the philosophy behind this bill is to improve the lot of the ratepayer and to improve the lot of the local airports <e> <s> i am happy to give an assurance to the committee that in considering local authorities proposals for the transfer of property rights and liabilities we will adopt a very flexible approach <e>", "<cs> i apologise to your lordships <e> <s> i meant to say that we will be sending out guidance in the not too distant future <e> <s> we have delayed sending out that guidance particularly to take account of what was said in committee last week and will be said today <e> <s> it will go out <e> <s> i hope to have something to report to the house at report stage as i gave a commitment on part i of the bill <e> <s> i hope that that is helpful to the noble lord lord tordoff <e>", "<cs> the proposed amendment which would effectively require that employees of airport companies remain within the local government superannuation scheme even if the local authority concerned sells it to a private sector buyer is i have to tell the committee fraught with problems <e> <s> perhaps the best example is that the lgss receives favourable tax treatment on its investment income from the us tax authorities that is on such investment in the us <e> <s> if it were to be a requirement of our legislation that an airport company should remain within the lgss even if and when it becomes a private sector company then we could expect the privileged status of the lgss in relation to its us investments to be prejudiced <e>", "<cs> i believe that i have heard that argument before from the noble lord lord tordoff <e>", "<cs> in response to the noble lord lord williams of elvel i may say that the flexibility created by clause is better than the rather stricter regime of his amendment <e> <s> i believe that it might be better if i were to seek a little more advice on this matter and were to return to it when we come to discuss clause <e> <s> if the noble lord is happy that i <e>", "<cs> i hope i shall be fully prepared to counter the arguments of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i have to come down on the side of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i think he is absolutely right in this matter <e> <s> indeed if it is a consolation to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and lord williams of elvel there is nothing in the legislation that would inhibit the appointment of employee representatives or indeed financial interest representatives <e>", "<cs> it would be quite wrong of me to say to the committee that i will not look at this matter again <e> <s> of course i will if the noble lord lord carmichael wishes me to do so <e> <s> however i fear that my answer will be exactly the same as i have already given and encapsulated by the noble lord lord harris that it will be as objectionable to us in its amended form as it is now <e> <s> i cannot therefore hold out any hope to the noble lord <e> <s> i will look at it but my argument will be exactly the same and we shall be in the same position on report as we are now <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill said clause will provide a rather more liberal regime than its counterpart in the transport act <e> <s> it is for that reason i have dubbed this amendment the oliver amendment having given the labour party something they say please sir can we have some more <e>", "<cs> the distinction lies in our belief that it is better for the airports and the future of the airport industry to be at arms length from the council <e> <s> therefore with the local authorities still retaining a majority or a per cent <e> <s> shareholding the more arms length it is the better because there will be conflicts of interest and it is best to avoid any possibility of that by the bill as it now stands <e>", "<cs> yes but they also have the other duty of the council and that is the conflict that we are trying to avoid <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i have not come up to the high standards that the noble lord lord harris requires of me <e> <s> i think that we have looked at this matter very seriously in the past <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord underhill said my honourable friend mr ancram in another place took it away and looked at it at that stage <e> <s> i think it would be wrong to mislead the committee and say that i could come back with something at report stage <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord lord carmichael i shall of course look at this point as i look at every amendment and every discussion that we have but the reason that the bill is phrased in its present terms is because we took on board the points that the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff made on the transport bill and therefore we extended the provision to make it more liberal than the transport act and as a consequence deleted the dispensation <e> <s> i do not think that i can go any further at this stage <e>", "<cs> we have tried to establish a clear arms length relationship between the public airport companies and their local authority shareholders as the noble lord lord tordoff has acknowledged <e> <s> various provisions in the bill are directed towards this important objective <e> <s> we have recognised that a companys interests and those of the local authority owners may not always coincide for example on the provision of services to public airport companies by local authorities <e> <s> we believe that the company secretary and indeed any of the other employees of the airport companies should always put the companys interest first <e> <s> they should not be subject to conflicts of interest or put in a position where however honourably they act they would be open to suspicion that they had favoured one particular authority against another or against an outside interest not because of the companys interest but because of the interest of the local authority that employs them <e> <s> that is the situation that we are trying to avoid <e> <s> it comes back to the argument that i have just made we want to create an arms length independent company with the minimum of conflict of interest <e>", "<cs> with regard to the last point made by the noble lord lord carmichael i do not believe that there is any difference in our thought <e> <s> i do not wish to pre-empt discussion on clause but as soon as a local authority has sold per cent <e> <s> or more the airport will not be subject to local government finance <e> <s> we shall however be going into that matter in detail <e> <s> the consistency is there to create an arms length company <e> <s> should the local authority shareholders then decide to sell per cent <e> <s> or more the airport comes outside local government finance control <e> <s> that is an entirely logical sequence <e>", "<cs> the main purpose of this amendment as so ably put by the noble lord lord williams of elvel is to allow public airport companies to obtain private capital without that financing counting against the controlling authoritys capital allocation <e> <s> instead the company would have to obtain specific borrowing consent from the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord dean of beswick in that recent additional short speech has highlighted what a good thing this bill is <e> <s> we are making public airport companies so that they can go to the market to seek private finance <e> <s> he has quoted figures from manchester <e> <s> the fact that the company will still be local-authority owned does not in any way prevent it from seeking private capital <e> <s> but it is entirely illogical for the reasons i stated earlier that so long as the local authority retains a controlling interest in a public airport company such finance should be taken in the overall context of local government finance which as the noble lord lord williams and other members of the committee know better than i is a complicated minefield in its own right <e>", "<cs> it would be wrong for me to go wider than discussing airports <e> <s> i know that under this government and the financial restraints that were <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is absolutely right in saying that we considered the possibility of putting down an amendment on this matter <e> <s> i think that he has raised a very valid point and i am grateful to him for putting down this amendment <e> <s> i am happy to accept it on behalf of the government and would recommend it to the committee as being a sensible and logical amendment <e> <s> i should like to say having accepted the principle of it and the amendment that i shall look closely at the wording to check that it agrees with parliamentary counsel which as the noble lord lord underhill will understand is the ruling voice on matters such as this <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord dudley for continuing our discussion on the philosophy of finances in regard to part of this bill and also for his very clear exposition of the reasons behind the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the contributions made by the noble lords lord carmichael and lord tordoff <e> <s> i think that it serves to highlight that we are doing the right thing by listening and then taking away matters for further consideration <e> <s> on this particular matter i do not think there could be found any fault on our part <e> <s> i thought it was wise to put our thoughts on the record at this stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to take this away and look at it because of the relationship and interplay in the whole thing <e> <s> i do not think that it would be useful for me to comment on a precedent without going back and looking at it in the office <e> <s> i am sorry if that is not as helpful as my noble friend would like but i think it is the right thing to do at this stage <e>", "<cs> if i may first reply to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i hope that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will make this statement in the week prior to report <e> <s> i understand that report is to be on th june and therefore the statement will be made in the week commencing nd june i hope in the early part of the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that they made the sacrifices <e> <s> they will receive the benefit and they have received the benefit <e> <s> manchester is the fastest growing airport in europe thanks to this government and our help to other regional airports such as newcastle has been well received <e> <s> i should not like to limit it to the ratepayer <e> <s> i should dearly like the ratepayer to take up shares but i think it should be made much wider <e> <s> i believe that the governments thrust on that is not so different from that of noble lords opposite <e> <s> but i am glad that they are coming along with our way of thinking on wider public share ownership <e> <s> if they can come all the way with us and open the whole thing up i am sure it will be to the benefit of everybody <e>", "<cs> may i just answer the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i shall in future try to resist the odd dig but i think it just helps to encourage noble lords along <e> <s> with regard to the specific point i understand that his concern is taken care of under subsection <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining his amendments to the committee <e> <s> perhaps it will be helpful if i start by offering a little background to clause <e> <s> the clause was added to the bill at report stage in another place largely in response to requests from opposition members in committee <e> <s> it follows very closely the corresponding section of the transport act <e> <s> it deals with compensation for loss or diminution of pension rights a sensitive issue to which the government have given much thought but i am glad to say one which we believe is unlikely to be an issue of substance <e> <s> nevertheless we have prepared for it <e>", "<cs> that may be the case i shall look into it <e>", "<cs> in regard to that direct question i cannot give the assurance the noble lord requires because security is so important that it must be done in the most efficient and the best way and i think it is something which should be left to the airports concerned <e> <s> i fully take the noble lords point about it but i believe that this is a matter in regard to which they must use their best resources or the best powers which they have available to make certain that this is carried out <e> <s> for that reason i cannot give the assurance the noble lord would like <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments particularly the first part to his speech relating to security <e> <s> as the committee will know the airports are acting under the aviation security act which was not so long ago discussed in terms by your lordships house <e>", "<cs> could i write to my noble friend on that detailed point <e>", "<cs> i think at this stage i shall have to rush to parliamentary counsel for advice <e> <s> i think the point which my noble friend makes is well taken <e>", "<cs> the first of these amendments would give the caa a duty to consult employees representative organisations at airports before advising the secretary of state on traffic distribution rules <e> <s> the second as the noble lord lord carmichael has just pointed out to us would require the caa to have regard to airport staff interests in giving advice under clauses to or in preparing a scheme to allocate capacity under clause <e>", "<cs> the world moves on and even whitehall is affected by it <e>", "<cs> we have had an extremely useful debate on these important amendments <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter with his great experience of the caa for his contribution <e> <s> he told the committee a point perhaps missed by the noble lord lord tordoff that if a consultative committee is useful the airport will wish to set one up <e> <s> i shall return to that point later <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monkswell is using the argument that i used at one stage of an agriculture bill <e> <s> i was persuaded by my noble friend lord belsted that i was wrong to take that view <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead was absolutely right <e> <s> there should be on the face of the bill a requisite number of people to be consulted <e> <s> that is the minimum consultation <e> <s> however to expand the list any further could lead us into severe difficulties <e>", "<cs> i take this amendment on its merits and will deal with it as such <e> <s> i hope to give the noble lord lord underhill three very convincing reasons why i regrettably from his point of view cannot accept it <e> <s> first the essence of traffic distribution rules is that they should apply when and where they are needed <e> <s> although the government have yet to make any decisions on such rules there is a clear possibility if rules are to be effective that they must operate at a detailed level <e> <s> clause indeed provides for detailed rules in the references to any class or description of air traffic <e> <s> the quite detailed level of discernment in traffic distribution rules which clause envisages is simply we believe not appropriate for a statutory instrument <e> <s> so that while i appreciate the motives of the noble lord i must tell him that a statutory instrument would be the wrong vehicle for enacting the rules made under this clause <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord begs leave to withdraw it perhaps i may clarify one point that he mentioned when he said it was felt that the consultation which the caa have just undertaken concerning the london distribution in the south-east did not involve the rest of the country <e> <s> the reason for that was that the remit was strictly limited to london and it would have been inappropriate therefore for them to have looked at air traffic distribution throughout the country <e> <s> however notwithstanding that they sought to consult very widely as i have explained and i think that all the points i have heard subsequent to the publication of the draft report only confirm that the caa consulted everybody beforehand <e>", "<cs> i shall not comment on the last point and i hope that the committee will understand the reasons why i shall not comment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord trefgarne is beside me <e> <s> he took part in the discussions and so i think it would be wrong for me to comment further <e> <s> the fact that passenger growth at busy airports can ultimately be limited by runway capacity is explicitly recognised in the bill in clause which restricts the application of the atm limit clause in line with the policy intention to those airports with substantially underused runways <e> <s> this seems entirely logical <e> <s> there can surely be no point in setting an atm limit at an airport the runway capacity of which is already substantially saturated unless of course the intention is to reduce rather than cap usage and that would create chaos because services would have to be cut to meet the reduced level of usage demanded by the limit <e>", "<cs> this new clause seeks to allow organisations independent of airport owners to provide extra terminal capacity <e> <s> such a provision is i believe most unlikely to be necessary and i also believe that it would be counter-productive <e> <s> my noble friends have made two claims on its behalf <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to add to those matters to which the caa must have regard in undertaking its functions under part iii of the bill <e> <s> the amendment would specifically write into the legislation the need for the caa to look to the interests of people who live near airports <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has highlighted some of the wide range of interests that might have to be taken into account if this amendment were written into the bill and the general environmental impact of airport operations <e>", "<cs> i am happy to tell my noble friend that i went shopping for my family last weekend <e> <s> we had a fairly comprehensive list <e> <s> when i staggered home rather tired on friday evening i added one or two more items <e> <s> yet when i reached the shop i found something that was badly needed was not on the list <e> <s> i return to my point that i do not think we can make a comprehensive list <e> <s> i hope that i have covered the point sufficiently for my noble friend to realise that our right honourable friend the secretary of state will take these matters into account there is the necessary provision for him to give the instructions to the caa and that we shall not lose sight of these and many other matters <e>", "<cs> i should like to join with the three noble lords who have spoken and i agree with them that we are discussing very important considerations <e> <s> at this stage i should like to pay a tribute to the air traffic controllers <e> <s> i went specifically not only to west drayton and heathrow but to some of the regional airports to look at what they do and i was very impressed by the work that they put in to keep our skies safe <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to expand upon the transparency provisions of clause yet clause <e>", "<cs> these amendments are aimed at ensuring that the price formula at designated airports sets minimum charges as well as maximum charges presumably with the intention of preventing predatory pricing <e> <s> however as the committee knows the government support this very intention <e> <s> the dangers of very low or below-cost charging have been recognised in the bill and indeed clause allows the caa to impose conditions to deal with predatory pricing <e> <s> we believe this is the best way to prevent or remedy such specific abuses that is to target on them when they occur <e>", "<cs> i was not clear what was desired to be achieved by the amendment with due respect to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> as drafted clause requires publication of an mmc report but first gives the opportunity to the secretary of state to require excisions from the report on grounds of public interest or commercial confidentiality <e> <s> this is a standard procedure for all mmc reports <e>", "<cs> i can be very brief on this amendment <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord dundee <e> <s> i have pleasure in accepting the amendment on behalf of the government and i commend it to the committee <e>", "<cs> this amendment relates to a small part of the laws on sunday trading <e> <s> the idea that a right reverend prelate might head off to some enchanted isle without his suntan lotion or aspirin fills me with horror <e> <s> seriously i do not consider that the amendment conflicts in any way with the decision taken in another place on the question of sunday trading as a whole <e> <s> the short speech of the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove in which he raised the point concerning protection for employees would possibly turn this into a debate on sunday shopping which it certainly is not and which we would seek to avoid <e>", "<cs> it is always pleasant to welcome a new voice into the committees proceedings even though at a late hour in our discussions <e> <s> it is good to have my noble friend on board joining in the committees proceedings but i hope i can convince him to get off board in his support for the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am happy to see any noble lord to discuss the bill and i should certainly welcome seeing my noble friend again <e>", "<cs> one of our main reasons for restructuring local authority airports is that we believe that under the present regime airports often pay too much for the services that they obtain from local authorities <e> <s> one of the consequences of making the airports into companies act companies is that the directors will be bound to act in the best interests of the company <e> <s> i emphasise in the best interests of the company not the shareholders <e> <s> this is a point about which my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter spoke at some length earlier <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will bear with me if i take a little longer than one would hope at this stage because this is an important point that the noble lord lord tordoff has raised <e> <s> if the committee were at an earlier hour in its discussions i know that other noble lords would wish to join in the debate <e>", "<cs> i think that as we are going to be without the very able services of the noble lord lord tordoff at a later stage at report stage i would hope we might find time to discuss this before he leaves for other parliamentary business and i should certainly like to consider this matter with him <e>", "<cs> i brought the noble lord lord williams to his feet i hoped i might <e> <s> i should very much like to discuss this with all those interested in this amendment <e> <s> that was hidden within what i said to the noble lord lord tordoff but i would certainly welcome discussion with the noble lords opposite as well <e>", "<cs> i do not have that information readily to hand but i can repeat what i said earlier which is that the government will continue to meet the additional operating costs of running vip facilities on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> if the definition of subsidiary in clause was deleted from the bill it would create doubt as to what was or was not a subsidiary <e> <s> so the matter might well go to the courts which might come to much the same conclusion and if so the amendment would thus be of little effect <e> <s> however we think that the definition puts the matter beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords the biggest example of investment in the north-east is the electrification of the east coast london to edinburgh main line at a total cost of about million <e> <s> it is the biggest single investment of british rail for years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have the figures available to answer the noble lord at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it would be helpful to have trains running between certain existing stations as well as new stations and this is exactly the policy that british rail are pursuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> i am aware of the significant improvements they underline that this government have approved per cent <e> <s> by value of investments submitted by british rail since taking office in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the present chairman has put in figures for what he thought he could get he has been satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a decision for british rail themselves rather than the government <e> <s> however if british rail come to the government and justify it on economic grounds i am sure that they will be given a receptive reply <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the likely value of orders as announced by eurotunnel and orders for major items of equipment placed by the channel tunnel group which is the uk arm of eurotunnel comes to about million that breaks down into million on construction equipment million on civil and building materials million on mechanical and electrical equipment and million on rolling stock and signalling <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> detailed discussion and detailed inquiry into the benefits and disadvantages of the tunnel have been undertaken by the government a white paper has been produced and the matter has been debated on more than one occasion in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there will be opportunities for construction workers in the kent area but as i indicated in my earlier answers there will be tremendous opportunity for those in the midlands the north and in scotland to benefit from this project <e>", "<cs> my lords the long-term employment opportunities that i mentioned in my original answer is a figure generated as a result of the construction of the channel tunnel and its operation <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly points out there will be some reduction in the labour force as a result of the possible effect on the ferries but we understand this will be overtaken by increased further opportunities in kent about the turn of the century <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> as he rightly says there are a lot of opportunities for those in the north-east and i hope we shall get tremendous support for this project from the workers there and also from those who work on the railways <e>", "<cs> my lords further housing land will be made available <e> <s> obviously there will be opportunities during the course of construction for more people to be brought in or for those locally to change jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords kent will not be desecrated <e> <s> as the noble lord might be aware my honourable friend in another place mr mitchell has had a lot of meetings with all the groups concerned about the future of kent <e> <s> we are very concerned about that matter but i do not believe that kent will be desecrated when the project is finished <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> although there is to be considerable investment in this london and south-east sector express service there are no plans for it to be transferred to the intercity sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not have to wait much longer because the government have recently authorised the expenditure by br of some million for new electric multiple units to be used on that line <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble viscount lord buckmaster is right about the mileages but i should not like to comment on increasing the speed limit without further reference to br on the safety aspect <e> <s> however i can tell the house that when the new locomotives are in place the journey to weymouth will be reduced by minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will soon have a more comfortable carriage to sit in and a faster and better service <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the punctuality of trains because that is rather wide of the question on the order paper but if the noble lord wishes to put down a question on that subject i shall make the information available to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all i can add to that is that manchester as with any airport which has developed well has come out of the stage of subsidy <e> <s> however the principle remains <e> <s> if the noble lord wants equalisation of treatment with regard to any airport that is trying to get off the ground where there is a demand for traffic as there is in the south-east and as there will be at stansted the government are perfectly entitled to give stansted a grant <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the noble lord has already abused report stage i am afraid and i must continue <e> <s> he cannot differentiate suddenly between the past and the present because what he wants is continuity and continuity would ensure a grant to stansted and would ensure unfair cross-subsidy <e> <s> that is not what the government want <e> <s> any loan to stansted will have to be clearly shown in the accounts and balance sheet <e> <s> there will be no unfair cross-subsidy for the reasons that i have explained <e> <s> i therefore believe that the amendment is not only unnecessary but also incompatible with the memorandum and articles of association of the company which would not be the appropriate vehicle for a provision of this kind <e> <s> it could not be effectively enforced <e> <s> it could also be removed at any time by the private sector baa holding company which will own per cent <e> <s> of the shares in the stansted airport company <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran quoted from what i said on th may the extract in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments and the questions which the two noble lords have put to me <e> <s> i find myself in some difficulty over the first question that was posed by the noble lord lord williams of elvel for the very good reason that the financial services bill is still in another place and it would be wrong for us in this house to start consideration of the bill before it reaches us here <e> <s> however i shall draw to the attention of my right honourable friends in another place the point that he raises and i hope to be able to get an answer to him before third reading in regard to where he links this bill with the financial services bill <e> <s> i hope he will accept that assurance in the good faith in which it is offered <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but i thought i had answered the noble lord lord lloyd <e> <s> the words other securities were requested <e> <s> i believe that they are wider than the word shares but i will take advice on that and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before dealing with this amendment may i with the leave of the house quickly go back to the last amendment <e> <s> it escaped my memory at the time but the point raised by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran with regard to shares is of course covered in the definitions on page of the bill as printed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add anything to what i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the attention given to this amendment by the noble lord lord underhill and also the attention given by my noble friend lord dudley whose presence we sadly miss today <e> <s> both noble lords have given considerable attention to transfer schemes under clause and in particular to the question of transferring airport debts <e>", "<cs> my lords i will clarify what i said <e> <s> what we are proposing would involve the introduction of a new grant related expenditure assessment for past airport debt borne by the controlling authorities <e> <s> the notional cost of financing this debt would be calculated using standard interest rate and repayment rate factors consistent with those used for the other greas for debt charges <e> <s> the amounts calculated in this way would be added to the individual authorities overall greas to ensure that the entire notional cost of financing past airport debt is met with the rate support grant <e> <s> for airports owned by more than one authority as most are the airport debt gre will be divided among the joint owning authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill said there is only one airport currently owned by a pta and that is liverpool which is owned by the merseyside pta as the noble lord lord sefton of garston has just reminded us <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that i was a little surprised to see this amendment on the marshalled list as it is a slimmed-down version of amendment no <e> <s> moved in committee by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> we took the matter to a vote and the amendment was defeated <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the figure of per cent <e> <s> is not taken out of the air <e> <s> it has been discussed i understand in the house previously and is well precedented in relation to non-housing receipts of local authorities <e> <s> section of the local government planning and land act which applies to england and wales only might help the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord williams of elvel said we had a good canter around this course before a gallop as he prefers to call it and i would agree with him when i explained this in detail to the house in committee on the nd may <e> <s> the aim of this amendment is to remove control over private capital raised by airport company share issues while retaining control over that raised by loans <e> <s> it seems to make what i would regard as a totally spurious distinction between different methods of raising private capital <e> <s> both add to the public sector borrowing requirement in the way that i explained to the house in committee on the nd may <e> <s> therefore private capital raised by either means should be subject to the same control <e> <s> i would therefore ask the noble lord to withdraw his amendment for the very good reasons advanced earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i think what i said was raised by airport company share issues <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may try to clarify the situation <e> <s> the money raised represents a call by the public sector on the private sector <e> <s> as long as the company is controlled by the local authorities then that money should be classed within the psbr <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just look at the point which the noble lord lord williams has raised to see whether it can be clarified <e> <s> i shall return with an appropriate amendment at third reading if that is helpful or i shall certainly write to the noble lord if we believe that the amendment as drafted is all right <e>", "<cs> of course i shall my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that i shall look at that particular point again <e> <s> i would not want to invalidate something about which i have written to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that he will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i reconfirm what i said earlier to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe we were also discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> these amendments seek to add to the secretary of states powers of direction under clause a very broadly-worded provision in relation to the national interest for the development of air transport <e>", "<cs> my lords so far i have not finished what i was going to say <e> <s> if the noble lord lord harris will bear with me i know he is probably anxious to go elsewhere i shall continue <e> <s> i hope that even he will realise that there are many who would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that he has the powers already existing in the civil aviation legislation but at this stage i cannot point my finger at a particular section of an act that gives the enabling power <e> <s> however i shall look into that specific point for my noble friend <e> <s> going back to the cap point and in particular in answer to the noble baroness lady burton of coventry we have not made a final decision on the recommendations of the caa <e> <s> we are considering this and a final decision will be forthcoming i hope in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is one of the many points we are still considering at the moment as part of the caas submission to us <e> <s> if i may sum up we believe that the free marketplace will provide all the necessary incentives to take care of the situation envisaged and described so eloquently by so many speakers today <e> <s> that is a preferable way of doing it rather than by means of the heavy draconian powers of either of these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had answered the noble lord <e> <s> i said i was unable at the moment to put my finger on the precise point in order to answer and therefore the answer that i gave was a specific answer <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend lord kinnoull that i quite understand the house wants a specific answer which i am at the moment unable to give <e> <s> therefore i should like to reconsider this matter with my officials and i hope to be able to give all the necessary answers at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i might answer that and try to help the house a little further <e> <s> under the provisions of section of the civil aviation act the secretary of state has the duty of carrying out and encouraging measures for the development of civil aviation <e> <s> he would have no power himself to provide an airport but clearly could give encouragement for an airport under <e>", "<cs> my lords the words i used were that <e>", "<cs> my lords when we considered this bill in committee the noble lord lord underhill who has proposed this amendment put forward a similar one which applied not only to the powers of direction under clause but also to those in respect of special facilities at airports <e> <s> for our report stage noble lords have in effect divided their original proposal into two in that they have tabled a similar provision for incorporation into clause <e> <s> i am happy to tell the house that thus far i am in agreement with them that is i agree that the issues fall into two distinct parts <e> <s> directions made in the interests of national security or to discharge international obligations are indeed different from directions to provide special facilities at airports <e>", "<cs> my lords clause sets out the consultation arrangements which shall apply before the secretary of state can make traffic distribution rules <e> <s> he must first consult the caa who may then canvass opinion from a wide variety of civil aviation interests <e> <s> similarly clause sets out the consultations which the secretary of state must undertake before he makes an order limiting aircraft movements at an airport <e> <s> of course i appreciate noble lords reasons for seeking to expand the range of interests consulted under this bill and we have reviewed the position since we last discussed the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the purpose of the amendment is to limit the consultation i should have thought that aberdeen airport consultative committee to which i have just referred would have been aggrieved at not being consulted by the caa on air traffic distribution in the london area <e> <s> it shows that the caa consults on a very much wider basis than just the relevant body <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i appreciate the motives which prompt this amendment and i can assure the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that i have lifted my visor on this but that having looked i shut it again pretty quickly <e> <s> there are other amendments on which as the noble lord knows i lifted my visor and where we made a lot of progress and a number of concessions as a result of what has been discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the noble lord i really am after all we have gone through <e> <s> i do not think he really means that <e> <s> my noble friend lord monk bretton mentioned injurious affection <e> <s> that is a subject which i dealt with as an agricultural surveyor but i do not think he is quite right in saying it is appropriate here because most of the development has followed the airport <e> <s> the houses and industry that come in with the airport reap a benefit from the airport <e> <s> perhaps it should be the other way round and they should pay the airport for the benefit of the increased rent and the capital value that accrue to them through being next to the airport <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that there have been some occasions when certain people have not felt they were fully compensated <e> <s> i was putting the alternative view that many have come in subsequently <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i hope it was very useful <e> <s> what i said i will repeat it and look at the noble lord it is sometimes difficult to hear the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit to some surprise at seeing this amendment on the marshalled list since the words it seeks to delete were in fact added by a government amendment during committee stage with the agreement of your lordships <e> <s> this was as a result of a commitment given in another place by the government following a defeat in the committee stage a defeat engineered with the full support of the front bench of the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i now find it surprising to find him coming back to say that that is not what the opposition meant when they defeated the government in committee <e> <s> that is why i am puzzled <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may just say that the noble lord knows that i cannot give him that assurance because i have not yet taken the point away to look at <e> <s> he asked me to do so and i said that i would but i cannot give him an assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for the error that i have just made <e> <s> these are technical and apparently rather complicated consequential amendments <e> <s> their purpose is merely to ensure that nothing done by the caa under part iv of the bill can prevent the secretary of state for trade and industry from using his powers under normal competition law <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated this matter during our consideration of the bill in committee and i referred to that debate when we discussed a similarly termed amendment to clause where i explained at some length why in that case i considered the question of compensation to be inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i might have misheard the noble lord lord underhill when he said that there are local authority airports designated for this purpose <e> <s> i hope that i did not hear him say that but if he did so then i am afraid that it was a slip of the tongue which is most unusual for him because there are no local authority airports designated for the purpose of this clause <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that we will not take care now because we have already taken care at the moment when the amendment went down <e>", "<cs> my lords immediately means immediately the second before <e> <s> i hope that clarifies the situation for the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove is absolutely right to mention the noble lord lord mountevans because this is not only a technical amendment but it is partially consequential on the new clause moved by the noble lord lord mountevans at committee stage <e> <s> as your lordships will recall shops at designated airports are already exempted from the restrictions on opening hours in part i of the shops act <e> <s> the new clause of the noble lord lord mountevans extended this exemption to cover also part iv of the shops act which restricts sunday trading <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the answer to that is yes but i will check and if i am wrong i will come back to my noble friend <e> <s> i have just been informed that it is all shops within the airport terminal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful for those kind words <e> <s> i should like to say that my task has been made very much easier by the helpful and constructive way in which the report and indeed the committee have been handled by noble lords opposite and by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran today and his noble friend lord tordoff at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the traffic on the m <e> <s> traffic forecasts are being undertaken and a survey is being done which my right honourable friend will consider as soon as it is published <e>", "<cs> my lords the link was terminated under the terms set by my right honourable friend the secretary of state which were considered right at the time <e> <s> when the vital section of the m opened four months later it was part of the condition of the licence that the link would be terminated and so it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very concerned that the links between gatwick and heathrow remain open <e> <s> there is a very good bus service and alternative means of getting from one to the other <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not forget the fact that a great many cancellations of the helicopter service were due to adverse weather conditions <e> <s> that meant that people had to go by road in any case and for part of the day both from gatwick to heathrow and vice versa some commercial flights were arriving when no helicopter service was being provided <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill is absolutely right in that new alternative routes were proposed <e> <s> it was a very finely balanced judgment <e> <s> there are very good arguments on both sides but at the end of the day as the noble lord will know from our discussions on the airports bill we take environmental factors very seriously <e> <s> it was that aspect that tipped the scales in favour of the decision that was taken <e>", "<cs> my lords there were reasons other than the noise mentioned by my noble friend that had to be taken into account <e> <s> the scheduled service has terminated <e> <s> if the m road link does not prove satisfactory in the future and we will watch the situation my right honourable friend the secretary of state has said that he will examine the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said before there were very good arguments on both sides <e> <s> having examined the matter very carefully and having considered all the representations my right honourable friend came down in favour of the m road link being the one that should be used for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords this government do not stop helicopters from being used for commuter services because each application for a commuter service is considered on its merits <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend is right when he says that there would be less noise if the helicopters were permitted to fly higher but that would have to take into account the other air traffic movements in the vicinity <e> <s> as i have said before there is more than noise to this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend misconstrued some of my words <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state announced last month that he was commissioning a study to determine whether the problems could best be tackled by improving traffic management arrangements at junctions remodelling junctions widening parts of the motorway or a combination of those options <e> <s> we expect to receive the consultants report later this month and it will be considered urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i have discussed this matter at length with my right honourable friend particularly in view of questions that have been asked before and i know full well the feelings that exist <e> <s> i can only say that i will again talk to my right honourable friend <e> <s> the decision was taken on finely balanced arguments both ways <e> <s> the department received about representations <e> <s> they have all been looked into and there were more representations opposed to the air link than there were for the air link <e> <s> my right honourable friend the present secretary of state is fully aware as was his predecessor of the views of this house on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the present situation concerning traffic on the m was fully taken into account when the matter was examined by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the other reasons was the visual intrusion of the helicopter <e> <s> it was rather a large helicopter holding some people which is rather bigger than the normal helicopter one sees flying around <e>", "<cs> my lords we realise that new motorways cause traffic <e> <s> however the planning system in this country leads one to the conclusion that it takes so long from the time that it is decided to construct a motorway or by-pass until it is completed it takes well over years that there might be more in the argument my noble friend has produced than just the extra traffic generated by the motorway <e>", "<cs> my lords if british rail bring forward a proposition for a rail link between the <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall many matters during our discussions on okehampton and i understand that the policy followed on this occasion was similar to that on previous occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two schemes in the national roads programme which will affect national parks <e> <s> there are also two schemes in the regional programmes which will affect national parks <e> <s> if the noble baroness would like to be more specific i may be able to help on the one to which she refers <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not appear on my briefing so perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to write to her on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i can help the house <e> <s> the four schemes are the a gargrave bypass where no objections were received on public consultation and the a high and low newton bypass where the villages lie within several miles of the lake district national park <e> <s> the two regional schemes are the a taddington dale improvement and the a white lee improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful to the noble lord lord dean of beswick for the very succinct way in which he introduced the bill <e> <s> as he said this is a bill which deals with detailed matters but it is nonetheless welcome for that <e> <s> the bill provides useful additional flexibility to both local authorities and manufacturers of parking apparatus and i am sure that it will be welcomed by them <e> <s> it will have the added benefit i believe of reducing crime associated with the present equipment <e> <s> furthermore the new equipment that the bill permits will help to increase the efficiency of the operation of parking schemes <e>", "<cs> i go further than that my lords <e> <s> i welcome anybody who has a contribution to make to any of the existing or proposed legislation <e> <s> of course i shall look into that particular point for the noble lord <e> <s> i think that comment too covers some of the points that the noble lord lord underhill raised and i shall also write to him and put a copy of my reply in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend and the house that we have seriously considered whether overtaking on either side on motorways is a possibility <e> <s> we are not in favour of that alternative driving procedure for different classes of roads because we believe that road safety which is paramount depends upon uniformity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords question <e> <s> i can tell him that the study area is junctions to in the south-west sector not the whole of the m <e> <s> we expect the results shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of my noble friends concern for the helicopter link <e> <s> when the study is completed we hope that it will give some solutions for achieving a speedier flow of traffic in that south-west sector <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the most pressing complaints at the moment relate to the south-west sector <e> <s> our consultants are looking into a number of items connected with the motorway such as the remodelling of junctions better traffic management and perhaps widening the carriageways or a combination of those measures that might well help <e> <s> if any results come forward from the study that can be applied to other parts of the motorway we shall not fail to apply them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that both can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that drivers in this country are perhaps no better and no worse than drivers anywhere else <e> <s> but we believe that uniformity is essential for road safety <e> <s> it would cause severe complications i believe for many drivers if they were suddenly told that they could overtake on the left-hand side on a given section of road <e> <s> that would cause problems not only to the person undertaking the manoeuvre but also to others who were unaware of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that undertaking <e> <s> i shall draw the noble lords point to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords no such arrangements exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of the arguments put forward by my noble friend <e> <s> the first three-year cycle of the badge and the programme has been completed <e> <s> we are looking into the operation of the scheme with the local authorities and we shall bear in mind the arguments of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that there has been abuse of the badge <e> <s> this is one of the matters that we are looking at in reviewing the operation with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the local authorities can issue the badge for a shorter period than three years <e> <s> however this is one of the points that we shall be looking at <e> <s> i think that we have to go back to why the scheme was designed in the first place <e> <s> it was designed to assist only those people with a permanent and very considerable difficulty in walking and the blind and one or two other groups <e>", "<cs> my lords the scheme at present is designed specifically to take into account my noble friends point where one has as a passenger somebody who is severely disabled and has considerable difficulty in walking whereas the driver such as my noble friend i am glad to say is fit enough to compete with the rest of us <e>", "<cs> my lords the scheme is run by the local authorities <e> <s> the original purpose of the scheme was as i have said before to help those with a permanent disability <e> <s> there was therefore no intention of providing for a temporary badge <e> <s> but all these arguments will be taken into account in the process of our consideration of the scheme <e> <s> the arguments of any of your lordships who care to write to my department will of course be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a very valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> the abuse of this scheme is something that we should not tolerate because it lowers the value of the scheme and makes it considerably harder for those who have a serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is a little early to say because this is the first result that has come in as regards the tendering process but i agree with my noble friend that it is certainly encouraging especially when one bears in mind that it may have been thought that the highland region was not an area ideal for competition <e> <s> however even there most valuable savings have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the question asked by the noble lord lord underhill who very kindly sent me a letter yesterday enclosing some cuttings <e> <s> i shall be replying to the noble lord in detail <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that poor service is to be regretted under any circumstances <e> <s> i understand that the examples which he has referred to me are temporary difficulties which will be rectified soon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it there will be the same level of service in the respects which the noble lord has mentioned as operated in the previous year <e> <s> the level of service from august to august is also proposed for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends question and i shall pass his comments on to the highland regional council <e>", "<cs> my lords i should think that it would be towards the end of october or beginning of november because as the noble lord lord underhill has reminded the house the tendering processes will not be completed until the end of october and therefore the information probably will not be available until then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the concern <e> <s> indeed there was concern in the highland region which as the noble lord will know is a fairly rural area <e> <s> there they have made a success of tendering and they have saved the ratepayers and the taxpayers money as a result <e> <s> now that the noble lord has drawn my attention to the matter i shall watch the situation in wales and let him know in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not only in the private sector that one expects failures one sees failures in the public sector too <e> <s> however i do not think that the bus services in the last years or so could be classed as anything like a success story <e> <s> as bus travellers have halved so subsidies have doubled in real terms in the last years and fares have increased some per cent <e> <s> more than inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the merchant shipping orders standing in my name on the order paper be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the orders will apply to all merchant shipping in territorial waters united kingdom or non-united <e>", "<cs> the guidance notes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lords opposite we want to see flourishing public airport companies and we will continue to provide the same generous support to which the noble lord lord underhill referred for worthwhile investment in local authority airports as we have done in the past <e> <s> indeed the special capital allocations for airport development made by my right honourable friend under the provisions of section of the local government <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect we listened very carefully to the arguments of the noble lord at earlier stages of the bill and that is part of the reason why we brought forward the amendment <e>", "<cs> on monday my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove said the amendment is worded differently from the amendment that noble lords opposite put down on report <e> <s> i fear that he forgot to mention that the principle behind it is the same as the one which they pressed to a division and on which their amendment amendment no <e> <s> was defeated <e> <s> indeed the specific point upon which the noble lord lord williams of elvel felt that he had to seek the view of your lordships house was the term at the heart of this present amendment the word furtherance <e> <s> that is the very word which i said i would take to have a look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the general welcome to the amendment given by most noble lords but i understand some of the concerns expressed by the noble lord lord mountevans <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords over the last few weeks we have enjoyed some hours of debate on the airports bill debate which as is customary in your lordships house has been courteous and incisive and which has amply demonstrated your lordships knowledge of the aviation world and recognition of its importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be coming on to some figures <e> <s> as i mentioned earlier this is such an interesting and complicated subject that we could bandy figures all evening <e> <s> if i do not cover the specific points the noble lord requires i shall write to him further on this matter <e> <s> this will be of major importance to our shipping industry as the noble lord lord greenway mentioned in his excellent speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the danger exists at present because if a ship calls at shoreham it can go up the inshore traffic zone even though it is a large tanker and proceed beyond the thames estuary and out the other side without having to take a pilot <e> <s> so these are points that have to be looked at again <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord but under the new proposals it is for the harbour authorities to be the bodies to look at them <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be a number of harbour authorities around the thames estuary <e> <s> but we hope and i am about to make a comment on estuaries that they will in most circumstances act in a unified fashion <e> <s> this is important as there are special conditions that apply to estuaries <e> <s> if i may refer specifically to the thames estuary the indications that we have had are that satisfactory arrangements can be reached <e> <s> nonethe-less in case they prove to be difficult either at the start of the new regime or later we propose that my right honourable friend the secretary of state should be able to call for a scheme for the estuary and he should have the power to direct any changes in the proposed scheme that he considers necessary <e> <s> this we believe will be an adequate safeguard so that safety is maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly one of the problems of the present system <e> <s> the age structure in the london district is wrong <e> <s> it is imbalanced <e> <s> it is exactly the odd situation that the present laws provide for <e> <s> in a district of the importance of london where new blood and new young pilots are needed the present system blocks the exit of old pilots who wish to take early retirement or leave the service <e> <s> we hope that our new proposals will solve exactly these types of problems <e> <s> if i have not covered any noble lords point i shall read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that aviation was not discussed at the last council meeting <e> <s> i read the same article that the noble baroness has quoted about the comments of the commissioner responsible <e> <s> the commission has tabled a paper <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the commission can take action under article of the treaty of rome <e> <s> alas as there was no discussion at the last council meeting there seemed to be little point in the commission taking action straight away until the discussion on th june <e> <s> thereafter it will be up to the commission to decide what action to take but i understand that it will want to take action immediately if no progress is made <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what we in the government are trying to do and what the commission is trying to do <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have made enormous progress on aviation liberalisation and we shall continue to press with all the forces at our command to take it a stage further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome to the statement that the noble lord lord underhill gave <e> <s> i will pass on his remarks about what good news it was that we still maintain our derogation to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> i can confirm to the noble lord lord underhill and to the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> that the maximum weight of tonnes or tonnes drive axle weight will be the limit for this country unless parliament decides otherwise and until our roads and bridges are in a satisfactory condition to bear other lorries should parliament decide that those are the lorries that would be suitable for this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter gave to the derogation that my right honourable friend successfully negotiated on axle weights <e> <s> i will pass that message on to my right honourable friend <e> <s> with regard to enforcement i can confirm that this is undertaken in a very serious manner and will continue to be undertaken in the same vein <e> <s> lorries that exceed the weight will not be permitted on our roads and enforcement action will be taken not only at the ports of entry of the country but in roadside checks by police and traffic enforcement officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the commissioner is taking the matter extremely seriously and should like to see greater competition <e> <s> indeed the commission has indicated that it will wish to take action under article of the treaty of rome if there is not action by the member states themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the noble baronesss absence earlier we welcome her to our discussions particularly as she is a keen liberaliser <e> <s> yes i did say that we would be pursuing the point of easier entry of airlines into the market place <e> <s> but this cannot be taken in isolation <e> <s> we are looking for four points and we want to move forward on all four together <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to heavy lorries coming in from the republic of ireland it too has a similar derogation to us which it put in the directive and indeed had confirmed yesterday <e> <s> it is similar to that which my right honourable friend the secretary of state achieved <e> <s> we will check with our usual thoroughness vehicles coming into the country <e> <s> i think it would be impractical for the road haulage association and commerce in general to have every single lorry vetted every time it came in but we will indeed check up in our usual thorough fashion <e>", "<cs> no my lords i regret that i shall not remind my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne of that point because i saw that he was taking careful note of it himself <e>", "<cs> no my lords i regret that i beg to differ from the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i do not think it conflicts with the airports bill <e> <s> it is all part of the same process <e> <s> of course my right honourable friend bore it in mind during the discussion <e> <s> but if we can increase the opportunities for civil aviation and air traffic this was so powerfully argued by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and i believe that the noble lord supported it as being one of our success industries we must do so without delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that my right honourable friend is fully aware of that <e> <s> it was because we were so concerned about it that we moved an amendment to the airports bill at report stage on rd june <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the house at the moment when a decision will be taken on the document because it is long and complicated but we are considering it urgently <e> <s> it is i believe a matter for the usual channels as to whether it is discussed or debated in any way <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> on the last point i do not believe there is a conflict between government policy and the bill which indeed reflects government policy <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill is absolutely right it was at the end of july that my right honourable friend the then secretary of state invited the caa to review the existing rules for traffic distribution between the london airports <e>", "<cs> my lords we have received much information about the importance of the inverness-heathrow flight and that will be taken into account by my right honourable friend when he comes to make a decision on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i believe that to be slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> but if the noble lord would like to put down a question on that matter i shall do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i believe that is not what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord knows but aircraft do fly direct to scotland at the moment <e> <s> my right honourable friend will of course take into account any representations <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the noble lords points <e>", "<cs> my lords payment of awards for costs to successful objectors are made on a discretionary not a statutory basis <e> <s> successive administrations have concluded that it would be inappropriate to pay interest and we have no plans to change this <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that on this occasion my noble friend has got it wrong <e> <s> i remember as a surveyor how difficult it was getting accounts settled by clients <e> <s> the department of employment booklet <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong for me to comment on a case of my noble friend without his approval <e> <s> but with regard to payment we pay awards for costs where they are justified as soon as practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely right <e> <s> it is the time from the receipt of the claim to getting that justified by the department that takes a little longer than we should like but we are pursuing this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the normal time for payment of an award of costs is much less than six months <e> <s> if there is a delay of six months it probably means that a matter of policy has been at stake and therefore it has taken a little longer to take the appropriate ministers advice on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i missed the first part of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been the practice of all governments since the recommen-dations of the council on tribunals in <e>", "<cs> my lords the qualified objectors who are the ones who have an interest in the land will get an award for costs if they can substantiate their claim <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always an onus on government to settle any outstanding accounts quickly <e> <s> indeed the fact that the matter can be raised on the floor of the house on an occasion such as this encourages us to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have not misunderstood my noble friend <e> <s> we pay an award for costs which is the answer to the question he asked me <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think i have already answered the question as to why we do not pay interest previous governments have not done so either <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to some of the concerns raised in particular that raised by the noble lord lord underhill who asked what has happened since <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly said these regulations were considered in but were not pursued at that time because further <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a width restriction <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the last question no such trailers are not confined to miles per hour unless the circumstances dictate that they should be <e> <s> we are talking about a regulation affecting trailers which includes the horse-box carrying the goats which the noble lady mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course unable to give the proportion of the public who have actually received the towing code <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that the national caravan council the caravan club and the camping and caravanning club who together with my department all contributed to the towing code have made sure <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is right <e> <s> the mirrors have to have a sufficiently clear view around the side of all trailers <e>", "<cs> my lords driving instructors have to pass a very stiff three-part examination which comprises a written exam a practical test of the candidates own driving skill and one of his own instruction ability <e> <s> how the candidate actually reaches the required standard we believe is up to him or her but we think that the standard is sufficiently high at the moment <e> <s> however we shall always keep this matter under review <e>", "<cs> my lords the department keeps a list of approved driving instructors and indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it depends on each individual airline <e> <s> as a result of our recent efforts we have achieved more liberal arrange-ments with the netherlands and i know that if the noble lord seeks to go there he will find that there is a much greater choice and variety of seat allocations than hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that on certain flights there will be a preponderance of business class seats <e> <s> for example if one travels from london to brussels on an oclock flight on a monday morning one will find that there is a very high proportion of business class passengers <e> <s> however it varies with the time of day and the type of flight <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly be glad to look at any case which any noble lord wishes to bring to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords we are pursuing bilateral negotiations with most of the european countries with which we do not have liberal arrangements at the moment <e> <s> moreover as in particular the noble baroness lady burton of coventry will know we are pursuing matters in the ec as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now aware of that fact yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm to the noble lord lord underhill that the order has been before the joint committee which approved it without comment <e> <s> i should like to add that it is nice for the other place to have our comments before we have theirs <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for his welcome to this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his welcome of this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the first part of the question because we have not completed our considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness has slightly confused me <e> <s> i thought that there were two parts to the question that the first related to the decision on the financial viability which we are urgently considering following a revision of some of the parts of the financial elements of british rails proposal and that the second part was in regard to the bill which is in another place <e> <s> as it is a private bill as i have previously explained to the noble baroness it is not a matter for the government <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i informed the house in january february april may and june on the progress of the bill in another place <e> <s> i have explained to the house previously that there were revisions to the proposals following consultations as a result of the second reading in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords from liverpool street <e>", "<cs> my lords consideration has been given to that <e> <s> i repeat that stansted is not dependent on the rail link <e> <s> we hope to complete our considerations of the british rail proposals and make an announcement in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say on that is that i hope it will be before the recess <e> <s> as to an announcement during the recess and consideration of that announcement by this house that will be a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords we firmly believe that we are undertaking this action for the benefit of the consumer and the passenger <e> <s> as the house will be aware passenger bus services have declined consecutively for many years and we are now offering real opportunities to small businesses and to individ-uals to own their own buses and fulfil a market need <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard quite a lot of the propaganda that the alliance party put out which was totally erroneous and has been proved to be so <e> <s> as i reported to the house the highland region of scotland in its tendering saved <e> <s> since then we have heard that lancashire tendering is virtually completed and that it will save about million which is per cent <e> <s> of its budget <e> <s> cumbria expects to spend about million compared with a budgeted million for the seven months from th october to st march <e> <s> therefore my lords the scare stories of the alliance are totally unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful for that question <e> <s> it follows from my last answer <e> <s> with the savings that local authorities are already beginning to show it will be up to them to spend that money on those routes that have not been tendered for on a commercial basis <e> <s> the results so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to tell the noble lord and the house that the services are broadly the same as before <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i come back to a point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on the airports bill <e> <s> if something is successful there is nothing to stop us making it more successful in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that there is a time limit of two months for replies to the letter and those replies have to be sent to the commission <e> <s> the other airlines to whom the commission has written on this particular point are sabena sas lufthansa olympic airways air france aer lingus alitalia and klm <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the commission can act independently of the council of ministers on this matter <e> <s> i cannot tell the house when the commission next meets but i can say that the council of ministers will be meeting formally on th and th november <e> <s> it is hoped that my right honourable friend will be able to arrange an informal meeting in london in october <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be for the commission to take what action it deems necessary through its powers under the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend rightly points out we can take matters into our own hands but we believe that a better solution will be found for the long-term good by negotiation between all members of the community rather than by individual states taking action <e> <s> however if we do not achieve a satisfactory solution by the end of our term of presidency which will be the end of december we will look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission is firmly of the opinion that there should be further liberalisation of the air transport market and it will pursue all means at its disposal to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords we remain committed to seeking an agreement with our partners in europe which is why my right honourable friend is seeking to have an informal council meeting before the formal council meeting where we hope substantial progress will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we will be entitled to consider every option available to us if progress has not been made by the end of our presidency <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil aviation authority have informed us that since the initial inspections of localised areas of the nose fuselage structure were completed in march this year three boeing aircraft on the british register have now been more extensively inspected in the continuing programme for aircraft which have accumulated over flights <e> <s> cracks have been found in all three aircraft <e> <s> but the nature and severity is less than previously found being well within the structural capability of the aircraft <e> <s> each aircraft has completed over flights aircraft remain to be inspected and each inspection will take to weeks to complete <e>", "<cs> my lords the cracks are well within the structural capability of the aircraft and this is something for the aircraft operators themselves to determine <e> <s> it depends on the pressure cycles that is the number of times the aircraft has to take off and land and therefore the cracks will vary <e> <s> obviously there will come a time when because of the continuing maintenance programme it will be cheaper to renew the aircraft than to maintain it <e>", "<cs> my lords the incidents that i have reported today have come to light as a result of a continuing programme of vetting of aircraft which is done on a regular and increasing basis <e> <s> the cracks are very minor and well within the structural capability of the aircraft and i believe that the government and the caa who are responsible for this matter are taking it seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the aircraft have to come back to this country in order to be inspected for british airways but this is a second series of inspections <e> <s> the aircraft have been inspected once before the end of march and the inspection that is being carried out this time is a continuing on-going and slightly more extensive one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that it is safer to travel in aircraft with cracks of this nature than in aircraft with no cracks at all as this probably means that there will be greater stress elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why this section of nbc was not sold to the management was that its offer was considerably below that which was accepted <e> <s> as to the sale of the whole company we do not believe that selling it as an entity would have been beneficial and it would have frustrated our deregulation programme which would not have been in the interests of potential passengers who are waiting for an improved service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should not be surprised if there is a consistent answer to a consistent question <e> <s> we have been through the question of the disposal of ncb in considerable detail on the transport bill last year <e> <s> he will recall our happy discussions on the matter <e> <s> we believe that the action that we have taken is the best for competition and for the passenger <e>", "<cs> my lords the act to which the noble lord referred did not provide for the disposal of all national bus company operations the act did <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are fully conversant with the noble lords special interest in this matter <e> <s> i shall ensure that his point is passed to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point about pensions i am glad to tell the house that settlement has been reached on the vexed question of past pension entitlements <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords second question i cannot give the assurance that he wants <e> <s> from his experience he will realise that there are some surplus properties that the nbc will dispose of separately <e> <s> in general the operational properties will be sold with its subsidiaries <e> <s> with regard to whether the price was influenced by the offer to take on existing staff a number of factors affected the price but i can confirm that as we understand it all the staff will be taken on under roughly the same terms and conditions of employment that they were under before <e>", "<cs> and their pensions my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot give the noble lord any further information on that point as no disposal has taken place <e> <s> however i shall look into the matter now that he has raised it <e>", "<cs> my lords when london regional transport was established in the government set it a number of objectives relating to the efficiency and quality of its service <e> <s> these included making the service more attractive to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a number of technological improvements to help service quality <e> <s> one of those has been the docklands light railway which will come into operation next year <e> <s> there will be a new ticketing system for the underground by which will greatly improve the issue checking and control of tickets and passes <e> <s> electronic bus priority systems are being tested to help traffic flow at roundabouts and traffic lights <e> <s> the government are also helping with four assessments of the worst road problems in the london area <e> <s> with regard to innovative services a number of things have been happening <e> <s> in particular better use has been made of one-person operated buses <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell the noble lord that he is completely wrong <e> <s> since unit costs have been significantly reduced and revenue costs have been halved in one year to million <e> <s> he will of course recall that the glc had plans for revenue subsidy of million <e> <s> capital investment has been increased to million in compared with glc plans for only million <e> <s> fares have been held broadly in line with inflation <e> <s> the financial burden on the ratepayer and taxpayer has been reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords no i have not <e> <s> from my car my bus my bicycle or my feet i find it difficult to understand what is going on in the underground <e> <s> i shall note my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords no lrt does not consider itself to be inefficient <e> <s> it believes that where tendering is feasible and will benefit bus service users it should be undertaken <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that there was a local problem in epping <e> <s> i recall telling him that that was being tackled <e> <s> lrt is conscious of any problems that arise and sees that they are remedied as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware recently there has been such a substantial increase in the number of people using the underground that i am sure lrt will want to improve the service even more <e>", "<cs> my lords lrt is looking beyond the summer months <e> <s> it is looking to improve all stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly convey my noble friends point to lrt <e> <s> i recall that a question on this matter was answered by my noble friend lord davidson last week <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not true i believe if one looks at the figures of people using the buses <e> <s> the number has increased from and is now slightly above the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because we see that improvements can be made that we are helping lrt through a substantial improvement in grant for capital investment of million in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill raised a number of points and hoped that they would be taken into account in the inquiry <e> <s> i assure him that i shall pass them on to my right <e>", "<cs> my lords one would of course advise all motorists to take note of flashing lights particularly when they are red flashing lights at an automatic level crossing <e> <s> i do not know about the french system but i know that in preparing the specialist report on this matter in evidence was taken from european countries and visits were made to the netherlands france west germany and switzerland <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to the noble lords second point but i shall write to him <e> <s> as regards the noble lords first point the crossing was an automatic open level crossing and therefore there were no half barriers or full barriers <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the accident and refer the noble lord to the report of it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hope the noble lord will be aware british rail check their automatic crossings on a very regular basis <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may write to the noble and learned lord on that point and put a copy of my reply in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords there are crossings which are similar to that at lockington <e> <s> as regards what advice one can give to motorists i think that the answer is to watch the lights extremely carefully and if there are any lights that are flashing then motorists must stop and not try to beat the train <e> <s> similarly with half barriers they must not try and weave their way in between the barriers <e> <s> of course we are very concerned that motorists should not be alarmed about what can be a perfectly safe crossing if treated properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there was no cause for a public inquiry <e> <s> however i believe that a report was naturally made of the incident <e>", "<cs> my lords i can repeat to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos that there are crossings like that at lockington <e> <s> concerning the inquiry into the safety of these types of barrier we shall pursue that with the utmost haste and without further delay <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill chided me for not covering all the points which arose from these three draft regulations and the draft order but i am sure that if i had tried to cover all the points the noble lord would have said i beg to move that the noble earl be no longer heard <e> <s> and the noble lord would have been quite right so to do <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill said that this is going to cause tremendous problems for the drivers <e> <s> my noble friend lord teviot said no my lords <e> <s> it is going to pose tremendous problems for the operators <e> <s> so i think the government and the other member states have got it about right <e> <s> it is not perfect for either side but it is somewhere in the middle and i think we have a better working solution now than we had before <e>", "<cs> my lords that is always uppermost in our minds <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill quoted from a tgwu letter i think and said that these regulations were a fundamental change <e> <s> they are not a fundamental change <e> <s> it is solely because the proposals are so much in line with what was the situation in our act that we have been able to get rid of the duplication and come under one set of regulations which must be a preferable situation to operating under two distinct legislations the ec regulation and that of our own transport act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming on to enforcement in a minute <e> <s> the noble lord said that there had been no reply to a couple of examples given in another place <e> <s> during the debate in the other place on th july the honourable member for wigan mr stott gave two examples of work patterns that he said might occur under the proposals <e> <s> one of those involved a driver working from am one morning to am the following day a hour working day hours allowing for a break of minutes <e> <s> that would not be legal <e> <s> it surprises me that the honourable member made such a fundamental mistake as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall see what we can do on that <e> <s> i have a huge list of derogations with me but i think it would perhaps test the patience of the house if i went through it word for word <e>", "<cs> my lords we always try to please <e>", "<cs> my lords there were recommendations in the home report and the government have accepted out of them which i think is a satisfactory solution <e> <s> my honourable friend is going to meet the local authorities in the near future to discuss the other recommendation over which they are a little concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords if that matter is raised i am sure that my honourable friend will be happy to discuss it <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords and that will help the motorist and all those who use the roads <e>", "<cs> recommendation my lords <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords i do know <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has mentioned the specific point <e> <s> the report is in the library and i am sure that the noble lord will be looking forward to reading it shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall send the noble lord the paragraph concerned

to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of some of the immediate problems facing the charity commission <e> <s> there have been recent discussions and discussions are continuing <e> <s> unfortunately i cannot tell my noble friend anything further but her points are noted <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed that argument has been put to us and it is one of the matters under discussion at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that to be slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we would all expect the charity commission to maintain the highest standards in their work <e> <s> the treasury staff inspection report is under consideration at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware there are in order

lord bursts into that language i am afraid he will leave me even further behind than i shall be in any case <e>", "<cs> as i understand it we are not only talking to amendment no <e> <s> but also to amendments nos <e> <s> a and a which cover the same points <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble viscount lord st davids and to the noble and learned lord lord silkin for raising this issue which i know causes considerable concern <e> <s> the main target of the noble viscounts amendments are militants or activists who attend demonstrations wearing hoods to avoid identification <e> <s> from what he said i believe he was referring to those people <e> <s> the noble and learned lords amendments also address this problem and they seek to reinstate in part the saving which appears in section of the public order act that no conditions can be imposed restricting the display of flags or emblems except such as are necessary to prevent a risk of a breach of the peace <e>", "<cs> i was just coming on to the point having put the background into perspective that we believe that the police already have adequate powers to make necessary impositions on marches should they need to do so <e> <s> if the police believe that the wearing of disguises is so provocative or threatening as to constitute a threat to the peace they may take action to prevent that threat by requiring those concerned to remove their disguise <e> <s> if the masks constitute a uniform they will be caught by section of the public order act which prohibits the wearing in public of uniforms denoting association with any political organisation or with the promotion of any political object <e> <s> the committee may know that ira supporters have in the past been prosecuted under this section <e> <s> lastly of course under clause of the bill the police may impose any condition which is necessary to prevent serious public disorder serious damage to property or the intimidation and coercion of individuals where necessary this could include ordering demonstrators to remove their masks <e>", "<cs> as the committee is aware the nature of the police presence at any demonstration will depend entirely upon the size of the event and the problems which are anticipated <e> <s> it is likely that officers of higher rank will be present at large-scale gatherings but there are small demonstrations or pickets which may often be attended by a single constable <e> <s> indeed both the noble lord lord morton of shuna and my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter mentioned these one-off situations <e> <s> it cannot be altogether ruled out that there may be occasions in these cases where for example the fourth test of intimidation might be breached and the officer present might need to intervene to prevent demonstrators overstepping the mark <e> <s> if they are to prevent the mischief occurring they need to act quickly and it might not be possible in the time available to send for a more senior officer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before i reply i should like to clarify with members of the committee opposite whether they are happy that i speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> za zb and zc or whether they would like to move those separately <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon wanted to preserve the right to process and i am sure that every single one of us here wants to preserve that right because there is no need to have permission to march in this country and long may that remain <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i gave the impression that i singled them out as the only ones that suffered <e> <s> i mentioned them as examples of where people had used them and their perfectly legitimate processions as an umbrella for what they particularly wanted to do <e> <s> i was not picking out cnd or antiapartheid movements <e> <s> equally i would thoroughly support the points made by the noble lord lord mishcon regarding whoever organises a procession finding there are trouble-makers over whom they have no control <e> <s> that was the point i was trying to make <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has an attractive argument and it is possible that the framers of the act had they legislated after the police act of might have considered a role for the police authorities or county councils <e> <s> the difficulty now is that the district councils have performed this role very satisfactorily for the last years and there is no strong demand for a change <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has rightly reminded us that the white paper proposed in paragraph that there should be power to ban a single march <e> <s> it is also fair to add that this proposal commanded considerable support on consultation <e> <s> but one of our chief concerns both in the white paper and in the bill was to propose only such powers as would be of practical value to the police and i have to tell the committee that the police have expressed considerable reservations on this matter <e>", "<cs> i understand the arguments of the noble and learned lord and i accept that it is entirely reasonable that banning orders should wherever possible be in writing but as i am sure he will be the first to understand that is not always possible <e> <s> banning orders are imposed rarely and only as a last resort and sometimes at the last moment <e> <s> when a ban is applied for at the eleventh hour it may not always be possible to put the banning order in writing <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon puts the matter succinctly and it does not behove me to follow him in great detail because he encapsulated most of the points of my argument <e>", "<cs> an amendment identical to the amendment moved by the noble baroness was moved in committee in another place but for very different reasons as i understand it <e> <s> it was taken into account by the government who brought forward an amendment on report in another place <e> <s> they substituted a revised power enabling the police to impose conditions as to the location of an assembly and the committee will find that on line page <e> <s> that provision will allow the police to give negative <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this new clause as the noble earl lord halsbury has explained is to provide enhanced penalties for those who persistently commit offences under part ii <e> <s> i can see the logic in saying that where someone persistently and deliberately disobeys the law in this way he should be treated more firmly than a first offender <e> <s> but that is what happens already in practice <e>", "<cs> i hope that it does not cause that amount of disquiet because on reflection i hope that my noble friend will read what i said about the increased penalties for someone who commits a greater degree of mischief <e> <s> indeed the persistent offender is probably one such person <e> <s> if that is what he does and he is caught and punished he will receive a graver and more serious punishment than he would receive for a lesser mischief <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has explained that his purpose in part was to pursue a suggestion made in the white paper about the possible recovery of policing costs from demonstration organisers and i am grateful to him for raising this so <e>", "<cs> this amendment would provide a right of appeal to either a magistrates court or to the crown court against conditions imposed by the police under clauses or and it confers a similar right of appeal against a banning order imposed under clause but the right is confined to local electors in the district concerned <e> <s> banning orders in london would not be subject to appeal <e> <s> on appeal the courts would be able to revoke or vary conditions imposed by the police or the terms of a banning order and in the case of a ban the court could spell out that it applied to a particular procession <e>", "<cs> this is a very technical area of the law and i now wish i had my noble and learned friend beside me to answer that particular point <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord hutchinson will read the <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord withdraws his amendment of course i know something but not being a lawyer i do not know in great detail about section of the civic government scotland act <e> <s> however the substance of the right of appeal in that act is equivalent to our judicial review namely the sheriff has to decide whether the council have erred in law based their decision on any incorrect material fact and exercised their discretion in an unreasonable manner or acted beyond their powers <e> <s> so there is a similarity but of course i shall look at this again <e> <s> it is a very detailed and complex area and i do not hold out much hope of being able to give the noble and learned lord the favourable response that he would want tonight <e>", "<cs> perhaps this is a good moment for us to adjourn for dinner and in moving that we adjourn perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee if i were to say that we shall not return to this bill until ten minutes past eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the committee do now adjourn <e>", "<cs> the bill as introduced in another place included a definition of public place which is currently found in section of the public order act <e> <s> that definition incorporated the phrase at the material time <e> <s> we were persuaded by the opposition to replace that definition by one based on section <e>", "<cs> i am happy to confirm that <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with the purpose of this amendment but we believe it to be unnecessary <e> <s> we entirely share the views expressed that an exclusion order should not be part of a probation order <e> <s> but clause states specifically that an exclusion order can only be made in addition to a sentence or one of the court orders described in subsection <e>", "<cs> i am happy to do that as well without prejudice <e>", "<cs> clause provides that the minimum length of an exclusion order shall not be less than three months subject to that the period for which an order shall have effect is at the discretion of the court <e> <s> that is the precedent established by orders disqualifying drivers from driving the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich has said that in the case of exclusion orders he does not think that it should be open to the court to make exclusion orders lasting for very long periods <e> <s> i acknowledge that under the licensed premises exclusion of certain persons act the maximum period of an exclusion order is two years <e> <s> but we have to bear in mind the appalling ferocity of some football-related offences and of course the risk to ordinary matchgoers that these incidents can present <e> <s> members of the committee will have read of the incident at the odsal stadium in bradford recently when a chip van caught fire <e> <s> in other incidents there have been episodes of vicious violence <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be right then to restrict the period in respect of which an exclusion order may be made <e>", "<cs> i shall of course consider the question of penalties mentioned by the noble lord lord elystan-morgan and my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington asked whether this was an appropriate bill <e> <s> i think that it is <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> i fear that i may take a little time <e> <s> this is somewhat of a second reading summary but it is so important that i ought to deal with many of the points raised <e> <s> if i do not deal with the points raised by noble and learned lords i shall write to them between now and a later stage <e>", "<cs> i shall try not to overlook anything and i shall make sure that i pay particular attention to that in the days to come <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> it is one of the points that i omitted accidentally <e> <s> of course i shall look at that point <e>", "<cs> the reason we have not repealed it is that it is still a very useful piece of legislation <e> <s> the act is designed to cater for a specific mischief <e> <s> we are not here considering disorderly behaviour likely to cause alarm harassment or distress such as will be dealt with under clause but disorderly behaviour that is aimed quite deliberately at preventing meetings transacting their business <e> <s> people who behave in such a way are abusing the privilege of a meeting being open to the public in order not to put a point of view but to disrupt that meeting to the point of making it futile <e> <s> it does not necessarily involve just politicians <e> <s> it involves all sorts of meetings and for that reason it remains an essential and useful part of the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is the rub <e> <s> in fact i would take my noble friend further and say that since people have been looking at ways of trying to reform this measure but there never seems to be a consensus <e>", "<cs> my lords where there is consensus to reform and improve section we should be happy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be a moral in that for us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i was not around at the time but i shall see what researches i can look into <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the reform or the potential reform of section i would only repeat what my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said on th march that is that we look forward to hearing any sensible proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i think that by looking at what we tried to do in one can see that it is not a party political matter <e> <s> it was the franks committee which reported to the labour government and which put out a white paper as a result of which we introduced the bill but there was no consensus at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there was a great deal of consensus over getting rid of section but i understand that there was very little consensus about how one would replace it <e>", "<cs> my lords i carefully note what the noble lord says <e> <s> but i would remind the noble lord as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor also said that we do not want to compound the felony of previous mistakes <e>", "<cs> my lords that might suit the noble lord opposite but i do not think it would suit the great majority of those in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of health and social security and the home office have recently considered the position under the <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services and the home secretary asked for an examination of the existing controls and options for change because of concern about the release from special hospitals of psychopathically disordered patients who might re-offend <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that of patients in this category who were discharged from special hospitals by a tribunal between th september and the end of four are known to have committed subsequently a serious offence of a similar nature to their original offence <e> <s> although it is a small proportion we must make sure that the present procedures under the act could be updated if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords when there is a unfortunate incident and somebody who is released re-offends of course it is natural for the media to seize upon this <e> <s> it is not in the majority of cases that this happens and of course we have to take that into account <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that we should consider those who have to serve and who work in such hospitals and those too who are suffering from this disorder <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to commend the staff for what they have done in the past and for what i know they will continue to do <e> <s> i note the point that the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> my lords considerable evidence came before my right honourable friends the secretary of state for social services and the home secretary that required them to institute this report which as the noble lord knows has gone out for consultation <e> <s> until we get replies to the consultation i believe they are due by th october i do not think that it would be wise for me to prejudge anything <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord argues that it is perhaps too soon to be amending the mental health act i am sure that he would be the first to vilify us for not reacting to the concern that one aspect of the act has presented <e> <s> as i have explained the concern which led to the report is a specific concern within the mental health act and we are at present planning no other changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is a tricky and complicated area <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put his name down for a debate or to approach my noble friend the chief whip in the usual fashion i am sure that something can be arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision to grant anderson parole was taken in the light of the available information about his background criminal record and performance in prison <e> <s> the aim was to provide a rootless persistent criminal with support which he might not otherwise accept on his release <e> <s> the full extent of his dangerousness emerged only at his latest trial <e> <s> nevertheless the tragic outcome reinforces the need which my right honourable friend and the parole board have always accepted for such decisions to be taken with the utmost care and on the basis of the fullest possible information <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say what a horrific and tragic event it was <e> <s> with regard to the whole case for parole when judge hazan commented on this case he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm what the noble lord has said that very few pre-parole leave applicants are refused and that there are very few failures <e> <s> in fact in recent years less than per cent <e> <s> of prisoners granted pre-parole leave have failed to return on time and less than one-half of per cent <e> <s> have committed a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to the parole board which has by statute a psychiatrist on it to apply for a psychiatric report whenever it wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords we fully concur with the noble lord with regard to the tremendous work that the parole board does <e> <s> indeed provided that anderson had behaved in a good and reasonable way he would have been out of prison some eight months after the tragic event but in any case he would have been paroled had he not committed a further misdemeanour two months later <e>", "<cs> my lords the parole board had full information in front of it <e> <s> it admittedly did not have a psychiatric report but that could have been provided had it wished <e> <s> the same full evidence was in front of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords we are satisfied that the decision was taken in good faith on the basis of adequate information concerning the mans background and record of offending <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we realise that distress is being caused but in very few cases when the habit is considered throughout the country and the practice is generally undertaken with good humour <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords such evidence has not come directly from the police but age concern has written to us and the matter has been raised by members of parliament in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear that <e> <s> but in that case i know that the noble lord will support us even more firmly on the public order bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding us of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i read quite a lot of comments in the press but what i prefer to believe is what actually happens <e> <s> of course it is up to all of us to make sure that the law is obeyed and to give that advice <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be up to the local authorities to take action if they so wished <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also add to the list members of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords police officers have been injured in this dispute and people have been convicted of offences connected with it <e> <s> in this country there is a long tradition of peaceful protest within the law but it is clear that some of those taking part in these demonstrations have attended with the intention of committing and provoking violence <e> <s> the way forward lies in sensible co-operation between the police and responsible trade unionists organising such demonstrations to reduce disorder and prevent violence which only the troublemakers want <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks made by the noble lord about the police and i shall make sure that my right honourable friend the home secretary is made aware of them <e> <s> the need for officers to be deployed in this way is regrettable and must have an effect on the service which the police are able to provide elsewhere <e> <s> the precise effect on crime levels is of course unlikely to be quantifiable but i am pleased to be able to report to the house that the level of police attendance required in order to maintain law and order has declined substantially since august and i hope that all responsible members of trade unions will seek to co-operate with the police to reduce violence to an absolute minimum and preferably to eliminate it altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer people have been convicted of <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends support for the public order bill <e> <s> of course anyone who commits an act of violence or comes within the remit of the bill when it becomes an act and is subject to prosecution will be dealt with in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong for me to comment on an industrial dispute <e> <s> the police are seeking to maintain law and order and a peaceful existence for people <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> he will doubtless be supporting the government on the public order bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect to my noble friend as we have a report stage coming up next week on that detailed matter it would perhaps be best to defer consideration until then <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is felt by the police that the perpetrator of harassment or violence falls within the relevant clauses of the public order bill i am sure that they will take action <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and the government are on common ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely support my noble friend in what he says when he urges responsible trade unionists to liaise with the police on those matters and to ensure that violent demonstrations do not occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do so without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the noble lords point <e> <s> i am sure that responsible trade unionists when organising a demonstration will be even more aware as a result of what your lordships have said of the need to keep the demonstration small and peaceful <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall with permission make a statement about the detention of passengers at terminal heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon asked me five questions <e> <s> the first was whether the home office can lay any claim to <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i have already answered that point <e>

gymnasium and another large hall in hounslow <e> <s> beds mattresses and clean linen were supplied and adequate <e>", "<cs> on temporary admission <e> <s> if the noble lord will let me finish what i wish to say it may save time <e> <s> the reason for not giving temporary admission is well known within the rules of the immigration system <e> <s> the justification for retaining some people for a secondary examination was confirmed by the fact that of those who were put up in accommodation have absconded <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards my noble friends first comment i confirm that the action that my right honourable friend the home secretary has taken is not racist action it could not possibly by any reasonable standard be classed as racist <e> <s> i reiterate that on th october out of

country a person is refused entry it will be for the airline to pay for his flight home <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says and i am grateful to him for giving me advance notice of that question <e> <s> that is helpful <e> <s> i confirm to him that i shall draw his remarks to the attention of my honourable friend mr waddington <e> <s> however i should say at this stage that students will require visas and if they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i concur that we believe that the visa system is the right answer <e> <s> of course we looked at all the alternatives but came down firmly in favour of the visa system <e> <s> my noble friend as he always does highlighted the nub of the problem which is the sheer weight of numbers <e> <s> in the months to the end of june people had been refused admission or removed from this country <e> <s> of these over half came from the five countries to be covered by visa regime <e>

are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps i have commented enough on this but i would ask the noble baroness to bear in mind that although one can assess as indeed we did assess the likely increase from the sub-continent direct it is extremely difficult though perhaps she has greater wisdom than all of us put together to envisage how many of those using flights from other parts of the world will come in at the same time <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones raised the very important question of the application of part iii to the gypsy community <e> <s> indeed he has referred to the representations on this issue made to my right honourable friend the home secretary by the commission for racial equality <e> <s> some members of the committee may have received a circular letter from the commission urging support for an amendment to incorporate a similar declaratory provision to that proposed by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble and learned

offences in clause to apply only to words behaviour or displays of written material which are threatening abusive or insulting to a racial group in great britain <e> <s> we believe this would limit the effectiveness of these provisions in dealing with offensive and inflammatory material <e>", "<cs> i shall look at those points but i think it is up to the courts rather than me to advise the noble lord <e>", "<cs> to deal first with amendments nos <e> <s> and we appreciate the concerns which have been expressed by the noble and learned lord lord silkin and the noble lord lord donaldson on these points <e> <s> there is no doubt that the kind of behaviour which clause is designed to catch is reprehensible and undesirable wherever it takes place <e> <s> that is why we rightly include both public and private places <e> <s> however the effect of these amendments would be to bring within the scope of the offences activities of a purely private nature such as conversations and exchanges of opinion between friends <e> <s> i know that noble lords did not give those examples but those are the sort of things that would be caught by these amendments <e>", "<cs> i shall take the proposal away

escaped our notice to date <e>", "<cs> this might be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement about visas which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for welcoming the statement <e> <s> the noble lord asked why we do not impose visa requirements on every country which imposes visa requirements on this country <e> <s> we impose visa requirements to meet an operational or other need <e> <s> we do not believe that it would serve any useful purpose to retaliate against a country that imposed a visa restriction on this country <e> <s> generally because of our geographical situation we are in the happy position of being able to rely on our system of control of visitors at the ports <e> <s> this works well in most cases and is the cheapest of the very different types of immigration control arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> indeed i know that there are people who wish to come here to settle not only in england but in wales scotland and northern ireland as well and we welcome them <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> from the party opposite and ourselves there has come agreement that the immigration system must work properly <e> <s> unfortunately and as i said it is regrettable we have had to impose visas because our system

in this measure <e> <s> when i went to australia i did not need a visa yet it does not worry me now that i need a visa to go to america <e> <s> with regard to the remarks of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls i do not think i can add anything to the comment i have already made that we wish to make the system workable <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord mishcon somewhat confused me by

indeed in an ideal world we should not have to have visas <e> <s> but as i explained on friday and as my right honourable friend the home secretary has said on many occasions it is the continual and growing pressure on the immigration service by this increasing minority that has forced us to take the action that we have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords there comes a time when every government have to take action <e> <s> the noble lord has rightly pointed to one circumstance where inconvenience could have been caused and we regret that inconvenience <e> <s> there is no doubt in our mind and it is clear from the evidence that there was a continual and growing problem to such an extent that my right honourable friend had to act and act quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be right for me to comment on that situation yet because they may be able to apply for their visas by post or other means if they so desired <e> <s> with regard to the point raised by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i think his comment is a rather useful one at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we come back to the ground we were covering on friday <e> <s> whenever one draws the line or says that one intends to introduce visas one is open to criticism <e> <s> we believe that the situation was deteriorating and the pressure of those wishing to beat the system and clog the wheels was making life so difficult that we had to act and act quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his points <e> <s> i am sure that it will be seen when some of the emotion that is i fear clouding the issue at the moment dies down that the government took the right decision <e> <s> of course i shall pass on to my right honourable friend the home secretary my noble friends points about looking at the whole of the visa system <e>", "<cs> it is not the purpose of part iii to affect the private expression of opinion of an individual in his own home <e> <s> for this reason the use of words or behaviour in a private dwelling is not covered by clause <e> <s> we do not believe however that this exemption should be extended to private places other than dwellings <e> <s> in the general order of things conversations in a dwelling will be between an individual and his friends or relatives <e> <s> even if they are not of like mind on matters concerning members of ethnic minorities they are unlikely to be said to be setting out to stir up racial hatred in a way that threatens public order <e> <s> any disagreement that arises at the time is likely to be on a small

section <e>", "<cs> i should tell the noble lord lord grimond that i said that the words in all the circumstances were more apt than taken as a whole and in our view cover all the ground and more than the words taken as a whole so there was another strand to my argument <e>", "<cs> with due respect i think that the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington was wrong when he said that clause could be distinguished from the rest of part iii <e> <s> i do not believe that that is the case because the offence in clause is that of giving a performance of a play and it is therefore similar to the mischief in clause and the publishing in clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon gave a very good example of a play where a lot of the audience walked out after say three-quarters of the play <e>

beginning to the end <e> <s> not only that but he could also take account of the nature of the audience outside political events and so forth <e> <s> we believe that what we propose is slightly better than taken as a whole <e> <s> i am sorry to disagree with noble lords opposite but we believe that the judge should have no difficulty in situations such as those envisaged by the noble lord lord mishcon in directing the jury to look at the play as a whole from the beginning of the first scene to the end <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord foot that using the words taken as a whole in clause would be ridiculous <e> <s> that is what i said earlier <e> <s> what i have said is that the words that we have used in all the circumstances are the same as and cover the same ground as taken as a whole <e> <s> contrary to what my noble friend lord beloff has said i think that i will take this matter back to have another look at it <e> <s> it will not be the first point in this bill that i have taken back to have a look at <e> <s> i have already taken back a number of matters this afternoon as well as at earlier stages <e> <s> i promise to have another look at this one <e>", "<cs> i think that the argument used against me in the last amendment with regard to the words spoken in the merchant of venice would provide the defence that the director or presenter needed <e> <s> there is also the case where the actor may depart from the script and the director may not be present or he may be totally unaware of the circumstances in which the actor was going to depart from the script <e> <s> we have tried to protect the innocent presenter or director in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> it slightly troubles me that noble lords opposite are taking a different attitude on this amendment from that which they took on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should have thought that to be consistent they would welcome the amendment <e> <s> all one is doing in this instance is saying that there is to be a defence for a presenter or director in various circumstances where he did not know or had no reason to suspect that various offences would be committed <e> <s> surely that is a logical protection for a presenter or director <e> <s> it will be for the courts to decide whether he would have known but one can well imagine a situation where an actor ad libs and his words create a situation which engenders racial hatred <e> <s> i do not think that in those circumstances the person presenting or directing the performance should be held responsible <e> <s> when it comes to the writer i would point out to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney that the writer would fall within part iii of the bill <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the purpose of paragraph <e>", "<cs> i take that

the amendment but that i would look at the noble and learned lords point to see whether it could be refined <e>", "<cs> i am conscious of the time and it was for that reason that i phrased my reply to

<s> clearly some programmes which are broadcast or transmitted by cable originate on film or videotape which in due course are shown or played <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to limit overlap between the two offences <e> <s> in other words if a cable company were in showing to transmit a racially inciting film simply to transmit it the company should be prosecuted for the act of transmission under clause <e>", "<cs> i think it would be better if i wrote to the noble lord on this point <e>", "<cs> responsibility for what is broadcast on radio and television rests with the broadcasting

noble lords amendment with regard to clause in order to clarify the point <e> <s> before doing so it is right that i should say a few words about the reply of my noble friend lord glenarthur at an earlier stage when he undertook without commitment to see whether clause could be improved and to discuss the whole of the matter with the association of chief police officers <e> <s> i have to advise the house that we did not believe that the clause could be improved <e> <s> i am sorry that the explanation for that decision is rather complicated <e> <s> however i will try to put it succinctly

to this bill until twenty-five minutes before nine oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington said quite rightly that this amendment was not moved at committee stage but he foreshadowed in the clause stand part debate the areas of his concern so the arguments of the noble lord are familiar to your lordships and indeed those arguments failed to persuade the committee

and clause already require that such directions should he given in writing where they are made in advance of the event <e> <s> i believe that any extension of this requirement to cover the giving of directions by the police officer at the scene would be wholly impractical <e> <s> the amendments try to recognise this by stipulating that the requirement should apply only where it is reasonably practicable <e> <s> however i would suggest that it is unlikely ever to be practicable for an officer policing a demonstration which threatens to breach one of the four tests to take out his notebook

change their names or the titles of processions to avoid a ban <e> <s> i think this important point is one that perhaps has not been given due weight which i feel it ought to have been given be noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the government have shown how reasonable they are <e> <s> after many hours of toiling and burning the midnight oil in order to seek solutions and compromises to satisfy the opposition <e> <s> i am happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment which we have seen before at an earlier stage would provide a right of appeal to either a magistrates court or a crown court against conditions imposed by the police under clause or clause and it confers a similar right of appeal against a banning order imposed under clause but the right is here conferred on to local electors in the district concerned <e> <s> banning orders in london would not be subject to appeal <e> <s> on appeal the courts would be able to revoke or vary conditions imposed by the police or the terms of a banning order and in the case of a ban the court could spell out that it applied to a particular procession if so desired <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich has explained that the purpose of this amendment is to improve upon the definition of public procession currently found in clause <e> <s> he argues that the definition there employed takes us no further forward and that it should be brought into line with the definition of a public assembly namely that a public procession must be one consisting of or more persons <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no difference between us here <e> <s> we are all concerned to see that written material words and behaviour which stir up racial hatred against gypsies who are of a distinct ethnic group should be penalised in the same way as they would be if they stirred up hatred against any other ethnic or racial group <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the purpose of part iii to affect the private expression of opinion of an individual in his own home <e> <s> for this reason the use of words or behaviour in a private dwelling is not covered by clause <e> <s> we do not believe however that this exemption should be extended to private places other than dwellings even if this would only apply to meetings of a maximum of persons <e> <s> in the general order of things conversations in a dwelling will be between an individual and his friends or relatives <e> <s> even if they are not of like minds on matters concerning members of ethnic minorities they are i think unlikely to be setting out to stir up racial hatred in a way which threatens public order and any disagreement which arises at the time is likely to be on a small scale <e> <s> however when it comes to other private places it is much more likely that people will be present who have no link of friendship between them and that there may be an intention to stir up racial hatred on a scale which does threaten public order <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mishcon has pointed out this amendment is similar in purpose to one which we considered in committee <e> <s> as i said on that occasion i appreciate the noble lorlds concern that offensive graffiti especially racially offensive graffiti should be removed <e> <s> doing so seems at the least a sensible element in a housing management policy and we would encourage local authorities to maintain the environment of their areas in this way whenever possible <e> <s> the need to do so is all the more pressing where members of ethnic minority groups are being daily offended by racist graffiti <e> <s> the government do not generally however believe it right to impose extra statutory duties on local authorities unless they are absolutely necessary and i would repeat our argument which the noble lord lord mishcon suitably encapsulated at an earlier stage <e> <s> we do not believe that it would be right to impose a duty of this kind in this context <e> <s> this amendment places a duty on local authorities to remove graffiti and posters and other displays which are likely to stir up racial hatred from highways for which they are responsible and from any curtilage adjacent thereto <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall reply to some of the additional points <e> <s> i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> it was perhaps because of shortness of time that i restricted my reply <e> <s> the definition in clause is the one that we always bear in mind <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords lord

still have this matter under consideration with a view to coming back at third reading <e> <s> i can confirm that to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we discussed this amendment two days ago and the two plays that my noble friend mentioned were the two plays mentioned on that occasion <e> <s> i understand that the clause is taken from the theatres act <e> <s> the matter that is in dispute is whether these words are the right words in all the circumstances or whether the words which are in the theatres act as existing taking the performance as a whole should be

remarks of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i refer him to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend if i was too brief in trying to answer him <e> <s> broadcasting including programmes in cable programme services is dealt with in clause of the bill as it stands <e> <s> the rearrangement of part iii of the bill was done in order to bring all the offences with regard to publishing or distributing written material public performances of plays broadcasting or the possession of racially inflammatory material into one common part which is part iii of the bill to make it easier for all of us who would wish to seek reference to particular points <e>", "<cs> my lords we agreed at committee stage to take this point away and have a look at it <e> <s> like my noble friend lord campbell of alloway i was swayed when i read the words of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones which my noble friend quoted <e> <s> for a noble and learned lord of his reputation to come out with such words gave us cause to think again <e> <s> indeed we have thought quite deeply about this and have concluded that it would be appropriate to raise the maximum sentence to years in line with my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i reply to the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> i hope what i said was that the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington was the only one who had spoken against the amendment at that stage <e> <s> i believe contrary to the noble earl that the mood of the house is all-important because if one is to test the amendment in a division it is the mood of the house that matters <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord stanley has explained this amendment attempts to extend the scope of this clause so that the police powers of direction can be deployed against animal rights demonstrators and others who seek to prevent legitimate activities by members of the farming community on their own land <e> <s> however i have to say to my noble friend that i think the amendment goes a little wider than this <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may reply to the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> the purpose and intent of this clause is certainly not to impinge upon industrial disputes <e> <s> it is to cope with a serious menace of mass trespass <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal purpose of this clause is to give the police an effective power to act when dealing with trespassing itinerant groups <e> <s> members of those groups may and do commit specific criminal acts <e> <s> where a criminal act is committed the police do of course have power to proceed against the perpetrator if they can identify him and obtain sufficient evidence against him <e> <s> that is a very significant condition in the circumstances we are considering <e> <s> in dealing with a crowd of people it is frequently difficult to identify and bring proceedings against an individual offender <e> <s> the police may come across a trail of destruction left behind by one of these groups and yet have no way of knowing who is responsible <e> <s> further even if they can prosecute the person responsible this does not give them any power to deal with the wider group <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i was urged by a number of your lordships to reduce the number of vehicles in the clause <e> <s> various numbers were canvassed but the general thrust of comment was that the police powers of direction should not depend upon there being vehicles <e> <s> indeed i was chastised again by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on that just now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has as usual made himself clear <e> <s> i am advised that even without this new defence a defendant will be able to challenge the lawfulness of the direction which has led to the charge against him <e> <s> moreover i remind your lordships that the commission of an offence arises only if the person directed to leave the land fails to do so as soon as reasonably practical or re-enters within three months <e> <s> in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i say a few words to make the governments position clear <e> <s> with regard to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord stanley we have considered and been swayed by the force of his arguments <e> <s> i am happy to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords by comparison with private land the problems which occur on highway verges and lay-bys are not of the same order <e> <s> the element of damage or harassment of the landowner does not necessarily arise or if it does at least not to the same degree <e> <s> the consequence for our <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i have to say straight away to my noble friend that we do not think his amendment satisfactory <e> <s> we want to have a provision which is clear and effective <e> <s> perhaps i may mention briefly some of the disadvantages of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> his amendment would leave unclear what is to be regarded as adjacent land <e> <s> he has tried to deal with that point but i fear that it would not satisfy myself nor the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> nor does it make it clear whether the occupiers of the land have to ask all the trespassers to leave or only one or whether where threatening words or behaviour are used all the occupiers should be victims <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has explained with the present wording there might be some doubt as to whether the clause catches those who have a permanent place of residence elsewhere <e> <s> it is desirable to catch such people as well as those who have nowhere else to live <e> <s> and certainly we do not want the police to have to investigate whether the persons concerned have a place of residence elsewhere before being able to act <e> <s> that was a point well put by my noble friend lord clinton <e> <s> this amendment places the point beyond doubt and i am happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect i think that the noble lord has gone considerably wide of the question on the order paper and that to comment on modern events without an appropriate question being put down would be wrong <e> <s> suffice it to say that the prison officer-inmate ratio has come down from just after the war to now <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of a fresh start is again wide of the question on the order paper but we believe it to be absolutely fundamental to cure some of the problems facing us at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords it all depends on what equipment is required by those who own and run the football stadiums <e> <s> if they want to go for an expensive system i am sure that they will judge that on their budgets <e> <s> but we believe that the basic system which the police find satisfactory is well within the capabilities of football clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed my right honourable friend the prime minister has said plenty of nice things about football clubs and i should like to join her in saying i am glad that they have come along with the government in this partnership to try to improve the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not those figures but i can tell the house that arrests at football league grounds at divisions and matches fell by per cent <e> <s> last season <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the football trust which is a legally independent body established by a

between the police forces throughout europe on the matter of drugs <e> <s> whether special constables have a role in combating drugs offences is we think questionable because of the high specialist

the end of august that the soviet union provided full technical information about the accident to the international atomic energy agency <e> <s> i think it would be wrong for me to comment on my noble friends question as to whether or not we thought there would be another chernobyl <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two aspects to that question <e> <s> the first is what would happen if there were an accident in this country <e> <s> it is of course up to the operator of the plant to provide a suitable scheme to take account of any accident and preferably of course to prevent the accident from happening <e> <s> the nuclear industry in this country has a very good safety record on that front <e> <s> with regard to an accident overseas that is one of the matters that we are addressing in our work at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the noble lord was right to write to the ministry of agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is rehearsing questions and arguments

successful conference <e> <s> in addition to the confiscation powers the act creates offences of laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking and of prejudicing an investigation <e> <s> it also

but i am sure that the noble lord will need no reminding from me that it is not only guns with which we are concerned but ammunition <e> <s> in in addition to the or so firearms that the noble lord mentioned there were something like rounds of ammunition surrendered <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the difficulties that we are looking at is that it has been the usual practice in the past to couple an amnesty with legislation which was the case in and <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to shotguns the police and shotgun users agree that the storage of these weapons is important in keeping them out of

were reported to have been used still number less than per cent <e> <s> of the total number of all reckonable offences <e> <s> that is still too high a percentage and it is that we want to reduce

temptation to vandals <e> <s> one of the factors that british telecom is trying to emphasise at the moment is the value of the public payphone system to the local community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that british telecom considered that point but i shall make sure it is made aware of the noble lords comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that the answer was as simple as that <e> <s> however i am able to tell the house that the number of phonecard telephones which have no cash boxes is increasing steadily and currently stands at some <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that considerable research has taken place and the results are appearing in the building of booths in a new style and the introduction of equipment that is more resistant to vandalism <e> <s> important new features of payphones are improved lighting open plan design tough construction materials and telephones which report automatically when cash boxes need to be emptied <e> <s> the research is paying dividends <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount of vandalism varies from area to area and from person to person <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> following a recent scrutiny of the band the commissioner has decided that it should remain in being but that changes should be made to its organisation use and staffing with the aim of improving value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords the band will be in uniform <e> <s> i am sure that the metropolitan police will make sure that the positions in the band are widely advertised so that ethnic minorities and others can take part <e>", "<cs> my lords it will concentrate more on community events and will spend less time on commercial engagements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for that question because at the moment the band plays at community events schools and charity concerts as well as on ceremonial occasions <e> <s> we wish to encourage that side of the use of the band <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly said it is important

noble lords lord harris of greenwich and lord mishcon for welcoming the draft order before your lordships <e> <s> the fact that those were the only comments made on it leads me to agree very firmly with my noble friend lord maude of straford-upon-avon who said that the reasoned amendment is nothing but a balloon that is raised at every opportunity by the liberal party and that it will do that

excuse <e> <s> all knives are dangerous in the wrong hands including carving knives pen knives and stanley knives all of which have legitimate uses <e> <s> it would be difficult to ban the sale of a

firearms regardless of the method of sale <e> <s> we expect traders to act responsibly concerning the sale of such items <e> <s> with regard to crossbows and items of martial arts we have circulated the traders concerning the sale of martial arts equipment which i have already referred to and the crossbows bill will help if it receives parliamentary approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord i thought he was referring not only to advertising but also to mail order <e> <s> a point about mail order is that the sale of firearms as in a shop is closely regulated <e> <s> we shall continue to monitor the situation very closely but there are no plans at the moment to ban mail order sales <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble viscount broke off the end of his knife i am sure it was still an offensive weapon <e> <s> however as it had a legitimate use its possession would have been very difficult to prosecute <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very grateful if any

of the house the important point about safeguarding the public <e> <s> the argument i put to him which is probably the main argument that convinced us to leave the situation as it is is that where there is a dangerous psychopath who has committed only a relatively minor offence he could be released very much earlier if there were a change such as that which my noble friend suggests than if the law is left as it is at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are stepping into legal territory and i fear i must decline to answer <e> <s> however as a layman i think i agree with the noble lord <e>",

is very much in line with government policy in this instance is one that should remain within the bill <e>", "<cs> the nature of the charge is on a full cost recovery basis but i fear i have misinterpreted the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the safety certificates which include fire in respect of designated sports grounds under regulations are the matters about which i am talking <e>", "<cs> the statutory duty imposed under section a of the act which is inserted by this clause is an important feature of the modified system of fire precaution controls which we are seeking to introduce through this bill <e> <s> the statutory duty will ensure that fire precautions in premises put to a designated use which are exempted from certification can be kept up to the necessary standard <e>", "<cs> there is little i can add because as i read the bill the situation is already covered <e> <s> even if we add the words i cannot see what effect that would have on an occupier who for example does not maintain a sufficient number of fire extinguishers when the power is already in the bill to remedy the situation <e>", "<cs> the bill is silent on the maximum period which may be allowed by the fire authority for the occupier to remedy a contravention of the statutory duty <e> <s> the period must be at least days since this is the time within which an appeal against an improvement notice may be brought by the occupier under new section e which is also inserted by this clause <e> <s> it is for the fire authority to determine what period should be allowed to remedy the contravention and it will no doubt have regard to the seriousness of the contravention and the extent of work required to remedy it <e>", "<cs> i believe that the words exceptional circumstances have hidden hazards for interpretation <e> <s> if one can envisage the situation of an inspector who will be a senior man at this stage going round and saying to a business man you must carry out certain works in order to satisfy me and these works have to be done by a certain time he then has that little bit of flexibility if good will is shown to extend the period and resolve the dispute as quickly as possible <e> <s> the last thing that anybody who is involved with the fire service wants is in fact a fire <e> <s> they would be much happier preventing it and trying to help the situation and the owner in the first place by creating a climate in which a fire does not occur <e> <s> if the owner prevaricates and seeks to use the words exceptional circumstances to delay the necessary work and this is where i see the hidden hazard i believe that this could lead to a difficult situation that might have to be resolved by a court of law <e> <s> that yet further delays the situation <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the very laudable intentions of the noble lord lord mishcon in putting forward this amendment but i invite the committee to take a close look at its effect in relation to the existing fire certification system as modified by the bill <e>", "<cs> i can confirm that the government attach the greatest importance to fire authorities having effective arrangements to deal with premises that present a serious risk to persons in case of fire <e> <s> at the same time it is the responsibility of the government and parliament to ensure that any powers made available to enforcement agencies such as fire authorities are not excessive and that the legitimate interests of occupiers are safeguarded <e> <s> i therefore welcome the opportunity which this group of amendments and new clauses has provided for us to discuss this issue today <e>", "<cs> clause follows mr justice popplewells recommendation that authorised officers of the local authority be given powers to issue notices to prohibit or restrict the use of sports grounds where there is a serious risk to spectators <e> <s> the new power replaces the existing powers of section of the act under which any prohibition order is issued by the courts on the application of county regional or island councils and in greater london or the metropolitan counties the london borough and district councils respectively <e> <s> those are the certificating authorities <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mishcon has so lucidly explained this amendment seeks to implement mr justice popplewells recommendation that sports grounds which are not designated under the act but which have a stand with capacity for or more spectators should be <e>", "<cs> i am not able to satisfy the noble lord lord mishcon with regard to the criteria he asked for at the end of his additional speech <e> <s> i understand the situation to be that by amending the act we are covering the point which the noble lord is seeking to cover by his amendment <e> <s> mr justice popplewells report presented two alternatives <e> <s> one alternative was to amend the act but that is not as efficacious as amending the act which we are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord would want me to read exactly what he said <e> <s> i should like to take that last point away so that i do not give him the wrong answer now <e> <s> if that is acceptable to the noble lord perhaps we can come back to this point <e> <s> it is important from both sides of the house to get this right <e> <s> i should hate to give him a misleading answer now <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has elucidated that this amendment is designed to give effect to a recommendation of mr justice popplewell in his final report that all indoor sports facilities with accommodation for over spectators should require a fire certificate under the fire precautions act <e>", "<cs> it is paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the recent strengthening of the law there are still a number of areas where discrimination on grounds of sex is not illegal <e> <s> some of that discrimination disadvantages men and some disadvantages women <e> <s> notwithstanding the remarks of the noble lord the government are not aware that there is a great deal of concern on this matter or that it causes great difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the sex discrimination act does not affect the present system of inherited peerages <e>", "<cs> possibly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking entirely personally no because i should not be here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am even more tempted not to succumb to the noble lords blandishments <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords our major prison building programme will yield a further places in new and expanded prisons by the mid-s <e> <s> we are making better use of the existing prison estate where necessary by changing the functions of establishments to match changes which have occurred and are projected to occur in the nature of the prison population <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fortunate in this country to have open to the judiciary perhaps the greatest range of non custodial sentences available anywhere <e> <s> these have been taken up in a number of ways <e> <s> for instance community service orders have gone up from to <e> <s> over the same time-scale probation orders have gone up from to <e> <s> so full use is being made of those alternatives <e>", "<cs> my lords we are trying to improve the situation as regards speed of trials <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has made the position considerably better by the creation of further courts and additional members of the judiciary <e> <s> whether or not a person is remanded in custody of course depends upon the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty with the proposal of the right reverand prelate is to get any agreement as to what the right level for a prison population is and whether it is right for my right honourable friend the home secretary or for any home secretary to turn to a judge and say there is no room for these people in prison or i cannot release that number of people <e> <s> it has been tried as the right reverend prelate says in various countries <e> <s> for that reason two-thirds of the convicted prisoners in holland are still awaiting their time in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is absolutely right and in fact it is the duty of parliament to provide a variety of non-custodial sentences as well as the option of a prison sentence <e> <s> it is up to the independent judiciary to determine what sentence is appropriate <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right in stating that the governments policy is to reduce the level of crime and the number of those who re-offend once they have been convicted <e>", "<cs> my lords we are seeking various methods of funding to encourage treatments for alcoholism and drug abuse both outside and within prison <e> <s> with regard to the second question of my noble kinswoman the matter of sentences is of course up to the judiciary <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time that the then home secretary made that statement he was absolutely right to say what he did <e> <s> unfortunately the prediction of future trends in the prison population has proved a very difficult task to carry out with any accuracy and the prison population has increased far more dramatically than he predicted <e> <s> the way to overcome this problem is first to improve the regimes within prison so that there is a greater flexibility for accepting prisoners who are sentenced or remanded in custody late on in the afternoon and secondly to improve the prison building programme which should have been started before the government came to office <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a number of points which would take a great deal of time to answer <e> <s> it is wise to point out to the house that as a percentage the level of overcrowding is the same today as it was in <e> <s> it is a problem that has remained with us <e> <s> where we have failed in the past is in providing adequate resources to build new prisons <e> <s> this is what the government are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the bail act and bail hostels a number of options are available to the judiciary <e> <s> it is part of our programme to continue to bring them to the attention of the judiciary but at the end of the day it is up to the judiciary and not the executive to decide on each case <e>", "<cs> my lords we deplore the fact that some people on remand are kept in police cells overnight <e> <s> as i explained in an earlier answer this is what we want to get rid of by building more prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a substantial reduction in the number of prisoners as a result of the bail act but unfortunately the number of those on remand has increased <e> <s> it is the increase in the numbers on remand rather than the number of sentenced prisoners that has posed the problems of overcrowding that we have today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is wise on each case for the judiciary to have an option of sentences <e> <s> it is up to the judge having heard the full details of the case to make up his mind what the appropriate sentence should be <e> <s> but we do not hesitate to draw to the attention of the judiciary the range of non-custodial options should they be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords we have given consideration and are continuing to give consideration to that report <e> <s> i believe that a motion for a debate is down on the order paper but the date has not yet been fixed <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware we are seeking to encourage the use of civilians for some police work in order to make well-trained officers available for operational duties <e> <s> that is what we are seeking to encourage <e> <s> a number of forces have significant posts where police officers could be replaced by civilians <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that as a result of the manpower increases announced last may a further posts will be made available by civilians able to do jobs that officers used to do <e>", "<cs> my lords police manpower has increased <e> <s> of course we all remember the low base from which we started in <e>", "<cs> my lords that was one of the reasons why the crown prosecution service was set up <e> <s> as regard traffic wardens i am afraid that under the remit of this question i am unable to help the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of november last year there were police vacancies which is an average deficiency of about per cent <e> <s> in the average was about per cent <e> <s> we hope that before long police manpower will be up to the limit for each police force and budgets have been made accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know a certain amount of the work of officers can be undertaken by civilians but the writing of reports is extremely important and even more important when <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not know but i shall look into the matter for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the government is keen to see an increase in the number of black and asian police officers <e> <s> a very useful national conference of police recruiting officers was held last october and we are now considering how to put its recommendations into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course control at present through the broadcasting act <e> <s> also the bbc has followed the example of the independent network <e> <s> there is control too by the cable authority <e> <s> the government are at the moment looking to the time when we shall be able to receive programmes directly through dishes without cable <e>", "<cs> my lords the per cent <e> <s> to which the noble baroness referred is of european community origin at the moment <e> <s> naturally enough the great majority of that in this country is british <e> <s> it will be up to the viewers whether that amount changes because they will be able to switch off if they receive a programme which is not to their liking <e> <s> as to the future we believe that the council of europe offers greater scope because it involves many more countries than the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why we have the broadcasting act and the cable authority <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware within the broadcasting act and the bbcs charter we have set down the terms under which broadcasters should manage their businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of the work done by my noble friend and all the other noble lords on the committee <e> <s> the government are extremely grateful to them for the hard work which they have put into studying this matter and look forward to receiving the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me three supplementary questions <e> <s> yes we have everyones best interests at heart <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm to the house that at the annual general meeting last week the governors voted unanimously in support of the proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his support <e> <s> however we are negotiating not only with the prison officers association but also with the other unions involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the advantages of fresh start are essentially higher basic pay and a guaranteed level of earnings for a much reduced working week <e> <s> there will also be other benefits such as the opportunity to work in groups and more job continuity <e> <s> we are introducing the proposition of fresh start because the present arrangements are iniquitous for the prison officer for his family and for the service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is being very pessimistic <e> <s> negotiations have not concluded with the prison officers association there is a further meeting tomorrow <e> <s> the noble lords question is therefore hypothetical <e>", "<cs> my lords the fresh start proposals should be implemented regardless of whether there is overcrowding <e> <s> as the noble lord will be the first to admit the present regimes in prisons are not satisfactory <e> <s> overcrowding is a different question and i should be happy to answer a question put down on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally agree with my noble friend on his first point <e> <s> with his experience he will know the importance of getting new regimes into the prison service <e> <s> at the moment the average prison officer is working about hours overtime per week and taking home some per annum <e>", "<cs> my lords the prison service has lived with overcrowding for many years <e> <s> the present percentage of overcrowding is about the same as in the previous two decades <e> <s> it is entirely up to the judiciary whether a prisoner is held on remand and it is the duty of the home secretary to provide a prison place <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a question which is wide of the question on the order paper but in view of the noble lords interest i shall try to answer him <e> <s> from memory i think the population is about as opposed to a certified normal accommodation of <e> <s> such a proportion of overcrowding has remained fairly constant for the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very happy to answer that question from the noble baroness but it is slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all those who have taken part in the interesting debate on this subject that we debate annually and particularly for the measured tones in which the noble lords lord mishcon lord meston and lord hylton made their remarks <e>", "<cs> the noble lord underestimates his powers of persuasion <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to a number of powers under the act and his words will be studied very carefully by my right honourable friend <e> <s> i am sure that he will welcome any constructive suggestion on this piece of legislation as with any other legislation <e> <s> we have discussed the provisions of this act with the irish <e> <s> they are aware of and they understand the problems we face <e> <s> in fact irish governments have themselves introduced special measures to deal with the scourge of terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i have to reply to the debate at minutes past eight at the very latest and there are four more speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity which the motion of the noble lord lord donaldson has provided for this interesting debate on prisons <e> <s> because prisons are a closed community with which the vast majority of the public have no contact there is all too little public knowledge or debate about them <e> <s> i am therefore grateful to the noble lord for the chance to set out for the record how the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear to support the words of the noble lord lord mishcon that our good reputation for political asylum in this country must not be spoilt <e> <s> that is the reason we have had to bring in the measures because it is solely what has been happening in the very recent past at an increasing rate that has caused an unprecedented situation that had not been foreseen <e> <s> that is the reason that my right honourable friend has had to take the action that he has and that accounts for the urgency of the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to mislead the house and therefore i cannot give a precise answer <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord and to the house is that a great many were used <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought the noble lord had accused me of saying something in the statement which i was repeating <e> <s> the examples that my honourable friend mr waddington gave <e>", "<cs> my lords he was honourable at the time he gave two examples it was not on st august but i believe that i am right in saying it was on st august but these were not the only two examples as i understand the situation <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury wanted some examples at the time and he was given two <e> <s> but he cannot say that those are not the only two that the government must be tied to <e> <s> most of the who have arrived over the past couple of months of whom not all are tamils are still under review <e> <s> i conclude at this stage by saying that this measure is not an hysterical answer <e> <s> it is solely to protect our integrity and reputation for political asylum which has been abused that we have taken the steps we took today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend who as is always the case put his finger on the very salient point that our reputation is being threatened by people taking action to countervail the visa requirements that have been working very well up to recently <e> <s> when a loophole such as this exploited it does considerable harm to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is much wider than the particular case which the noble lord raised <e> <s> as i said in the statement the figure is <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should concentrate on the present <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord would be the first to agree with me that the great majority of refugees would not be affected in any way by what my right honourable friend proposes <e> <s> until the recent increase in the number of applications made from abroad most applications for asylum had been made in this country by people who were already here and genuine refugees do not generally have to travel far in order to obtain immediate safety <e> <s> refuge can often be found in neighbouring countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> we all sometimes tend to underestimate the good work that is done by civil servants in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords where there is a genuine case i am sure that my right honourable friend will continue to carry out the good work on that front <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that there is a great difference between the genuine refugee or asylum seeker and somebody who wishes to seek a better life in the west <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i made that admission <e> <s> in any case a person from iran is not required to come here to seek asylum <e> <s> that can be done in a neighbouring country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has quoted quite a lot of what i was going to be able to tell the house from the letter that i wrote to him following the committee stage with regard to his specific request <e> <s> of course that body the committee of the cfbac will be one of the organisations that we shall consult <e> <s> as i happen to chair the bi-annual meeting of that committee held at the home office i think that i am now cast very firmly in the role of fulfilling that obligation <e> <s> i would also say to the noble lord lord mishcon that of course there are the designation orders which have to come before parliament under the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> at that time we intend that the guidance will also be available to your lordships <e> <s> with that i hope that the noble lord may be able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord mishcon which was echoed by the noble lord lord lord dean of beswick that clause a might lead to the fire authority granting an exemption in circumstances which did not merit it because an inspection had not been carried out <e> <s> i can assure both noble lords that this is not the intention of the provision and i am confident that fire authorities will not act in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he clarify one statement that he made <e> <s> is the amendment related purely to multi-occupation and plural ownership premises or does it apply to all premises within schedule to the act being schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we have ranged considerably wider than prohibition notices <e> <s> we have moved almost into a second reading debate on this matter <e> <s> i say first to the noble lord lord mishcon and to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter specifically on the prohibition notice side that i am grateful for their welcome <e> <s> indeed they put forward solid arguments and my right honourable friend thought that the right thing to do was to bring forward an amendment at this stage <e> <s> i am grateful for their work on this matter <e> <s> i have had a lot of inspiration since the noble lord lord mishcon asked me that question but i have not had quite enough to be able to answer him at the moment <e> <s> perhaps i may write to him in the usual form and put a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no difference between the noble lord and the government on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now reached the final stage in our deliberations on the bill before it is sent for consideration to another place <e> <s> a bill dealing as this one does with public safety demands serious attention and a non-partisan approach <e> <s> i need hardly say that your lordships have provided both <e> <s> the government are grateful for the welcome which was given to the bill by all sides of the house and for the efforts of your lordships to improve the bill and to seek clarification of its provisions <e> <s> we have made a number of technical and minor amendments and in two respects namely fire safety prohibition notices and frequency of inspections of sports grounds the bill has been significantly changed to take account of the views of the house <e> <s> the effect of those changes has been to strengthen further the fire precautions act and the safety of sports grounds act <e> <s> i am sure that these changes will be well received in another place and that the bill as a whole will be given the same thoughtful reception there as it has received here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will be aware the police have a large number of demands made on them <e> <s> however i know that they take very seriously the problem of cruelty to animals and do all that they can to combat it <e> <s> in this as in all their work the police have the wholehearted support of this government <e> <s> their efforts and those of the rspca inspectors are invaluable in countering mistreatment of animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy on behalf of the government to welcome the words of the noble lord with regard to the rspca <e> <s> of course we applaud its very fine work in this area <e> <s> however we do not think it appropriate to give the police a general power of entry to private land or premises when investigating allegations of cruelty to animals <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware the question of the issuing of search warrants was discussed at length when the police and criminal evidence bill now the act was before your lordships in <e> <s> that confined the occasion to the more serious arrestable offences <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are differences between the cases <e> <s> many of the incidents to which the rspca has referred in discussions that i have had relate to incidents when owners were not present <e> <s> animals had been left in the home without food and water and there was of course no one to answer the door <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite knows that we are always prepared to consult and to listen <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of my noble friends questions <e>", "<cs> my lords of course as i am sure the noble earl will be the first to appreciate there has been considerable legislation since <e> <s> in fact <e> <s> i see that some -plus orders or acts of parliament have been passed since then eight last year under this government <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill also proposes to double the term of imprisonment <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that this government deplore any cruelty to animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse the question of my noble friend <e> <s> of course the fact that we are animal lovers was one of the reasons for so many complaints as mentioned by my noble friend lord brougham <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed and i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> of course the range of animals that have been kept by people has changed as he so rightly says <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the police to report to the home office the statistics for offences against the sunday trading laws <e> <s> as soon as we have them and are able to complete the criminal statistics they will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the noble lords sentiments <e> <s> that is why we introduced a bill which unfortunately did not proceed beyond second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble and learned lord the details that he would like until we have them before us but i am sure that the full light will be revealed in september or october <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether prosecutions are instituted is up to the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords if the liberal party had given overwhelming support to the governments proposals last year we would not be in this state now <e>", "<cs> my lords if the party opposite is as divided as it always is i can only refer the noble lord to the fact that it divided on second reading against the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not know what the whipping arrangements for that party were in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords if they were open there is sufficient power under the act as my noble friend will be aware for the local authority to take action if it so wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord misheard me <e> <s> it is not up to the government it is up to local authorities in this instance <e>", "<cs>

any such evidence or allegations he should present them to my right honourable friend the home secretary but nothing has been presented to him <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble and learned

from the question on the order paper <e> <s> but i assure him in case he has any misapprehension on the point that if any evidence is put to my right honourable friend the home secretary he will consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the bbc and i can assure the noble lord that the government have not interfered in any way whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords what the bbc does is a matter for it within the guidelines set out by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that i have seen the latest nacro news release which is based on figures provided by the council of europe <e> <s> if one takes those at face value it looks as though the united kingdom is the worst offender in this instance <e> <s> but for england and wales of course we are still below west germany and france <e> <s> we look at every alternative for reducing the prison population but as i am sure the noble lord will be the first to appreciate with an independent judiciary in this country it is perhaps not as easy to reduce the prison population as it is in some countries which have political justice <e>", "<cs> my lords with his very considerable experience in this matter my noble friend will i know support me when i say that the government believe that the range of penalties available to courts should be wide and flexible <e> <s> indeed i believe we have among the best in europe if not the best <e> <s> the government have strengthened the range of non-custodial measures for example in the criminal justice act and we have strengthened the courts powers to attach conditions to probation orders and enable a compensation order to be used as a penalty in its own right <e>", "<cs> my lords we are keen to encourage magistrates to use the wide range of options that we have made available to them <e> <s> i am sure the house will agree that it is up to them the only ones to see the whole case to determine exactly what the sentence if any should be <e>", "<cs> my lords we totally agree with my noble friend on that point <e> <s> it is up to the courts within the parameters set down by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the quotation from my speech of th february read out by the noble lord was in fact absolutely correct for the united kingdom and in particular for england and wales <e> <s> i was referring to the council of europe booklet of june which

now about england and wales rather than this country <e>", "<cs> my lords without checking the figures i cannot answer the noble lord <e> <s> as he knows full well remands are of great concern and i spent much of my speech on th february on that point <e> <s> we take this matter very seriously but it is up to the judiciary who hear the cases as to whether or not bail is granted <e>", "<cs> my

am sure that there are certain people who will take up the noble lords suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the programme to which the noble lord refers and i shall make a point of watching it <e> <s> i hope that it has been videoed that might be my best opportunity to see it <e> <s> of course as i said in answer to the last question we draw to the attention of magistrates their full powers under the acts of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords that is something for my noble friend to take up at a later stage if he is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we consider that the crossbow can be an extremely lethal weapon in the wrong hands <e> <s> that is why we are giving support to the bill that is in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the third phase of the magpies publicity campaign was launched on rd february <e> <s> the campaign using television advertisements door-to-door distribution of leaflets and advertising in national and local newspapers and magazines will encourage householders to improve the physical security of their homes <e> <s> the campaign will cost million <e> <s> the crime prevention publicity budget for has been increased from million to million and the greater part of the additional funds will be spent on a new national advertising campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary question <e> <s> as the house will appreciate neighbourhood watch schemes can be of tremendous importance and give greater security to individuals who live in the areas <e> <s> there are now somewhere in the region of schemes operating throughout the country which is an increase of per cent <e> <s> during the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i heard the noble lord correctly but if i did my answer is that that is why we are spending so much and have increased the budget so substantially for next year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord as always puts his finger on two important points <e> <s> the first point related to car thefts <e> <s> they have increased astonishingly and at an alarming rate <e> <s> statistics show that in per cent <e> <s> of all burglaries force is not involved in entry <e> <s> there is a message there for <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says and will draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords that is of course a matter for the usual channels and not for me <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity to thank the noble baroness for her work in this field and for the recent pamphlets to which she made a major contribution regarding shops <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the inner city areas face enormous problems <e> <s> that is where local authorities can help <e> <s> instead of some of the more outrageous schemes which are proposed it would be helpful if some local authorities followed the example of hammersmith and fulham which have produced a useful booklet giving sound practical crime prevention advice which they have distributed free to some residents in their boroughs and the example of droitwich and deptford where increased lighting has substantially reduced burglary figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear my noble friends strong conviction on this point with interest <e> <s> perhaps i could also discuss that point with my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says <e> <s> in view of what my noble friend lord thorneycroft said earlier with regard to other matters crime in this country is committed across a fairly wide spectrum <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord will know well we tried to do this in but we did not find the consensus then and i fear that the consensus is not here at the present <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a fair measure of support for the reform of the official secrets act since <e> <s> the trouble is that one has never been able to have the right consensus in order to implement those reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question has some merit <e> <s> however we do not believe it to have the force that he believes <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said but a year ago we welcome any constructive suggestions and will look at them carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what we did <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the franks committee reported to the labour government <e> <s> we introduced a bill <e> <s> had that received support in your lordships house we might not now have the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot recall exactly what the noble lord refers to <e> <s> i believe that it is more a question of replacing section than merely repealing it <e> <s> that would suit some people but not the great majority of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right and i shall make sure that my right honourable friend is informed what he said today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord chalfont might be satisfied but i am not sure what we can do to satisfy the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot remember whether the noble baroness was present during the fire safety and safety of places of sport bill <e> <s> there seemed to be a great deal of consensus in respect of that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the words of my noble friend who has great experience in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i was not brushing it away dismissively <e> <s> i was trying to give a fair and honest answer similar to that which i gave in october <e> <s> i shall take up the matter with my right honourable friend the home secretary who is interested whenever any of your lordships raise questions with regard to the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her words of support <e> <s> indeed yesterday in another place my honourable friend mr mellor said that we are extremely well disposed to looking at such a proposal but we should of course want to consult all the interested groups first <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his support and i hope that it will apply to the rest of the criminal justice bill when it reaches this house <e> <s> with regard to his second point as the noble lord knows far better than i do under our law there has always been a right of prosecution <e> <s> i shall look very carefully at the point that lie has made and <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that along with all the other matters in the criminal justice bill we take this matter extremely seriously <e> <s> as i said i shall discuss it with my right honourable and honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly will not be before because as i understand it it is hoped that the bill will arrive here fairly shortly <e> <s> whether our full consultations are achieved during the passage of the bill before your lordships house is something that i do not know at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the report but we have not had an opportunity to study the full report which as i understand it is not available <e> <s> from what we have been able to read so far the noble lord is right in saying that some members of ethnic minority communities are for a variety of reasons reluctant to report racial incidents to the police <e> <s> the police are particularly aware of that are sensitive to the difficulties and are making considerable efforts to build up the confidence of the ethnic minority communities <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the noble lords words that all of us in this house deplore racial harassment <e> <s> i remember discussing the point with him on the public order bill when we made great strides in trying to help ethnic communities <e> <s> i shall discuss what the noble lord says with my right honourable friend but i know that the police do a great deal with regard to ethnic minority communities and are setting up community liaison officers <e> <s> in fact the number has doubled since <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord who is keen to conform to the procedure of this house would not wish me to reply to all his many questions in detail <e> <s> from what i have seen i would dispute the figures in the newham report but until we have the full report it is difficult to comment further <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the ethnic minorities who wish to play a constructive part within the community <e> <s> however i do not necessarily agree that all the racial attacks come from the host country because there is evidence of inter-ethnic minority racial attacks as well <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect we discussed that matter fully during the public order bill and it is a little wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting and valuable debate much of which has taken place on the high ground of principle which is as it should be <e> <s> it has benefited also from the practical experience of our courts which many of your lordships have brought to our proceedings <e> <s> i should like to join in the tributes which have been paid to the noble lord lord irvine of lairg for what as others have said was a most thoughtful and stimulating maiden speech <e> <s> i shall read it with interest tomorrow to see how he managed to keep it uncontroversial when the subject with which he was dealing is so controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords not only are the government aware of the fears expressed by the noble lord but indeed the office of fair trading is considering that very matter at the moment <e> <s> therefore it would be wrong for me to comment further <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that the decision will be made soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware as was my right honourable friend the home secretary of the points the noble lord has made and i look forward to debating with him at greater length when we come to the unstarred question which will be on the order paper shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> the specials do an excellent job and they are encouraged <e> <s> i am grateful for the tribute which has been paid to them and on behalf of the government i should like to join in thanking them for their work <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will be aware there has been no greater commitment to the police force than there has been in the seven years since this government took over in a situation of ridiculously low manning <e>", "<cs> we are giving equal effort to recruiting specials by means of posters advertisements in the local press and displays in public places <e> <s> a new recruitment video is also nearing completion <e>", "<cs> my lords those matters were looked at most recently in by a working party on the police advisory board <e> <s> however i shall draw the points which the noble lord has made to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly put those words to my right honourable friend <e> <s> however i can tell my noble friend that i believe that the work is sufficiently challenging <e> <s> one of the things which we have noted is that an increasing number of specials who resign as specials go on to join the police force <e> <s> therefore the police force actually benefits although the specials may lose a few members <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said to the noble lord not only today but in written answers the police forces are aware of the recommendations <e> <s> but it would be wrong for me to comment on the individual case that the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend in paying tribute to the salvation army <e> <s> indeed i pay tribute not only to the police and salvation army but to all in the dhss and others who contribute on this front <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter is kept continually under review in the home office <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asked me to give serious and careful consideration to these amendments <e> <s> indeed it would have been wrong for me not to do so considering that not so long ago i had a much greater involvement with the shipping world than i do at the moment and so i took particular interest in amendments which might affect the lives of ferry operators <e>", "<cs> there is a provision for the bill to be included within the channel tunnel bill <e> <s> i believe that when we look at the amendments before us there are considerable difficulties in regard to their inclusion in the bill <e>", "<cs> before dealing with the amendment perhaps i may take up two points <e> <s> the first is the article in the paper which the noble lord lord mishcon was kind enough to warn me that he would mention <e> <s> he knows better than i that even if you tell the press the truth sometimes it does not get printed sometimes it is taken out of context and sometimes when you do not tell them anything they may invent a story in order to keep a good headline in front of the government <e>", "<cs> i do not think on the hypothetical question put to me by the noble lord lord walston that the amendment would have any bearing on the matter <e> <s> in my view the amendment would not affect the decision of the carrier <e> <s> i think the amendment would affect the decision of the carrier in encouraging people to come to this country without the relevant documentation and i am sure the noble lord would agree with me that that is not what we want to encourage <e>", "<cs> the amendment before us offers a general exception when the right course is to exercise discretion in the light of the circumstances of each case <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon suggested that i might reply to him in such terms <e> <s> while i can assure the committee that the government will exercise discretion sensibly when the carrier through no fault of his own really has no option but to comply with the orders of a foreign government there may well be circumstances where it would be right to consider the carriers liability <e> <s> for example the carrier might have been compelled to carry someone to this country because he had carried him without documents in the first place either from here or from another country <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and many others i too was moved by the speeches which have been made and particularly that of the noble lord lord mcnair in moving the amendment <e> <s> however i believe that we must look at this matter with a very close eye <e> <s> this amendment would create a wholly unreasonable expectation on the carrier an expectation which is ultimately untestable <e> <s> indeed it was the noble and learned lord lord denning who said that carriers cannot be expected to make careful judgments on whether an individual passenger is or is not in grave or immediate danger <e> <s> i have to agree with the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> this is where i beg to differ with the right reverend prelate if i may be permitted to do so <e> <s> the words grave and immediate danger are not the criteria for refugee status that i read out <e> <s> although one has deep sadness and regret that many countries are involved in civil wars or in some instances have been invaded by opposing forces people in such countries might consider themselves to be in grave or immediate danger for example in afghanistan certain areas of the far east or indeed in beirut <e> <s> they do not necessarily constitute being potential refugees within the definition of the united nations convention <e> <s> that is the important point that i believe has become confused this afternoon <e>", "<cs> what i am saying is that that is much wider than the united nations convention <e> <s> we have already decided on that <e> <s> the amendment is wider and i cannot recommend the committee to accept it <e> <s> it would create an expectation that carriers could make judgments or assumptions that they are clearly not in a position to make <e> <s> furthermore that decision having been made it would be extremely hard for it to be properly tested <e> <s> consequently this amendment gives enormous scope for abuse and i am sure that is something the committee do not want <e>", "<cs> in such a case there is the law of the sea and there is also the discretion of my right honourable friend the home secretary which is built into the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson referred to the vietnamese boat people and the government can be justifiably proud of their record in that respect <e> <s> indeed i hope that in the not too distant future there will be another announcement which will please the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> therefore i do not believe that the amendment affects the position outlined by the noble lord <e> <s> as i said the amendment widens the scope for abuse <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that to my mind the argument is entirely right <e> <s> i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> this is where we must both agree as non-lawyers that we need a lawyer to be present <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i do not go that far <e> <s> the noble lord would not expect me to withdraw what i firmly believe and what i have said to him <e> <s> does he agree that the case he advanced of a sudden crisis blowing up and people coming to the airport is a matter on which the government rather than the carrier should take the initiative and say yes we agree that there is a crisis we will use the discretion that is provided for the home secretary <e> <s> the onus is on the government not on the carrier <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend who moved this amendment has said we have already discussed a somewhat similar amendment to remove responsibility from carriers who were obliged to carry a passenger as a result of the order of a foreign government and some of the arguments are the same <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon added one of his own when we discussed it earlier when he said he did not like amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would be unsatisfactory to leave such a saving in this legislation <e> <s> it would not be right for a carrier to be able to claim that he was required to carry a passenger when it might be very difficult indeed to substantiate such a claim <e> <s> how would it be possible to know after the event the basis of the requirement who issued the instruction whether it had or could have been challenged or what the alternatives were <e> <s> it would be a recipe for dissension and dispute as it would require a very difficult subjective judgment to be made namely was the carriage voluntary <e> <s> it appears to be enough under the terms of the amendment for the carrier to do no more than state that the passenger was not carried voluntarily for responsibility to be removed <e> <s> indeed it might be enough for the carrier to argue that if he had known the true status of the passenger he would not have carried him so that the carriage was indeed not voluntary <e> <s> a blanket provision like this creates too <e>", "<cs> may i first be permitted to answer one point of the noble lord lord mishcon and confirm to him that guidelines will be issued to the immigration service <e> <s> i am grateful for his kind words and i shall make sure that they are passed on to the immigration service who equally will be very grateful for his support <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcnair for moving this amendment <e> <s> unfortunately i could not find the paper but i now have it to hand <e> <s> the date in question is th march and not th march <e> <s> since then there have been over notifications <e> <s> if the bill receives royal assent we shall follow up the notifications with request for payment <e> <s> however it will then be open to carrying companies as it is now to make representations that the charges should not be levied in individual cases <e>", "<cs> the amendment as drafted would limit the life of the bill to a maximum of two years the second of which would be subject to further parliamentary approval <e> <s> i cannot accept that this would be right or sensible <e> <s> the bill is neither novel nor experimental <e> <s> there is no point at all in leaving carrying companies and indeed passengers in a state of uncertainty about parliaments intentions next year <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that i apologise for delaying the committee there is one point on which we should be clear <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon said that it gives us the opportunity to review this legislation year by year <e> <s> it gives us the opportunity to review this legislation once and extends it for a further months <e>", "<cs> the total certified normal accommodation cna of the dispersal prisons in england is and their population on friday st may was an apparent number of vacancies of <e> <s> over half these places are not available because of refurbishment <e> <s> the remainder provide the operational flexibility which is essential within this part of the prison system <e> <s> there is therefore no scope for keeping remand prisoners in dispersal prisons <e> <s> there would in any case be objections on both policy and practice grounds in mixing remand prisoners with the inmates of dispersal prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the home address is not given in every case <e> <s> however in highly populated areas such as london where a home address might be useful it is a long-standing tradition that to do so is of help to the defence so that it can if necessary challenge for cause <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord will know far better than me the list is a long and comprehensive one <e> <s> we have no evidence to suppose that jury nobbling comes about as a result of inspecting the list <e> <s> i can tell the house that between november and only requests were made by the defence to inspect a jury panel <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is absolutely right <e> <s> i apologise for not <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> i made that clear i hope in my first supplementary reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend agrees that it is right that there should be a challenge for cause in jury trials <e> <s> if there is to be a challenge for cause a long-standing tradition in this country it seems imperative that the list is provided to enable the defence to base its claims for cause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the specific case in such detail as the noble lord <e> <s> i believe therefore that it would be wrong for me to comment on it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is found necessary for an address to be given in some of the more populous areas such as london in order to identify the juror so that a challenge for cause can be made if necessary <e> <s> it is not necessary in more rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords whether one acts through the judge or makes the details available to the defence the defence still knows about them <e>", "<cs> my lords arrangements for the day-to-day handling of complaints matters within the metropolitan police are a matter for the commissioner <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that the criticism has already been taken to heart because <e> <s> as i understand it the deputy commissioner has met the chairman of the authority twice since the publication of that report <e> <s> of course my right honourable friend the home secretary is available to help if he is called upon to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that was one of the topics discussed at the meetings to which i have just referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we can all look at some of our procedures and find them wanting <e> <s> the metropolitan police is no different in that respect but i am sure that it will do everything it can to meet the concerns of the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last question which the noble lord asked is that i honestly do not know because that is a matter for the police <e> <s> however i shall see whether i can find out <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass on the concerns of the noble lord to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships debated these matters on th december last year <e> <s> the security service operates under a directive issued by the then home secretary sir david maxwell-fyfe in <e> <s> the directive makes the director-general personally responsible to the home secretary and through him to the prime minister <e> <s> those principles have applied to all previous governments since <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be wrong for me to add anything to the statement made by noble friend the leader of the house last week <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to proceedings that my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general has instituted <e> <s> those proceedings are <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord mishcon that following the debate last year i discussed the debate and the point which he has just raised with my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend was very interested and sought to consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said to the noble lord i shall not comment further on matters that were discussed when my noble friend the leader of the house made a statement last week <e> <s> i remind the noble lord of two points because i cannot remember whether he took part in the debate last year <e> <s> if we elaborate the handling of security matters two obvious dangers may arise <e> <s> the first is that by unduly widening the information generally available we prejudice the secrecy necessary for effective security service operations secondly by creating a new structure we blur the responsibility and detract from essential accountability to parliament as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the director-general reported to my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> she was convinced by what the director-general said and accepted that advice <e> <s> the leader of the noble lords party dr david owen accepted the director-generals advice in these circumstances <e> <s> surely the best thing that we can do is not to aggravate these rumours but to let the security service get on with doing the job that it does so very well and for which we are grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in amendment <e> <s> there has been much discussion in both houses of the threshold of for a regulated stand <e> <s> some have argued that it is too high while others including the noble lord lord ross of marnock have suggested that it is too low and may bring too many stands within the scope of the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the local authority must determine under clause whether a stand is a regulated stand <e> <s> that is wholly a matter of the extent of the covered accommodation it provides <e> <s> as long as the local authority is certain that it is above or below the current threshold there is no need for them to make a precise calculation of spectator accommodation <e> <s> as drafted clause requires a number to be placed on the capacity of stands <e> <s> the amendment removes any such requirement <e> <s> i commend the

the police officers involved deserve the highest praise for bringing a very difficult operation to a successful conclusion <e> <s> we hope that this will be a warning to potential troublemakers <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is an attendance order on somebody who might cause trouble at a football ground and he is not allowed to cause trouble as a result of it that surely must be beneficial <e>",

the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords no objective assessment has yet been made for the current session in scotland but i agree with the noble lord that the preliminary view is that improvement in football crowd behaviour have been maintained this season <e> <s> it should be noted that there has been a considerable increase in attendances <e>", "<cs> my lords we firmly believe that the legislation that this house passed not so long ago has been an enormous contribution <e> <s> it was the police view earlier in the year that the welcome improvement in behaviour last season has generally been maintained this season <e>", "<cs> my lords as so often happens england has followed the lead of scotland in this field <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with the noble lord lord graham

ludicrous character of scientology <e> <s> we are however aware of no particular need to take action over the british part of the organisation at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend suggests that there must be international co-operation when there is an allegation of criminal behaviour <e> <s> of course i support him in that criminal behaviour is a matter for the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon but there must always be a balance between freedom of expression and practice within the law on the one hand the need to safeguard from abuse the basic freedom of members of society on the other <e> <s> we shall continue to watch that position with care <e> <s> with regard to his second point on charitable status i confirm that scientology is not a charity and that we have no proposals to change the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i and i am sure the house are well aware of the concern of the noble and learned lord in this matter and of his great knowledge in respect of it <e> <s> he used the word religious but i should put that word in inverted commas after watching the panorama programme where there seemed to be no qualification to claim that title <e> <s> the noble and learned lord also used the word children <e> <s> so far as we can detect scientology has been careful not to attract children because if it did it would break the law and there would be a criminal <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we in the home office are aware of most of the cults operating in this country and we shall watch the position <e> <s> however if there is an allegation of criminal behaviour i repeat that action will be taken by the police in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would allow a carrier who was liable to a charge under the bill to be charged a sum of up to that sum presumably being decided by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me whether the secretary of state has the power to vary the penalty <e> <s> yes he has <e> <s> but we believe that it should be an all or nothing charge because that at least makes it absolutely clear to solve all

evidence that comes afresh to the carrying company as the noble lord suggested of course it would be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcnair has asked a series of questions about the operation of the legislation of which he was kind enough to give me advance notice this morning <e> <s> between th march and th april about passengers have arrived at the ports to claim asylum of whom just under had the right documentation <e> <s> at an average of about port asylum applications a week this represents a considerable reduction in the figures for the previous month when applications were running at an average of about a week <e> <s> in the great majority of cases where a carrier has been notified of liability it was because a passenger had no valid visa <e> <s> the general rule is that people without valid visas are refused entry and removed <e> <s> similarly the great majority of cases where discretion has already been exercised involve passengers without a

prisoners do not require such high security <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall qualify what i said and i am grateful to the noble lord that those are the remand prisoners <e> <s> we must not forget that

possible because we did not receive the results of the ballots early enough <e> <s> therefore it was agreed to phase in the scheme <e> <s> half-way through the phasing in the home secretary the prison

november figure and the figure that had been agreed between us would be in place by th february <e> <s> that was agreed and that is why we are recruiting extra staff this year and why our training schools are full <e> <s> in addition we are recruiting in hired accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be well aware only about half our prisons are overcrowded <e> <s> the other half are at capacity or less than capacity <e> <s> we were seriously concerned about the huge number of people in our prisons which is why the home secretary took the action that he did in the middle of july which resulted in the release of some short-term prisoners <e> <s> given that which was something that the prison officers association wanted it is sad that the association has not responded better and has subsequently gone on to take industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords we were well on our way to reducing the number of prisoners in police cells to zero as the home secretary wished to do when he made his statement in april <e> <s> but as a result of industrial action in a limited number of prisons i have with regret to inform the house that at pm yesterday we had people in police cells <e> <s> that is taking up manpower in out of forces and is entirely due to industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support that the noble lord has given us on fresh start <e> <s> it is deeply depressing that we are back into industrial action <e> <s> that is why the home secretary summoned the nec of the poa to his office on monday last week and gave it a firm warning

for local negotiation <e> <s> where that has not been completed i hope that it will be completed as soon as possible so that we can get many of the establishments onto fresh start which is surely to

consenting to the prosecution of a returned fugitive for offences not covered by an extradition <e> <s> subsection prevents the extradition of a fugitive if arrangements have not been made to place restrictions on his prosecution on his return to the requesting state <e> <s> some form of speciality rule is an almost universal feature of extradition arrangements <e> <s> according to the principle of speciality the requesting state should specify the crimes for which the fugitive is sought and the requested state should exercise some control over the prosecution of the surrendered fugitive for other crimes committed before his surrender <e> <s> the existing law in respect of foreign extradition is found in section of the extradition act <e> <s> this provides that a fugitive shall not be surrendered unless there is an arrangement that he shall not until he has been restored or had an opportunity of returning to the uk be prosecuted for any offence other than the extradition crime upon which his surrender was grounded <e> <s> this is a very inflexible requirement and means for example that if following the return of a fugitive evidence of a serious crime comes to light it is not possible for the requesting state to prosecute a fugitive for that crime <e>", "<cs> if i may add weight to the last point of the noble lord lord mishcon it is a wise suggestion because the <e>",

concession in another place when the bill was in its previous form that such order in council would have to be laid on the table in both houses of parliament <e> <s> that gives us the opportunity in this chamber to say no we do not like the system of justice that that particular country operates <e>", "<cs> because of our different system of justice to which the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington referred it is more common for us to extradite than it is for some of our friends in western europe <e> <s> but there has been significant change in western europe of late and they are moving quite speedily towards the system that we operate of extraditing our nationals <e> <s> in particular i refer my noble friend to holland where i believe that on st january next year they are

system for the republic of ireland <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i am not sure that i can add very much to what i said at the beginning <e> <s> if i may repeat myself the material which a

result of an earlier amendment <e> <s> i am happy to confirm that <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington said his amendments go to the very heart of one of the principal changes

drafted <e> <s> it was a misunderstanding in another place <e> <s> i would refer the committee to standing committee f and col where the honourable member leading for the opposition agreed with my right honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary in his interpretation of the word shall and the word admissible <e> <s> i shall come to that point now <e>", "<cs> we had a little trouble trying to understand what the noble lord meant and the point he was driving at when we saw this amendment <e> <s> i believe however that i have it clear <e> <s> one problem was our interpretation that

note of his concern <e> <s> however i am not convinced that the substance of that concern is not already provided for in the clause as it stands <e> <s> in the first place it should be remembered that the list of considerations to which the courts attention is directed by clause is not exhaustive <e> <s> under clause in deciding whether to exercise its discretion to exclude a document which is admissible under clauses or the court is to have regard to all the circumstances and clause is specifically expressed to be without prejudice to the generality of subclause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mishcon could not go all the way with my argument <e> <s> as i said at the beginning there is not much between us <e> <s> we are driving at the same point and therefore it is logical that i should have another look at this between now and a later stage <e>", "<cs> clause is the means by which we are ensuring that the more liberal arrangements for admissibility of documents proposed in clauses and do not threaten the essential character of the trial as an oral event at which witnesses testify to events from their direct experience <e> <s> it creates a presumption that documents which are themselves a construct of the criminal process witness statements police reports and the like will not normally be admitted as evidence of their contents <e> <s> it also leaves open the possibility that that presumption will be displaced in the mind of the court and that a particular document will be admitted in the interests of justice <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do in respect of his amendment it would be right for me to respond to the noble lord <e> <s> lord hylton <e> <s> he raised a point in respect of northern ireland following a comment which i made <e> <s> i mentioned northern ireland because it illustrated a point that i was trying to make about the risk of someone who has made a reliable statement to the police is subsequently intimidated and becomes unwilling to give evidence at the trial <e> <s> i should like to refer the noble lord to clause where he will see the parts which will come under an order in council for northern ireland <e> <s> there was no point other than that which i wished to make <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of my noble friend <e> <s> to recap the presence or absence of representation or cross-examination would be added to the specific factors to be taken into account by the court which is another important safeguard <e>", "<cs> it will be one of the many letters that i shall write between now and report <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing our attention to the terminology used in clause <e> <s> if i may say so i was a little surprised to hear him say <e> <s> if i understood him correctly that he was not speaking for the official opposition when he was speaking from the dispatch box <e> <s> at that stage i thought he was speaking for the official opposition who i think if i am right in my interpretation of the noble lord will remain silent at this stage <e>", "<cs> as i think has been clearly indicated we on this side are prepared to listen <e> <s> we do not always have fixed views but at least we have some views <e> <s> i believe that the purpose of the clause is well understood but it is less clear how we can best describe the means by which the live evidence is to be taken in a case to which it applies <e>", "<cs> i understand that in courts there are shorthand writers who will be able to take down the transcript of the conversation between the parties <e>", "<cs> this raises a point that i should like to look at <e> <s> but let us just take the case not the fraud case that the noble and learned lord lord roskill was looking at in connection with his report but let us say a case concerning the sexual abuse of a child <e> <s> instead of the child being physically in the court he or she will be in an adjoining room <e> <s> we shall come to the details of that in later amendments <e> <s> but all this link will be doing is to transmit what the child is saying to the court in a live manner <e> <s> i do not at the moment see why it is necessary for that to be taped as well as taken down in written evidence because if you took away the wall behind which the child is sitting the child would be in the court and there would not be a video link now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for those additional comments <e> <s> i shall draw them to the attention of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend who made the point knows better than i do it is for the lord chancellor to make the rules for the court and it is only right that i should draw this matter to his attention <e>", "<cs> this amendment would give the courts a discretionary power to direct that a child witness in say a sex abuse case should be questioned by a third party independent of prosecution defence or judge the so-called child examiner <e> <s> before i deal with this amendment i should like to explain that while i recognise that boys are alas also subject to abuse as a matter of convenience i shall be referring to the victims as her throughout the following debates <e>", "<cs> as i understood it the suggestion was not that it would take the place of the first statement but rather that throughout the case a third party could be used thus taking over the role of counsels cross-examination <e>", "<cs> the noble lord mishcon and i have often agreed in the past <e> <s> we agree at this moment and i am sure that we both look forward to agreeing many times in the future <e> <s> either the amendment is a dead letter or as i have explained it would abolish the right of the defence to cross-examination by the back door <e>", "<cs> i take my noble friends point about committal proceedings <e> <s> i was just going to cover that particular point <e> <s> most committals are on the papers rather than on an oral hearing <e> <s> even when there is a full committal section of the magistrates courts act provides that only in exceptional cases should children be called to give evidence <e> <s> usually their statements will be used <e> <s> clause of the bill extends the provisions to cover exactly those offences covered by closed-circuit television in clause <e> <s> but the defence can insist on the child giving oral evidence <e> <s> therefore i should like to consider the point further <e> <s> i refer my noble friend again to the fact that we have asked consultants to advise us on closed-circuit television in the crown courts and they will also look at the question of committal proceedings <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway made a point concerning drafting <e> <s> the words this section applies are not a drafting error <e> <s> the words refer to clause b where they first appear <e>", "<cs> on a legal point such as this i am sure that my noble friend and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington will not be surprised if i bow out at this stage and say that i shall go for legal advice <e>", "<cs> as i understand it amendment no <e> <s> is consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> has been accepted <e>", "<cs> before i come to the amendment i should like to say at this stage that the noble and learned lord lord silkin the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington and my noble friend lady faithfull referred to corroboration which refers to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not wish to say anything about that amendment which is entirely separate so i hope the committee will not think me discourteous if i do not refer to it at this stage <e> <s> i shall have something to say about it later <e>", "<cs> this clause would repeal the existing law that a childs unsworn evidence must be corroborated <e> <s> in its place it proposes that the judge should consider whether the case should be withdrawn from the jury because a conviction would be unsafe or unsatisfactory or whether he should warn the jury of the dangers of convicting in the absence of corroborating evidence <e> <s> it would also amend the criteria for the admission of such evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is a little early to give a comprehensive answer to my noble friends question because of the short time that we have had these reports <e> <s> analysis of them would give an indication of how local authorities are progressing with their civil defence planning and provide background for consideration of the budgets for and <e> <s> when further information is to hand i shall be delighted to let my noble friend know what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that i think the world co-ordinate is the wrong word to use in this respect <e> <s> the person to whom the noble lord refers is the civil defence adviser who is very much in post <e> <s> the position involves assisting in the consideration and development of arrangements for monitoring progress by local authorities advising on the performances of local authorities advising on the valuation of local authority applications for civil defence grant participating in working groups advising committees undertaking various representational duties and serving on the editorial board of <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil defence adviser will play a key role in assessing the reports before us <e> <s> i confirm to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that we shall be presenting a further report in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be pleased to hear that the great majority of authorities have responded and include a number of those under the style of nuclear-free zones <e> <s> it appears that all local authorities are now co-operating but the full degree to which they are doing so will not be known until we have assessed the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble lord is at last beginning to realise the importance of civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to say to the house that a clearer picture on the preparedness of local authorities should emerge between next april and next october <e> <s> i hope that i shall then be able to answer my noble friend more clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords from my information i do not think that it is necessary for the government to use their reserve powers at the moment <e> <s> there are good reasons why we have not received the seven reports but they will be coming to us shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the current arrangements for summer time apply until the end of <e> <s> the consultations referred to will enable the government to survey a wide spectrum of interests to detect any significant changes in attitude since the last inquiry in <e> <s> the consultations have been undertaken at an appropriately early stage and most of those consulted have replied <e> <s> the government continue to welcome representations on this subject from any quarter <e> <s> no new proposals have as yet been received from the european commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the flaw in my noble friends argument on the six-week period for response is that the deadline was met by the majority of the respondents <e>", "<cs> my lords if it needs to be adjusted that will be shown as a result of the consultations we are now undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to come to a decision because summer time in europe runs out at the end of next year <e> <s> we await a directive from the commission on this matter and i confirm that any order will have to be debated in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i was referring to criminal justice <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to some of the points made in this excellent debate and to the specific proposals which have been put forward by the opposition <e> <s> i should like to deal first with double jeopardy <e> <s> i entirely support what the noble and learned lord lord ackner and my noble friend lord campbell of alloway said about double jeopardy <e> <s> it was wrong to say that what we are talking about is double jeopardy <e> <s> what we are talking about is where an offender has already been convicted and whether the sentence should stand as the correct and proper sentence <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge said that he supported the idea that it was right to punish them properly <e> <s> that is what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i hoped i had made clear in my opening speech on this matter the reasons why we in government changed our mind <e> <s> i think it would be wrong for the committee if i went back on that <e>", "<cs> it is clearly on the official record and i hope that that is the right way of dealing with that particular point <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause and of the two clauses that follow it is to make certain offences triable only in the magistrates court which are at present triable either way that is either by the magistrates or in the crown court <e> <s> clause refers to two such offences taking a motor vehicle or other conveyance without authority or taking and driving away as it is commonly known and driving while disqualified <e> <s> clause which i shall deal with in more detail shortly covers criminal damage of a value between and <e> <s> clause covers common assault <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to make offences of criminal damage to a value between and triable only summarily in the magistrates court <e> <s> under the magistrates court act section and schedule the offence of criminal damage is triable either way <e> <s> the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment is years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine <e> <s> but section of the act makes this offence triable only summarily where the value involved is less than <e> <s> the maximum penalty in such a case is three months imprisonment and/or a fine of level on the standard scale <e> <s> that is currently <e> <s> we propose that these should henceforth be the maximum penalties for offences up to the higher threshold of <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord elton gave notice of his interest in this matter on second reading and he does this place a great service by raising it again today when we have had the opportunity to consider it in more detail <e> <s> i have listened with the greatest interest to the views of all members of the committee <e>", "<cs> indeed and i refreshed my memory on that debate earlier this morning <e> <s> just as some of the faces in the chamber today are the same as during the debate on the criminal law bill years and nine months ago almost to the day the main issues at stake are familiar too <e> <s> the government exposed these fully last year in the discussion paper on the distribution of business to which i have already referred today <e> <s> we set out the arguments for and against change and floated a possible approach short of full reclassification which we thought might have satisfied one of our main objections raised in response to the james report <e> <s> that our exposition was even-handed i cannot doubt since responses to it were split down the middle just as in todays debate <e> <s> the only point on which there was virtual unanimity was that the possible compromises we had floated would not do <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for correcting that point <e> <s> i should need to reflect further on the point relating to sentence with my right honourable friend having listened carefully to the views expressed by the committee <e>", "<cs> i know that we all sympathise wholeheartedly with the reasons of the noble lord lord irvine of lairg for moving this amendment <e> <s> police officers in the course of their duty are often exposed to the risk of attack and they are entitled to expect whatever protection the law can give <e> <s> i shall be inviting the committee on a future day to consider the governments proposals for tougher controls on offensive weapons and knives <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary made it clear in announcing these measures that he had very much in the forefront of his mind the young police officer whose job is made so much more dangerous by knife-wielding thugs and the ready availability of nasty weapons <e> <s> that is an important step forward in tackling the cause <e> <s> but it is right also as the noble lord lord irvine invites us to do to consider punishment and deterrence <e>", "<cs> i am certainly not learned <e>", "<cs> i have been much encouraged by the wide measure of support which this debate has uncovered for our proposal <e> <s> i had hoped that i would have the full support of the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> having supported my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and then my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i had thought that i would get lucky the third time and that the noble lord would support me <e> <s> but we are getting closer <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the rule of the committee is that as the amendment is in the name of my noble friend it is up to him whether or not he moves it <e> <s> i would certainly oppose an adjournment of the committee at this stage <e>", "<cs> it is right for me to say at this stage that i fear i disagree with the noble lord lord mishcon on his point <e> <s> the death penalty was discussed in another place during the passage of the criminal justice bill <e> <s> if an amendment is down before the committee it is only right and proper that we discuss it whatever views we might hold about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not know <e> <s> if i may i will write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend applies to the passport office he will have his passport renewed in the usual manner because the delays that were evident as reported to your lordships house in july of this year have been reduced <e> <s> the seven-week waiting period in london is being rapidly reduced and we hope that london will be on normal working as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords it all depends on the person <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> on amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington argued that the judges power to recommend a minimum term to be served when a life sentence is imposed for murder should be abolished <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> in that case i shall have a look at what is said in the <e>", "<cs> i feel that both those matters should be looked at between now and another stage <e> <s> those are wide and complicated matters and i am sure the committee would not wish to move to a hasty decision which might be regretted later <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the committee is debating this matter when during the debate on the last amendment i said that i would take it away <e> <s> it seems to me to be wrong for the committee to protract this matter further <e> <s> i shall look carefully at what was pointed out to me by the noble lord lord morton of shuna after the last debate and also at what my noble friend lord campbell of alloway said <e>", "<cs> i too am grateful to the noble lord lord henderson of brompton not only for raising this very important subject but for bringing me back on to a territory where i am on slightly firmer ground than i have perhaps been in some of our earlier debates <e>", "<cs> i understood that the noble lord was highlighting the fact that he differentiated the refurbishment of existing premises given the size of cells or dormitories which very much curtails what can be done <e> <s> some of the victorian cells are larger and some smaller than the specific standards laid down by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> in some prisons there are both larger and smaller cells in the same establishment <e> <s> as i recall <e>", "<cs> our target is the amount of money that we are putting towards the problem <e> <s> under the last labour government who actually reduced the amount spent on prisons a sum of money that was regrettably heinously low resulted in a backlog <e> <s> it is by spending money on the problem and by doing refurbishments within the existing constraints of the building that the problem will be tackled <e> <s> perhaps i may continue <e>", "<cs> that is indeed the difference but as i was going to say my experience was very much like that which my noble friend lord elton experienced that regardless of the unsatisfactory situation these people are in at the moment they would prefer to share a cell than to be moved further away <e> <s> we are talking about remands who have the extra privileges of visits every day <e> <s> notwithstanding the difficulties which sharing a cell sometimes creates they would prefer to do that than be moved to a prison further away in the country where they could have a cell to themselves <e>", "<cs> my noble friend expresses that point better than i could and i agree with him on the point which he made about regimes and the better regimes which one can produce <e> <s> indeed one of the aspirations of fresh start which is now in over half our prisons is to provide a better regime for inmates including those in remand centres <e> <s> i have seen one at manchester where fresh start is working most satisfactorily and producing a better regime <e> <s> even if we had a perfect match between accommodation and population i doubt if it would be sensible to have as rigid a requirement as in subsection which goes further than the corresponding provision in the european standard minimum rules <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not answer that point directly i thought it was contained within my answer <e> <s> of course in we produced a summary of design standards <e> <s> there are the existing prison rules which cover much of what the noble lord contains in his amendment but as the noble lord knows a well as i do what has thwarted us in many respects is the temendous increase in the remand population <e> <s> there are more in our prisons than this time last year <e> <s> we believe that instead of laying down some standards which could not be achieved in any foreseeable future spending a lot of time and energy of members of the department working out suitable minimum standards on which some of the reform groups have spent quite a considerable time the right solution is to get round to spending the money which my right honourable friend the home secretary has been able to obtain on the refurbishment programme so as to relieve the problem in a practical way <e>", "<cs> i understand the intention behind this new clause but i have to say that we do not accept that standards of food hygiene and health and safety in prison service establishments fail to meet the standards required by statute <e> <s> neither do we accept the implication that the threat of prosecution is required to achieve an acceptable standard <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with the noble lord that there is a case for that equally there is a case for keeping the provision in a bill which already deals with penalties <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary thought that that was the right way to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> i shall of course draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary the points that the noble lord lord mishcon has made <e> <s> notwithstanding what i have just said i believe that there is a distinction between penalties with which we are dealing in this bill and arrangements for control mentioned by the noble lord which are perhaps matters for the proposed bill to be introduced <e> <s> of course i am aware of what was debated in another place <e> <s> i am also aware of recent meetings between the parties on this matter and i shall put forward to my right honourable friend what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> we are entering into a debate on shotguns and firearms which i hoped members of the committee would avoid until a later stage when the proposed legislation is before us <e> <s> may i draw the committee back to the amendment which is about penalties <e> <s> i beg to move that amendment <e>", "<cs> the government believe that going armed while committing crime is in the first rank of gravity among offences <e> <s> that is why we have proposed that criminals who carry firearms will be liable to the severest penalty <e> <s> i believe that is also the view of the overwhelming majority of law-abiding citizens <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just make it clear that i was talking about the police federations initial reaction <e> <s> that was modified in its written comments <e> <s> i said that the other police organisations which we consulted were in favour of our proposals <e>", "<cs> cruelty to children is as the committee recognises an evil crime <e> <s> i certainly <e>", "<cs> i regret to say to the noble and learned lord that i do not have at my fingertips the figures that could answer the question that he asked me <e> <s> i hope that he will accept that i shall write to him and to the noble lord lord monson and that i shall of course place a copy in the library <e> <s> that may be the best way of dealing with that particular matter <e>", "<cs> the committee will know that clause increases from two to seven years the maximum prison term for the two main statutory offences of corruption <e> <s> at present the maximum term <e>", "<cs> i stand guilty <e> <s> i apologise to the committee and i shall rectify the situation as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> insider dealing can be a major financial crime akin to issuing misleading statements about investments or manipulating the market as specified in section of the financial services act <e> <s> the maximum term of imprisonment on conviction on indictment for these offences is seven years and the government believe that the maximum term of imprisonment for the worst cases of insider dealing should be the same <e> <s> that is the answer to the noble lord lord monson as to why we have done it <e> <s> it is important that we show overseas governments the seriousness with which the united kingdom regards insider dealing <e> <s> it is a practice which more of them are beginning to regard as a crime which should be eradicated from the worlds financial markets through international co-operation and by adequate powers for investigation and sentencing at home <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for raising this matter <e> <s> this bill makes a number of changes in maximum penalties for offences which thankfully are committed relatively rarely and it is no bad thing to look critically at the maximum for two of the most common offences <e>", "<cs> i should he happy to consider what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has directed our attention toward a subject which has given home office ministers much cause for concern <e> <s> over the last months i can personally vouch for that <e> <s> i fully appreciate and indeed i share the concerns expressed so eloquently this evening <e> <s> i accept that conditions in police cells are frequently quite unsuitable although i should add that the police do their best to provide whatever facilities they can <e> <s> i accept that there are far too many prisoners presently held in police cells and that the need to hold a number of them in police stations far from their home may cause difficulty and hardship <e>", "<cs> the noble lord <e> <s> lord hylton and the noble baroness lady seear have raised the very important point of bail hostels <e> <s> i should like to commend the work with which the noble baroness is associated <e> <s> it is highly respected by the home office and indeed if i may call the association to which she referred a pressure group it is a more powerful pressure group because of its experience in this field and not merely a paper pressure group <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not deal with that point and i apologise <e> <s> i do not have the exact figures in the last days or so because of the problems we have been facing <e> <s> however if memory serves me and i shall write to the noble lord if i am wrong following what the home secretary announced in july we reduced the number of women in police cells to zero <e> <s> i think that the last time i looked we had one woman on a very short-term basis who was moved into prison <e> <s> therefore the action that my right honourable friend took at that stage was highly effective <e> <s> however i could not agree more with the noble lord when he says that the sitation we were in was very wrong <e>", "<cs> as the noble earl lord longford knows the sentences of all life sentence prisoners are kept under review by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> i know that he will say that is not enough for him but it is a fact <e> <s> the noble earl would wish to go beyond that and say that there should be a formal review by the parole board after the first years of sentence if there has not been one earlier and a further review at least every five years thereafter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may for a change intervene at this stage because of something i have to say and on which the noble lord lord hunt has touched <e> <s> it may help the debate <e> <s> this is a matter which received a great deal of attention in in the run-up to the criminal justice act <e> <s> the government concluded then for a variety of reasons that it would he better not to go ahead with a scheme on the lines contained in the new clause for automatic release under supervision <e>", "<cs> indeed i can help the committee <e> <s> it is one of a number of matters at which the carlisle committee will be looking though as i have said it is a very central matter <e> <s> it would require legislation <e> <s> i discussed the matter with my right honourable friend the home secretary and it was part of his decision in july that that was the right way in which to proceed <e> <s> when we receive the carlisle committee report we shall consider it urgently <e> <s> the committee is due to report in july next year so it will be a quick committee <e> <s> my right honourable friend will then wish to make a speedy decision and introduce the necessary legislation that he sees fit at that time <e>", "<cs> before i deal with the substantive issues raised by this clause i think it may be worth recalling the recent history of this complex subject <e> <s> the prior committee was set up to review adjudications partly because there were serious concerns whether boards would be able to cope following the <e>", "<cs> i can see the wrath of the board of visitors descending upon the noble lord if he accuses them of not being totally independent although they are appointed by my right honourable friend <e> <s> i beg to differ with the noble lord the prison visitors are very independent as i know full well <e>", "<cs> while i agree with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that with the exception of boards of visitors there was a general view that the two functions should be separated i must tell the committee that it was very much harder to arrive at any agreed view on what should replace boards of visitors <e> <s> indeed we did not arrive at such a view <e>", "<cs> i can only apologise to the committee <e> <s> i took about seven or eight minutes explaining why i thought it was wrong and why the system that we had proposed was a better one <e> <s> i should hate to read everything that i have read out yet again <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that i have tried to discuss the arguments and present them in a way that showed why we found the matter so difficult <e> <s> i highlighted five points in my argument for keeping the disciplinary function with the boards of visitors <e> <s> i also said that because of the great difficulty that we have had in getting any kind of agreement on what could replace it whether it is the prior committee or whether it is something different and for other reasons we have opted for the present strengthened arrangements <e>", "<cs> the effect of this new clause would be to extend to adults a restriction which the bill already imposes on the use of custody for young offenders <e> <s> on the whole we should prefer to give emphasis to the guidance of the court of appeal on <e>", "<cs> i agree that the consistency of practice of the magistrates courts to which the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has just referred leaves a little to be desired <e> <s> i frankly doubt very much whether the noble lords amendment would have the effect of solving that problem <e> <s> as my noble friend lady macleod has said the better approach is through the training of magistrates local comparisons of practice and so on <e> <s> that is what we are encouraging and we are trying to solve the problem which the noble lord has highlighted <e> <s> we are doing it in a slightly different way <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord irvine explained this new clause would amend the criminal justice act so that time spent remanded in custody would count towards the minimum qualifying period for parole <e> <s> at present remand time is taken into account in calculating whether an offender has served a third of his sentence and may therefore be eligible for parole but section of the act operates in such a way that the period between the point when sentence is passed and parole eligibility is never less than the specified minimum which is at present six months <e>", "<cs> we have some sympathy with the objectives of these two amendments but see difficulties in each which perhaps i may explain to the committee <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would ensure that time spent on remand in custody by a juvenile who was subsequently sentenced to be detained under section would count towards the term of the sentence <e> <s> on the face of it it seems sensible that the juvenile should as it were get credit for the time spent on remand <e> <s> but there are practical obstacles <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord would be horrified if i tried to do so <e>", "<cs> i have a considerable amount of sympathy with the amendment proposed by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> the fine is the most commonly used of all our penalties and it is important that it should be fully and properly used as a penalty <e> <s> dealing with his amendment this raises the interesting question of whether the court should have a discretion to impose a more severe fine on a wealthy defendant just as it can and should impose a smaller fine on a poor defendant <e>", "<cs> we move from courts and prisons to some of the individuals who may pass through them <e> <s> i share the concern over the disgraceful activities of poachers which has prompted this amendment <e> <s> i must advise however against adoption of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has very rightly drawn the attention of the committee to the problem of fine defaulters in prison <e> <s> the need to hold some fine defaulters every day is a strain which the prison system could well do without <e> <s> the noble lord proposes shorter periods of custody for defaulters as <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows full well we are in constant touch with the magistrates association but we do not necessarily always agree with them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has raised a most important matter <e> <s> as he rightly pointed out over fine defaulters were received into custody in <e> <s> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington said that that is

today we shall have to speak of detention in a young offender establishment but that does not affect the substance of the argument <e> <s> it was because we took very seriously the judges feeling that the absence of a power to suspend youth custody sentences was a regrettable gap in the sentencing structure that we published a consultative document a little over a year ago inviting views on the various possibilities <e>", "<cs> i am of course in the hands of the committee but i had hoped that it would be possible to take amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull is in the

right honourable friend the home secretary but he has concluded that there is insufficient justification for making a special payment <e> <s> special payments have only been made to police forces in cases of exceptional circumstances generally of an unforeseen nature by which the efficiency of the police force would otherwise have been threatened which is not the case in lancashire <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend who is much more experienced in party conferences has made a very valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the house that there is a tripartite structure for policing arrangements in this country <e> <s> this gives a large measure of local influence and limits the degree of central intervention <e> <s> if one followed the route proposed in the question of

averse to learning from experience north of the border in matters concerning criminal procedure <e> <s> in the last few years we have seen legislation to provide both for an independant prosecution service and for statutory limits on time before trial each of which is so long established in scotland as to be part of the legal scenery <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble lord lord mishcon is just as i thought <e> <s> i felt it was better to wait for total clarification <e> <s> the purpose of the exemption is to exclude pocketknives that have any blade which is longer than three inches <e> <s> however i take the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the appropriate authority to look again at the drafting of this amendment so that we are absolutely clear that it satisfies the point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can clarify once and for all i hope the subtle but vital point raised by the noble lord lord mishcon about the exceptions to the offence <e> <s> our intention as my noble and learned friend lord hailsham said is that a pocket knife no blade of which is longer than three inches should be excepted unless it has a blade which locks when open <e> <s> we believe that the clause achieves that result but it is clear from our discussions today that it would be sensible for me to look again at the drafting <e> <s> i will gladly do so between now and another stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the general welcome that has been given to these amendments and in particular for the words of my noble and learned friend lord havers <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to the speech of my noble friend lord brentford <e> <s> as he outlined the government included the provision as a result of our concern over the cost-effectiveness of the structure of the city probation service <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that we intend no criticism to fall on the individual probation officers concerned <e> <s> we believe that the problem is inherent in the very small size of the city probation service <e> <s> as my noble friend said the city concedes that there is some room for improvement and efforts have now been made to bring this about <e> <s> he has proposed that the city should be given a years grace and has given assurances that if after that time a further evaluation by the probation inspectorate shows that matters have not really improved the city will bring forward a similar provision in a bill of its own <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that we should treat the <e>", "<cs> there is nothing between the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington and the noble baroness lady david and the government about the importance of crime prevention work by voluntary bodies <e> <s> the question raised by this amendment is whether it would help to have a specific grant-giving power of the kind proposed <e> <s> it may help to explain why if i say a word or so about our general approach to crime prevention <e> <s> the thrust of that approach has been towards stimulating innovation and awareness of the importance of crime prevention <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has equally been well trained by the home office and he can read amendments as quickly as i can <e>", "<cs> members of the committee have rightly said that we are here discussing a most serious matter <e> <s> the power of an officer whether a police officer or a customs officer to search the person of an individual is granted by parliament sparingly and only when it is entirely justified <e> <s> it is only three years ago that we debated these matters with the utmost care during the course of the police and criminal evidence bill <e> <s> smugglers are however unscrupulous people and can inflict great harm on society <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of those who carry or induce others to carry substantial quantities of hard drugs concealed about them or i regret to say inside their bodies <e>", "<cs> the tome produced by the noble and learned lord lord keith of kinkel covered more than just searches <e> <s> i gather that it covered such things as vat <e> <s> some of the recommendations have been implemented and some have not <e> <s> it is those parts which have not been implemented that my honourable friend the paymaster general is looking at <e>", "<cs> i yet again appear to have let the committee down by not making myself clear and i apologise to the noble lord lord pitt <e> <s> i thought that i had given cogent reasons why the amendment could not be accepted <e> <s> the amendment goes much too wide for the customs which is a very different operation from that operated by the police <e> <s> it is not tailored to the customs but to police needs <e> <s> as i have indicated we are looking into the question of tailoring such provisions for customs needs which my honourable friend is looking into <e> <s> i believe that it is right that we should await that consideration before going as it were with a wrong amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to meet the points that the noble lord lord harris has put to me <e>", "<cs> i really think with due respect to the noble lord that that is one of the worst arguments that he has put forward <e> <s> when a person comes into this country who is intent on smuggling he will probably have a small quantity of highly valuable drugs <e> <s> that short period between arriving and going through customs is the moment when the customs have to act <e> <s> once he is through customs he can cut down that small package into even smaller bits <e> <s> he does not need to conceal it on his person <e> <s> he can distribute it around the country <e> <s> he can have it in various places around the country where he can pick it up at any time <e> <s> he can leave part of it in a field and come back to it a year later <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord morris has proposed that the maximum period for remand in custody should be increased from eight to days rather than to days as the government propose in clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord irvine has gone further by opposing the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> the committee will be familiar with the thinking behind our proposal <e> <s> it is well known that many eight-day remand hearings serve no useful purpose and are wasteful in terms of time manpower and resources <e>", "<cs> i cannot yet say precisely how the experiment will be conducted but i can assure the noble lord lord hutchinson that i shall draw the points that he has made and validly made to the attention of those responsible for designing it <e> <s> on the noble lords second point i <e>", "<cs> i well understand the reasoning behind the amendments of the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> i appreciate that there are crimes which can be as distressing to the victim as that of rape <e> <s> but rape is a horrible crime in a category of its own and we believe that special considerations apply <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson is concerned that anonymity should not be removed from rape defendants <e> <s> it may be helpful if i set out a little of the background <e> <s> the sexual offences amendment act gives effect to some of the recommendations in the report of the advisory group on the law of rape <e> <s> on introduction it made provision that anonymity of complainants but not of defendants is recommended by the group <e>", "<cs> if i may respond to the noble lord <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a would also give the high court power to review decisions of the crown court made at a trial on indictment <e> <s> it goes further than my own amendment in the two respects he mentioned <e> <s> first it would give the high court power to require the crown court to make an order forbidding publication of a report of proceedings under the contempt of court act whereas my amendment only empowers the high court to quash such an order made by the crown court <e> <s> secondly it would permit the high court to review a decision by the crown court to sit <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what has been said in the past few minutes <e> <s> i am very grateful for the support that i have received from my noble friend lord renton and indeed others on the back-benches <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is

house seven days ago <e> <s> i have no doubt that it will be in even better shape after report and third reading <e> <s> i look forward to those events and to continuing our discussion on this very important piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those of your lordships who have taken part in this most useful debate on subject access <e> <s> we have had a most interesting debate on the data protection act and the question of subject access <e> <s> it is a measure of the general interest in this new statutory right for the individual to have access to data recorded

involved <e> <s> it will be appropriate for the data user to contact one of the other health professionals listed in the schedule to the order <e> <s> it is for the data user to decide who is the most appropriate health professional <e> <s> in many cases especially in respect of work in the community the most appropriate professional is likely to be the nurse <e> <s> that position is provided for

terrington <e> <s> we owe him a debt of gratitude for introducing the amendment <e> <s> the provisions of this order flow from what the noble lord said in committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps at this stage it would be appropriate for me to say a word or two <e> <s> the governments position on racing is that provided suitable arrangements are made for betting to take place lawfully we see no reason to stand in the way of horseracing on sundays <e> <s> that is the view that we have expressed before and are expressing again <e> <s> we do not have any plans at present to introduce legislation of our own on this subject so it will be for the committee to decide how to handle the amendments before it <e>", "<cs> that is true and i hope the noble lord will take it on board <e>", "<cs> no what i was saying my noble friend was quick to try to turn my words but he was wrong was that the effect of the amendment would have serious repercussions on other sporting events that exist at the moment <e> <s> people who work on saturdays and find that sunday is a free day may wish to go to such a sporting event but they would not be able to in the future <e>", "<cs> that is the effect as i understand it of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> it will affect not only cricket matches but also british open golf and wimbledon if they start before oclock <e> <s> it precisely affects sports that take place now <e>", "<cs> i believe it would be wise for me to say a word at this moment <e> <s> i go back to what i said at the beginning <e> <s> one of the keys to this bill so far as the government are concerned is that suitable arrangements are made for betting to take place lawfully <e>", "<cs> i am surprised to hear my noble friend advocating illegal betting <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton did not actually answer my point <e> <s> he freely admitted that a race like the grand national was bound to stimulate interest <e> <s> he then said that the new betting shop at edmonton would be well patronised <e> <s> if you have the grand national on a sunday with the amount of betting that takes place on it on the day rather than on the friday or the saturday before and the people of edmonton who are the regular betters who use that shop on a weekday find that on the sunday of the grand national they cannot put their bet on does the noble lord accept that they will find other means to put that bet on which would be illegal <e>", "<cs> i think that on this occasion my noble friend is wrong <e> <s> he is not wrong very often <e>", "<cs> with his experience of the home office the noble lord is seldom wrong but i think that he may be wrong on this occasion <e> <s> we gave the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford some help with this matter <e> <s> the point of amendment no <e>

designed to ensure that it represents a surer way of providing that no offence is committed under the act if there is sunday racing <e> <s> the trouble is now that the bill is a piece of drafting nonsense <e>", "<cs> it is because we are in the mess that we are that my noble friend and i now agree having agreed to disagree earlier <e> <s> because this was a consequential amendment on an earlier amendment which has now been overtaken by a result of a division we are in a mess <e> <s> i could perhaps suggest to the committee that this is accepted and that it is dealt with on report in the normal manner <e>", "<cs> i have now received further advice from the table and i believe that the right course is not to accept it <e> <s> i am happy to change my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i read with interest what my noble friend said in the debate on th april <e> <s> i am glad that she made a congratulatory comment about the governors who have made a great deal of effort in the recent past

he will agree that the statutory monthly visit is the one that we are talking about and that is the one where we help wives and close relatives <e>", "<cs> my lords assisted visits may be made to inmates in england and wales by close relatives in northern ireland on the same basis as for england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look into the point made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs>

"<cs> my lords i think this is another occasion where scotland sets a good example <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to each local authority to consider how best to discharge its duty under the act <e>",

anomalies which is why the auld report was so right in saying that it needed a complete overhaul <e> <s> as the house will recall your lordships did not find that any compromise removed the anomalies <e>", "<cs> my lords i have once again listened carefully to what the noble lord has to say on this point but i regret that i am still not convinced that the substance of his point is not already provided for <e> <s> we have already discussed amendments to the earlier clauses which are intended to ensure that documents admissible under clauses and will not replace oral evidence where that evidence is available <e> <s> secondly i stand by what i said in committee which is that under clause in deciding whether to exercise its discretion to exclude a document which is admissible under clauses or the court is to have regard to all the circumstances <e> <s> this can include factors such as those that the noble lord referred to in moving his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am

suggest that we should not come back to this matter until minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to rehearse at great length the arguments which i placed before your lordships when we debated this important matter at an earlier stage <e> <s> we had a very full debate then and it would serve little purpose for me to go over substantially the same ground twice <e> <s> indeed it would

it would be extended only if in the light of experience it proved necessary desirable and practicable to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said these amendments remove from clause words which troubled the committee at an earlier stage <e> <s> the causes for concern were most persuasively expressed by my noble friend and by the noble and learned lord lord lane <e> <s> indeed my noble friend has been supported by the noble and learned lord lord ackner this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend lord elton raised this matter on second reading and in committee i thought it right to approach it with an open mind <e> <s> during the committee debate and again this afternoon powerful arguments have been made in support of my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments afford us a further opportunity to consider the prison disciplinary system <e> <s> as i understand the noble lord the two new clauses he has tabled are intended as alternatives <e> <s> one identical to the one we discussed in committee is intended broadly to implement the prior committees proposals for a new prison disciplinary tribunal with a circuit judge as president legally qualified chairmen and lay members <e> <s> the other as i understand it is intended in effect to implement the proposals in the white paper on the prison disciplinary system cmnd <e> <s> for a new lay body which would be separate from boards of visitors to deal with the more serious breaches of prison discipline <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord has been able to correct me there <e> <s> in that case i should say and/or <e> <s> i explained in some detail in committee why the government had decided not to proceed with the white paper proposals for this new lay body <e> <s> i also explained however the steps we were planning to take to improve the existing adjudication arrangements principally by accepting in large part the prior committees recommendations for a new code of discipline and various procedural changes and by providing hoards with the assistance of court clerks or solicitors <e> <s> i recognise that these plans do not go as far as some people would wish but i believe that they hear a close scrutiny as serious and worthwhile improvements to the present adjudication arrangements improvements which i may say will involve a lot of hard work to put into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to the debate this evening some of your lordships may have gained the impression that the home office did not have a structured organisation to deal with this particularly important matter <e> <s> it might be helpful if i set out the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris of greenwich gave notice in committee that he would return to the matter of prisoners in police cells <e> <s> i know that this matter greatly troubles him and other noble lords and i fully understand and sympathise with the arguments he has put forward so persuasively both in committee and today <e> <s> for his part i hope that he accepts as i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i can clarify that <e> <s> rollstone camp was opened on a temporary basis as the noble lord knows for about three months <e> <s> it took category c prisoners <e> <s> it is not suitable for taking remand prisoners <e> <s> my lords we have been able to disperse those category c prisoners around the other establishments <e> <s> therefore rollstone camp has now been closed and the staff have been distributed elsewhere <e> <s> some have been distributed to ashford which i mentioned would take prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships are aware the government are not persuaded that restrictions of the kind proposed in the amendments are as effective as some of your lordships have argued <e> <s> during the course of the criminal justice bill we accepted amendments introduced by my noble friend as she said relating to restrictions on the sentencing of young offenders <e> <s> i cannot agree that those restrictions should be extended to those over years of age <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very concerned about anyone going to prison for the first time and we are particularly concerned about those under the age of who might be sent to prison for the first time <e> <s> we therefore thought that it was right to accept the amendments of my noble friend to the criminal justice act which put the extra spotlight on young offenders in order to keep in the minds of us all that they require something a little special <e> <s> some of the spotlight that we have put on them would be dimmed if we were to extend it to adults also <e> <s> that is the difference <e> <s> it is for that reason that i am not persuaded that either of the changes are required or that the steps which the noble lord has proposed will be the right ones to meet our objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said when he started his speech there is nothing between us <e>", "<cs> my lords i share my noble friends concern about poaching which has prompted this amendment <e> <s> i know that there are a lot of people in the countryside who come onto farmers land search for game and often behave in a threatening manner when approached <e> <s> obviously the law must give sufficient protection against the worst excesses of their behaviour and i think it does <e> <s> nevertheless i think i can advise your lordships to accept only part of my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house perhaps i may respond to the noble lord <e> <s> i thought that i had covered that <e> <s> we wish to discuss that with my noble friend between now and third <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an emotive issue and i am sure that we all have sympathy with the intentions behind the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord monson has said his amendment would increase from one to two years the minimum period of disqualification for the offence of causing death by reckless driving <e> <s> he rightly argues that this is a serious offence and that the courts should deal severely with those who commit it <e> <s> i would not argue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones moved an identical amendment to this one in committee <e> <s> i indicated then that the government would be willing to look sympathetically at the case for an amendment for these purposes and on that basis the noble and learned lord was willing not to press the matter <e> <s> the purpose of such an amendment as is the purpose of this one would be to enact the provisions of article of the international covenant on civil and political rights <e>", "<cs> my lords this is perhaps the single most significant issue left for us to discuss on the bill <e> <s> therefore it is good for the house that we can welcome back the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones after his travels to america <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for placing his arguments before us as ever with his normal cogency and clarity <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make it absolutely clear that i would reflect on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however the reflection on amendment no <e> <s> seems to have reached as far as we can go <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wigoder said not all of us can win all the time but the noble lord has won on this amendment <e> <s> i am very happy to support him <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said during the committee stage the principle that we followed in establishing the new custodial sentence was to leave what i described as the coverage of custody unaffected <e> <s> this means as my noble friend has reminded us that the courts would have power to impose a custodial sentence of up to four months on a year-old boy as they do now <e> <s> we adopted this approach on the basis that parliament had gone into these matters in some detail in and that the prime need was to create a unified sentence <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there has not been time to consult bodies such as the magistrates <e>", "<cs> my lords the fine is by a long way the most used of any disposal available to the courts in dealing with young adult offenders <e> <s> in about per cent <e> <s> of all young adults convicted of indictable offences were fined <e> <s> this heavy use suggests that the courts see the fine as the most useful of the sentences available to them <e> <s> it has many advantages <e> <s> it is a clear and forceful indication of the courts disapproval of the young offenders behaviour <e> <s> it punishes the offender without interfering significantly with his life <e> <s> while not necessarily a direct alternative to a custodial sentence it has the great virtue which i am sure your lordships house will endorse of being one way to ensure that young people are spared the custodial experience <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady elliot of harwood was a little surprised that the home office had not taken on the scottish system and wondered why this was not so <e> <s> as i said in committee the reason is that there is an historical difference between the way things have been done in scotland and in england and wales <e> <s> indeed the scots did not have a systematic juvenile system before so it could equally well be asked why the scots did not follow the english development of a system of juvenile courts pre- <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may correct my noble friend <e> <s> it is amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble and learned lord lord denning which cannot be called <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly reply on this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the three noble and learned lords for their support <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord lord molloy is broadly speaking yes <e> <s> however i do not have the qualifications of the noble and learned lord lord denning to be able to answer as the noble and learned lord can <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at report stage <e> <s> the noble lord introduced his amendment for minutes and he can speak at the end or with the leave of the house <e> <s> however i think it is right that i should answer the arguments that have been put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that perhaps amendment no <e> <s> is not quite as good as amendment no <e> <s> a which i think covers the point more precisely as it includes section which the noble lord omits <e> <s> perhaps that section also should apply to scotland <e> <s> i believe that it should <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has told us this amendment would reverse what has become known as the nottingham justices judgment in which the divisional court ruled that when considering a renewed application for bail the magistrate should be confined to investigation of whether there were any new considerations which were not before the court on the previous occasions <e> <s> this means in practice that repeated applications for bail on identical grounds will not be entertained <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson moved an amendment dealing with information <e>", "<cs> i shall try again my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson moved an amendment dealing with information whereupon the hare ran all around the field of customs and strip searching <e> <s> an important subject though it is it has absolutely nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> it had more to do with the amendment we discussed at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that that is the side i want to look into between now and a later stage whether all the facts that the noble lord would like printed are being collected and in what form <e> <s> this is something that i have to discuss with my honourable friend in another place <e> <s> it would be wrong for me to try to answer this question now because i might mislead your lordships <e> <s> i cannot guarantee by third reading to come back with the answer <e> <s> when i have discussed it i shall write to your lordships as i did between committee and this stage on matters such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house yet again i do not think i can add anything more to what i said which is that i do not know what i am going to be able to tell the noble lord until i have talked to my honourable friend <e> <s> as soon as i have i shall be able to let your lordships know <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend i think that he is seeking by his amendment to introduce a greater degree of certainty about future events than can possibly obtain <e> <s> in practice a case is most commonly adjourned and a defendant may be remanded in custody in given circumstances because either the prosecution or the defence is not able to proceed <e> <s> even after hearing representations as is already required under the clause the court will not be able to decide when progress will take place <e> <s> moreover before the expiry of the period of remand the circumstances of either the prosecution or the defence might easily change <e>", "<cs> my lords deprivation of liberty pending trial is a very serious matter <e> <s> we have sought in clause to make a provision which balances scope for improvements in the management of cases before the court and in the deployment of prison service resources with safeguards for the liberties of the accused person <e>", "<cs> the scrutiny found that at many remand hearings no progress is made in the process of bringing the case to trial after the first or second appearance when applications are often made for bail or legal aid appearances are very often pure formalities <e> <s> and yet these fruitless appearances impose a burden on the court which must conduct a hearing and on the prison service which must produce the prisoners often from considerable distances away <e> <s> on the basis of findings in the court escort scrutiny we issued a consultation document in december on the proposal that courts should be permitted to remand for up to a maximum of days <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house if i need it before i sit down it is said that all prisons are overcrowded but as the noble lord knows about half are at or below capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment raises some very important points about the way in which juveniles awaiting trial or sentence in the crown court are dealt with <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment would be to secure regular eight-day remand hearings for such juveniles who have been remanded in custody or local authority care <e> <s> there are two main points at issue the need to ensure that juveniles remanded in custody awaiting a crown court hearing are not deprived of their liberty unnecessarily and to ensure also that the court hearing takes place with as little delay as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very surprised at how the noble lord lord hunt and the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what i have said <e> <s> it was there at committee stage to be discussed but no noble lord moved the amendment <e> <s> it was identical to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord was here when i accepted the amendment moved by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says these questions require further careful consideration which makes it impossible for me to accept the amendment today <e> <s> indeed it will not be possible for the government to reach a conclusion on this difficult issue before this bill has passed through your lordships house <e> <s> as the noble lord said my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has written to him canvassing most of the points that i shall make <e> <s> my noble and learned friend will doubtless consider what the noble lord has said and in due course will probably receive a letter from him reinforcing the arguments that he has given to the house tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason as my right honourable friend the prime minister said on nd november is that a staff counsellor will be available to be consulted by any member of the security and intelligence services who has anxieties relating to the work of his or her service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is on a slightly different point which has to do with the oversight of the security services <e> <s> as i explained in our debate in this house on th december we believe that the direct ministerial responsibility which pertains at the moment is the best way to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble lord agrees that the creation of the post is worth while <e> <s> we believe that it will serve a useful purpose for the members of the security and intelligence services <e> <s> however it is distinct from and not related to the oversight of the services <e>", "<cs> my lords there is indeed a case for what the noble lord the leader of the opposition has suggested <e> <s> that was put forward in our debate on th december <e> <s> for the reasons which i gave then we think that the present arrangements are the right way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the words of my noble friend and happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord wigoder and the noble and learned lord lord roskill for acknowledging the importance of the undertakings that i was able to give on report about the future of stand by <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wigoder said i undertook that in future stand by would be exercised in only two situations first to remove a manifestly unsuitable juror but only if the defence agreed secondly to remove a juror in a terrorist or security case in which the attorney-general has authorised a check of the jury list but only on the personal authority of the attorney-general <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i had thought that the noble lord was speaking to both amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords first i apologise to the house when i replied to the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington on the last amendment i said that there was no intention to alter the guidelines and that i could give him an assurance <e> <s> however i cannot give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> i apologise for having misled the house on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong for this amendment to leave this house for another place without me saying a word about it <e> <s> i make no apology for the fact that the definition of public place in the clause which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale now recommends we should leave out is lifted directly from the definition of public place in the prevention of crime act <e> <s> it seems logical that it should do so <e> <s> both the act and clause have the same basic aim to make public places safer by outlawing the possession of weapons and other things that can be and regrettably are used as weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of clause is to give the secretary of state powers to specify weapons the manufacture sale and importation of which will be an offence <e> <s> the offence itself is comparable with the restriction of offensive weapons act which outlaws flick-knives <e> <s> in our debate in committee i mentioned hand claws knuckle dusters and belt buckle knives as examples of the type of weapon we had in mind <e> <s> what marks them out is the fact that they are intrinsically dangerous <e> <s> i am not sure that imitations of such weapons are in quite the same category <e> <s> it may be undesirable that they should exist but i very much doubt whether their sale needs to be covered by the criminal law with the substantial penalties including imprisonment which are provided by clause <e>", "<cs> my lords it may assist your lordships if i cite some relevant words of the divisional court in giving judgment in the nottingham justices case <e> <s> the question the justices should address they said in considering a second or subsequent application for bail is this are there any new considerations which were not before the court when the accused was last remanded in custody <e> <s> i mention this for two reasons <e> <s> first the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington said that some defence solicitors do not make an application for bail on the first appearance before a court because they do not feel fully briefed on the merits of their clients case and they do not wish to prejudice a future better developed application <e> <s> as i understood the law and i am sure noble and learned lords will correct me if i am wrong that degree of caution is unnecessary and if it results in remands in custody where an application for bail might have succeeded surely it is undesirable <e> <s> a matter which was not put before the court on the first occasion may as i understand it be put forward on the second occasion whether or not there had been a change of circumstances as such <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook at report stage to look at the matters which the noble lord lord monson raised with my honourable friend the economic secretary to the treasury who is the government minister responsible for hm customs <e> <s> i said that i could not guarantee to come back with an answer by third reading <e> <s> nevertheless i thought it right before today to convey to those of your lordships who spoke in the report stage debate the progress our further consideration had made <e> <s> this i did in a letter dated yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit to being disappointed at what the noble lord lord irvine of lairg said <e> <s> perhaps i can accuse him of something that he has accused me of that is of not listening to what was said <e> <s> to be fair i do not believe that he listened to what i said in moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he said that it has the primary aim of saving money <e> <s> i explained about the prison officers the improvement of regimes and improvements for the courts and for the police <e> <s> there are other circumstances that are taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords in the words that have haunted my noble friend the chief whip over the past six weeks i shall not detain the house for too long <e> <s> over hours of debate have taken place on this bill <e> <s> we are now nearing the end of our consideration of it for the time being <e> <s> i really do not intend to take up too much of your lordships time <e> <s> but now would seem to be the right moment to reflect on our achievements over the past few weeks <e> <s> we have had some long and valuable discussions on the bill and it leaves the house all the better for that as well as being somewhat plumper <e>", "<cs> my lords before answering that question perhaps i may pay a special tribute to my noble friend who has shown even more than her usual courage in being able to be with your lordships today <e> <s> my noble friend has set us a very great example <e>", "<cs> my lords the drug trafficking offences act set a good example world-wide of what can be done <e> <s> by nd december the high court had made restraint or charging orders freezing assets of the order of million <e> <s> and the first confiscation orders are beginning to be made as cases work through the crown court including a recent one for <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this is part of a wider programme for which over million is being provided over a four-year period to develop and introduce technical aids such as fibrescopes and x-ray machines for scanning cargo and baggage but on the particular point of robotic noses i think i too shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon is absolutely right <e> <s> an example of the co-operation that has proved a success is the recent operation in which kilograms of cocaine with a street value of million were seized at southampton which was followed by a number of arrests in holland <e> <s> this resulted from close collaboration with the french german and dutch authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that credit is due for the co-operation which has already occurred and which is a notable change in the attitudes of a number of countries that are important in this field <e> <s> we will of course continue to press hard to make it even better <e>", "<cs> my lords no but i saw the quote from the governor <e> <s> i was referring to the article which in my opinion did mislead and was certainly inaccurate in places <e> <s> it referred for instance to a commitment that had been given to commence fresh start with staff <e> <s> that is totally wrong and there are many points in that and in other articles in that paper that give me concern that a paper of that standing should not be more accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could <e> <s> but alas as the noble lord lord mishcon will know i cannot <e> <s> however my noble friend lord arran who has listened to this debate will be attending that debate and i am sure looks forward to discussing that matter with the noble earl lord longford <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i understand what the noble lord lord graham has said he is correct <e> <s> to my knowledge there is no instruction that they should go on to fresh start immediately with only prison officers <e> <s> i have mentioned that we are restricted with between six and eight prison officers being tied up on escorting contractors for external works when they could be used in the prison <e> <s> this is a matter that is still being discussed because the numbers of prison officers that are needed to bring the establishment on to fresh start has not been finalised <e> <s> so what the papers say is not accurate <e> <s> that is still a matter to be finalised and agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for his kind words <e> <s> yes i am aware that concern has been expressed about development around listed buildings <e> <s> of course no such proposal has come forward <e> <s> in view of my right honourable friends quasi-judicial function perhaps it would be wrong for me to comment any further at this stage as i am sure the house will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be corrected but at the moment i understand that there has been no planning application <e> <s> when such a planning application goes before the city planning authority at that stage the royal fine art <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there was a major change in <e> <s> before that time legislation to control development was used by governments of both shades of political opinion as and when it proved necessary <e> <s> however in the word setting was introduced which allows buildings adjacent to listed buildings which might have an effect on that listed building to be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the police take the view that the control of the sale of alcohol on trains and coaches travelling to football grounds and inside the grounds has played a significant part in the improvement of crowd behaviour in recent seasons <e> <s> there is no evidence available to quantify the relationship between alcohol consumption and crowd violence whether or not lager is sold with club labels <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first supplementary question of my noble kinswoman is no but i shall draw the matter to the attention of my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those responsible in the clubs will read todays discussions <e> <s> however i shall draw this point to the attention of my honourable friend since there is a working group which looks into matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that time spent on this problem can be beneficial <e> <s> indeed that is what has happened <e> <s> a working group was set up which consisted of government ministers the football authorities and the police <e> <s> as the house will be aware measures were announced in february of last year which have achieved considerable success and go a long way to meeting some of the points raised by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> as a result of the provisions in part v of the criminal justice scotland act a significant improvement has been seen in scotland which has resulted in increased attendances at football matches <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that question goes slightly wide of the question on the order paper which related to lager <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was moved to the department of the environment i feared that i might miss the opportunity of debating with the noble lord across the floor of the house <e> <s> i am delighted that my fear has proved unfounded and that we shall continue our discussions <e> <s> i do not know the exact number supplied <e> <s> perhaps i may look into the matter and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we all owe a debt of gratitude to the police for the tremendous amount of good work that is done in attending at football matches and other occasions where there are crowds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that this is something the government can do <e> <s> as he very well knows it is not just a matter for the government but of co-operation among the government the football authorities and the police <e> <s> i have said that i shall draw the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot stop the noble lord anticipating the next debate <e> <s> i shall not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount broadens the scope of the question <e> <s> but he is right on the fundamental point that we are all concerned about bad behaviour from excessive drinking <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be few greater experts than my noble kinswoman on underage drinking as a result of the report which she has just produced and which is being considered <e> <s> i shall draw her remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considered today important illustrations of the pollution which man makes and which man must acknowledge deal with and best of all prevent <e> <s> it is an important and very wide-ranging subject <e> <s> we are all indebted to the noble baroness for raising the debate today <e>", "<cs> i have my lords <e> <s> i have not mentioned a lot of other things which your lordships would have liked me to mention <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i begin by explaining briefly the way in which the government have proposed that the competition provisions in part i of the bill should be implemented <e> <s> my department issued a consultation paper on the matter on nd november of last year with a closing date for comments of st january <e> <s> similar papers were issued by the scottish and welsh offices at much the same time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to say another word <e> <s> as he and the noble lord lord graham of edmonton fully appreciate authorities will be able to take account of local circumstances in drawing up the specifications which we have been discussing and deciding how the work should be packaged provided that they do not prevent or distort competition <e> <s> that is one of the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> alas i do not think i have the consultation document with me though i certainly had it this morning <e> <s> the authorities are divided up alphabetically but that does not necessarily mean that z will have to contract out all its works after a it will be phased between the two so that a will be contracting out some services as will z but they will not necessarily be the same services <e> <s> however by october all the services will be contracted out throughout local authorities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just clarify the matter for the committee <e> <s> the word privatisation takes the discussion into a different sphere <e> <s> we are not talking about privatisation but about getting a competitive tender <e> <s> if the direct labour authority happens to produce the lowest tender because it is the most efficient provider of the service or indeed not necessarily the lowest because it is not incumbent upon the local authority to accept the lowest tender under the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that that is of course up to him perhaps i may answer the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> of course my noble friend lord bellwin with two s in his name is concerned about wales <e> <s> i with two ss in my name am concerned about scotland <e> <s> my noble friend lord hesketh has two es that covers england as well <e> <s> the consultation exercise for wales scotland and indeed england was carried out in and the consultation paper on implementation which is before local authorities now is also in all three countries <e>", "<cs> i believe that we are talking to amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time <e> <s> both amendments have as their laudable objective that of protecting the jobs of handicapped employees <e> <s> it is an objective with which i and i am sure all the committee have considerable sympathy <e>", "<cs> i totally agree with the noble countess that the work in these fields is important <e> <s> she referred specifically to cooking and cleaning <e> <s> i draw her attention to paragraphs b of schedule where she will find as i have that it exempts precisely what she is trying to exempt <e>", "<cs> are we discussing amendments and together <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will agree that the first two of these amendments nos <e> <s> and would in practice have a similar effect <e> <s> the first would omit entirely the power to add further activities without recourse to primary legislation the second would delay its use until so far into the future as to make it rather academic <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will forgive me if i do not give the noble lord lord beloff an answer at the moment because this treads on treasury rules and the annual budgets of local authorities <e> <s> as i am very new to the job i hope that the committee will allow me to find out the answer and write to my noble friend on that particular point putting copies in the library as usual <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lord has slightly misled the committee on that last point <e> <s> we are not talking solely about sport and leisure <e> <s> we are discussing the right of adding other items by order to the bill <e>", "<cs> i should start my response by emphasising that the government have recognised from the outset that it would be nonsense to require authorities to expose to competition minor bits of cleaning or other work carried out by people whose main job will not be subject to competition <e>", "<cs> the philosophy behind what we seek to do is as follows <e> <s> if over per cent <e> <s> of the activities carried out is comprised of cleaning for instance as suggested by the noble baroness those should be put out to tender in the way that we all think is right as we believe that this can be done satisfactorily without impinging on security <e> <s> the noble baroness produced an example of a swing of the pendulum at one end and compared it with one at the other end <e> <s> it is for this kind of reason that i should like to have another look at the proposal <e>", "<cs> such problems can be overcome <e> <s> if there is more caretaking than cleaning one must consider that in the terms of the bill <e>", "<cs> it may be that the local authority would wish to redraw the responsibilities to take account of the provisions in the bill <e> <s> in regard to the suggestion of the noble countess the local authority may wish to consider who was doing what before putting out any tender <e>", "<cs> i did not make that assertion i was exposing the fact that a loophole exists <e>", "<cs> i think we have had an extremely useful debate on what i call the safety net amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they are all related to the same point as the noble baroness lady stedman said <e> <s> i am of course as concerned as anyone that local authorities should be able to carry out their functions unimpeded by contractor failure but i really do believe that noble lords opposite have very considerably exaggerated the extent to which this bill will create any serious danger of functions not being fulfilled <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and would raise the threshold below which work is exempt from the bills provisions very considerably <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> couched in terms of employees probably translates into gross expenditure of the order of between and <e> <s> it might be more appropriate to describe such a threshold not as a <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i was totally floored by the amendments and misinterpreted them completely <e> <s> i am therefore extremely grateful for the clear way in which the noble baroness explained them and i tell her that there is some good news to come <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord but i thought that we were dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> to together <e>", "<cs> it is entirely up to the noble lord not to me <e>", "<cs> of course i can give the assurance which the noble lord is seeking from me that i will read very carefully the points made by the noble lord and discuss them with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble baroness and my noble friend that the government have sympathy with the suggestion that ground maintenance work which is scientific in nature should be exempt from competition <e> <s> there is an outstanding commitment to consider whether an appropriate amendment should be brought forward and i apologise for not having brought forward an amendment by this stage <e> <s> therefore i am almost tempted to accept this amendment as it stands <e> <s> however it does seem to stray a little too far in the work that it would exempt <e> <s> there is no obvious reason i would suggest why work in woodlands and forests should not be exposed to competition <e>", "<cs> i cannot claim to have been a firefighter in the war but as members of the committee know i have had considerable experience of the fire service having had the privilege of working with it when i was in my former position in the home office <e>", "<cs> i shall look at this matter without commitment <e> <s> i do not think it has nearly the strength of the argument of the fire service <e> <s> the machinery that we are concerned with is considerably more simple <e> <s> i remember from my days in aberdeenshire when the farmers did much of the snow clearing and gritting of the roads quite happily for the local authorities <e> <s> perhaps if the noble lord is content we shall return to this between now and another stage when we can discuss it informally <e>", "<cs> i think it is right that i should respond to the amendment in a little more detail <e> <s> i said that i would look at the matter again without commitment because the noble lord was willing to speed up the proceedings and i think that i can do so <e> <s> however i stress to the noble earl lord minto that i see a great difference between the request in the bill for the contracting out to tender of the maintenance and repair of fire vehicles as opposed to winter maintenance vehicles <e> <s> i disagree strongly with the noble earl and i believe that local authorities will be able to produce a contract which will be sufficiently clear to enable the private sector to do exactly what is being done at the moment by the direct labour force should it come forward with a more economical price for the same service <e> <s> that is the difference and i think that the committee lost that point in the argument <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for moving the amendment <e> <s> it provides an opportunity to explain the distinction drawn by the bill between works contracts and functional work and the way in which the controls on work contracts imposed by clause will operate <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is a necessity for me to come clean <e> <s> the committee will probably be aware by now that until very recently the view taken in my department was that correct interpretation of the dates as regards functional work already had the effect which the noble lords opposite by their amendment are now suggesting <e>", "<cs> as the consultation process is continuing a point to which i referred earlier it is something that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will bear in mind <e> <s> the correct interpretation will play an important part when finally deciding on a phasing-in competition <e> <s> as that has not been decided i cannot answer the hypothetical question that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton posed to me because it is part of the consultation process <e>", "<cs> it is <e> <s> it is not eight weeks <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may add one word to give a clearer picture <e> <s> in our proposals the authorities will have had to deal with only one activity and one-tenth of ground maintenance by st april next year <e>", "<cs> i believe that it becomes functional work under clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord opposite for moving this amendment <e> <s> he is absolutely right to say that it is consistent with the remarks that i have been making this afternoon and indeed that have been made by my noble friends <e> <s> in particular my noble friend lady blatch has been saying precisely this <e>", "<cs> we believe that clause is a sensible and important provision aimed at putting beyond doubt that closure notices issued under the bill are to prevail over any other statutory provisions requiring or enabling authorities to carry out work <e>", "<cs> it is of course possible to argue to the general proposition that whoever is responsible for the imposition of a burden should pay for it though in fact that is of course not a general rule by any means <e> <s> householders have to pay for the cost of complying with building regulations for instance and there are many similar examples <e>", "<cs> the second part of this amendment would apply to the consequences of contractor failure resulting from the provisions of this bill a legal doctrine that quite rightly does not apply to the consequences of any other sort of contractor failure <e>", "<cs> i was rather surprised to hear the noble lord lord graham of edmonton moving these amendments as i thought that they were all grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and which he did not move <e> <s> because they are so hound up this has come as a surprise <e> <s> therefore i <e>", "<cs> a local authority can do only those things necessary for the discharge of its functions and the local authorities goods and services act is a minor empowering act which makes it legitimate for local authorities to supply goods or services to other local authorities or to public bodies designated under the act <e> <s> the designated public bodies must be exercising functions of a public nature with the result that local authorities cannot supply the private sector <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the concern that he showed in respect of this matter and for explaining it so fully to the committee <e>", "<cs> before i respond to the first group of amendments to clause i should like briefly to remind the committee of the thinking behind the provisions of part ii of this bill <e> <s> we do not believe that the contractual process between public authorities and the contractors they employ should be the place for political posturing <e> <s> nor do we believe that local authorities should take upon themselves the role of extra-statutory enforcement agencies on matters which are already the subject of existing statute and which where appropriate have their own enforcement agencies to make sure the law is carried out <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is asking for local authorities to have a right to investigate all sorts of matters which have nothing to do with the commercial contract which should be for the benefit of the ratepayers <e> <s> he is asking that the local authorities should be allowed to investigate whatever they want to investigate and to set a long list of questions about anything that springs to mind <e> <s> one only has to look at the pre-tender form of leicester city council and the questions that they seek to have answered before a possible contractor is even allowed on to the list <e> <s> that has led to a situation which has produced very poor results for the ratepayer <e> <s> what we are seeking with this bill is to improve services for the taxpayer and the ratepayer <e> <s> i think that at this stage i ought to call in aid some words of councillor margaret hodge the leader of the islington borough council and an unlikely supporter of my argument i should have thought as reported in the <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can he helpful to the committee <e> <s> the questions to which the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has referred under the race relations act will be the subject of detailed debate at a later stage <e> <s> they are the subject of consultation at the moment <e> <s> he failed to draw the committees attention to the fact that in the act there is a special section which says that it is the responsibility of the local authority to perform certain functions <e> <s> we are not talking about that in the amendments before the committee but about a request by local authorities to look into matters over which they have no jurisdiction and which are covered by other matters of primary law <e>", "<cs> the local authority has the right to make sure that those who will submit a tender have the financial ability and the competence to carry out the necessary skilled work in order to make sure that the contract is completed <e>", "<cs> it is clear from our very useful discussion that we all understand the motives behind the amendment moved by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the detailed and comprehensive background that he gave <e> <s> the noble lord ranged widely over what had happened in the past to hopes of including some special provision and referred to remarks made on second reading in another place <e>", "<cs> i can confirm that the governments initiatives to which my right <e>", "<cs> it would be wrong for me to comment on that case because i have not been able to study it <e> <s> however i can assure the noble baroness that i shall look into it now that she has raised the point <e> <s> i must repeat to the committee that our legal advice is that we cannot write a clause such as that proposed in the amendment moved by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton onto the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put it in a nutshell <e> <s> the difficulty which the noble lord lord pitt faces is the question of a legal opinion <e> <s> on the one hand the noble lord lord graham of edmonton as a client of the ala has asked for a legal opinion and that legal opinion says that it is in order <e> <s> on the other hand the government as a client have sought a legal opinion <e> <s> the legal opinion which they have received is that it is not legal <e> <s> as a client one may either disregard ones legal opinion or accept it <e> <s> we accept our legal opinion that the amendment proposed by the noble lord would be illegal <e>", "<cs> if i correctly sense the mood of the committee it may be that i should respond at this stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean said that he was not a signatory to this amendment <e> <s> i believe that he is a signatory to the amendment which we are discussing although he is right in saying that he is not a signatory to the amendment tabled in the name of the right reverend prelate which is linked with it <e> <s> of course he is a signatory to amendments nos <e> <s> and which are linked <e>", "<cs> under the ec convention of course <e> <s> there is the competition <e>", "<cs> i do not want to become involved in a technical argument but it may well be that it is a moral matter to the councillors and therefore they might try to write that into a contract which would he illegal for an ec contractor <e> <s> however the principle of what the noble viscount said does hold water for the argument i put forward <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord pitt and i differ again <e> <s> we say that thank goodness in this country we can allow the individual to discriminate as he thinks fit <e> <s> we say it is wrong for the local authority to write such discrimination into a contract <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for tabling this amendment <e> <s> it may just help the committee if i explain the background to clause h <e> <s> this subsection will have no effect on the standards with which builders have to comply under the building acts and associated building regulations <e> <s> we must continue to ensure that building work is carried out to an adequate standard and nothing in this bill will interfere with that <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord dean that quality control is vital <e> <s> the clerks of works have an important role to play <e> <s> i would remind the committee that the nh bc and local authorities apply exactly the same standards and that therefore there will be no diminution in quality control as a result of this bill <e> <s> that is something the government would not wish to see in any case <e>", "<cs> may i seek clarification on that <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a states <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to take advice on this because that is the right way of dealing with such matters <e> <s> of course it was said that we could deal with these points later because they can be raised later <e> <s> but as i understand it and i stand to be corrected the fact that the amendment was then voted on altered the position completely <e> <s> but i shall he happy to take advice on that <e>", "<cs> there has not been an error at all <e> <s> the noble lord took his amendment to a division and it was settled in the division lobbies <e> <s> i cannot stop him discussing anything on clause stand part <e> <s> but i think we should obey the rules of the house and the advice that i have now received is that it is not in order to speak to these amendments because they have been specifically voted on <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assure the noble lord lord dean and my noble friend lord balfour that the government are as concerned as they are over standards <e> <s> i accept that a contractors membership of a reputable trade association is often used by authorities as an indication of certain professional standards or competence <e> <s> but it is not the only method by which authorities should evaluate the merits of a company with whom they are considering doing business <e> <s> it would indeed be foolish to use such membership as the sole yardstick against which to judge a contractors suitability for inclusion in an approved list or for the award of a contract <e> <s> far more relevant i suggest is the contractors previous work record and financial standing <e>", "<cs> i wish to answer a couple of points that have been raised particularly by the noble lord lord dean of beswick who was concerned about the nhbcs role in the private house building sector <e> <s> with respect i do not think that that is at question at the moment <e> <s> we are talking about work for local authorities <e> <s> the two should not be confused <e>", "<cs> i remind the noble lord of what i said at the beginning of todays proceedings concerning using the same argument over and over again on all the amendments because the argument is consistent throughout <e>", "<cs> what we are saying is not just another attack on local authorities <e> <s> i draw the noble lords attention to the requirements of for instance sheffield city council or the council of the london borough of greenwich which have insisted that those that are to be on the tender list shall be members of trade associations <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his question <e> <s> i should go to the person who would do the best job and who i was certain would perform in the way that i wanted him to perform <e> <s> being a surveyor and a member of the rics i can say that when i recently sold my flat in london i did not go to somebody who was a member of the rics <e> <s> i went to somebody who could do the best job at the right price <e> <s> that person did not happen to be a member of the rics <e> <s> although he was perfectly well qualified to do the job he did not want to be a member of the institution <e>", "<cs> it is up to you <e>", "<cs> i am well aware of the importance potential and success of women in this world <e> <s> my mother is still alive <e> <s> i have one sister and four half-sisters the leader of my party is a woman i have a wife and a daughter and a dog which is a bitch <e> <s> my son and i are struggling nobly to support the male race <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this very important debate <e> <s> i could not agree more with the noble lord lord dean of beswick when he said that we all agree with the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> indeed i have recently had the opportunity of looking at situations where great strides have been made in the provision of work for the disabled which show encouraging signs for the future <e> <s> however none of the situations at which i looked resulted from contract compliance <e>", "<cs> i am very well aware that the employment service takes its role in this area extremely seriousy <e> <s> on numbers i cannot give a figure to the noble baroness at this moment but the matter having been raised i shall look into it <e>", "<cs> both the noble lords lord carter and lord dean of beswick have raised an extremely important point <e> <s> i do not dispute the assertion of the noble lord lord dean that should local government be given the resources and the extra manpower <e>", "<cs> what i was going on to say was that there might be expertise in some areas of local government that has undertaken this work but for a very great number of authorities there will undoubtedly be extra resource implications if they have to undertake it <e> <s> however that takes us back to the crucial point <e> <s> do we wish to set up the local authorities as extra-statutory enforcement agencies <e> <s> some have not taken on that role and some have but that is the basic difference between members on that side of the committee and the government <e> <s> we believe that local authorities should not be setting themselves up as extra-statutory enforcement agencies <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friends lady blatch and lord campbell of croy because they have absolutely hit the nail on the head <e> <s> the local authorities can do what they want to do within their own powers for their own workforce but what we are talking about here is the outside contractual process <e> <s> all we say is that they should not use that contractual process as an extra-statutory enforcement mechanism <e> <s> the right people to be doing that as my noble friend lord campbell of croy said are the employment service <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is probably absolutely right to say that i have missed a point that he has been trying to make <e> <s> however he knows that i will carefully read the <e>", "<cs> as usual my noble friend has raised an interesting drafting point with his amendment no <e> <s> d which would delete the word draft from the term draft tender in clause b <e> <s> however such an amendment would appear to have a consequential effect on clause b and i hope therefore that he will agree to withdraw his amendment while i have a further look at it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady blatch for her speech and i recognise the sincerity of her view that the provisions of clause should not form part of the bill <e> <s> however i think it is right that i should point out that clause which is of course a clause added by the government at report stage of the bills consideration in the other place has been included in recognition of various ministerial undertakings that nothing in the bill shall prevent authorities carrying out their existing statutory duties <e> <s> under the terms of section of the race relations act local authorities have a statutory duty to carry out their functions with due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and the need to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord thomas for moving the amendment on behalf of my noble friend lord balfour and for having brought to light what would appear to be an omission <e> <s> i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with the sentiments behind my noble friends amendment but fail to see why a potential contractor who has had a contract denied on noncommercial grounds should not receive damages in respect of the costs that he has reasonably incurred in submitting a tender as provided in clause <e> <s> i imagine that those costs would include what my noble friend describes as expenditure on unnecessary studies provided that that expenditure was reasonable of course <e>", "<cs> i am sure i speak on behalf of all members of the committee when i say how nice it is to see the noble lord lord mcintosh back <e> <s> his place has been well filled by the noble lords lord dean and lord graham <e> <s> i realise that the opposition needed a change of bowling but we shall continue stoutly to defend the bill which is an excellent piece of work <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the sentiment of the noble lord lord mcintosh in moving this amendment <e> <s> of course authorities should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the contractors they employ are competent to carry out the work involved in accordance with the health and safety legislation <e> <s> however we believe that to include such a provision on the face of the bill would suggest that provisions in clause somehow prevent authorities from taking such steps <e> <s> no provision exists and we believe that to amend the bill in the way suggested would therefore be entirely superfluous <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to extend the period in which a public authority responds to a request for reasons for any of the decisions listed in clause <e> <s> we do not consider the days period suggested by the noble lord lord mcintosh to be a reasonable one in this instance <e> <s> the public authority will be aware of its reasons for making its decision at the moment that decision is taken <e> <s> if it is reasonable for a person affected by a decision to request reasons within a -day period of the decision notice as specified in clause it is not unreasonable to expect an authority to respond within an identical timescale <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has argued that compiling fresh approved lists to accommodate what it is claimed will be the small number of firms who have possibly been excluded by non-commercial considerations could be a time-consuming expensive and wasteful exercise by the local authority <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the canter round the course of housing that the noble lord lord mcintosh has given us on these clauses <e> <s> there has been some concern about the provision of assistance to special needs groups particularly where grants to voluntary organisations are involved <e> <s> we have reassured them that we do not want to stop or impede a great deal of worthwhile activity which comes within the scope of these new consent requirements in clause <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that i know he would not have expected me to make any complaint about local authorities without justification <e> <s> i should like to draw his attention to the case at sheffield where it was clear that the local authority tried to circumnavigate the financial controls that had been placed upon it <e> <s> that is one extremely good reason for having this clause <e>", "<cs> i do not need to repeat in my remarks on these amendments the full explanation of and background to clause given on second reading by my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> it will however serve a useful purpose to remind the committee of the purpose and nature of the governments proposals <e> <s> they are fundamental to the governments opposition to this amendment and indeed the other amendments to this part of the bill and which i take it with the leave of the committee we can speak to generally as they are all related <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal expected quite such a long debate after posing me what appears a relatively simple but is in fact a difficult question <e> <s> i am grateful that her question has provoked such a useful debate <e> <s> of course the answer must be that it very much depends on the way that the local authority produces the documentation <e> <s> in the example of the noble baroness it could be done legally <e> <s> but it is not difficult to imagine some local authorities doing it in a way designed to affect party political support <e> <s> that would be illegal <e> <s> therefore without being able to comment further one would have to see the precise wording that the local authority used in the example that the noble baroness gave <e> <s> the question of the noble baroness prompted a good reaction and very useful support for which i am grateful from my noble friends lord harmarnicholls lord bellwin and lady carnegy of lour who answered the points better than i have been able to do <e>", "<cs> i wish to make it clear that i was speaking of the amendment of the noble lord lord hayter which deals with the first part of the proposal <e> <s> that as i understood it was what the noble lord lord mcintosh was criticising because it brought in a second test <e> <s> however it certainly does not do that <e> <s> it merely explains what the auditor or the courts in due course have to take into account <e>", "<cs> if i sense the mood of the committee it might just be that should say a few words at this stage <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the book and the teacher to which the noble lord has referred may promote by various means the homosexuality which the clause is designed to ban <e> <s> if the book in question is part of a range of other books on the shelves of a library in a school or of a local library those are facts to be considered by an appropriate authority at the time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson whom i am glad to see taking part in the debate i am sorry he was unable to do so earlier suggests that the prohibition on the promotion of homosexuality should be qualified if the majority of electors entitled to vote at a local poll give prior approval to the proposal that the local authority may underake an activity that promotes homosexuality <e> <s> quite apart from the cost implications of such referenda and the constitutional problems of deciding issues in that way the government have other worries that make us feel that we are unable to accept the noble lords <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the suggestion of the noble lord lord airedale because it is to the courts that we look to draw what inferences they wish on the example put forward by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> that means of course that the courts can take into account all the relevant circumstances in determining the purpose of the local authority not just what the authority claims to be its purpose <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peston has proposed a specific exemption in amendment no <e> <s> for the stocking and lending of works relating to homosexuality in the normal discharge of the functions of a public library or the library of an educational institution <e> <s> in his speech he quite rightly referred to the fear of those in the library world that the normal functions of public libraries would be constrained as a result of this clause <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i am saying that if the local authorities put a range of materials in their libraries we do not wish to affect them with the clause <e> <s> if a local authority goes out of its way deliberately to promote homosexuality that is a matter of great concern <e>", "<cs> i take the arguments and theories of noble lords opposite very seriously indeed <e> <s> if such a matter comes to court for judicial review and leave must be given for that to happen and the court looks at all the circumstances it then has to assess the intention of the local authority <e> <s> if the authority did nothing other than provide on all its shelves books which were for the promotion of homosexuality i dare say that under the clause it would not stand a terribly good chance <e> <s> however i should not wish to prejudge any situation <e> <s> as i have said time and again if there was a wide range of books covering a variety of subjects we would not wish to catch that in the clause <e>", "<cs> i was surprised by what the noble lord lord mcintosh said about my earlier comments <e> <s> all i did was repeat what i had said admittedly in slightly different words <e> <s> i thought it would be wrong for me to repeat to the committee exactly the same words that i had used before <e> <s> however let me repeat them for the committees sake <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord inadvertently did not hear me <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to write to the noble lord on that particular point because i think that it would be the right way to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> on the best legal advice that i have available to me i am advised that this amendment is necessary to make it absolutely plain what inferences the court can draw when and if a case is brought before it <e> <s> contrary to what the noble lord <e> <s> lord airedale said my legal adviser on this i must take the legal advice not being a lawyer myself says that these words are very necessary <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord lord jenkins was very ingenious in the way in which he introduced his amendment <e> <s> he highlighted the answer that i would give him which has been the fairly consistent answer that i have been able to give this afternoon <e> <s> then he said get me off the hook let us exclude theatres <e> <s> therefore i have to repeat that the government do not share the noble lords view that local authorities funding of the theatre would be affected by clause except in circumstances in which a local authority or a group which it was funding set out deliberately to promote homosexuality <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for giving the committee the opportunity to discuss the question of pupil counselling <e> <s> clearly it is important for a local authority and its staff to feel free to discuss with a pupil any problems that arise because of a pupils personal preferences including problems that involve the discussion of homosexuality <e> <s> the government naturally share the oppositions concern that local authorities should not be prevented from ensuring that pupils with personal difficulties have access to persons be they teachers or specialised counsellors who can discuss those personal circumstances in an objective and helpful fashion <e> <s> that is quite different of course from promoting homosexuality or promoting the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship <e>", "<cs> of course the noble lords lord gifford and lord mcintosh of haringey were right to raise the question of a pretended family relationship <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not say earlier that this is the very point which i took back to look at <e> <s> it was the amendment of my noble friend lady cox <e> <s> i wanted to have another look at the wording between now and another stage and i shall do so <e>", "<cs> of course the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is right to raise the question of sex education <e> <s> however he knows full well that under the education no <e> <s> act control passed from the local authorities to school governors <e> <s> it is right that one should still consult ones colleagues in other departments and more than one department is involved in this <e> <s> but it would be wrong for me to spell out the details that the noble lord lord mccarthy requires <e>", "<cs> at first sight the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey seems very reasonable <e> <s> we are all against discrimination <e> <s> we all want to protect civil rights <e> <s> however i must ask the committee to look more closely at the amendment <e> <s> on closer examination i think that it proves a trojan horse which in the guise of something to which we can all subscribe could in fact remove much of the effect of clause <e> <s> in the first place i ought to point out that the amendment is concerned not with discrimination by the local authority but with the local authoritys attempts to discourage discrimination by others <e> <s> therefore the whole amendment is built upon a busybodys charter <e> <s> it deals not with the local authoritys own decisions but with other peoples conduct of their own business <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware english heritage advised on the listed building consent but as that is a matter which is before my right honourable friend the secretary of state i cannot comment further on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend quite rightly has made full representations to westminster city council which is the planning authority on this matter <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> governments of various parties over the years have delegated powers to local authorities who have been able to undertake those powers quite responsibly <e> <s> my right honourable friend has given this matter careful consideration as i said in my original answer and he also gave the reasons his decision was made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite able to make representations to westminster city council <e> <s> he has doubtless seen sketches in the planning application <e> <s> i remind the house that westminster city council has to have regard as all local authorities have to have regard in considering the environmental impact in such a sensitive location to the town and country planning act as amended by the local government planning and land act <e>", "<cs> my lords of course this matter is up to westminster city council when it looks at all the facts and indeed the planning application <e> <s> it must bear in mind its responsibilities under the various planning acts some of which i have already mentioned <e> <s> i am sure that the council will consider the matter and indeed your lordships representations made in this debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that there has been considerable concern voiced about this proposed development <e> <s> indeed my noble friend said that it had been going on for months <e> <s> i am sure that local authorities would not be in a position to consult each of their electors on any planning application and particularly on one such as this which goes wider than just the ratepayers and electors of the westminster city council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased of course to convey the feelings of the house to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the comments of my noble friend on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it may help the committee if i confirm that only the two government amendments were accepted <e>", "<cs> perhaps it might be right that i should follow the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> our debates yesterday showed how much we differ in our views on this clause <e> <s> we now have the chance to stand back from the detail of the amendments and view the clause as a whole <e> <s> as we do so <e> <s> i think it is right to remind the committee what we think this clause is about why we support it and why we do not think it causes problems <e>", "<cs> this new clause and the new schedule empower auditors to take early action to secure the compliance by authorities with the law governing their financial affairs <e> <s> these provisions arise from widespread dissatisfaction over the long delays in auditors bringing proceedings where authorities have disregarded or deliberately flouted the law <e> <s> the surcharge cases which arose from the late rate-making in have illustrated just how long such an action can take to be resolved <e> <s> the auditor is still progressing his inquiries in four london boroughs nearly three years after the event <e>", "<cs> i fully accept my share of the responsibility for putting down this amendment <e> <s> the reason i thought it right to put the amendment down was that i remember being in opposition when clauses and schedules of this size were put down at a late stage <e> <s> i always felt that the earlier i saw them the better <e> <s> i thought that members opposite would prefer me to put it down late though it is at committee stage for immediate comment than to wait for report stage <e> <s> i always felt in opposition that that was the right thing for the government to do <e>", "<cs> i see the opposition chief whip there and in that case i tread even more carefully than i would normally when it comes to discussing the usual channels <e> <s> of course i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> i shall discuss it with my noble friend the chief whip <e> <s> i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has argued very persuasively in favour of the two original amendments nos <e> <s> c and d which would provide members of the public with direct access to the local commissioner for administration instead of having to refer complaints through a member of the authority concerned <e> <s> i understand his concern that we should not put unnecessary obstacles in the way of individuals wishing to complain to the local ombudsman <e> <s> this was also the concern of the widdicombe inquiry into the conduct of local authority business which also recommended that complainants should have direct access to the local ombudsman <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord dean of beswick would be to remove powers given to the commission for the new towns in under an amendment to the special development order which provides a framework for planning approvals for new towns <e> <s> under section of the new towns act the secretary of state may after due consultation approve development proposals put forward by new town development corporations <e> <s> prior to whenever the commission for the new towns took over the remaining responsibilities of a development corporation it was unable to carry through outstanding development schemes which had already received section approval apart from those schemes which were already in progress where binding commitments had been entered into or where the development corporation had disposed of the land prior to the transfer date <e> <s> this seriously restricted the ability of the commission to complete the task of rapidly and effectively rounding off development in the towns it inherited <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> raises an important point <e> <s> i do not necessarily agree with him but before i comment more fully this is something that i should like to consider in a little more detail and i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that both noble lords were able to welcome the statement as such but not necessarily all its contents <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord talked about consultation with the staff <e> <s> i shall come on to consultation with the staff but we are concerned with the future of the staff <e> <s> where one has a declining market where departments are going out to look at suppliers other than the crown suppliers and the crown suppliers is facing a narrowing market surely the right approach is to encourage the crown suppliers which has about per cent <e> <s> of the global market to go into the private sector to compete and to get a wider market <e> <s> that is the right way for the future of the staff <e>", "<cs> my lords let me just deal with all the other points <e> <s> i think that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right on his first point and that is a major reason for the government to proceed on this route <e> <s> however i cannot give him a firm answer at the moment on the date of the legislation but we hope that it will be in the fairly near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend who has considerably more experience of these matters than i have <e> <s> i hope that your lordships took on board his relevant comments about what the managers of the crown suppliers want <e>", "<cs> my lords pensions are always a sensitive and difficult area that deserves great consideration <e> <s> that will be given <e> <s> concerning sheltered workshops i can only repeat that the conditions that may be made by any government as a requirement for supplying to them can be introduced in the public or the private sector but we realise what an important part this is for small firms and sheltered workshops <e> <s> we take our commitment to them very seriously <e> <s> of course i cannot give guarantees and i am sure that the noble lord will realise that <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> indeed i can confirm to my noble friend that the fund is active in that sphere <e> <s> it has just included and aided work with regard to a medieval coin find in aberdeen <e>", "<cs> my lords the fund has trustees nobly led by the noble lord lord charteris of amisfield and it does an exceptionally good job without interference from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the storm of th october damaged a number of pre- woodlands <e> <s> for the future we believe satisfactory protection against damage by man is provided not only through designation where appropriate as sites of special scientific interest or national nature reserves but also by the forestry commissions felling controls and planting grants with its associated consultation procedures and by tree preservation orders <e> <s> in administering these arrangements full use is made of an inventory of ancient woodlands being compiled by the nature <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness rightly said the committee is at present sitting and therefore it would be wrong for me to prejudge what it will say <e> <s> however i shall draw the committees attention to her comments <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the aspects we are considering <e> <s> however our initial belief is that the general principle must be that clearance is the responsibility of the individual owner <e> <s> as regards ancient woodlands as the noble baroness knows well there are many benefits to nature by not clearing them too quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords not at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords our discussion gives me a nice opportunity to welcome the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> we look forward to hearing him take part <e> <s> i hope that we may persuade him before we conclude the report stage that he is sitting on the wrong side of the house and that the charges concerning errors of judgment about the bill are totally unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said in moving his amendment its purpose is to ensure that in exercising a number of the order and regulation-making powers under the bill my right honourable friend takes account of authorities civil defence and emergency planning responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady carnegy of lour for raising a point which seems to have been overlooked <e> <s> it is that my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment for scotland and for wales issued a consultation paper on this matter on th september on proposals which dealt with the applying of the competitive tendering provisions of the bill to the management of local authority sport <e>", "<cs> my lords unusually for the noble baroness she is incorrect <e> <s> there was a consultation document for england and i know that birmingham received it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government accept that we must allow sufficient time for consultations before we bring forward orders to add new activities to the list in clause <e> <s> indeed since consultation is provided for by statute my right honourable friend would be open to challenge if he did not do so <e> <s> however this amendment seems to mean that we would have to allow at least months for consultations <e> <s> we believe that to be excessive <e> <s> i should have thought that allowing three months for comments would be perfectly adequate in most cases and it should not take the government many months to consider those comments reach a decision and bring forward an order <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord repeat that question please <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that there would be more than months <e> <s> i said that instead of the months allowed for comments by the noble lord we thought three months would be about right <e> <s> but there would then be a period during which my department would look at the matter and consider comments made during the consultation period before reaching a decision and bringing forward an order <e>", "<cs> my lords since we last debated this point i have looked carefully at what was said on that occasion and taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments indicate a feeling that the gross expenditure level proposed in my departments consultation paper has already been decided upon and that now it has supposedly been set it will remain at the same level for years to come irrespective of inflation or of experience of the bills operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for moving this amendment which as she said introduces the substantive amendment amendment no <e> <s> which would exempt work whose primary purpose was research or plant preservation from the definition of ground maintenance work which will be subject to competition <e> <s> as the noble baroness reminded me i promised in committee that the government would <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to all that has been said on this difficult and sensitive subject and i have re-read carefully the points previously made in committee <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for having raised the matter again at this stage of the bill <e> <s> i remain unconvinced by the view that it is impossible to involve private contractors in fire vehicle maintenance in a satisfactory way <e> <s> from my own experience i think that if fire authorities were less wedded to their existing ways of carrying out their functions they might well find scope for substantial cost savings through competition without any loss of service quality <e> <s> the government take very seriously the pursuit of greater efficiency and value for money in the fire service <e>", "<cs> my lords of course they have been consulted <e> <s> i spoke at length with cafo on a regular basis when i was at the home office <e> <s> i visited workshops to look at service vehicles <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord will be pleased at the concession i have given to my noble friend following the moving of the amendment <e> <s> i am willing to give the commitment to use the exemption in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry the noble lord lord dean of beswick takes that attitude <e> <s> i believed that i was approaching this problem in a most constructive way <e> <s> i tried to help in the discussions which have taken place on this matter <e> <s> if in the light of experience it appears that this work can be contracted out then that will remain an option <e> <s> as the noble lord knows because he has read the bill and taken part in the debate under clause consultations with interested parties will of course include cafo <e> <s> the noble and learned lord knows only too well that that must take place <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would either have no effect at all or it would have an effect that i believe is totally unjustified depending on how one interprets the word may <e> <s> under the provisions governing competition for functional work authorities must invite tenders from at least three contractors who are not defined authorities unless fewer than three contractors respond to the advertisement inviting contractors to register their interest <e>", "<cs> my lords although i sympathise with the intentions of the amendment as i am sure the noble lord lord dean of beswick will understand i believe that its aim of not penalising local authorities for employing disabled or handicapped persons is best achieved by other means <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord repeat his question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e> <s> perhaps i may say another word on this matter <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that the local authorities do not have to submit the contracts to the secrtary of state <e> <s> what this part of the bill is doing is to define the financial objectives concerned by reference to such factors as the secretary of state thinks fit <e> <s> if the local authorities fail to make the financial return required they can explain why <e> <s> at that point they can tell the secretary of state about the disabled costs <e> <s> but that is in relation to carrying out the activity and not in relation to contract letting <e>", "<cs> my lords i happily make an apology to the noble lord because i did promise to write to him <e> <s> but there i was poised with pen in hand when lo <e> <s> and behold i saw the amendment <e> <s> at that point i thought that i would not write to him that i would save the stamp as that would be very cost-effective and that i would supply that information when he moved the amendment <e> <s> so here i am to answer the noble lord and to inform the house that the amendment is superfluous <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean of beswick has said that it is to be regretted that the government have had to put down an amendment at this stage of the bill <e> <s> to some extent i agree with him <e> <s> but i must reiterate that had it not been for a small minority of local authorities which saw a loophole it would not have been necessary to put the amendment down <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to that point when i gave way to the noble lord <e> <s> it is true that we only heard very recently that some local authorities were considering setting up such companies and not through a poltergeist experience by my right honourable friend <e> <s> the noble lord knows better than i do the formal and informal contacts between the department and the local authorities <e> <s> therefore we felt it right when such a loophole was clearly going to be exploited that it should be closed before the event rather than after some authorities had used it to avoid the responsibilities to be laid on them by this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i can confirm that we are in principle talking about the k <e> <s> out of the that are to be listed have already been listed <e> <s> in addition more than examples of the earlier k model have also been listed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is ingenious in turning a question about listing into a question about servicing <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl lord halsbury can find dr whos tardis i am sure that my noble friend lord montagu of beaulieu who is the governments adviser as chairman of english heritage will come to the rescue and recommend the listing of it <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend that is rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be pleased that we are keeping so many of the red telephone boxes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i am sure that the whole house is grateful to him for the work that he does with english heritage in recommending the listing of these boxes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the red telephone box is becoming increasingly famous <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a valid point <e> <s> one of the reasons for the change in the design is that some of the earlier telephone boxes which we are listing were not the most salubrious of places to go into <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords the new clause proposed under this amendment is different in form from that moved by the noble lord lord basnett at committee stage but i have to say that our objections to the principle behind both amendments remain the same <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord misunderstood me <e> <s> i hope that i have made myself clear <e> <s> of course there is responsibility on a local authority for its own employees <e> <s> i am saying that it should not have that enforcement duty on contractors and tenderers <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord has read what i said on disabled people on other occasions with regard to the bill <e> <s> if there are extra costs in employing local authorities in a direct labour organisation these can be discounted when it comes to the tendering situation <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments so ably moved by my noble friend lady platt of writtle who unfortunately was not able to <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i shall take the word as insignificant <e> <s> however a provision in a bill is not insignificant it is rather vital which is why we have translated into this bill that section of the race relations act rather than anything in the sex discrimination act which does not relate to the issue <e> <s> when the noble baroness said that her amendment was an enabling amendment to allow the two commissions that is the commission for racial equality and the equal opportunities commission to adopt the same practices she was not quite right <e> <s> i think that she will now realise that the amendment has nothing to do with the powers of the equal opportunities commission and that it relates solely to the local authoritys powers <e>", "<cs> my lords we have again had an interesting debate on an issue which has come generally to be known as local labour and i recognise the efforts of some noble lords opposite in attempting to draft their amendment to overcome the objections to this type of provision which were upheld in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already referred to the two ec directives <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord bonham-carter referred to them when he spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton considers it right for authorities to ask detailed questions of a contractor about the training he gives his workers <e> <s> one of his arguments is that an authority will not know if a contractor is competent if it cannot seek details about how his workers are trained <e> <s> we know full well that a contractors competence can be judged in various ways without the need for detailed questionnaires about any kind of training programme which happens to catch an authoritys fancy <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would allow unscrupulous authorities to discriminate against contractors on many grounds and unfortunately we know that a number of councils will go to any lengths to discover such loopholes in these provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for the moderate and reasoned way in which he introduced this amendment <e> <s> he was right to say that this issue was debated at length in commitee and my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was absolutely right to say that we divided on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i specifically answered that earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble viscount lord hanworth on finding yet another possible way of defining bodies which in his view should not be caught by the provisions of clause f <e> <s> that subsection as further defined in clause provides that authorities should not take account of a contractors membership or non-membership of an organisation when deciding whether to put him on an approved list or award him a contract <e> <s> in committee the noble lord lord dean moved an amendment which would have exempted bodies which were designed to promote a particular standard of expertise and that has again appeared on the marshalled list as the next amendment <e> <s> now we have this particular amendment which tries to exempt bodies whose primary purpose is the safety of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that the government are as concerned over standards as he is and i accept that a contractors membership of a reputable trade association is often used by authorities as an indication of certain professional standards or competence <e> <s> but as i said on the last amendment it is not the only method by which authorities should evaluate the merits of a company with which it is considering doing business <e> <s> it would indeed be foolish to use such membership as the sole yardstick against which to judge a contractors suitability for inclusion in an approved list or for the award of a contract <e> <s> far more relevant is the contractors previous work record and financial standing <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make one point from my own experience in regard to new companies doing work for local authorities <e> <s> when i set up my own business and took the first contract from a local authority i remember that the very questions that the noble lord has just mentioned were the type of questions that the local authority asked me <e> <s> i was able to convince the local authority that i could meet the high standards notwithstanding the fact that i had no track record at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are an attempt to extend the provisions of clause to all the public bodies listed in schedule <e> <s> however clause deals with the way in which the duty under section of the race relations act <e>", "<cs> my lords in recognising that the provisions of this bill should not prevent local authorities from carrying out their statutory duties under section of the race relations act we have had to consider how the provisions could be drafted in a way that does not permit abuse of that duty and does not place too excessive a burden on contractors <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments advanced in support of the amendments of the noble lord lord hayter have concentrated on just one of the factors identified in clause that is whether the material <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene at this stage solely to try and help the house <e> <s> there are a <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly as i understood the situation because the noble earl lord longford wished to take his amendment separately <e> <s> i gather that his amendments nos <e> <s> and are consequential on amendment no <e> <s> which he has just moved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson of brompton is of course right in saying that he may move any of his amendments singly or in a group <e> <s> i was only trying to be helpful <e> <s> indeed i took no part in the grouping that was going on while we were in discussion on the bill <e> <s> i know that those who were trying to put some order into this rather convoluted mass of amendments tried to contact the noble lord they sought him here they sought him there but they did not find him <e> <s> this was put forward in a spirit of co-operation <e> <s> of course the noble lord is right in what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two quick answers to the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee as to why i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> first we have just voted on the previous amendment which confined the ambit of the clause to schools and is very similar to what the noble lord wants <e> <s> secondly the amendment uses the word permit which as my noble friend lord campbell of alloway said is totally wrong as i explained in committee because of the education no <e> <s> act <e> <s> the permitting of teaching is a matter for the local authorities while teaching is with the headmaster the governors and the parents of the school <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall leave out that part <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i take the matter seriously <e> <s> that is why i have taken time to reply specifically to the noble lord <e> <s> i come back to what he said <e> <s> it was i confess a point raised by the noble lord lord gifford in committee that was largely responsible for the governments amendment which we shall shortly deal with <e> <s> however what the teacher does is now the responsibility of the head teacher and the governing body not the local authority <e> <s> what we are talking about in the bill is the attitude of the local authority <e> <s> i hope that covers the point <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house of course i understand that <e> <s> however as i said earlier the difficulty that we are facing on this clause is that so many amendments are inter-related that when i was trying to define the governments attitude to the words promoting homosexuality i had to touch upon the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can add much to what i previously said about these amendments when i spoke to the previous amendment <e> <s> i endeavoured to explain that we are concerned about all aspects of homosexuality and not just homosexual acts <e> <s> we wish to cover the sum of homosexuality homosexual relationships and sexual orientation in short every aspect of the way homosexuality manifests itself <e> <s> that is what the local authorities to which we take exception are trying to promote <e> <s> therefore we believe that the wording in the bill is appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can add very little except to say that the two aspects which the noble lord lord henderson wishes to put into the bill limit the ambit of the clause and will not catch a very great deal of the activity that the local authorities are promoting at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not reply to the noble lord on that point <e> <s> perhaps i may look into the matter and check before i give him a definite answer on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rea has made some persuasive arguments for deleting all the specific references in new subsection a and for retaining only the simple prohibition that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome that some of your lordships have been able to give to the governments amendments <e> <s> i am sorry that there is still some confusion in the minds of the noble lord lord mcintosh and the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> the government have listened carefully to all the debates during the committee stage and to representations made from outside the chamber <e> <s> i believe that we now have it right <e> <s> as regards paragraph b mentioned by the noble baroness we return to some of the detail which has already been discussed tonight and some of which will continue to be discussed for the rest of the evening <e> <s> i believe that the clause as now amended is a much better and more well understood piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has proposed a series of amendments <e> <s> i believe that he spoke also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i fear that i may have to stray on to the other amendments as i have done previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is entirely relevant that i should comment because this is a combination of words devised to cover a particular form of teaching <e> <s> one must look at this as a whole <e> <s> that is what i said at the beginning <e> <s> that is why i said i should have to look forward as i had to on a previous occasion <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord kilbracken was not satisfied with my reasons for rejecting his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i wonder whether like my noble friend how far we are likely to get by playing at semantics in this way <e> <s> it seems to me that adding the words the basis of if anything weakens the meaning of the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords pretended is part of a single phrase which i have already tried to justify to your lordships although obviously not very successfully <e> <s> i shall keep on trying because i am convinced that the clause as a whole is the right one <e> <s> i therefore do not think that i can add very much to my explanation of the phrase as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilbracken proposes the deletion of the word family from the phrase pretended family relationship in the proposed section a b of clause <e> <s> i attempted to explain in my comments on the previous amendments why the government support the retention of the phrase chosen by the sponsors of the bill as the best means of encapsulating the particular form of teaching that local authorities should not be promoting <e> <s> the phrase teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords there is quite a big distinction in this case because as i think the noble lord will be aware this was originally a private members bill in the name of the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> it was therefore he who promoted these particular words <e> <s> what the government have done is accept the wording <e> <s> the word family is an essential element of the phrase we are discussing <e> <s> we are not concerned with pretended relationships <e> <s> there is no doubt that two people of the same sex living as part of the same household have a relationship <e> <s> there is nothing pretended about it <e> <s> the word pretended in the phrase relates more to the concept that such a relationship is a conventional family relationship or the portrayal of it is as equally valid as the traditional family relationship <e> <s> without the word family the proposed section ab would lose an essential part of its meaning <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock has proposed this amendment to the wording of clause specifically to exclude from the prohibition anything done for the purpose of providing information advice and counselling in the interests of public health <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord a little comfort i can give him lots of comfort because the dhss has already been fully consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson of brompton says that he has been disappointed to hear many of my replies and it is my turn to be disappointed that he has chosen to reopen the discussion on this government amendment which was agreed at the committee stage <e> <s> however i am happy to explain once again the purpose of the subsection and to answer his queries <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord willis should be congratulated upon his assiduous attention to the debates on this part of the bill <e> <s> indeed he has set a fine example to other noble lords by sitting through all the speeches waiting for his turn <e> <s> i am grateful to him for having tabled the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he is right to say that this is an exciting project <e> <s> it will lead to the creation of the largest national nature reserve owned and managed by a voluntary body <e> <s> it will also help to secure the future of our only endemic bird species the scottish crossbill <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook in committee to consider further the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey to provide members of the public with direct access to the local ombudsman rather than having to refer complaints through a member of the authority concerned as at present <e>", "<cs> my lords we have brought the provisions in the bill forward in advance of our response to the widdicombe committees report as a whole because we see a clear and pressing need to do something in this area <e> <s> i would not claim that substantial breaches of the law by authorities are a widespread occurrence <e> <s> however our concerns stem from the increasing frequency with which a small minority of authorities are running up against the law in their attempts to evade and defy duties and controls that parliament has put in place <e> <s> our concerns also stem from the wholly unsatisfactory delays in resolving such cases and from the preference which i think many in your lordships house will share for prompt prevention rather than delayed retribution <e>", "<cs> my lords the widdicombe committee felt that powers for preemptive action should lie with the audit commission whereas the provisions of schedule place the powers with the auditor <e> <s> this accords with the views that the commission itself expressed in response to widdicombe and in its proposals for changes in audit legislation <e> <s> this weighed heavily in our consideration <e> <s> we also took account of the obvious practical difficulties in giving a power for swift action to a commission which normally meets once a month and whose eminent members are busy people with widespread interests who cannot always be contacted in haste <e> <s> we further recognised that the authority and standing which the commission as a body has established is due in no small part to the unity it has managed to preserve in taking some difficult decisions <e> <s> i believe it would put unreasonable strain on the commission and perhaps change its nature in an unproductive way if it was required to make decisions to take action against individual councils <e>", "<cs> my lords while the decision on when to use the new powers will be a matter solely for the auditors discretion auditors will be able to look to the commission for advice and guidance <e> <s> they will also be required to take account of any relevant advice which the commission may include in the code of audit practice <e> <s> i understand that it would be the intention of the commission to review the code to include such advice following royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand and sympathise with the intention behind amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i agree that these powers should be principally addressed to substantial breaches of the law <e> <s> it would not make good sense for the auditor to pursue trivial matters by way of a prohibition notice <e> <s> the use of the power will inevitably involve expenditure of the auditors time and costs in obtaining legal and other advice <e> <s> it would not be sensible to incur expenditure which is disproportionate to the unlawful expenditure or loss likely to be incurred <e> <s> the audit commission has made it known that it also shares this view as the noble lord lord mcintosh has just said to the house <e> <s> i am sure that the commissions guidance in the code will chart a sensible course and as i have said your lordships will have the opportunity of considering it <e> <s> i hope that that is of some comfort to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords where an order is revoked by the auditor or quashed on appeal one or more of the parties may claim to have suffered loss which could have been avoided if the auditor had not interfered <e> <s> given the great caution which auditors have shown over many years in the exercise of their existing powers there is every reason to believe that they will use these new powers with the utmost responsibility and that such cases are likely to be very exceptional <e> <s> however where they do arise schedule provides protection for the auditor against claims for damages provided he acted in good <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn for five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i first of all should like to welcome the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon to the

<s> clause of the bill bears witness to that <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> offers the prospect of private contractors being placed in an unequal position by the subsidised operations of local authorities <e> <s> i believe that this amendment is designed to create more jobs for local government empire builders rather than to improve competition which is the aim of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must say that was a little surprised and disappointed to see the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> this amendment was first tabled by the noble lord and the noble lord lord hayter at committee stage <e> <s> during the debate on amendment no <e> <s> za which was taken to a division the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey made it clear to the committee that he was also presenting the case for this and a number of other amendments <e> <s> he then gave full expression to his arguments for this amendment and i duly responded to the points he made <e>", "<cs> my lords with his customary clarity and concern for clarity the noble lord lord airedale has proposed this amendment to subsection of clause to spell out more fully the courts duty in any proceedings against a local <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist drawing to the attention of the house what appears to be a change of view among noble lords opposite regarding the significance of clause <e> <s> in commenting on it originally the noble lord lord dean of beswick seemed to doubt very much whether the potential abuse at which the clause is aimed actually existed <e> <s> he commented that there were shadows which have not really appeared <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the house can fairly congratulate itself on its thorough examination of a bill which though not particularly lengthy deals with a range of complex and contentious issues <e> <s> we have spent more than hours at committee stage and more than at report and very few stones have been left unturned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for asking a question which highlights what the government have been doing <e> <s> the commission of museums and galleries has set up a travelling exhibition unit <e> <s> as i am sure your lordships are aware the government indemnity scheme has allowed many more works of art to be loaned between museums and galleries without the need for commercial insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords it is still our intention to grant to the three english national galleries the enabling power to which the noble baroness has referred <e> <s> however i disagree with her that it would be a betrayal of gifts that were left to such galleries <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is on to a very important point about the danger of disposing of unfashionable works of art but i am sure that the whole house has confidence in the trustees to exercise the disposal power with care <e> <s> i am sure that the trustees will be very conscious about changing tastes and values <e> <s> it would be wrong to restrict this enabling power where there are perhaps duplicates that could be disposed of without detriment to the collection <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of galleries and museums already have this power which they exercise very judiciously <e> <s> all the government are seeking to do is to extend this enabling power to the three galleries i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords you can of course have duplicates being copies <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question is a little wide of the one on the order paper but i should be very surprised if one could find any museum that would not like more space <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give any undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a problem for the national galleries <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that at the national gallery itself per cent <e> <s> of the items are on display <e> <s> that can vary down to something like per cent <e> <s> in the national portrait gallery <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords comments but the question of a site is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to support the noble lord in that question <e> <s> that is exactly what the government want to do and that is why the initiatives have been taken by my right honourable friend in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that there is some reluctance but i hope that the government indemnity scheme will help in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords in my answer to my noble friends original question i outlined some of the initiatives which the government are taking to ensure that some works of art are released for viewing by the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer my noble friends question without some prior notice <e>", "<cs> my lords yes there has been substantial progress in that area <e> <s> more than projects involving million have been approved and many are for highway improvement and environmental work <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to tell my noble friend that today my right honourable friend the prime minister announced investment of some million in a spine road to open up the area further <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right <e> <s> he will know better than i do that after losing jobs in the four years prior to alone companies have been attracted to the area <e> <s> thus some jobs have been created <e> <s> a considerable amount of housing work has been undertaken for people living in the area <e> <s> i am pleased to tell the noble lord that today my right honourable friend the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the noble and learned lord which figures he has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a new udc <e> <s> i understand that some million has been provisionally allocated for it next year <e> <s> there are already signs that the private sector is becoming interested as a result of the governments pump priming <e>", "<cs> my lords more money is being afforded to the development corporations <e> <s> as the noble lord knows there will be a further million allocated next year for teesside <e> <s> indeed it is the concentration and how one spends the money that is important that is where it has been such a success <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord the answer that he requires <e> <s> the question relates to private investment in the inner-city areas <e> <s> however i shall of course look into the matter for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the necessary details to enable me to answer the noble baronesss last question <e> <s> perhaps i may write to her on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the new money to which my noble friend refers is money that has been committed by the government in their white paper <e> <s> that has been allocated and targeted to various areas details of which were announced this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords the udcs have helped considerably within in particular docklands where one quarter of those who purchased homes on udc sites were former local council tenants <e> <s> they have now become owner-occupiers which is a good thing <e> <s> one third of the purchasers of homes built on lddc sites were people from the docklands area <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the leader of the opposition knows interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we approved the nature conservancy councils offer of grant towards the purchase of abernethy forest by the rspb only <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the rspbs interpretation of vermin will be in accordance with the requirements of the wildlife and the countryside legislation <e> <s> but it will depend also on the area because the area is in two parts <e> <s> first there is the sssi and the national nature reserve where there will have to be control of red deer in order to allow natural regeneration of the forest <e> <s> on the open hill where the rspb will be the owner and therefore responsible for vermin i am sure that it will take account of the fact that it will be its responsibility as a good neighbour to keep down the foxes hooded crows etc <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be a management agreement for the sssi between the nature conservancy council and the rspb which will involve a certain number of forestry workers as the noble lord knows <e> <s> but the mere fact that the rspb has leased back the shooting rights on the open hill and quite rightly so will allow employment to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that there is a natural link between conservation and shooting <e> <s> indeed those who do shoot often prove to be the very best conservationists <e>", "<cs> my lords on the matter of the management of the national nature reserve which will be a matter between the nature conservancy council and the rspb we do have a bit more <e>", "<cs> no my lords i should not like to hazard a guess <e> <s> but we have asked the director general of the group to review the groups strategy <e> <s> we are considering with him the best way forward for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that none of us can be unaware of the litter problem <e> <s> had it not been for the community environment programme on which the tidy britain group is working the problem could be worse because some of the local authorities which have benefited have shown a reduction in litter of up to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord has accepted my offer to visit the flow country but i have already been to oxford circus and seen the situation for myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that that view is strongly held by many people including my noble friend <e> <s> however there are problems and practical difficulties such as the accounting procedure for fines collected the risk involved in the police or anyone else carrying substantial cash receipts and how to deal with offenders who do not have funds available for on-the-spot fines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i agree that the community environment programme and the education programme through which primary training kits and science kits have been provided for schools and education authorities are a good sign of the work of the tidy britian group <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i was satisfied with some of the results because of the reduction in litter experienced by local authorities <e> <s> had it not been for the action taken we should now be facing an increased litter problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend has said and i shall pass on his comments to british rail <e> <s> however i am sure that it will read with interest what has been said by noble lords in respect of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the maximum fine under the litter act is and there were prosecutions in <e> <s> it is the duty of us all not to drop litter and there should be no necessity for a fine although it exists <e>", "<cs> my lords there is still a misunderstanding about the role of richard branson and the uk group which was established to carry out a wide range of environmental improvement projects <e> <s> litter abatement is often an element of the project and where it is the tidy britain group as a participant in uk has taken the lead on the litter element <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will look forward to receiving the noble lords letter <e>", "<cs> my lords that suggestion has been made but difficulties arise in our law and primary legislation would be required <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not answer but i shall take the question away and look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but that only serves to prove that there is so much more that we as individuals can do about the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord diamond said this amendment seeks to impose a deadline of the end of the calendar year beyond which the powers to prepare for our proposals which clause confers upon the electricity supply industries would no longer be available <e> <s> i appreciate the spirit of the amendment which in effect is telling us as the noble lord put it to get on with the job quickly <e> <s> that is exactly what we want to do <e>", "<cs> we seek to bring in at the earliest opportunity the bills which will result from this one <e> <s> as the noble lord lord diamond will know from his experience i cannot predict whether or not it will be in the queens speech <e> <s> we hope it will be at an early stage but we believe that the bill as drafted gives the secretary of state the necessary flexibility <e> <s> however i assure the committee that it is something that we wish to get on with quickly <e>", "<cs> in view of what i said i do not believe it necessary that there should be a time-limit <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord williams of elvel and also the noble baroness lady nicol for the way in which they have put down these amendments at an early date <e> <s> some of his amendments are perhaps more relevant to future legislation and some strike at the very heart of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord said at second reading that he dislikes this bill <e> <s> these amendments are therefore not surprising <e> <s> this amendment itself strikes at a fundamental principle of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams of elvel said that it is not sophisticated <e> <s> if it is not sophisticated it is done with great charm and it is an absolutely deadly amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> of course one of the great strengths of the committee is to make legislation clear <e> <s> that is something i am keen to do with this piece of legislation which is now before us <e> <s> i will take away my noble friends comments and look at them between now and another stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams is being increasingly ingenious in trying to get me to make commitments and to give assurances to the committee <e> <s> what i said to my noble friend was that i would look at the point he was making in order to see whether it needs to be clarified <e> <s> if so i would then consider how best to do it <e> <s> in doing that i shall bear in mind what the noble lord says <e> <s> of course what i have said is without commitment <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the thinking that lies behind this amendment which the noble lord lord diamond has moved with his usual clarity <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by assuring the committee that the bill had its origin in our intention to privatise the water industry and the electricity supply industry and the need as we saw it to confer explicit powers on those industries to co-operate with us in developing our privatisation proposals <e> <s> that is the purpose of clause and its purpose will be fulfilled i have no doubt within the lifetime of this parliament <e> <s> once the industries become plcs there will no longer be and i quote relevant public utilities within the meaning of clause so these powers will have become redundant <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern of noble lords and the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> what the clause is designed to do is to permit my right honourable friend the secretary of state and the utility companies to start work in preparation for privatisation <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond knows full well that when those proposals have finally been prepared and submitted they will have to come before parliament <e> <s> again it is a point which i mentioned earlier that matters such as the exact form of the nra are for the main bill <e> <s> if we were to put a reference to privatisation or to the nra in the main body of the bill it would have to be precise in bringing forward what our proposals will do <e>", "<cs> that is how it will end up <e> <s> however until one can have the powers to start discussions formally with the authorities or with the electricity industry on what is going to happen it is a chicken and egg situation <e> <s> when we have presented our proposals and worked them up we can then present a bill to parliament <e> <s> at the moment we cannot do that <e> <s> it is a problem with the nra <e> <s> it is very much a chicken and egg situation <e> <s> if it were to be written onto the face of the bill we should have to be very precise about what was to be privatised and what was to be the nra <e> <s> we cannot do that because we do not have the proposals which this clause enables us to put forward <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that invervention <e> <s> the noble lord lord sefton of garston has hit the nail on the head <e> <s> it is in order to bring forward proposals but not all the proposals necessarily include privatisation <e> <s> this is for the restructuring of the two industries but until we get the powers to enable us formally to discuss that we cannot discuss the proposals with the electricity industry or the water industry <e> <s> that is what is delaying matters <e> <s> it is a chicken and egg situation <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the point of the main bill <e> <s> it will come before noble lords <e>", "<cs> that is one of the difficulties <e> <s> until we get the authority to make the proposals what we have suggested is that the national rivers authority should be set up <e> <s> but as the noble baroness knows there are two white papers on the electricity industry one by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for england and wales and the other by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> some of the thoughts in the white paper may be changed in view of comments but this clause and the bill are what enable us to take matters a stage further in order to bring the main bill before noble lords <e> <s> that will be the moment for the chamber to decide whether or not what the government propose as a result of the powers conferred in this bill is acceptable <e>", "<cs> i shall try once again to get the message through to the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> he would be the first to criticise the government and the water authorities if there were not a long-term prospectus for the privatisation <e> <s> he would be the first to get up and say this is absolutely wrong <e> <s> it goes against all the companies acts <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams of elvel would he very close on the noble lords heels to tell me that <e> <s> this clause enables us to fulfil those kinds of requirements <e>", "<cs> the noble lord <e> <s> lord williams of elvel in introducing the amendment mentioned that it was in his name and in that of his noble friend lady nicol <e> <s> we are sad that the noble baroness is not in her usual place <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to take our good wishes to his noble friend <e> <s> we look forward to seeing her back in her place fit and well again to participate in other debates <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord diamond that it is important for the government to know <e> <s> that is precisely why we seek the powers in the bill to enable us to know so that when we bring forward the main bill i return to that because that is when the proposals will be laid before parliament following the powers under this legislation we shall be able to bring before noble lords how the reconstruction is to take place and how the values will be arrived at <e> <s> however i accept that at vesting the physical separation of assets will be determined as the noble lord lord williams suggested <e>", "<cs> but that is a combination of valuations of different types <e> <s> as i have said to the noble lord how does one put a value for example on maintaining the environmental quality of rivers let alone a fair value <e> <s> he carefully listed all the points on which i agreed with him about buying and selling a company where the balance sheets and the profit and loss account are important <e> <s> the projected earnings are important too because they determine the final value <e> <s> but we are well aware of our duty to bring the right amount of value by means of money into the exchequer for the public benefit and for the country as a whole as we shall seek to do <e> <s> much of it cannot be done until we get the main bill <e>", "<cs> as i said the starting point for the accounting procedure will be that which already exists in the water authorities <e>", "<cs> on that precise point perhaps at report stage i shall be able to let the noble lord know or even before that time <e>", "<cs> this is very interesting but it brings me back to the comment i made that we are <e>", "<cs> in his amendment the noble lord lord diamond has challenged the use to which privatisation proceeds may be put by the exchequer <e> <s> i am surprised that he did so <e> <s> he will know far better than i that this matter is not within my departmental responsibility but that it is for my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will be the first to congratulate my right honourable friend on the use to which he has put the proceeds of privatisation for the benefit of this country <e> <s> as my noble friend lord renton has said the amendment includes a wide-ranging phrase which covers everything which is owned by the country <e> <s> it is for those reasons that the country is now so much more prosperous than it was nine years ago <e>", "<cs> i am staggered by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> he talked about the government not maintaining the public estate if i understood him correctly <e> <s> while at the home office i learnt with great dismay of the reductions in real terms that the labour government had made in spending on prisons and with delight how much that spending had increased in real terms under the conservative government <e>", "<cs> this is where we have a complete difference of opinion between the two sides of the committee <e> <s> we believe these industries will do better for the consumer in the private sector <e> <s> however how the proceeds of the disposal to the private sector are dealt with is rightly a matter for my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> this chamber is noted for the concern which it has always shown for the protection of the natural environment in this country and in particular for wildlife and other conservation <e> <s> those members of the committee who recall the passage of the wildlife and countryside bill in will recognise the truth of that point <e> <s> from what the noble lord lord diamond said it seemed that he had forgotten some of the powers that the government have under that act <e> <s> it is therefore with some reluctance that i cannot accept this amendment on behalf of the government <e> <s> as a minister for the environment i am very concerned about this area <e> <s> i fully recognise that the noble lord has the best of <e>", "<cs> there is a major difference between the water industry and the electricity industry <e> <s> i am one of many people in this committee who is keen to improve the environment <e> <s> on monday i go to brussels to discuss the large plants directive <e> <s> it is the emission from power stations that is of concern throughout the whole of europe <e> <s> i believe that the water industry is very different <e> <s> the reason why we have set up the nra is because not only is the water used by consumers extracted from rivers or reservoirs but the water is then put back into the rivers or the sea <e> <s> that is very different from the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> i support the proposals that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has put forward and the commitment that is in the white paper <e> <s> those will be to the benefit of the environment <e>", "<cs> the literal implication of this amendment as a result of where it would be placed in clause would be to limit the granting of the express powers under clause to the electricity council to circumstances in which a transfer from an electricity board in england and wales took full account of the long-term interests of british coal <e> <s> it is clear however that in moving his amendment the noble lord lord ezra was in fact seeking to give it a somewhat broader application <e> <s> i believe that it would be quite wrong to restrict the express powers given to the electricity supply industry under clause by requiring a proposal for transfer of property or functions to take full account of the long-term interests of the british coal industry <e>", "<cs> detailed figures can be provided <e> <s> unfortunately i have to say to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon that i cannot produce them just at the moment <e> <s> however i shall be glad to do so at the earliest opportunity <e> <s> i emphasise again to the committee that these matters are perhaps more appropriate for discussion in another context <e> <s> as i said earlier it will be for british coal to compete in its markets and secure its own future <e>", "<cs> i recognise that this amendment would make the bill in some respects more flexible but i do not believe that such flexibility is acceptable in the present case <e>", "<cs> i am saddened that the noble lord lord williams of elvel is not clear <e> <s> i hope to clarify things for him and to reduce his problems by a third by saying that there are two proposals and not three <e> <s> the proposals which i mentioned and enlarged upon i have described as the basic proposals <e> <s> those are the basic framework on which we would take forward and hope in due course to bring forward legislation <e> <s> then there are the related proposals on which further comment is still to be made <e> <s> much of that will arise as a result of passing this legislation <e> <s> a lot of discussion is then triggered <e> <s> i hope that that clarifies the point for the noble lords lord diamond and lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> there will be proposals for the restructuring of the industry <e> <s> but there are indeed additional proposals which we will need to put forward to the authorities and to the supply industry <e> <s> it is those proposals as i understand it that they will obviously be allowed to comment on <e>", "<cs> i understand that they do <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble lord lord ezra is absolutely right <e> <s> that is why there is no need for the clarificatory amendment of the noble lord lord williams in which he wants to insert the words of the secretary of state <e> <s> clause b makes it quite clear that related proposals are indeed proposals made by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> subsection of clause deals with the concept of a related proposal which first appears in subsection b <e> <s> paragraphs a b and c of subsection set out examples of a range of matters which it will fall to the relevant public utilities to deal with in the preparations that they will need to make as a consequence of our proposals for the restructuring and privatisation of their industries <e> <s> an obvious example is the matter of future arrangements for the utilities employees which need to be addressed now and on a continuing basis and not left until the utilities have been replaced by the successor bodies which we propose <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall also speak to both these amendments <e> <s> i can understand the temptation to attempt to improve the drafting of this provision by using the familiar concept of assets and liabilities instead of the existing wording <e> <s> however we do not regard the amendment as an improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> those will be the related proposals which we discussed earlier <e> <s> the principle is quite clear all the items that form the property and rights of the existing water authorities must be transferred either to successor companies or to the nra <e> <s> the exact split will be much clearer when we come to the main bill because that could change as it goes through this chamber <e>", "<cs> the timescale on which we are working is that when this bill has received royal <e>", "<cs> i fully accept the underlying purpose of this amendment which seeks to ensure that all the powers and duties of the utilities which it is proposed to transfer to the successor corporate bodies are included in subsection b as related proposals <e>", "<cs> there is a technical justification for the existing drafting of paragraph b <e> <s> the main legislation will provide that certain of these existing functions will be transferred to the successor bodies by way of amendment <e> <s> that legislation will also re-enact certain functional legislation such as the water supply duties <e> <s> in such cases the technical effect will be not that these functions are transferred but that upon re-enactment they are conferred upon the successor bodies <e> <s> the amendment would restrict the ability of the water authorities to act in relation to the functions which are to receive this legislative treatment <e> <s> we have catered for the situation in the broad scope of the amendment in order to cover all the responsibilities duties and functions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for further clarification of his point <e> <s> there is the technical point and there is also the point that he covered <e> <s> i would not say that it was so much the transfer of the water authorities to the plcs <e> <s> perhaps i may give an example of possibly adding further functions to the nra <e> <s> we may very well want to strengthen the role of the nra by adding other duties which do not exist at the moment under the water authoritys responsibilities <e> <s> that is an added reason for this provision <e>", "<cs> it is an extremely important point on which to be absolutely clear <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord williams of elvel was trying to tie me down too much <e> <s> the wording makes provision to enable us to add other activities <e> <s> it might well be that when we get into further detail on the proposals when we receive evidence from the water authorities or there is an amendment in your lordships committee as regards certain aspects of the duties and functions of the plc or the nra nothing additional is needed <e> <s> however it may be that something is needed <e> <s> this provision allows us to add that something if the event occurs <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does withdraw the amendment the clarification is at pm on the th march <e>", "<cs> as the notes on clauses which have been made available to the committee explain paragraph c lists a number of matters arising out of our proposals for these important industries which the industries will need to act on if their restructuring and transition into the private sector is to be carried out in an expeditious and effective way <e>", "<cs> this bill will clear the way for the public utility to take the necessary action to take forward our proposal <e> <s> it is quite right that having received the proposal from the secretary of state the public utility should take the necessary action to make the transfer as smooth and as expeditious as possible <e> <s> that is why the water and electricity supply industries will need to act on all the matters listed in paragraphs a b and c of subsection <e> <s> to strike out any of those paragraphs would create a great deal of uncertainty and so hamper those preparations <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords question <e> <s> i had hoped that i had answered him specifically <e> <s> however i fear that he was not satisfied and i shall try again <e> <s> if costs are incurred in preparing for full flotation ultimately they will fall on the government <e> <s> if significant they will be reflected in the flotation proceeds <e>", "<cs> the costs will be borne by the water authorities and the electricity supply industry <e> <s> that has happened in all previous privatisations <e> <s> we do not believe in looking at it in the negative way <e> <s> i believe that it will be a success <e>", "<cs> i realise that that is the point the noble lord is trying to make <e> <s> i think i have answered the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> i answered that question when i said that it was the responsibility of the utility <e> <s> in the example that the noble lord gave it might well be that some costs will be the responsibility of the underwriter <e>", "<cs> in responding to the amendment i think it might be helpful if i were to explain a little about the corporate structure which we expect to be adopted by the water service plcs which will take over the utility business of the water authorities <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the bill is drawn specifically to enable the structure that we propose the holding company and core subsidiary which i just mentioned to the committee <e> <s> if the noble lords amendment is accepted it would mean that water authorities could act in the interests of the core subsidiary of the plc but not the holding company itself <e> <s> that is where there seems to be a difference of opinion between myself and the noble lord <e> <s> therefore if that is the case since it is the holding company that is to be floated the amendment would surely hamper the process of flotation <e>", "<cs> the purpose of subsection of this clause is not relevant to protecting the interests of consumers <e> <s> it makes it clear that where new powers are conferred by clause on the water authorities and the electricity supply industry those powers extend not merely to protecting or promoting the interests of themselves as water authorities but also to parts of the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> i have to say to the committee that i found this amendment somewhat confusing <e> <s> it bears on clause which gives powers to the water and electricity supply industries and yet one of its effects would be to state that these industries may advertise to inform the public of the charging and metering provisions of the bill which are concerned with the water industry only <e>", "<cs> i regret to have to say to the committee that there is not much that i can add to what i said when responding earlier to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would be wrong for me to repeat what i said then <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and is to provide that related proposals by the secretary of state shall include proposals by the minister of agriculture <e> <s> the committee will know that in england ministerial responsibility for the water authorities is shared between the secretary of state for the environment and the minister of agriculture <e> <s> the division of responsibilities is set out in section of the water act under which water authorities were set up <e> <s> responsibility for land drainage and fisheries functions rests with the minister of agriculture <e> <s> responsibility for the other functions rests with the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal with amendment no <e> <s> first <e> <s> as i understand it the purpose of the amendment is to cover the situation where a person quitting a metered property fails to give the undertaker the necessary two working days notice then sadly passes away before his liability for future charges under clause b is determined <e> <s> the committee will be aware that it is a general legal principle that liability

dependants there are precedents in the legislation of the other utilities most recently the gas act which did not make a special case of the kind envisaged by this amendment <e> <s> in any event as i shall explain later the potential liability of the deceaseds estate is not open-ended but limited in the way set out in clause b of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to check on that but presumably the same as now <e>", "<cs> i understand that if an occupier is away and somebody occupies his premises with or without permission the occupier can be charged for any electricity water and gas that may be used by whoever has occupied the premises <e> <s> it is the occupiers responsibility <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that the noble lord is opening out a huge new argument that goes much wider than the scope of the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the legal knowledge that my friend has on these matters i think that it would be right to reflect on what he has said when i read it in the <e>", "<cs> as the bill is presently drafted under clause my right honourable friend the secretary of state is required when considering a proposed metering trial scheme for approval or any conditions he

provided for in connection with the scheme <e> <s> these matters include in clause a the methods and principles on which charges will be calculated and imposed <e> <s> taken together these provisions will enable the secretary of state to consider the structure of charges to be used in the trials and the implications including financial ones for the customers taking part <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for his support <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first deal with the point raised by the noble baroness lady seear which was answered for me by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> the industry is considering a code of practice for high bills due to leaks that would enable bills to be reassessed according to normal usage <e> <s> that may be some comfort to the noble baroness <e> <s> however i am sure that she would join me in saying that that must not undermine the customers responsibility to maintain the pipes in good working order <e>", "<cs> when i receive the proposal of my noble friend i shall look at a consequential amendment to the title <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulties that disabled people face raise strong passions in this house and rightly so <e> <s> there should not be any noble lord who does not want to see them given every opportunity to live useful productive lives playing a full part in society <e> <s> the noble lord lord basnett has made a very effective speech appealing once more to our emotions but we must not let those emotions lead us to accept any legislative change simply because its proponents claim that it will benefit disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the right way forward as i have tried to explain is the work that my right honourable friend is doing on this issue <e> <s> this is where i differ from the noble lord lord basnett <e> <s> his sincere belief that all the amendment does is enable local authorities to draw the code to the attention of contractors and point them in the direction of the relevant agencies if necessary becomes a false dawn for the disabled <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can tell the house that the tuc was sent a bill yesterday for <e>", "<cs> my lords the litter that my right honourable friend picked up yesterday had already been put down by members of the public <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house would condemn that <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a days collection from the park itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that the closing date for bids for county hall was th april <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend considers the doe to be the worst building in the world <e> <s> it was commended by the royal fine art commission when it was being built <e> <s> as to the future use of county hall i think that it would be wrong for me to speculate <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed and i congratulate my noble friend on his new role <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh obviously has seen the judgment <e>

my lords the future of county hall is a matter for the london residuary body which has invited offers for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think refuted it <e> <s> my noble friend said that it was the worst <e>", "<cs> my lords not all of county hall is listed <e> <s> the riverside block is listed grade <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to the court to send the judgment and up to the post to deliver it

not been made by the time the report appeared <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble and learned friend is right <e>", "<cs> my lords the listing criterion is architectural or historic interest <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state is ultimately responsible for listing <e> <s> i believe that the doe

mcintosh that as far as i can elucidate in the short time that is available to me he has no need to be embarrassed <e> <s> as we consider these regulations over the next couple of years or so perhaps

that i shall come to in a minute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking entirely within the context of the debate which the noble lord lord dean of beswick so ably introduced <e> <s> i was talking about complete asset registers and giving an example of what happened when there was not one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also talking about local authorities <e> <s> i am giving an example of what happened

the bill without the amendment suggested by my noble friend there would be a gap when our proposals could not be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come back later to the point that my noble friend has just made as i had intended to deal with it in due course <e> <s> however as i was saying my noble friend lord renton kindly offered to help by suggesting an addition to the wording of the amendment after the words national rivers authority of such words as or other body corporate <e> <s> i acknowledge the assistance that that would give me with regard to my concern for flexibility but i believe that it defeats part of my noble friends intention to help the higher judiciary as he terms them and does not remove the difficulty of identifying what the duties of the corporate body will be and what functions it will undertake <e> <s> those questions will be fully and precisely dealt with in the main legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess to the house that i fear i was a little over-hasty at an earlier stage <e> <s> if your lordships would look at col of th march you will see that i commended the opposition for the early time at which they had put down their amendments <e> <s> alas that has not been continued at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the spirit behind this amendment which in seeking to define more closely what are the proposals in clause provides that they should be proposals made by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the intention behind amendments nos <e> <s> and on the marshalled list is to secure some greater certainty about what are the proposals in relation to which clause of the bill confers powers upon the water and electricity industries and in particular to ensure that those proposals must be contained in a published document or documents made available to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment requires the transfer of the property and functions of a utility to have regard to accepted accounting procedure <e> <s> at committee stage on th march i said that the starting point for the accounting procedure for any transfer would be that already existing in the water authorities <e> <s> as the noble lord lord williams of elvel then suggested that is historic cost accounting with an addition of current cost accounting <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has just said we debated a similar amendment at committee stage when the noble lord lord williams of elvel sought to give the water authorities and the electricity supply industry powers to seek modification of our proposals for privatisation and restructuring <e> <s> the house will recall the distinctions that i drew then between the two kinds of proposals on clause <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for realising the strength of the governments argument <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh could not have put his amendments down much later <e> <s> however i am grateful to him for the thought of the help that that might have given even greater help than receiving them late last night <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows we were deep in discussion on local government yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained during the committee stage of this bill in normal conditions modern water meters are reliable and accurate <e> <s> when they fail it is usually because the piston inside the meter is jammed with particles of matter <e> <s> this causes the register to stop moving but allows water to pass though a reduced flow <e>

obviously a very important issue which we intend to develop further in the context of the main water privatisation bill <e> <s> at present by virtue of section a of the water act there are formal arrangements for the representation of consumers interests <e> <s> each regional water authoritys consumer consultative committee provides a forum in which customers representatives discuss with the appropriate authority its policies and actions and their effects on consumers <e> <s> for example i understand that all of those water undertakers who have expressed a willingness to carry out a metering trial have already discussed the issue with the relevant consumer consultative committee <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can use this appropriate moment quickly to review the provisions of the bill and the reception that they have had in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state is considering what action to take <e>", "<cs> my lords we always keep the split in how the money will be spent under review <e> <s> we are always seeking ways to target the money efficiently <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend the prime minister

rural development commission <e> <s> the staff and activities of cosira have been transferred to the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be pleased to know that the new simpler city grant for the private sector will build on the success of the urban development grant and the urban regeneration grant programme <e> <s> so far million of public funds has been allocated attracting million in investment from the private sector <e> <s> that has provided some jobs and almost homes and has reclaimed acres of derelict land <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is delighted to hear that good news <e> <s> as my noble friend is aware we believe that the urban development corporations have a large part to play in revitalising parts of the country <e> <s> that is why we have increased their number and now propose to do so further <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that in the booklet <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no direct evidence but it is something that concierges could do <e> <s> however it is up to the landlord to enforce the rules <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the purpose of the estate action unit in the department <e> <s> it will help local authorities to counter the problems mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if illegal activities have been taking place it is up to the local council or the landlord together with the police to take the necessary action <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood the question of the noble lord lord mellish it was not that he was criticising high rise blocks of flats <e> <s> he was criticising the lack of management and that is where a concierge would have helped <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill is about accountability of local councils <e> <s> its central objective is the enhancement of accountability of councils to their electors <e> <s> this is not a new objective <e> <s> the search for greater accountability and effective local democratic control started in the s under the previous government and has continued throughout the s under this one <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is under a misapprehension that litter and uk are identical <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will be aware that although the tidy britain group is part of uk there is a special initiative on litter which

good work throughout the country <e> <s> i shall look into his second point <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord on that <e> <s> he will be pleased to know that my departments grant to uk

the leader of the opposition that it started in wales in november <e> <s> in scotland it was launched in april and as i have said we hope to launch it in northern ireland shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have to hand the figure for wales but i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that some shares have been bought at the market price which is higher than it was some months ago <e> <s> however i disagree with my noble friends comments as regard whether the dividend control the present statutory control over statutory water companies is the right method <e> <s> we believe that to be an outdated and inflexible method of forming a modern company <e> <s> we consider that the profit motive is the most effective means of providing a permanent incentive to greater efficiency <e> <s> however in the legislation that we intend to bring before parliament that must be coupled with a strong system to ensure the consumers interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the statutory water company is already private <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> the water industry is highly regulated and it will continue to be so for the purpose outlined by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord mowbray said the selling of water in bottles can be extremely profitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that this matter is of concern to a number of your lordships as well as to others outside this house <e> <s> i look forward to debating the matter fully when the main legislation comes before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble earl and the house that our standards are not the slackest in europe <e> <s> we take great care and it is up to the waste disposal authority to ensure that the standards are maintained and implemented in accordance with the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition is right

allegations that imported waste is going straight to landfill without being treated and if any of your lordships bring such allegations to my attention that is something i shall look into <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the length of this answer <e> <s> the latest estimate of english local authorities capital receipts from sale of dwellings is billion in per cent <e> <s> of this and per cent <e> <s> of unused receipts from earlier years can be spent on capital expenditure including building new rented dwellings <e> <s> in addition per cent <e> <s> of most other capital receipts from the latest year and earlier years together with borrowing and any revenue financing can also be used to finance capital expenditure <e> <s> in local authorities are forecast to be able to spend billion of housing receipts from this and earlier years compared to the billion they are forecast to generate this year <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer under the present system the local authorities will benefit rather than using the method which the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i am sure that the house is aware from earlier answers that it is central to our economic strategy that total spending by local authorities like other kinds of public spending should be kept within planned levels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for mentioning the renovation of houses because that is equally as important as the building of new ones <e> <s> as i said in my earlier answer there is very little difference between what local authorities could spend this year from the money they generated in comparison with the existing system <e> <s> in fact they are rather better off <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> however the noble lord will be pleased to know that we have provided additional resources totalling million for specific allocations for homelessness over the past six months <e>", "<cs> my lords some of the receipts can be spent by the local authorities in the same year on other matters <e> <s> however as time progresses local authorities can spend per cent <e> <s> of the balance which they have not yet spent from previous years <e>", "<cs> my lord it is for that among other reasons that of the moneys we have made available in the special allocation for homelessness out of the million that we announced in december million will be specifically for london <e> <s> i do not have a figure for the additional million which was announced on th march but i shall let the right reverend prelate know as soon as a decision is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord understands that local authority expenditure is taken into account in public expenditure overall <e> <s> therefore there is a need to exercise the restraints presently in existence <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is not the case <e> <s> the noble lords reasoning can be faulted <e> <s> he has also ignored the fact that there is renovation as well as new building <e>",

am not able to give the noble lord the breakdown between common and facing bricks imported <e> <s> however we are watching the situation otherwise i would not have been able to give him the figures

<e>", "<cs> my lords there are some instances of deregistration occurring throughout the country <e> <s> each case is of course looked at on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right to infer from this question that planning permission will be required and of course that matter must go for decision to the local authority concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already consulted very widely as the leader of the opposition will know <e> <s> that consultation resulted from the common land forum report which was published by the countryside commission in september <e> <s> however

<s> the countryside commission is taking a special interest in this matter at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this debate has centred on fairness and on the ability to pay <e> <s> after a long and comprehensive debate it would be wrong for me to make a long speech for members of the committee will want to reach a conclusion to the matter <e> <s> first let me turn briefly to the amendment of my noble friend lord chelwood <e> <s> he asks the government to think again but i have to say that we have considered with the utmost care all the alternatives to the discredited rating system and believe our solution to be the best and fairest <e> <s> my noble friend has doubts but clearly cannot think of an alternative which he could justify otherwise he would surely have brought it before the committee <e> <s> he did just that when he argued and voted against the government on the rates bill and the local government bill <e> <s> i know my noble friend would not have shrunk from his duty today if he could propose a better system than that in the bill <e>", "<cs> although i too must congratulate the noble lord lord mulley on coming forward with an alternative to the community charge i must confess to the committee that i was rather surprised by his amendments which seek to introduce a system of domestic rates based on capital values <e> <s> i am surprised because i thought until just now that he was introducing the policy of the labour party <e>", "<cs> that is exactly why i phrased my words until just now because it is clear that the noble lord lord mcintosh disowned the policy of the noble lord lord mulley <e> <s> after the general election despite having disowned capital values

member for birmingham sparkbrook the deputy leader of the opposition announced his partys support for this dual approach <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state immediately wrote to him pointing to the vacuity of his proposals and asking for further details so that we could produce exemplifications showing how such a system would affect bills for local services <e> <s> that letter was sent on th april <e> <s> as of today i regret to say that we have received no reply <e> <s> can i ask the noble lord lord mcintosh when we can expect a reply <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that clarification that the hard work done by my department to help the honourable gentleman the deputy leader of the opposition will not receive a reply <e>", "<cs> i beg to differ <e> <s> having been a surveyor and having implemented the revaluation of i can assure the noble baroness that despite the revaluation people paid more entirely because of it <e> <s> if she casts her mind to scotland where there was a revaluation two years ago she will find exactly the same thing happened <e> <s> in theory the noble baroness is right in practice it does not work out like that <e>", "<cs> we had a long and interesting debate on the amendment moved by my noble friend lord chelwood and we have now to some extent gone over the same ground in talking about a local income tax <e> <s> i think that before i deal with the very many fundamental objections to a local income tax i should first deal with one or two misconceptions about the particular version of a local income tax advocated by the sld party the party of the noble lord lord ross of newport <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the clarification which the noble lord lord mcintosh has been able to give in relation to the word estimated <e> <s> i am not certain that everyone would agree with his interpretation because there is another interpretation <e> <s> in order to comply with what the amendment proposes the report would have to be compiled by finding out the size of the bills paid by every adult in the country in and each subsequent year <e> <s> even to provide an estimate one would have to obtain those figures <e> <s> as even the noble lord realised that would be massively bureaucratic and also a more than somewhat intrusive task <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hayter for raising this important matter <e> <s> i have listened with great care as indeed i did earlier this evening when we had an extensive debate on the position of hostels for the homeless and hostels run by charities and other voluntary organisations <e> <s> my noble friend lord glenarthur agreed to take the matter away and to reconsider the governments position <e> <s> your lordships will recognise that the position of people who sleep rough is very closely linked as the noble lord lord dean of beswick has just intimated to the question of people who live in hostels and night shelters <e> <s> we are really dealing with two sides of the same coin <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> these amendments would exempt full-time students from the personal community charge <e> <s> there are however in our view no good reasons why students should not be subject to the community charge in the same way as all other adults <e> <s> like other adults they make use of local services and vote in local elections <e> <s> the accountability arguments are therefore just as strong for students as for anyone else <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the added contributions that have been made <e> <s> i would say to the noble earl lord russell that of course i recall that student life is always hard <e> <s> i am sure it is no different today to what it was in my day and indeed in the noble earls day <e> <s> i would however repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> the review which my honourable friend has carried out shows that over per cent <e> <s> of students are already contributing towards rates with an average contribution of around a year which is considerably more than the average of per cent <e> <s> of the community charge <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour put her finger on it when she said that the report must include all items of student expenditure and the extent to which the system already makes provision for them <e> <s> i confirm that the report will do just that <e> <s> as it considers rates it will doubtless also consider the effect of the community charge <e>", "<cs> i am indeed acquainted with it but it seems to have slipped my mind at present <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to alter the special residence rules for students which are contained in clause <e> <s> instead of being registered at their term-time address it would allow full-time students to choose whether they should be registered at their home address or at their term-time address <e>", "<cs> no because the student will be using the facilities provided by the local authority when he is in term and when he is at home <e> <s> likewise some of us alas have to find somewhere to perch in london at night and we use the facilities in london as one does if one is lucky enough to live in the country <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord morton of shuna will use the facilities provided by the local authority in scotland <e> <s> we do not believe that it alters the accountability <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for raising the matter <e> <s> it takes my noble friend lord glenarthur and me back to our former ministry and the work that we did there <e> <s> as the noble lord said there was considerable debate on this matter during the consideration of the bill in another place <e> <s> in view of that we agreed to consider in consultation throughout the government the possibility of extending the exemption to cover those held on remand <e>", "<cs> yes it will <e>", "<cs> this has been a most useful debate and i am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for initiating it and to noble lords who have taken part in it <e> <s> i should like to differ from the noble lord and divide my answer into two parts <e> <s> i shall deal first with the position of the severely mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge raises an important point <e>

believe that there are two main difficulties <e> <s> the main consideration must be that of the patient <e> <s> there is regrettably still a stigma attached to mental handicap <e> <s> many of those suffering from a degenerative disease may not consider themselves as having reached the stage where they should be classified as severely mentally handicapped <e> <s> they may not want to incur the stigma that is attached to that and many of them will have periods of remission when such a classification would be inappropriate <e> <s> but classification is what will have to happen <e> <s> the bill specifies that a doctor has to certify someone as severely mentally handicapped if that person is to be exempt <e>", "<cs> as i understand it is one <e> <s> however i will look at the point which my noble friend has raised <e>", "<cs> the noble countess raises an important point that i should like to look at <e> <s> it seems to confirm what i was saying earlier about degenerative diseases and how it would be more difficult for even a qualified doctor to assess at what point a person moves into severe mental handicap <e> <s> but perhaps i may look at that point which the noble countess has raised <e>", "<cs> my noble kinswoman does not surprise me <e> <s> the system of community charge reduction provided for in this bill will in fact direct help particularly towards the elderly and disabled people since they benefit from special premiums in addition to their personal allowances <e> <s> in addition to the per cent <e> <s> maximum reduction income support will contain an amount reflecting the average per cent <e> <s> minimum contribution which everyone will have to make to the community charge <e> <s> whether this amount is sufficient to cover the actual per cent <e> <s> contribution is in the hands of local authorities <e> <s> people in low-spending authorities will be better off while those in areas with high spending authorities will be a little worse off <e> <s> local authority spending decisions will make them directly accountable to all charge payers and i do not believe it is right to exclude elderly and disabled people from this process of accountability <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for mishearing what he said <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs gave the committee a graphic account of the work of residential voluntary workers <e> <s> as so often direct personal experience of a situation enhances our debate <e> <s> indeed it has enhanced our debate as many noble lords have had experience with these workers in various fields <e>", "<cs> i certainly would hope that they would take the opportunity to vote if an election occurred during the period that they were there <e>", "<cs> it is because they are to be encouraged that i referred specifically to some of the points that members of the committee made about the fact that it would be harder to recruit volunteers <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why i wish to consider this amendment again <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> he tells us that charities could have been exempted from rates at the moment <e> <s> they have a per cent <e> <s> rebate from central government and there can be a discretionary rebate from local government <e> <s> of course that will be transferred to the community charge <e>", "<cs> without notice i cannot give the noble countess either the maximum or the minimum but if there is an average there will be some who lose but there will be others who end up with cash in their pockets <e>", "<cs> i thought it was right as i have done before to the committee to spell out what i thought the arguments were <e> <s> i have heard exactly what the committee has said <e> <s> that is what i should like to consider <e> <s> but i thought it would be wrong not to spell out the situation as i had seen it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the opportunity to explain a little further the amendment which has been the subject of much discussion <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate reminded the committee the discussions were with the churchs main committee which not only represents the christian and jewish religions but also buddhist organisations <e>", "<cs> i am interested in what the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said and it is a point at which i should like to look <e> <s> we believed that we had covered the situation as did the churchs main committee <e> <s> however the noble lord has cast doubts <e> <s> i cast doubts on one of his definitions yesterday and i believe he realised that there was another way to look at it <e> <s> perhaps he would allow me to look again at this point <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is ingenious <e> <s> that is certainly not what is intended <e> <s> indeed i shall make sure that that intention is not fulfilled <e> <s> i say to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that the reason we have sub-paragraph is this <e> <s> it is to prevent a situation where for a period in his life someone may have worked and received a pension before entering a proper and relevant religious community and then being told that because he had worked and received a pension he was liable to the community charge even though he had taken the vow of poverty and said that he would not receive his pension or would pass it on to the religious organisation <e>", "<cs> having dealt a little with charities while i was at the home office i know full well the difficulties that that would entail <e> <s> that is a subject which is being looked at in the reports on charities which have been recently undertaken <e> <s> far be it for me today to interfere with that good work <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has seized on what he believes is an anomaly in the bill which is that a few relatively well-off people who are being cared for in nursing homes and similar institutions will nevertheless not be subject to the personal community charge <e> <s> i must say that i was a little surprised by what some noble lords have said because i must remind the committee that it was not originally the governments plan to exempt those who are being cared for in nursing homes <e> <s> all would have had to pay the personal community charge <e> <s> that was the position when the abolition of domestic rates etc <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness i did indeed mean to reply to her <e> <s> however i cannot answer her in detail on this occasion because i should like to study the point carefully <e> <s> however as i understand the position it would depend on where the sole main residence of the person was <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble baroness on the matter <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way on the matter <e> <s> however in view of the valid point that he made about accountability i wonder whether he would like to return to the position that we were in when we introduced the scottish bill to this place <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all members of the committee appreciate the good work that is being done by those who work in nursing homes and residential care homes particularly perhaps live-in staff who may need to be on call even during their off-duty hours <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord rochdale gave us a stirring example of such people just now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for clarifying that matter <e> <s> i think that i understand his point a little more clearly now <e> <s> but again i would say that in our view that would be the wrong way of looking at the matter because we believe that as the basis of this charge is a personal community charge to the person the income of that person will be taken into account and if it is below a certain level the rebate will be applicable to him or her <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble baronesses have said about womens refuges <e> <s> let me say straightaway that the government share their concern about domestic violence and applaud the good work done by womens refuges <e>", "<cs> on that last point the noble baroness lady lockwood is absolutely right <e> <s> that is what i said <e> <s> her sole or main place of residence is not determined because she may very well go back to her husband and the home which was her main or sole place of residence <e> <s> if she moves or is rehoused by the local authority she will have a new sole or main place of residence <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness and i are on absolutely the same rails until we come to the unfortunate situation in which the woman goes into the refuge <e> <s> she does not have to change her main place of residence from her home to the refuge and back either to her home or elsewhere <e> <s> the main or sole place of residence will remain that place where she was until she decides to change it <e> <s> notwithstanding that she will still be liable to a personal community charge and the assistance that she will be given will come through the rebate system <e>", "<cs> if when she has read the <e>", "<cs> i have already made the point several times both at second reading and during this committee stage that we believe that a great deal of this bill is about restoring accountability <e> <s> exempting income support recipients from the community charge would we believe severely reduce the extent to which that aim can be achieved <e> <s> each year every adult with very few exceptions should receive a community charge bill setting out how much the local authority spends compared with its assessed need to spend and how that will affect the amount that people in that area will have to pay <e> <s> as a result those who receive a bill will be better able to judge the performance of the authorities in whose area they live <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> the noble earl has made it perfectly clear that he disagrees with the proposals in the bill and the accountability in which we believe <e> <s> i cannot remember whether the noble earl was here for the discussion last night on his partys proposal for a local income tax <e> <s> that is not a very accountable tax and would be a great deal more costly to administer and a great deal more costly for most people to pay <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill knows the tailoring of the community charge and the rebate is linked to the social security legislation which i believe sets out the position quite clearly <e>", "<cs> the amendments proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh are concerned with the implications for civil liberties and the data protection of the community charge registration process as are the amendments to be moved by the noble lords lord meston and lord bonham-carter <e> <s> as with the noble lord lord mcintosh there is no doubt that my arguments will span over those amendments as well <e> <s> that is inevitable but it is the agreed grouping <e> <s> i assure the committee that the government take these concerns very seriously <e> <s> it is evidence of this concern that my honourable friend the minister for local government has met the data protection registrar and has agreed to co-operate with him in drawing up a data protection code of practice for local authorities community charges registration officers <e> <s> nevertheless the amendments in this group are not acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> when i drafted what i planned to say to the noble lord i looked at the word misconceived <e> <s> i believe that i was right to use that word because i honestly believe that some of what we have heard from the noble lord confirms my belief that he has a misconceived opinion of our proposals in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jay has raised an important point and it is one on which i believe the noble lord lord mcintosh and i differ <e> <s> we believe it is right that these matters can and should be dealt with by regulations rather than on the face of the bill <e> <s> i believe that was a point raised by the noble lord lord meston <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord is almost right <e> <s> the names and addresses might well be relevant to the registration officer <e> <s> however he is not concerned about why they are there <e>", "<cs> i believe it would be very difficult for the registrar to have greater access than the inland revenue <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that it would have legal status under the bill because that is what sets it up <e>", "<cs> indeed it is a serious question <e> <s> it jogs my memory and i believe that my <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can clarify that point for the committee and may i say how nice it is to be debating again with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> those items which we consider to be off limits will be under regulations that is under paragraph d of schedule <e> <s> the guidance will be as a result of the discussions that my honourable friend the minister for local government is having with the data protection registrar <e> <s> the important point which i believe satisfies the worries of the noble lord lord mishcon and the point about which we have been talking throughout our discussions is that that which is off limits will be under regulations in the bill <e>", "<cs> i thought i had clarified that point just now with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the guidance to which i referred following discussions between my honourable friend the minister for local government and the data protection registrar will not have the same legal effect as the off-limits items set by regulations under the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope i can meet the concern of the noble baroness and slightly pre-empt what i shall say later <e> <s> work is well advanced on many of the regulations because discussions with the local authority associations and the data protection registrar are being conducted but until they are <e>", "<cs> i take the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> there are two aspects <e> <s> there is that of the homeless people which we discussed two weeks ago and which my noble friend lord glenarthur and i said we would consider <e> <s> as regards a wife perhaps moving out of her sole or main residence without notifying the registration officer that is an offence under the bill as it stands <e> <s> therefore one is bound to do that <e> <s> it is right that the social services should be required to provide that information but nothing more sensitive <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness raises an important point <e> <s> it is not only battered wives but various other groups that can apply to have their names deleted from the register <e> <s> what i have said does not impinge on that position in any way <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness of that <e>", "<cs> as regards my noble friends second point of course medical records regardless of the illness will be sensitive information and cannot be disclosed to the registration officer <e> <s> as regards the first point i take note of what my noble friend said but we will be issuing guidance on precisely that aspect <e>", "<cs> i thought that this would lead to such an argument and indeed i come down firmly on the side of the clear and concise argument of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the governments clear legal advice is that it would be tautological to accept amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> we believe that it is inherent in the concept of maintaining the register that it will be kept up to date <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> a and would require the registration officer to seek only such information as he may reasonably require in connection with his functions <e> <s> as the noble lord lord meston just reminded the committee a similar amendment was tabled on report in another place <e> <s> on that occasion my honourable friend the minister for local government said that he understood the motivation for the amendment and undertook to consider whether the bill should be amended to incorporate the concept that registration officers may seek only such information as they reasonably require <e> <s> i can inform the committee that the governments intention is precisely that registration officers should be subject at all times to the duty to act reasonably <e> <s> as a result we have obtained advice on the point and have received confirmation that the powers will because of the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is right and i am most grateful to her for what she has said <e> <s> indeed this is a point that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey mentioned when he wound up on the first amendment <e> <s> he confused the two points as did the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> they confused what is available on the register with what is on an extract of the register <e> <s> the content of the register will be slightly more detailed but will only be available to the person named because of the data protection act <e> <s> in other words a person can only see the extract which relates to himself he will not be able to look at other matters because they will not be public <e> <s> the extract of the register which contains the names and addresses will be public as indeed the rating valuation list is at present <e> <s> as i said to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal there are cases where those who wish to be exempted for example battered wives do not want their husbands to know or for other reasons can be exempt <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments advanced in support of these amendments but i have to say that i find them as did my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter unconvincing <e> <s> i do so for two compelling reasons <e> <s> the first is that in the governments view there is nothing objectionable in allowing community charges registration officers to have access to electoral registers <e> <s> the second is that these amendments would in practice achieve absolutely nothing and would be quite unenforceable <e>", "<cs> indeed but as i have said the electoral role is already in the public domain and can be inspected by the community charges registration officer as a private citizen should he so wish <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides finally what to do with his amendment may i make two points <e> <s> he cited a case in the north of a parent who had not put down the names of his child or wife or declared their income because of fear of the community charge <e> <s> that goes to show what misconceptions there still are about the community charge and about parents being responsible for their year-old children and above <e> <s> when people realise that parents will not be responsible and that the child or indeed the grandparent living in the house will be assessed separately on their own income i believe that that and the many misapprehensions that there still are sadly will disappear <e>", "<cs> i must contradict the noble lord lord sefton of garston <e> <s> there is no evidence to substantiate his case at all <e> <s> according to the office of population censuses and surveys and indeed the home office there has been no significant effect from the community charge in scotland or elsewhere in reducing the accuracy of the electoral register <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> e f and are now grouped separately <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments that have been put forward during the debate on this group of amendments <e> <s> before responding in detail it may help if i set the scene by explaining the governments proposals so far as the inspection and sale of the register is concerned <e>", "<cs> i am coming to that point and perhaps i may be allowed to deal with it at the end of my comments on this group of amendments <e> <s> i should like now to turn to amendments nos <e> <s> e and f <e> <s> they are slightly different from the subject that we have been discussing although they are related to it <e> <s> they would require the registration officer to note beside each entry on the register whether or not the person concerned has consented to the supply of his details for non-community charge purposes <e> <s> we believe that this is an inappropriate proposal for two reasons <e> <s> first the register will contain only the information that is necessary to determine a persons community charge liability <e> <s> whether or not a person has consented to the sale of his name and address has nothing to do with his liability <e> <s> secondly it would be very odd indeed not to say wasteful to require the register to contain this <e>", "<cs> i understand the concerns that have been raised in the last few minutes and i shall need to consider them with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i missed my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my understanding at the moment is that that is not correct <e> <s> what is required on the register is the name and address of the person the liability of the person to pay and the date at which that person should pay <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said this amendment would require regulations in relation to registration to be made and to have come into effect by st january <e> <s> the committee will be aware that there is no provision in the bill for regulations concerning the register itself but clearly some of the regulation-making powers have a bearing on the registration for example those of the information gathering powers of the registration officers in schedule <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can go so far as the noble lord lord mcintosh would like <e> <s> however i repeat that meetings have already taken place between my department and local authorities on matters of policy and practice <e> <s> at the moment we are trying to arrange two further meetings with representatives of the local authority associations and we hope to hold them before the end of next month <e> <s> they will focus particularly on the draft community charge regulations <e> <s> at the meetings we also hope to discuss many of the regulations that will be needed to implement this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> with permission i should like to say a few words on the general subject of costs and then deal with the specific issues raised by the amendments <e>", "<cs> i have to disagree with the noble baroness <e> <s> of course we carried out our costs estimates and figures <e> <s> that is why there is a financial memorandum to the bill <e> <s> as matters proceed it is quite in order for the government to employ consultants to firm up those figures <e> <s> if the figures are different which i do not know because i have not seen the report then as happens on numerous occasions figures can be updated up or down <e>", "<cs> i reiterate that some draft material has been received at the department <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is being a little less than his normal generous self in his attitude towards this <e> <s> we want the figures as badly as he does and are anxious to produce them because that is right and proper and that is what we shall do <e> <s> the noble lord is right when we have the figures there will have to be a short period during which we must study them <e> <s> however i do not renege from the undertakings i gave him earlier <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness obviously did not hear me correctly <e> <s> i said that some draft material had been received <e>", "<cs> i have not denied the fact that draft material was received <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with the principle of this amendment <e> <s> however i can assure the committee that the bill <e>", "<cs> i am surprised by the noble lord <e> <s> at one stage i thought that he preferred a different political system to what we have in this country according to some of the matters that he itemised <e> <s> however he then said that he was glad that we had our system in this country <e> <s> there are some people not only students who live in fear and it is for that very reason that the government have gone to the extent that they have in giving the commitment to protect those people <e>", "<cs> i suggest to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey that to accept his amendments would be a backward step <e> <s> they do not add in any way to the bill <e> <s> let us try to define a practicable and equitable step <e> <s> what is a practicable step <e> <s> is it merely a step that is capable of being taken <e> <s> presumably it is <e> <s> is it not rather absurd to include such a requirement in legislation <e> <s> i am not quite sure what an equitable step is <e> <s> i find that a difficult one to understand <e> <s> presumably it is supposed to mean a fair step as opposed to an unfair step <e> <s> by contrast the concept in the bill of a reasonable step is infinitely clearer and more readily comprehensible <e> <s> it is a step which is moderate rational and not excessive in all the circumstances <e> <s> that i am sure the committee will agree is a much more sensible requirement than the one this amendment seeks to impose and after all that is the common ground between both of us <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friends lord renton and lord harmar-nicholls for taking on some of the arguments that i intended to raise when advising the committee to resist the amendments <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton was absolutely right to raise the point about the member of the public who would seek to use the amendments proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey in a political sense constantly to complain and thereby try to influence the role of the registration officer <e> <s> indeed i had intended to make similar points if the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey had moved amendment no <e> <s> h <e> <s> in that case the thrust of my argument would have been not about a member of the public but about the whim of the local authority and members of the committee need no reminding about what the whims of local authorities have shown in recent years <e>", "<cs> i have been given a message <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i believe that he got up just a moment too soon and that he is talking to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b whereas the deputy chairman put amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> to get the record straight perhaps we could deal with amendment no <e> <s> and clauses and <e> <s> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i believe that that is the right way to do things <e>", "<cs> the amendments deal with two matters concerning community charge registration <e> <s> although i too sympathise with the principle behind what the noble lord lord dean of beswick put forward i agree with my noble friend that the amendments are unacceptable <e> <s> i hope that i can persuade the noble lord that his fears are unfounded <e>", "<cs> although we will set down the parameters within which the registration officer should work it will be up to each individual registration officer to adopt a method that he thinks is suitable <e> <s> some registration officers might do it fortnightly some monthly some two-monthly <e> <s> there has to be some flexibility <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness highlights a point that needs a little clarification <e> <s> if somebody dies it will be either the executors or another member of the family who notifies the registration officer <e> <s> the community charge will in all probability be charged in instalments and therefore the executors will not want instalment reminders coming in unnecessarily <e> <s> at that stage the name will be taken off the extract of the register which is open to the public but will be kept on the main register for the very reasons i described <e> <s> arrangements could have been made with the local authority for the community charge to be paid six-monthly in advance or a year in advance and there might be some amount to be credited back to the estate of the deceased <e> <s> if the name of the deceased was expunged from the main register all the details would be expunged and therefore the reimbursement could not be made <e> <s> it should quite rightly be taken off the extract which is open to public view and kept on the main register for the two-year limit <e>", "<cs> i respond briefly to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> he will know that that is no discourtesy to him but it seems pointless to keep on talking at length to the committee when my answer can be brief <e> <s> these amendments would require statutory consultation with the local authority associations before regulations were made containing rules for deciding the area in which a property falls if it straddles a boundary <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill said when he moved the amendments i had indeed informed the committee of the progress that had been made in consultation with local authority associations and others <e> <s> indeed further meetings are to take place <e> <s> i therefore again repeat to the committee that the government will consult the local authority associations fully before making the rules <e> <s> not only will they consult on the implementation and practice of the rules but they will have discussions on the drafting of the regulations <e> <s> that was the point i made to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey earlier this afternoon <e> <s> i know that the noble lord would prefer the wording in the bill but at least one can say that i am being totally consistent with what my honourable friend said in another place <e>", "<cs> of course i repeat the assurance that local authority associations will be fully consulted <e> <s> of course we want good relationships with the local authority associations <e> <s> the noble lord has lain the blame fairly and squarely at the door of government <e> <s> perhaps there is another argument which might suggest that it is not all one way traffic as regards that matter <e> <s> we should not carry on with that point we should look forward to better relationships because that is what we want <e>", "<cs> i had not looked at the amendment in quite the way that the noble lord lord morton of shuna has described it <e> <s> of course the collective charge is being levied in a situation where the property might be used as a main or sole residence <e> <s> towards the end of his argument he was coming closer to what i had anticipated he would say in that he asked whether we meant day or night <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> the argument has progressed somewhat since i gave way to the invervention by the noble lord lord morton of shuna and perhaps i may pick up where i broke off before i return to the points which were added subsequently <e> <s> at that moment we were discussing whether night was an appropriate word instead of day <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord morton of shuna who is a lawyer that i believe that <e>", "<cs> of course there are problems with people who do something similar at present but i shall very much bear in mind what the noble lord said during the consultations we are having following the points that my noble friend lord glenarthur and i took away to consider at an earlier stage of our discussions <e> <s> what the noble lord omitted to say to the committee is that we have generous provisions to take into account the incomes of the people to whom he refers <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to assist the noble lord <e> <s> as it stands clause provides that a person resident in a collective charge property shall be liable to make different payments to the landlord of the property in respect of different periods of his residence during which he becomes and ceases to be exempt <e> <s> in other words if a person moves into a collective charge property becomes exempt and then ceases to be exempt each of the periods concerned has to be treated separately for the purpose of calculating how much he should pay by way of collective charge contributions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is having a great deal of fun but i can assure him that the amendments make it clear beyond peradventure where it is not clear at present <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can deal speedily with amendment no <e> <s> p which seeks to require statutory consultation with the local authority associations <e> <s> we dealt earlier as the noble lord will be told by his noble friend lord underhill with three similar amendments amendments nos <e> <s> a e and n <e> <s> the committee then accepted my assurance that consultation would take place without the need for an express provision to that effect <e>", "<cs> i accept the noble lords correction <e> <s> therefore i believe that it would be right to say that the labour party spokesman said that he was astonished that the bill provided for a per cent <e> <s> discount for those landlords who collect the collective community charge <e> <s> he went on to argue that some landlords in the traditional private sector provide accommodation that is covered by the collective community charge <e> <s> they cannot run fast enough to the bank each week <e> <s> they make enormous profits <e> <s> yet we are expected to legislate to allow such landlords a per cent <e> <s> discount for collecting taxes <e>", "<cs> i was paraphrasing the noble lords honourable friend <e> <s> the opposition spokesman said that he believed that per cent <e> <s> was far too high <e> <s> now we have the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey saying that it is far too low <e> <s> i wondered whether the noble lord might have a word with his opposite numbers in another place so that they could sort out their act on this <e> <s> it is not the first time that the opposition front benches have disagreed totally on many things <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for a further opportunity to try to elucidate what i said earlier <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean of beswick said that it did not matter to him that there were differences of opinion between the front benches here and in another place <e> <s> of course i am sure that he would be the first to appreciate how difficult this makes life for us <e> <s> we try to be helpful to <e>", "<cs> the point that i was making is that as i hope the noble lord will be the first to join me in saying we are very keen to help understand and improve the bill <e> <s> that is why we listen carefully <e> <s> but to find ourselves being pushed in one direction in the other place and in another direction in this house by the same party is difficult <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the welcome that the noble baroness has given to my amendment <e>", "<cs> in his amendments nos <e> <s> and the noble lord lord banks has identified a problem that would exist with clause if local authorities were to use the joint and several liability powers in the way that he described <e> <s> i believe that his fears are misplaced and i hope i will be able to explain to the committee exactly why <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the noble lord did not take me up on the point yesterday <e> <s> perhaps he is moving back towards the rating system as a preferred system in view of his recent comments <e>", "<cs> the basis upon which i make that statement is that the local income tax system that the noble lord wants would be far more intrusive because the registration officer would need considerably more information than he would to collect the community charge <e> <s> when the incomes of certain people particularly the self-employed are not known until some time after the end of the financial year the maintaining of such a register will add considerable extra cost to the collection <e>", "<cs> i was trying to answer the questions that i was asked <e>", "<cs> in response to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal there are many husbands who give their wives a housekeeping allowance to pay some of the bills and might give a further allowance out of their income to meet the wives community charge <e> <s> the accountability about which the noble baroness was concerned comes with the fact that for the first time the wives will be receiving a charge bill on a regular basis <e>", "<cs> receiving the bill is very much the key to the argument <e> <s> as the noble baroness will doubtless be aware the recent opinion poll for the audit commission showed that people who receive rates bills are three times more likely to know whether rates have gone up or down than people such as spouses who do not receive bills <e> <s> when we transfer that from rates into charges there will be the accountability which the noble baroness i am glad to say is so keen to support <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be right for me to go into more detail on the point which i believe the noble lord <e> <s> lord monson intends to raise about clause stand part <e> <s> with the committees agreement perhaps i may deal more fully with the whole of clause <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the procedure in committee is to have clause stand part at the end of the debate <e> <s> of course should it be dealt with at the beginning it might help to clarify matters <e> <s> however i am not sure that i am the right person at this stage to comment further upon the matter <e> <s> i shall nevertheless draw it to the attention of my noble friend the chief whip <e>", "<cs> in order to answer the queries raised by the noble lords lord jay and lord taylor of gryfe i must say that of course the local authority will not be especially concerned about who earns the income until the husband or wife does not pay the community charge and when joint and several liability starts <e> <s> at that stage i should refer both noble lords to paragraph of schedule which sets out how that situation will be dealt with should it ever reach the courts <e>", "<cs> the word income includes earnings <e>", "<cs> the local authority and the court will look for who has been responsible for the community charges until they cease to be paid <e> <s> of course if the husband or wife has walked out the respective spouse will be entitled to rebate if his or her income is below a sufficient level and to income support if there is no income and will not be meeting the full community charge <e> <s> the point made by the noble lord is covered <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for raising that point <e> <s> i draw his attention once again to paragraph of schedule which will be used by the local authority to establish means of income and the source of income if there is non-payment of the charge <e> <s> i understand the noble lords concern that that provision may not be adequate and i therefore look forward to his support for amendment no <e> <s> e which i intend to move <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e> <s> i have explained i went into some detail on clause as the committee gave me permission to do so the various stages at which a local authority would be involved and the representations that could be made by either spouse in any discussion as to whether liability for payment was due <e> <s> i said that should that fail the matter is then taken to the magistrates court <e> <s> at that stage the information that is required set out in paragraph which is to be extended by amendment no <e> <s> e to be moved later will cover the point made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> at that stage the magistrate will determine the liability for the community charge that has not been paid <e> <s> the magistrate will rightly he allowed to look at the income of both spouses <e>", "<cs> the noble lords ingenuity seldom ceases to amaze me and today he has not let me down <e> <s> the extensive provisions that we have made at the lower end of the income scale to benefit those on low wages who may be faced by the community charge are as the noble lord will be aware based on the social security regulations <e> <s> they deal with married couples <e> <s> they do not deal with the case of homosexuals which the noble lord just mentioned <e>", "<cs> i beg to differ from the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i refer him to the amendment to be moved in my name amendment no <e> <s> e which i think covers quite a lot of the noble lords concerns about the definition of paragraph c <e> <s> it goes on to define the earnings <e>", "<cs> in order to answer the noble lord lord sefton of garston i shall try again to draw his attention to amendment no <e> <s> e which refers to the income from the capital <e> <s> at this stage we are determining the question of joint and several liability who should be liable for an unpaid portion of the community charge <e> <s> capital is taken into account in the assessment of whether the person is entitled to a rebate under social security at the lower income <e> <s> that is the important place where capital is taken into account <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i too think we have made considerable progress and have clarified the point with which the noble lord was concerned <e> <s> of course he will be fully aware that under the present rating system if a person is sent a rate demand and does not pay it then he is also liable to end up in court <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord balfour for so clearly explaining the reasoning behind his amendment <e> <s> it follows very closely almost identically the letter he wrote to me <e> <s> now that the noble earl has spelt out the contents of his letter i have put a copy of my reply that he has admitted he has received in the library <e> <s> rather than repeating the whole contents of my reply to my noble friend i shall repeat just the key point which my noble friend may not have taken fully into account <e> <s> under clauses and an individuals liability for the personal community charge accrues on a daily basis during the course of the financial year <e> <s> this makes it necessary to provide that joint and several liability should also be assessed on a daily basis <e> <s> that is why it is necessary to follow the rather more involved course adopted in clause rather than the simpler course advocated by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson said that it was his belief that i had not calmed all the fears of those concerned with this part of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i do not believe that i shall calm all the fears however much i continue to try to persuade the committee <e> <s> there will always be some noble lords who are concerned about the bill <e> <s> what i hope i have achieved is to get rid of some of the misconceptions that have been aroused <e>", "<cs> we come back to the point which the noble lord lord morton of shuna has never ceased to make throughout the passage of the bill <e> <s> i look forward to the numerous occasions on which he will make it in the future <e> <s> it is that there are some drafting differences between this bill and the scottish bill <e> <s> the intentions are exactly the same as the noble lord will be aware <e>", "<cs> as a lawyer the noble lord will understand that lawyers differ <e> <s> a different parliamentary counsel is involved on this occasion <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> as regards the point raised in respect of subsection my answer is slightly covered by the point i made to my noble friend lord balfour earlier <e> <s> they will not be jointly or severally liable on the day they get married but on a subsequent day <e>", "<cs> i take careful note of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> perhaps i may refrain from making the last suggestion to parliamentary counsel but i shall make the first suggestion <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord diamond for raising this important matter <e> <s> i was fully expecting the noble baroness lady stedman to raise it because she tabled amendments to cover this point and has withdrawn them <e> <s> therefore i suspected that that matter would be raised at this stage <e> <s> i am grateful that the national association of local councils wrote to my honourable friend the minister for local government in advance of this debate to explain its concern about the issue of visiting servicemen <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton moving his amendment and i can assure the committee that i do not dissent from the principle that charging authorities should not discriminate in providing services against people who fail to register for or pay the community charge <e> <s> this is no different from saying that authorities should not discriminate in providing services against people who fail to pay their rates or people who have been convicted of a criminal offence or for that matter people with fair hair <e> <s> i accept the principle without reservation <e> <s> local authorities are service providers and they must carry out that role in accordance with the statutes which empower them to provide the services without favour or discrimination <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said that he would wish to give an exposition of his partys views on the nndr <e> <s> of course we should have liked to hear that <e> <s> i was ready to respond and indeed had shortened what i was going to say to the noble lord <e> <s> but i shall keep it for a more appropriate moment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord lytton has indeed been very patient <e> <s> it is not often that someone who moves amendments in committee for the first time has to wait until almost ten past one <e>", "<cs> i thought i had just covered that point about the right of appeal <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to consider that point <e>", "<cs> my last point concerned an issue raised by the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> i said that i should like between now and another stage to look at the point that he raised <e>", "<cs> we have had a useful addition to our discussion <e> <s> it appears that my noble friends lord renton and lord sandford do not like the existing system and would like it to be changed <e> <s> that is interesting and obviously something that i should like to look at and read about in detail <e> <s> i found some points a little hard to follow as regards what my noble friend lord renton was saying <e> <s> but when i read the <e>", "<cs> if i am wrong twice perhaps i am right <e> <s> perhaps i may say to my noble friend lady carnegy that the provision will of course apply to scotland <e> <s> i believe that it will be beneficial for all of us to look at what has been said in the <e>", "<cs> we are a broad church and welcome healthy debate <e>", "<cs> may i remind the committee that the main purpose of the governments amendments to which i spoke on the last amendment is to preserve the existing rules which empower local authorities to increase the rate relief for charities from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and to give up to per cent <e> <s> relief to other non-profit-making bodies including sports clubs <e>", "<cs> they cannot be for the simple reason that i spoke to the government amendments on the last amendment <e> <s> i did not move them because one cannot move them but there is nothing to stop anybody talking to amendments subsequent to the one being discussed <e> <s> indeed i had to do that in order to set the picture for the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> since then the noble baroness lady stedman has spoken to her two amendments nos <e> <s> za and zc the noble lords lord ross of newport and <e>", "<cs> i hope it will be in the autumn <e> <s> however i cannot give the noble lord a clear indication at the moment <e> <s> having been a surveyor and a small business man i appreciate the need to get out the figures as soon as possible because it is in the interregnum period when we are not sure what the figures will be that all the worries surface and the most extreme examples are naturally put forward <e>", "<cs> yes i give that firm assurance to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> it is good news for scotland which i am sure the noble lord will welcome <e> <s> i can assure him that there will be powers for transitional arrangements in scotland <e> <s> perhaps i may refer him to clause <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord stanley has made clear the principal motive behind the amendment is the fear for rural services especially village shops and post offices many of which as customer mobility increases face increased competition from town supermarkets <e> <s> the amendment gives me an opportunity to expand upon points that the noble baroness lady stedman raised on the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> the reason why i said the words which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey repeated about village shops as a group was as a result of my knowledge of rural village shops and of rating and valuation <e> <s> i do not think that as a group those shopkeepers have the concerns that are being expressed <e> <s> undoubtedly there will be some who because of the changes in circumstances will face rate increases <e> <s> that has not been denied <e>", "<cs> i quite agree with the noble lord lord mcintosh that it is right for him to speak to amendment no <e> <s> and to some other amendments grouped with it <e> <s> the reason i did not speak to them before is that the noble lord has not spoken to them and i thought it would be discourteous <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> c and za would be to exclude from rating by primary legislation all non-domestic property unoccupied for less than six months <e> <s> the effect of amendent no <e> <s> of the noble lord lord mcintosh is slightly different and would be to restore local authority discretion over the categories of property to be subject to unoccupied property rating and over the level of that rating <e>", "<cs> there have been many cases about whether particular types of buildings should <e>", "<cs> i am just coming to that point <e> <s> the dictum of lord justice lawson on the appeal of the <e>", "<cs> i should be sad if the advice which my noble friend lord rippon gave to the noble lord lord mason were accepted <e> <s> if one makes a suggestion in good faith that we can discuss the matter between now and another stage one hopes that that will be accepted <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stallard referred yet again to the very important subject of charitable hostels for the homeless and similar institutions <e> <s> he has proposed that they should be exempt for non-domestic rating from what the noble lord said i believe that the establishments about which he is concerned are predominantly residential providing living accommodation for longer or shorter periods to people who would otherwise be homeless <e> <s> if so they would fall within the definition of domestic property in clause <e> <s> they will not be subject to non-domestic rating and so there can be no question of specifically exempting them <e>", "<cs> if it is a non-domestic property run by a charity then of course <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will i hope know by now that when i say i shall take it away i shall take it away <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord monson for giving me a little notice that he might ask me this question <e> <s> although like many noble lords i am quite keen on wine i am not too knowledgeable about vineyards <e> <s> however i am able to tell him that vineyards are exempt by virtue of the agricultural exemption in schedule and d since they are treated as market gardens <e> <s> also exempt are the fermenting and bottling facilities <e> <s> only the retail premises if any are rateable in the same way as farm shops <e> <s> complications arise however where the vineyard also imports wine from elsewhere <e> <s> then the ancillary buildings may have a value attached to them reflecting the proportion of their use attributable to the bottling and handling of the imported wine <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment would have two effects <e> <s> first whereas the existing clause which the noble lord wishes to delete merely empowers the secretary of state to make regulations providing for disputes about rateable values to be referred to valuation and community charge tribunals the amendment would write into the bill that they should be so referred <e> <s> i have to say that this is a distinction without a difference <e> <s> there is no serious possibility of the secretary of state not making such regulations without which there would be no right of appeal against rateable values <e> <s> for all practical purposes the word may in this context means shall so there is no need for the amendment to ensure that a right of appeal exists <e> <s> however i can give the committee an undertaking that there will be such a right <e> <s> moreover the amendment would not avoid the need to make regulations dealing with the form of appeals the time for making them and so on <e>", "<cs> over the years valuers in england and wales on the one hand and scotland on <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord lord tordoff that we attach very great importance to the speedy achievement of harmonisation in this difficult area <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord will be aware we have listened carefully to the representations of the cbi the chemical industries association and the petroleum industries association on this subject and sympathise with their concerns <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that we have given priority to work on this issue and will shortly be receiving the formal recommendations of the inland revenue valuation office and the scottish assessors association <e> <s> we shall then consult with the rating profession and the industry on the way in which harmonisation is to be achieved the level at which the <e>", "<cs> the simple effect of amendments nos <e> <s> to would be to force business rates up by more than the rate of inflation <e> <s> by contrast the government wish to provide at least the possibility that they might be reduced <e> <s> i hope that the business organisations which have expressed concern about the possible effects of revaluation and the national non-domestic rate are taking note of the real attitude to the business community of both parties opposite <e> <s> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has suggested in his helpful intervention it is with these amendments that we hear the true voice of the labour and sdp parties who are concerned to go on subsidising the high-spending policies of some local authorities at the expense of precisely those small businesses they seemed so anxious to protect earlier <e>", "<cs> i covered the point of wages and salaries <e> <s> i admit that some are done from the centre but i think as the audit commission said in its recent report that there are considerable savings to be made in the way that local authorities conduct their business <e> <s> we do not see why the extra costs above rpi should fall on the business community <e>", "<cs> i am listening <e>", "<cs> as we have heard these amendments would change the basis of payment of the revenue support grant <e> <s> there are those who would have the english system like the welsh and those who feel that the welsh system should be brought in line with what we have proposed for england <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness and i are on common ground that is exactly what we seek to achieve <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i think i said that my noble friend would move her amendment <e> <s> what i meant was that she would speak to it <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> i moved amendment no <e> <s> a last thursday night <e> <s> i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps it might be appropriate for me to take the unusual step of replying to my noble friend at this stage because i <e>", "<cs> it is nndr which means national non-domestic rate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to some of the points raised because that would be fair to the committee <e> <s> in particular i should like to deal with some of the points raised by my noble friend lord carr <e> <s> i can assure him that grant will be distributed so that if all authorities spent at the level of their spending needs assessment they could all levy the same charge <e> <s> everyone would pay the same charge for the same level of service <e> <s> so let me make it clear that the needs assessment for westminster as for all other authorities will take account of all that the present system does <e>", "<cs> i apologise for misinterpreting some of what the noble lord said <e> <s> i thought he was criticising the fact that businesses paid rates <e> <s> that was the message that i received from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the bill is not unworkable <e> <s> it has been thought out extremely carefully <e> <s> i did not comment on my noble friends figures because i found it extremely difficult to do so without studying them in detail and knowing the basis on which they have been arrived at <e> <s> my intention which i should have made clear is to look at what my noble friend said and reply to him in writing putting a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> during mondays sitting we considered a similar amendment to amendment no <e> <s> in relation to clause and the power of the community charges registration officer to seek information <e> <s> today the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> has raised the issue in connection with information sought by the valuation officer <e> <s> the point i made earlier applies equally in this case <e>", "<cs> since this is a somewhat technical issue it may be for the benefit of the committee if i set out some of the background <e> <s> at present to he rated a property has to be beneficially occupied <e> <s> this means that in addition to the various categories of property which are specifically exempt a number of other types are effectively exempt because no one derives a benefit from occupying them <e> <s> they include land awaiting or undergoing development public highways and open moorland <e> <s> the bill by preserving the present case-law definition of occupier in clause preserves this position <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not have the brief and neither do i <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like to spend a little time introducing part vi which is clauses to inclusive because it is essential that i set it out for the committee <e> <s> it is relevant to future amendments <e> <s> it is also extremely relevant to what my noble friend lady gardner of parkes said earlier this afternoon <e> <s> it is extremely sad that she is not in her place to hear what i have to say because it would go a long way to soothing her fears about the grants system <e>", "<cs> i should first like to answer the question asked by the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal <e> <s> no it will not affect those authorities which have special needs <e> <s> the whole purpose of our system is to simplify it <e> <s> we believe that some of the duplication can be removed <e> <s> other services can usefully be taken on a population basis and distributed on that basis <e> <s> the core point of the concern expressed by the noble baroness will continue to be met by the needs assessment <e>", "<cs> as we have heard the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> is to re-introduce into the bill those factors which the secretary of state is required to take into account before determining rate support grant in the present system under the local government planning and land act <e> <s> therefore it seeks to retain a link between the amount of grant and the level of expenditure <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey therein lies my difficulty <e>", "<cs> there are some technical flaws in this amendment the chief of which is that there is no estimate of the distributable amount but rather a calculation albeit one based on estimates of certain amounts and for that reason the amendment as it stands does not achieve its purpose <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given us a full explanation of the purpose of these amendments <e> <s> he sees amendment no <e> <s> no doubt as a safeguard for local authorities setting constraints on the secretary of states powers and ensuring that certain steps are taken <e> <s> i understand his argument but i hope to show the committee that the noble lords concerns are misplaced <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble lord may not have been in his usual place when i spoke about reasonableness earlier on <e> <s> of course the secretary of state is duty bound to act reasonably for if he does not he might be taken to a judicial review <e>", "<cs> the experience gained by the department over many years of dealing with local authorities stands it in good stead in terms of knowing what local authorities need <e> <s> local authorities have never been slow in coming to the department with their concerns or to point out matters on which they believe that the department has not taken their representations on board <e> <s> that knowledge accumulated over many years has enabled the present system incomprehensible as it is <e> <s> to continue <e> <s> the proposed system will be much simpler <e> <s> as i have said on more than one occasion we shall continue to be in touch and to consult with local authority associations over a number of issues in the bill <e> <s> i am sure that local authorities will not be slow in coming forward with their views if they have not been reflected in what the department has said <e>", "<cs> as we have heard the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> a is to introduce a requirement for the secretary of state to <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the points made by the noble baroness lady stedman and the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> to decide what is the appropriate treatment of interest earned by the temporary investment cash surpluses in the collection fund and of the costs of administering the fund it is necessary to look at the nature of the collection fund <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to change the arrangements for handling the contributions received from the national non-domestic rates pool <e> <s> as i understand them they are designed to give parish and community councils direct access to a share in proportion to their precepts of the national non-domestic rate now <e>", "<cs> indeed there are a number of things that of course are being taken into account <e> <s> one has to take into account the fact that some district councils do not have parishes at all <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware there is nothing that the parish council is doing at the moment that the district could not be doing <e> <s> however i can assure him that full consultations are taking place <e>", "<cs> before turning to the detail of the amendments it may assist the committee if i briefly describe the rationale behind the inclusion of the charge capping provisions in the bill and the way in which we envisage them operating <e>", "<cs> i believe that i have covered most of the points which my noble friend put to me <e> <s> if i have not done so perhaps he will remind me what points i did not cover <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris tempts me to discuss another bill which will shortly be coming before the house <e> <s> i look forward to discussing that bill with him in the future <e>", "<cs> at the moment that bill is being discussed in another place <e> <s> it is right to wait until the bill comes before the house to consider that point <e>", "<cs> i think that one would have to look at all the circumstances surrounding the charge that an authority might levy in the future in view of the criteria which i spelt out in answer to the amendment <e>", "<cs> these four amendments deal with issues relating to a local authoritys spending under section of the local government act that is their residual power to incur expenditure in the interests of the area or its inhabitants where no statutory powers exist <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and the noble baroness lady stedman for the skill with which they have deployed their arguments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of newport raises an important point about the commoners at wimbledon <e> <s> i can assure the committee that it was fresh in my mind yesterday <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh said that had in a somewhat airy fashion indicated that the amount to be refunded in respect of these proposals would be half of per cent <e> <s> of local authority rate revenue <e> <s> i agree that that is a substantial sum <e> <s> if the noble lord will recall i was of course comparing it to the fact that the rateable base value increases between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> a year <e> <s> in that context it is not such a frightening figure as may at first appear <e> <s> of course the figures that the noble lord mentioned are substantial ones <e> <s> what i would say to him is that we are still considering the implications and considering some of the representations that have been made to us by the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that intervention and i am sure my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden will have a ready reply to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that on reflection the scots may consider that they are overall better off having a five-yearly revaluation rather than being the possessors of properties and hereditaments in england where we have not had a revaluation for years <e> <s> however although i take the point which has been raised by the noble lord lord ross it is one that i cannot recommend to the committee <e> <s> i do not think that a revaluation is the right answer particularly at the present time when we have not had one for so long <e>", "<cs> if recall rightly i believe i said that the figures quoted by the noble lord were indeed large sums of money <e> <s> that means i did not contradict the noble lord <e> <s> as i understand it and i shall need to check these figures the loss to the authorities for <e>", "<cs> i thought i had covered that point more fully than the earlier one <e> <s> i admitted that it was unevenly distributed throughout the countryi said that compensation would be paid in the worst circumstances and that of course we were listening to local authority representations at the moment <e>", "<cs> i have every confidence that my noble friends on the front bench will he far more adequate than i am in dealing with the subject and will convince members of the committee in no time <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i was a little disappointed to hear the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove say that building work always gets more expensive throughout the contract <e> <s> i recall that not so long ago we discussed the very question of contracts in the context of the local government bill <e> <s> my noble friend lady blatch and i argued strongly that many of the noble lords concerns could be taken into account by getting the right specification at day one <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not think that that follows <e> <s> in any case the recent figures reveal that there has been an exodus from the south-east not an influx into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not totally follow what the noble lord was asking <e> <s> what level is he referring to <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the planning application has to be considered on merit <e> <s> the point that i made was that it might be possible to have new settlements where the infrastructure costs were met if there are additional items outwith the planning application for development for example housing development which might be of benefit to the community <e> <s> that will of course be for the local authority to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea of sympathy from the noble lord is always welcome <e> <s> but i can assure him that the government have very sensible policies and that is why there has been such a substantial reduction in the amount of agricultural land that has been taken for all kinds of development from the s and s to the present day <e> <s> it is under a third of what it was in the s and s <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what fluctuations the noble lord is referring to <e> <s> however those matters are considered very carefully particularly as regards the south-east of england where my noble friend lord sandford and serplan are involved <e> <s> where changes have been made as they were last week that has been done as a result of further evidence from serplan <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord knows that there were good reasons for that <e> <s> as i have said serplan produced further evidence that there were likely to be more houses available by as a result of actions which have been taken by the government in particular in the private sector rental market which should allow about more dwellings to come on stream <e> <s> i hope that as a result the noble lord will support the housing bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is any confusion as regards the green belt <e> <s> when we came into office in the green belt consisted of acres around london <e> <s> it now consists of million acres <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment all we have are two proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure my noble friend that the government take the matter seriously <e> <s> the department of health and social security has issued new guidance about the inspection and maintenance of hospitals with cooling tower systems <e> <s> in the near future that will be incorporated into a wider code covering hot and cold water systems <e> <s> the health and safety executive issued a guidance note on the nature and prevention of legionnaires disease in january <e>

comments made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw the comments of the noble lord to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord will not expect me to answer his questions in detail <e> <s> inquiries into the bbc outbreak are continuing one by the bbc and the other by westminster city council <e> <s> they are expected to report in september <e> <s> i believe that it would be wrong for me to comment on the matter at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that guidance has been issued and that the health and safety executive is also looking into the outbreak through its normal procedures <e> <s> if necessary it will update the guidance which it produced in january <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the disease and indeed pontiac fever can be caught from the evaporation of water <e> <s> it is important that such installations as air conditioning systems and water supplies are maintained to a proper standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there is nobody involved in health or responsible for public or private buildings who is not aware of the potentially disastrous consequences of legionnaires disease and i am sure that they ensure that their maintenance is to a high standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble baroness that assurance without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i was concerned as i am sure were all noble lords when reading about the reports of dumping in african states <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend however that there is an ec directive <e> <s> the department will shortly be laying the directive before parliament hopefully before the summer recess <e> <s> each member state in the european community has to be convinced that the third world country has the right disposal facilities before any hazardous waste is sent to that country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition started off with concern about nuclear waste <e> <s> he then went on to the potential import of domestic waste from america in particular to the cheshire area <e> <s> i can tell him that we are due to see cheshire county council later this week to discuss the matter <e> <s> as i understand it the site is already zoned for tipping purposes <e> <s> cheshire county council has a direct interest in the site <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we shall discover a little more about that when we have the meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i missed the first part of the noble lords question <e> <s> however at the moment the disposal of hazardous waste is controlled by the consignment notes procedure both for imports and for exports <e> <s> this will be strengthened by the new directive that i have to lay before parliament shortly

in total <e> <s> of that about tonnes were special waste the major part being non-hazardous waste <e> <s> that is the first time that a very large amount has been imported into this country <e> <s> before that it was a fairly negligible amount <e> <s> however i can assure her that the total wastes imported were less than a half of per cent <e> <s> of the total uk waste <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second point we have extremely high standards for hazardous and non-hazardous waste <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the

mcintosh of haringey has been kind enough to offer me of saying a final word at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may pick up the kind offer of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> perhaps i may begin on a positive and i hope generally acceptable point <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna asked when the scottish amendments would be available <e> <s> of course we can oblige <e> <s> they will be available shortly and in good time for the noble lord i hope today <e> <s> however as we know some of the amendments unfortunately from both sides have not been tabled as early as we would have hoped <e>", "<cs> my lords that was just the point i was coming to because it was raised by the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> the bill gives the registration officer a discretionary power to designate properties for the purposes of the collective community charge <e> <s> in general that power will be used to designate hostels which are used all the year round <e> <s> crisis at christmas is as the noble lord knows and as we have been told open for only seven days in the whole year <e> <s> it seems to me to be most unlikely that a hostel that is used for only seven days in a whole year will be designated at all in practice <e> <s> it is that practical matter of designation that we wish to discuss with local authorities <e> <s> however when we discuss it with local authorities i assure the house that we shall bear very much in mind what your lordships have said today <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be an administrative cost to the local authority which i am afraid i do not know <e> <s> there will be a slight cost to the person who runs the hostel <e> <s> but there is a provision in the bill that that person should retain per cent <e> <s> of the charge <e> <s> that matter was debated at some length in committee <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> they will be responsible for collecting from everybody <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> what i said was that if those in crisis at christmas were the small number who had homes elsewhere then it would not be designated for the purposes of the collective community charge <e> <s> perhaps that has clarified this fact for the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> i shall be discussing these matters with my right honourable friend <e> <s> it is important on this narrow point of where accommodation and food are provided free <e>", "<cs> my lords before i finally sit down i shall bear in mind what the noble lord lord mcintosh has just said and also what my noble friend lord sandford has said <e> <s> i assure him that we have already had detailed discussions with those who run the salvation army and church army hostels and we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords how nice it is to continue the discussion with the noble lord on the differences between scotland and england <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that this is not the last discussion we shall be having on the matter <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will be teasing me gently throughout the rest of the report stage and doubtless on third reading <e> <s> he knows well that there are innumerable differences between any piece of scottish legislation and an equivalent piece of legislation for england and wales <e> <s> the differences result from different legal i am sorry i cannot read the next word <e>", "<cs> my lords not all the time but i hope most of the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what your lordships have said about the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> he raised a subject to which we have given a good deal of thought and upon which i recently wrote to him as he reminded your lordships a moment ago <e> <s> it may be helpful therefore if i explain precisely why we have adopted the approach to the issuing of certificates which is enshrined in the governments amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not believe that i said that <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has misinterpreted what i said <e> <s> i said that we have consulted the dhss and i am sure that the dhss as experts in the matter have consulted widely outside <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may repeat what i said to the noble lord lord hunter of newington that that was a point which i wanted to discuss with my right honourable friend <e> <s> it is a point which i certainly wanted to look into putting qualified before registered medical practitioner <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has just said and of the comments made in committee it may be helpful if i explain in a little detail the governments thinking in providing the exemption for religious communities in the way that they have <e>", "<cs> my lords before i respond to the amendment in detail this gives me an opportunity to say to my noble friend lord sandford who raised a point after i had sat down after replying to the previous amendment that i looked at the whole of the wording of this part of the bill between the committee stage when concern was raised and now <e> <s> but i must say that we could not come up with tighter wording <e> <s> we went back and discussed it with some of the members of the churches main committee <e> <s> it is sad that some of the right reverend prelates involved on that committee are not here today to take part in what would be a helpful debate on this matter <e> <s> we looked at the matter but found that the wording was sufficiently tight <e> <s> therefore my noble friend need not have quite the concerns that i know he has <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton will recall the reply that i gave to a precisely similar amendment that he moved at an earlier stage <e> <s> the position has not changed <e> <s> the principle behind granting an exemption for patients in a home is that accountability could not reasonably be said to operate for many of those individuals <e> <s> the ability of people in homes to participate in the process of local accountability would in many cases be severely limited and perhaps more limited than the noble lord lord monson believes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome that has been given to this amendment <e> <s> i should like to say to my noble friend lord hastings that we have not yet decided to employ a capital test <e> <s> we shall consult the organisations concerned before deciding whether to set a test and if so where to set it <e> <s> we shall bear in mind what my noble friend has said <e> <s> of course the same point applies to the question of age <e> <s> we shall bear in mind what your lordships have said in deciding whether to use age as one of the criteria <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said that is a matter to be decided in the future <e> <s> your <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said this amendment is identical to one moved by the noble baroness lady lockwood at an earlier stage <e> <s> i am sure that all your lordships would like to join me in sending our greatest condolences to the noble baroness <e> <s> our thoughts are with her as indeed they are with the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey in these difficult times for both of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall consider that in the cold light of day rather than immediately <e> <s> my first reaction is that i do not think that womens refuges and short stay hostels are comparable <e> <s> i see quite a major difference between the two systems <e> <s> however i should like to look at the matter in a little more detail <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that the situation that the noble lord lord dean of beswick is describing is covered by earlier amendments relating to hostel accommodation rather than the womens refuges that we are talking about at the moment <e> <s> the noble lord can be assured that on general purpose hostels where people are not receiving treatment or care we have already made a major concession to come down to per cent <e> <s> of the community charge <e> <s> the situation of battered wives is slightly different <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome that has been given to this amendment <e> <s> however with respect to the noble lord lord dean of beswick i believe that my noble friend lord renton has a point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady blatch has put her finger right on the pulse of the matter <e> <s> that is what i intended to say to my noble friend lord renton before the noble lord lord dean of beswick sprung to the rapid defence of his argument <e> <s> we are not only talking about people in central london <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord dean that to find a coach and horses and jalopies in central london might be a little tricky <e> <s> however if he comes with me to the country and dons his wellie boots i believe that there is a fair chance that he might look at the problem from a slightly different point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords that only confirms how wary i am about taking on the noble lord on a matter of interpretation <e> <s> perhaps i may look at the point between now and another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are revised versions of amendments tabled at an earlier stage <e> <s> my noble friend lord brentford took the trouble to write to me about his proposals and i was therefore able to write back to him with a full explanation of why even in their revised forms the amendments do not find favour with the government <e> <s> some of what i say repeats what i have said to him in writing but i am sure that it will be helpful to all noble lords if i set out the governments case in full <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing between the government and your lordships those who have spoken and those who have not who are concerned about the matter <e> <s> we agree entirely about <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord if i misread his amendment <e> <s> that confirms the point i was about to make that students form only one category of individual we have in mind <e> <s> there will be others besides overseas nationals who should have the same protection <e> <s> they will be people from overseas or not who are at risk or individuals who fear domestic violence <e> <s> we have already debated the position of battered wives <e>", "<cs> my lords at an earlier stage we considered amendments similar to those we are debating now <e> <s> it is appropriate therefore that i should repeat at least some of the remarks i made during discussions at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the point made by the noble lord lord dean of beswick however tightly one draws a statute with the very best will in the world human interpretation of it can be different <e> <s> we obviously want to minimise that in respect of any part of this bill when it becomes an act and i hope that your lordships will wing it on its way with due speed <e> <s> so the guidance notes will be sent to the registration officers and local authorities in order to minimise that <e> <s> i understand the noble lords concern <e> <s> it covers many points that occur in life <e> <s> i assure him that on this occasion as throughout the bill our guidance will be as clear as possible to avoid the very matters about which he is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to what has been said in the debate <e> <s> in the light of a debate at an earlier stage we have given the issue the closest consideration <e> <s> noble lords will appreciate that there are arguments on both sides of the issue <e> <s> on the one hand there are arguments which can be broadly described as deriving from concerns about privacy civil liberties and data protection <e> <s> those arguments were put most forcefully this evening and at an earlier stage by the noble lords lord meston and lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to confirm that to my noble friend <e> <s> the extract is very different from the register <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has just said the amendments would provide that an individual staying in a collective charge property should not have to pay a collective community charge contribution if he is paying the personal community charge somewhere else <e> <s> there are three reasons why i do not believe that it would be sensible or practical to accept the amendments <e> <s> i shall outline each of the reasons in turn <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the point made by my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> he was right to say that no one who is unable to pay will be imprisoned <e> <s> one can be imprisoned only if one shows wilful refusal or culpable neglect <e> <s> it is clearly established in case law that this expression only applies to someone who had the money could have paid but either chose not to or failed to do so without reasonable excuse <e> <s> that is the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has come up with a marvellously simplistic solution but i am advised that it is not as simple as he would have your lordships believe <e> <s> the reason the scots were able to do what they did was entirely due to the fact that the whole procedure had been looked at on a wide front <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord has been following the details of our proceedings with great care <e> <s> he will be aware that new instalment procedures are being introduced in the bill which have not been applicable to rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to take this opportunity to speak generally on the subject of costs before dealing with the specific issues raised by these amendments <e> <s> during the committee stage i undertook to make available the results of the price waterhouse study when we received the final report <e> <s> price waterhouse has now completed its report and copies were placed in the library last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i give full credit to the noble lord because this amendment is deceptively simple <e> <s> however if implemented i suspect that it would cause many more problems than it would solve <e> <s> perhaps i may give your lordships an example <e> <s> it refers to individuals who are caused hardship but does not indicate how the proposal for a per cent <e> <s> payment in would relate to the rebate system under which million individuals will be paying only per cent <e> <s> of the charge in <e> <s> how would they be dealt with <e> <s> nor do we accept that hardship will be caused <e> <s> even those on maximum rebates will have the per cent <e> <s> payment reflected in their income support <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to respond to the noble lord lord morton of shuna in two stages first on the policy intention underlying clause and the equivalent scottish power and secondly on the question of the words used in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am terribly disappointed that the noble lord lord morton of shuna could not give such a reasonable amendment a more glorious welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first deal with the point raised by the noble lord lord jay <e> <s> i can say to him that nothing in the amendment relates to the inland revenue <e> <s> it was only of the dhss that i was speaking so his concerns are abated <e> <s> to the noble lords lord mcintosh and lord ross of newport let me just repeat this undertaking it will only i stress only be names and addresses and not sensitive information that are passed on <e> <s> we are not trying to discourage people from claiming benefit but we must try to ensure that people whose income support will include an amount in respect of the community charge are already registered for that purpose <e> <s> indeed it is beholden on people to register for the community charge <e> <s> it is only right if such a person is claiming income support that the power in the amendment to do this cross-section on names and addresses only is available <e>", "<cs> my lords from my understanding of the bill it is clear <e> <s> however i should like to look into the point and advise the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has the assurance that i gave and repeat it is names and addresses only that the registration officer needs to complete his functions as set out in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lord to have moved the amendment for discussion as it was raised last night by the noble lords lord mcintosh of haringey and lord meston <e> <s> i can confirm that i have considered it between then and lunchtime today <e> <s> my mind has been concentrated on other things since then but due consideration has been given to it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord now takes me into a very technical area of the bill where i have asked for legal advice <e> <s> to substitute shall for may in paragraph would cast doubt on the use of the word may throughout schedule <e> <s> the result would be a potentially damaging lack of clarity <e> <s> i must therefore bow to my legal advice on this point <e> <s> the noble lord has my earlier assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the first two of these amendments would empower the magistrates court to remit payment of the community charge on grounds of poverty in cases where a charging authority applies for a liability order either against a person who has failed to pay the charge or against a person whose spouse has failed to pay the charge <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considered the situation of those people in local authorities where the spending is highest <e> <s> we took that very much into account when considering the per cent <e> <s> rebate and the per cent <e> <s> of the average community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be for the convenience of the house if i take up the offer of the noble lord lord mcintosh to speak now and with the leave of the house perhaps come back later <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge i can give the noble lord the assurance for which he is looking <e> <s> there is no home office circular of the type which concerns him <e> <s> the provisions in the bill allow a warrant to be directed to any person the court thinks fit <e> <s> that will enable the warrant to be directed if necessary to the police <e> <s> i am sure that that action will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will raise that matter with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not speaking to amendment no <e> <s> because that is part of the large government concession noted by the noble lord lord mcintosh as thank you nos <e> <s> to inclusive <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment returns to a subject that arose in committee <e> <s> at that time your lordships will recall that i was able to respond positively to the noble baronesss arguments and she was also good enough to say that she was pleased with what i had to say <e> <s> however i hope that she will not be too disappointed when i say that i cannot accept her amendment for the reasons i shall elucidate <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously took careful advice before seeking to put down the amendments <e> <s> should the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey be more successful than his party was at the committee and report stages of the education reform bill in persuading the government to change their view should that be allowed by the procedures of the house account will be taken of that later in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that must be thank-you no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it is in order for the present situation to exist <e> <s> i further understand that when the residuary body is wound up then the interest of the present chairman will finish because the residuary body will no longer have an interest in the company <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that we are also in touch with the districts on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that undertaking <e> <s> as the noble lord knows following the board meeting the previous chairman was no longer chairman but as i understand it remains a director <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is extremely complicated because not only is g mex involved but there is at least one other property and one development site of acres adjacent to g mex <e> <s> the residuary body is doing its best to protect the public interest and in my view is doing an extremely good job in reducing the liabilities <e> <s> we hope therefore that it will be sorted out in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it not to the public purse <e> <s> certain liabilities were entered into by gmc and that is what is being sorted out at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords the rating of charities is an important subject <e> <s> we discussed it at <e>", "<cs> my lords no i beg to differ from my noble friend <e> <s> my figures show that in a full year if there were no relief charities would have had to pay about million <e> <s> therefore the per cent <e> <s> of mandatory relief is million and the per cent <e> <s> of discretionary relief is a further million or so <e> <s> but the discretionary relief that they receive is about million <e> <s> that leaves the balance of million which is the sum about which we are talking as a result of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with that when i come towards the end of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not convinced that all the charities that have received relief are deserving ones <e> <s> that is why we still believe that there should be an element of discretionary rating relief to those charities <e>", "<cs> no my lords i shall not be discussing it with my noble friend i shall be discussing it with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is right that i should respond to that <e> <s> i gave the house the assurance that i would look at this again <e> <s> as it stands i believe that my noble friends amendment goes too far <e> <s> i realise that the two major concessions offered by the government did not go far enough to meet your lordships concern <e> <s> however i believe it is right that we should consider it again between now and another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for so clearly putting the case for the exemption of stud farms from rating and for their comments on the government amendment which i gave a commitment in committee we would table <e>", "<cs> my lords before i respond to my noble friend lord kimball perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord moran in regard to the previous amendment that many of his concerns will be addressed in future legislation <e> <s> however where i can write to him to give some clarity regarding consequential difficulties that we must sort out i shall of course do so <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a repeats an amendment which was tabled by the noble earl lord lytton in committee and which i undertook to look at further <e> <s> i have done so but i am afraid i have not been persuaded that an amendment would be justified <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend i have to say that i fear he may be under some misapprehension about the present situation <e> <s> the present situation under section of the general rate act is that an alteration to the list following a proposal by the valuation officer or the ratepayer can be backdated to the start of the financial year in which it is made or the date of the relevant change of circumstances whichever is the later <e> <s> so any retrospective effect can never exceed months from the date that the alteration is proposed <e> <s> it can be more than that from the date when the alteration is made which may not be until after appeal proceedings have been settled <e> <s> i shall come back later to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord dean of beswick has explained the effect of the amendment would be to delete from the bill the power for the government to decide in any year to increase the national non-domestic rate poundage by less than the rate of inflation subject to affirmative resolution in another place <e> <s> it would thus mean that business rates automatically rose every year by the full amount of the increase in the retail prices index <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house i should perhaps clarify the situation <e> <s> as i understand it if there is a surplus both the domestic and the business community charge payers will benefit <e> <s> we are considering an exceptional circumstance where it might be appropriate to give the benefit back to business by a slight reduction in <e>", "<cs> my lords i turn to the amendments which have now been presented by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> za and are concerned with transitional arrangements for those relatively few businesses which will face large increases in their rate bills in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i know that many figures have been banded about <e> <s> there is no basis to the figures until the revaluation takes place <e> <s> people are hypothesising about the increases <e> <s> i am delighted that at long last the noble lord and his party are taking small businesses as a serious body <e>", "<cs> it is because of that concern of small businesses that we added the further transition provisions after <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never denied that there would be increases particularly in the south of england <e> <s> the advantage that england and wales will have over scotland after revaluation will be in terms of the phasing provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton would be to require the secretary of state to inform local authorities and other bodies of the calculations made under regulations which define relevant population and to take into account representations made by those bodies before making any determinations <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not imagine that the noble lord did <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall try to exemplify the position <e> <s> the basis for the population figure is clear it is the taxable capacity of the area <e> <s> that will depend to some extent on your lordships amendments or agreement to the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord lord graham of edmonton were to say that he would not press any further amendments to change the taxable capacity of the area i should be able to help him a little sooner than i am able to help him <e> <s> that is the broad position <e> <s> the detail as regards the best way to assess that figure is the legitimate area for discussion with local authority associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i have not made myself clear to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> we have been through this matter at great length in committee and again on this occasion <e> <s> however i shall try once again to explain the position <e> <s> we are talking about the population in the area <e> <s> that is the basis of the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure will come from the local authorities to some extent and from the information that we have in the department <e> <s> that is the basis on which the population which is the taxable capacity of an area is arrived at <e> <s> but we then have to take into account the number of students as a result of the amendments which were agreed earlier last week <e> <s> then the nurses have to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall explain for the last time that the taxable basis will be the number of people liable to pay the community charge <e> <s> as i have said before this is where the consultation with local authorities is the best way of defining that taking into account the very valid points that the noble lord has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord mcintosh has tabled these amendments because they give me an opportunity to place on record a decision which the government have taken following the debate in committee on th june <e> <s> your lordships may recall the noble baroness lady stedman asked my noble friend lord glenarthur how a house would be treated under the new system if part of it was used on a casual basis to provide bed and breakfast accommodation to holidaymakers <e> <s> my noble friend replied quite correctly of course that bed and breakfast accommodation should be subject to non-domestic rating <e> <s> this led to what i think i might fairly describe as a minor storm of protest from among others the noble lord lord mcintosh and my noble friend lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> they made the point rather forcefully that it makes no sense to attempt to rate domestic property which is used on a very casual basis for a non-domestic purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of newport for raising this matter again <e> <s> notwithstanding the fact that we discussed it in committee i think that it is right and proper that it should be raised again because it is undoubtedly a matter

in the day <e> <s> however better late than never <e> <s> it shows that we continue to listen through to the end of the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may say what a delight it is to have my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter back on our side <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord lord underhill the assurance that he is seeking in that the revenue to be raised will not be less than is currently available to such bodies <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord highlights a valid point namely in dealing with private acts there are difficulties which must be taken into account <e> <s> these were by no means last-minute thoughts they were problems which we knew had to be resolved <e> <s> however we were so busy arranging concessions to the noble lords and other members of your lordships house that it has taken rather longer than we had hoped to reach this point <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has explained these amendments would change the basis of payment of revenue support grant and make it payable direct to the districts counties <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have heard these amendments seek to require the secretary of state to include additional information in the revenue support grant report for each year <e> <s> the first concerns the matters to which he has regard in determining the amount to be paid to authorities and the second concerns the estimate to be taken into account when calculating the amount of non-domestic rate available for distribution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey seeks to have extra information included in the distribution report <e> <s> as the name implies the distribution report is intended to set out the basis on which grant is to be distributed <e> <s> we do not intend to make a new distribution

amendments of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale seek to ensure that disabled people on low incomes receive in all cases full compensation for their community charge by ensuring that any gap between their income support and the charge they have to pay is filled by a special supplement <e> <s> i have listened with great care to the noble lord and those noble lords who have risen to support

power exists for the purpose in question <e> <s> the amendments do not make provision for the future of parish councils section spending and in that sense they are defective <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey on putting down an amendment that is nearly the ideal opposition amendment <e> <s> the amendments have a superficial air of reasonableness while adding further unnecessary and i believe undesirable procedures into the charge capping processes contained in part viii <e> <s> as i said in committee capping is an essential safeguard for charge payers <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord stodart of leaston explained in graphic terms how it has come into play in parts of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is a direct descendant of

authorities as provided for in the bill so that instead of there being one such authority the city of london there would be two the city of london and the city of westminster <e> <s> my noble friend

number of queries <e> <s> i am saddened by what some of your lordships have said in agreeing that we face a problem but do not seem to think that the private sector has any part to play in trying to solve that problem <e> <s> i believe that some of that is due to political dogma <e> <s> on the other hand i believe that some is due to misunderstandings of the bill which i hope will be sorted out

is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point that we shall be looking at in detail in committee <e> <s> as i understand it there could be a negative value on the properties <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said there are three sets of amendments within this group <e> <s> one is concerned with data protection one with social services records and one with arrangements for omitting names from the public extract from the register <e> <s> it maybe helpful to your lordships if i respond in turn to each of the three sets of amendments just as the noble

practice the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey will get precisely what he wants <e> <s> guidance will be issued by the secretary of state and i have absolutely no doubt that it will be borne in mind by all registration officers and charging <e>", "<cs> my lords to be absolutely clear i should say that we are only talking in these amendments about names and addresses <e>", "<cs> my lords at earlier stages of the bill the noble lord lord morton of shuna has criticised the drafting of clause <e> <s> at report stage he put down some drafting amendments but then withdrew them <e> <s> on this occasion he has adopted a much more radical approach and sought to redraft the whole of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another occasion on which the noble lord lord morton is seeking to write into the bill amendments concerning matters on which i have previously given assurances to your lordships house <e> <s> i do not entirely blame him for that but do believe it is unnecessary and indeed that legislation would become even longer and more cumbersome if we attempted to write in provisos of this sort at every turn <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe it might be for the convenience of all your lordships if i stated the governments position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton for allowing me to speak now <e> <s> although there is no government amendment i believe it would be helpful as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey indicated for me to put the governments position clearly to your lordships <e> <s> i believe that it would help the discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i can reply to this most useful debate <e> <s> my mind goes back to lord avon summing up the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> he stood at the dispatch box and said that he wished he had wing mirrors in order to see his back-benchers more clearly <e> <s> i was one of the back-benchers i now know how truly he meant

blatch and lady carnegy of lour saying that the government have gone too far that the government have been very generous and that that it is enough <e>", "<cs> my lords the words are necessary because if they were to be deleted it would narrow quite considerably the scope of relief <e> <s> i know that is something my noble friend does not wish to do <e> <s> i am advised that many charities have no legal personality of their own and any property they occupy is vested in the trustees <e> <s> it is important that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is much between the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and the government on this issue <e> <s> at report stage the noble lord moved an amendment which would have required each applicant for this exemption to go before a formal panel of adjudicators who would have determined whether or not he was severely mentally impaired <e> <s> my objection to that proposal was that <e> <s> however good the intentions it would involve an over-formal <e> <s> over-bureaucratic procedure which would be costly to administer and worse than that could actually deter some people from applying for an exemption to which they are entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble lords lord monson and lord graham of edmonton have collaborated to produce an amendment which in their view overcomes the defects of the amendments discussed at earlier stages <e> <s> i have to say however that that view is not shared by the government <e> <s> indeed i fear that this amendment is worse than its predecessors <e>", "<cs> my lords when i moved the exemption for care workers at report stage i was asked whether the government intended to use an age criterion as part of the definition <e> <s> i said that we had not yet decided <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh mentioned on report a rumour that there would be an age restriction and that the exemption would be limited to those aged to <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is very similar to the one which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones tabled at report stage and withdrew before the debate took place <e> <s> it would have been helpful had we discussed these issues at report stage when we considered all the amendments about methods of enforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i was pointing out that there is a heavy cost involved in a probation order <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness will wish to take that into account <e> <s> more importantly the proposal would divert the probation service from its work with offenders who may risk custody for several months or longer for various criminal offences <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments in this group are similar to amendments we discussed at report stage <e> <s> at that time i said that i would have to run for legal advice <e> <s> i have done so and i have to tell your lordships that on the best possible advice available to me the government cannot accept the amendments proposed by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords on th may when the bill had its second reading in your lordships house i said that its central objective was the enhancement of accountability of councils to their electors <e> <s> i commended it to your lordships as the best alternative to the unfair and increasingly unworkable present system of local government finance <e> <s> i believe that the central objective of the bill has stood up to the closest possible scrutiny during its passage through this house and that it has won the support of many of your lordships in the process <e>", "<cs> my lords i was delighted to give way to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank all noble lords for the kind words said to me <e> <s> those words apply of course to my whole team my advisers and my officials <e>", "<cs> my lords not all landfill sites are suitable for the disposal of such waste and those which are are unevenly

special waste was between and tonnes and non-special waste was down to about to tonnes <e> <s> our figures arc not complete at this stage <e> <s> however on those figures there has been a reduction since <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his question but i believe that it represents a misapprehension <e> <s> it is up to the waste disposal authorities which are by law the bodies responsible for the disposal of waste to check waste which is deposited in landfill sites under the control of pollution act <e> <s> her majestys inspectorate of pollution acts as auditor to the waste disposal authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords if landfill projects are carried out in a proper manner as we believe they are in this country it is environmentally safe and beneficial for that process to be continued <e> <s> however we shall continue to watch the matter carefully <e> <s> if there is evidence that the methods which we are using need to be altered we shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords waste disposal authorities have responsibility for monitoring wastes <e> <s> i have received this week a further report from her majestys inspectorate concerning the incident to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> we shall take action on that matter if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords we intend shortly to introduce regulations on the trans-frontier shipment of hazardous waste <e> <s> i apologise for the fact that they have not been put before parliament sooner <e> <s> as regards labelling of canisters we are discussing that matter with other government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is not much difference between the standards <e> <s> the methods of disposal used in america may be slightly different <e> <s> the noble lord asked a previous question concerning importation of hazardous waste from america <e> <s> i am now able to update my answer <e> <s> as i understand it my information is sketchy at this stage as i received it only this morning the application for the site in cheshire has been withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords if there are seepages it causes a great deal of worry to all of us <e> <s> that is why we take the matter seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords the result depends on how a site is filled and the geological structure of the land <e> <s> as the house will be aware landfill sites in the netherlands are particularly difficult to use because of the high water table <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carter raised a very important point <e> <s> if waste is to be imported it is first up to the waste disposal authority to decide whether or not it wants to import that waste <e> <s> it is then up to maff to ensure that the waste is up to the standards that we require and that no plant or animal produce is imported illegally <e> <s> final regulatory powers are available to the secretary of state for the environment under the control of pollution act <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we keep not only the numbers of staff but also the finance available to her majestys inspectorate of pollution carefully under review <e> <s> as your lordships will have seen from the reports they have produced they are up to a very high standard <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> there is a need for that legislation <e> <s> we have announced the terms of the legislation but unfortunately i cannot give him a date as to when we shall be able to introduce it <e>", "<cs> my lords i note with considerable interest the emphasis that the noble lord is putting on consultation with tenants rather than necessarily with the local authorities <e> <s> i hope that we all bear that in mind in the housing bill <e> <s> but of course there will be consultation with the tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there was indeed very wide consultation with all those who would he affected the local authority and the tenants by the development corporation <e> <s> this is an example where co-operation will be to the benefit of the tenants and indeed to all the community because in addition there is a million social project <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know at the moment there are heads of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage it is not a matter for the government <e> <s> it is a matter for the london docklands development corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told that it is near <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble kinswoman is absolutely right in saying that one should retain the community spirit <e> <s> i believe that moving the tenants into better accommodation will seek only to reinforce that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the replacement housing will be determined by tenant preference <e> <s> tenants being displaced will be offered a choice of two new or refurbished housing association units <e> <s> where the tenants decline those offers the london borough of tower hamlets will rehouse them in existing council stock <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seeks to enlarge the question quite considerably but <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord lord dean has said <e> <s> it is important <e> <s> but it is up to the london docklands development corporation rather than the government at this stage <e> <s> however i am sure that everyone wants the scheme to proceed as quickly as possible for the right reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not know the totally correct answer to that question <e> <s> i think that i know what the answer ought to he hut as i am not entirely sure it would be wrong for me to respond to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper

know that my noble friend will wish to support me in keeping alive the private sector rented market <e> <s> the starts and completions in the private sector in were the highest since over starts and completions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham is wrong <e> <s> house completions in were more than those in <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason that there is a restriction on the amount that local authorities can spend has been covered many times in your lordships house <e> <s> as it is part of public expenditure it needs to be taken into account by the chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> since april in england over million renovation and improvement grants have been paid to private owners and tenants <e> <s> in addition <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is a little wide of the question on the order paper but i know that much of the ground the noble lord has mentioned will be covered in our housing debates <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i believe i can <e> <s> there are empty dwellings <e>", "<cs> my lords there is the great debate that although we want more housing and there is a demand for more housing as the noble lord will know there is also a very strong demand to keep the green belt intact and perhaps that is just as relevant to house prices <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong for me to hypothecate on what housing prices might have done had there been more or less houses around <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot answer my noble friend <e> <s> the opposition always seems to criticise us <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure how to respond to this debate because it was not quite in the form that i thought this morning or at oclock at lunchtime at oclock or now even that it would be <e> <s> i started off this morning believing that we would debate amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord mcintosh is absolutely entitled to bring forward any other amendments in his name to be discussed together with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that is what he has done and he has a right to do so <e> <s> those are the rules under which the committee operates <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that the noble lord may have misheard me <e> <s> i was indeed referring to rachman and landlords who under the existing rent acts and other acts that affect housing did some things which i suggest they would not have <e>", "<cs> mr rachman was buying property at market value <e> <s> it was property that was subject to tenancy and therefore had a low market value and he was harassing tenants and evicting them from that property in order to sell it <e> <s> had the provisions of the present bill been in existence and if civil damages could have been taken against him i put to the committee that he might not have done some of the things he did <e> <s> quite apart from the anti-harassment measures that i have mentioned i think it highly unlikely that the deregulation provisions of this bill will increase harassment and illegal eviction <e> <s> landlords who try to get rid of their tenants illegally usually do so because they want to have vacant possession in order to sell the property and not because they want to re-let it <e> <s> as my noble friend lord coleraine has just reminded the committee the incentive to harassment is already there <e> <s> this bill will not increase it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stallard merely confirms the potential for harassment and eviction of tenants that exists under the present legislation because of the wide discrepancy between artificially low rents and the resulting capital value of the dwelling against vacant possession value of the dwelling <e> <s> i put it to the committee that if a landlord under the new assurred tenancy provision can let for a market rent which gives him a rate of return at least some properties which are at the moment empty may come back into the rented sector <e> <s> surely that is something to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> where a landlord has granted a fixed term assured tenancy whether or not it is an assured shorthold tenancy within the meaning of clause the circumstances in which he can recover possession of the dwelling before the end of the fixed term are limited by clause of the bill <e> <s> this allows the court to grant possession only on certain of the grounds in schedule and then only if the terms of the tenancy make provision for it to be brought to an end on the ground in question <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> reflects the view of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey that there should be a powerful incentive if not an outright compulsion to obtain a determination of rent for a shorthold tenancy <e> <s> this brings us once again to an issue on which there is a clear divergence across the chamber namely the merits of statutory regulation of private lettings as against the right of landlord and tenant to negotiate terms between themselves <e>", "<cs> as drafted amendment no <e> <s> would give the landlord or tenant or both acting jointly under a shorthold tenancy the right to apply at any time to the rent assessment committee for the registration of a rent <e> <s> there is no specific provision as to the basis on which the rent assessment committee would determine the rent but we can infer from the reference at the end of subsection that it would be a market rent <e> <s> the bill as it stands provides a mechanism under which the rent assessment committee can determine the rent payable under a shorthold tenancy but it is considerably more restricted in scope than that envisaged in this amendment and quite deliberately so <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that will be a consideration which will be taken into account <e> <s> however the committees will also take into account the level of the rents because as i have explained there has to be evidence of rents at a different level from that agreed <e> <s> i am sure that the rent assessment committees will be looking at the level of those rents as well <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal and my noble friend raised a very important point as regards the question of separated and non-tenant spouses <e> <s> we shall be dealing more extensively with that as my noble friend has reminded the committee when considering amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should hate to steal the thunder of what my noble friend lord hesketh will tell the committee when he comes to speak about that amendment <e> <s> at this stage i say to the noble baroness that the non-tenant spouse might be unaware of a rent increase affecting her but if there was a divorce and subsequently a maintenance order made the increase would be reflected in the maintenance payment <e> <s> the question of who should have the tenancy in the event of a divorce is as my noble friend knows settled by the court and at that time it takes the position of the children very much into account <e>", "<cs> i shall look at the point raised by the noble baroness if it is not covered in due course by my noble friend lord hesketh <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what he intends with this amendment i ask him how he can say that on the one hand there will be no more properties let in london in the next three years as the result of this bill yet on the other hand he says that all this bill will do is enable landlords to charge more rent <e> <s> we are not affecting existing tenancies <e>", "<cs> as the right reverend prelate knows under the present acts it is extremely difficult to hasten the end of existing tenancies <e> <s> one of the results of this has been harassment <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate will recall from our earlier discussions we are strengthening protection in that respect under clause <e> <s> that is a significant improvement <e> <s> as to taking away with one hand i should say that the government are giving with one hand and giving with the other <e> <s> the government are seeking to increase the availability of rented property <e> <s> we have said that we want this to be at market rent <e> <s> we have said that housing benefit for those who require it will need to meet that market rent <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend lord trafford is right <e> <s> we have wandered far and wide from the amendment before us <e> <s> indeed we have almost gone through the second reading again <e> <s> therefore i think that as there are one or two other amendments which we should like to discuss this evening perhaps we ought to concentrate on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord dean of beswick and let him decide what he wishes to do with it <e>", "<cs> under this bill landlords letting accommodation in their own homes are treated differently from non-resident landlords <e> <s> provided that the conditions in paragraph of schedule i are met a letting will not be an assured tenancy under part i future lettings by resident landlords will not be subject to any special statutory regime <e> <s> these landlords will be able to agree rents with their tenants without statutory intervention and the security which tenants have will be a matter of contract <e> <s> we all i think would want to encourage people to let spare accommodation in their homes and it is simply not appropriate that they should be subject to the sort of legal controls necessary for nonresident landlords <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me some questions <e> <s> perhaps i could write to him between now and another stage with the details <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw the attention of the noble lord lord monson to one of the government publications which i am sure he has read <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> thank you <e>", "<cs> it is clear from our discussion that the amendment of the noble lord lord monson does not achieve the purpose which he stated at the outset of protecting the tenants occupancy of the house and garden <e> <s> the noble lords amendment removes protection not only from the contiguous land but also from the dwelling <e>", "<cs> i understand the views of the noble earl lord lytton who has advocated the removal of all statutory controls over private lettings leaving both the rent and the tenants security as matters of contract <e>", "<cs> i retract that statement and i apologise to the noble earl <e> <s> the point is that the noble earl wished to go very much further than the government have gone and we have gone very much further than the noble lord lord mcintosh has gone or would like us to go <e> <s> so perhaps we have struck the middle road which can only be to the benefit of the landlord and the tenant <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and would make it a requirement of ground that both conditions in it should be fulfilled before the ground could be used <e> <s> that is to say a landlord who wanted to recover a property under this ground for himself or his wife to live in would have to live in the property first and would have to live in it or his wife would have to live in it after possession had been recovered <e> <s> but there arc many cases of people who buy property while they are working or living somewhere else people in tied accommodation who want to have somewhere of their own to retire to schoolmasters members of the armed forces many others <e> <s> in many cases it is simply not practicable for them to live in the property before they let it out <e> <s> we want to encourage people to make available for rent homes which they cannot actually live in themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that we are speaking to amendment no <e> <s> and to the two consequential amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i remember sitting on those benches opposite not in the hallowed place at the dispatch box where the noble lord opposite is standing and thinking that the labour party had a <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend knows we are happy to consider anything which is put to us <e> <s> i should like to consider that point <e> <s> however if a landlord applies for a mortgage or a bank loan on property which is subject to a tenancy at the time it will doubtless be a far smaller mortgage than if the property were in vacant possession <e>", "<cs> i shall take first amendment no <e> <s> and the consequential amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the issue whether suitable alternative accommodation should be provided by a landlord wishing to use this ground was as the committee knows discussed in committee in another place <e> <s> this ground is for people who wish to develop property <e> <s> it is based on the well-known and well-tried similar gound in the landlord and tenant act <e> <s> it is already tightly drawn so that it cannot be used where the landlord purchases the property with sitting tenants or where he can do the development work around the tenant without actually displacing him <e> <s> we do not want to circumscribe it so tightly that it can never be used at all and that is what would happen if the landlord were obliged to find suitable alternative accommodation for the tenant every time he wished to redevelop <e> <s> it would make largescale development impossible <e> <s> i know that the noble earl lord lytton will be the first to appreciate that developers of necessity have to operate to tight timescales and they cannot afford the sorts of complication and delays that would be entailed if we were to accept these amendments <e> <s> there is in any event a discretionary ground for possession where the landlord is able to provide suitable alternative accommodation and if he can offer it he does not need to use this ground <e>", "<cs> i am always happy to discuss with the noble lord anything that would be an improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> the private landlord rents out property and he is encouraged to do so on a commercial basis <e> <s> he does it for profit and we believe there is nothing dishonourable in that <e> <s> if the activity is unprofitable he cannot be expected to continue with it and that would be to the detriment of tenants <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look again at the situation that the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> but i think i am right in saying that as regards the cases he mentioned housing benefit was not available <e> <s> therefore a lot of the problems to which the noble lord referred will now be accounted for as it is to be hoped after a short interim period which has been pretty detrimental more efficient and reasonable local authorities are now back in power who will try to keep within the statutory limit of days <e>", "<cs> offhand i cannot tell my noble friend the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall look <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord monson for having moved the amendment because it gives me the opportunity to say to my noble friend lord swinfen that the social fund is not available for housing purposes <e> <s> housing benefit is available for housing costs so the tenant could not obtain an emergency payment from that particular fund <e>", "<cs> of course i should like to look into the point raised by my noble friend but although local authorities cannot make payments to tenants from the social fund they can make interim payments of benefit where they are not yet in possession of all the information necessary to make the regular housing benefit payments <e> <s> it is in the local authoritys interest to make such payments because otherwise it could be faced with a homeless person to house <e>", "<cs> one of the basic principles of the new regime is that once a tenant has been <e>", "<cs> clause provides that a landlord who has let a dwelling as an assured shorthold tenancy has a mandatory right to possession when the fixed term comes to an end or during any statutory periodic tenancy which follows it <e> <s> in order to exercise this right he must give the tenant two months notice that he requires possession <e> <s> as the noble lord lord monson has just explained he would prefer that period to be reduced to one month <e>", "<cs> as the bill is drafted a landlord wishing to obtain possession of a dwelling let on a shorthold tenancy is required to give the tenant at least two months notice to the effect that possession is required <e> <s> there is no restriction as to the actual point at which the landlord must serve the notice <e> <s> thus a landlord granting a shorthold and knowing that he will require possession as soon as the fixed term comes to an end may choose to serve notice on the tenant at the very outset of the tenancy <e> <s> that will please the noble lord lord monson who alas is not in his place because then the tenant would know for certain when the term was coming to an end <e>", "<cs> i am well aware that the issue of premiums sometimes described as both noble lords have said as key money has in the past been an emotive one <e> <s> nonetheless i hope that i can <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides finally i think that it would be appropriate if i were to reply to some of the points which have been raised <e> <s> i should like to stress to my noble friend lady macleod of borve that housing associations can at present charge premiums for tenancies and that some do <e> <s> premiums can be charged under the agriculture miscellaneous provisions act of <e>", "<cs> i think that that goes to prove my point that although some landlords in scotland might have been trying to charge a premium they would not have been doing so legally <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might just correct that statement <e> <s> i said that there was no evidence of complaint in the eight years during which premiums were permitted as a result of the old style assured tenancy <e>", "<cs> i should like to start our debate on chapter iv of part i of the bill dealing with protection from eviction by stressing once again that the government are unequivocally opposed to harassment and illegal eviction by landlords <e> <s> we are determined to see that the law deals effectively with <e>", "<cs> the clause provides that where a tenant is eligible for damages in respect of a liability other than the loss of his right to the accommodation he may claim separate damages for the liability <e> <s> however he may not claim damages for the loss of his right both under this clause and under other provisions <e> <s> he cannot obtain damages for the same loss twice but he may obtain damages for different reasons <e> <s> that clarifies a point to which the noble lord lord meston alluded when he said that a tenant may receive more than one set of damages for the same item <e>", "<cs> to begin with i did not think that i liked this amendment very much <e> <s> however i thought that the noble lord had a good point in his argument <e> <s> it is something which i should like to look at <e> <s> i do not see why a landlord should necessarily suffer a claim for damages if there has been a reconciliation during the period of the court hearing and the tenant is back in the accommodation <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to look at it between now and another stage and meanwhile talk to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the phrase <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord renton has just said we on this side of the committee share the abhorrence of members opposite for racial or sexual discrimination and for criminal behaviour with a racial or sexual motive <e> <s> however i am afraid that we believe that this does not justify awarding aggravated damages automatically where racial or sexual harassment was involved in a case which has resulted in damages being awarded under clause <e> <s> i repeat what was said in another place that deplorable though racial and sexual harassment are they are not necessarily worse than other forms of behaviour such as ill-treatment of the elderly or the disabled <e>", "<cs> support from that quarter of the committee is always welcome <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of newport was active earlier in the bill and the noble earl lord russell is no less welcome in joining our considerations <e>", "<cs> indeed i should like the opportunity to intervene just to continue the answer to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes <e>", "<cs> well here i am with the answer <e> <s> the advice that we have been given to authorities is that they should not insist on a court order before rehousing a tenant who has to leave and is in priority need and that will continue to be our advice <e> <s> but if my noble friend would care to listen to what i have to say in more detail on amendment no <e> <s> of the noble lord lord mcintosh which deals specifically with hostels perhaps we may go into that point again <e>", "<cs> as the committee is aware sham holiday lets are essentially a device to evade the rent and security regime of the rent act <e> <s> with the new shorthold tenancy we are offering landlords a method of using short lets at market rents which gives them a guaranteed right of possession <e> <s> this has to be attractive to the landlord whose main aim in setting up sham holiday lets is to set market rents for his property <e> <s> the landlord who sees the attraction of sham holiday lets as being the power to evict without a court order is running a serious risk <e> <s> if he uses a sham holiday let rather than shorthold he runs the risk that if the tenancy is examined in court he will be found to have created a full assured tenancy <e>", "<cs> under the existing law it is not necessary to obtain a court order to evict a licensee whose contract has ended <e> <s> that seems to the government to be anomalous and in clause we have extended the requirement in the protection from eviction act to obtain a court order so that it covers most residential occupiers <e> <s> moreover in clause we have extended the notice to quit provisions of section of the protection from eviction act <e> <s> there must however be some exceptions and those are set out in clause <e> <s> they include licensees whose agreements have expired living in hostels provided by the bodies listed in subsection <e>", "<cs> we believe that it would be wrong to require every local housing authority to appoint such an officer as this new clause proposes <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord renton on that <e> <s> perhaps i may tell the committee that we intend to write to all local authorities drawing their attention to their duties under the protection from eviction act and the remedies available to them where serious harassment is taking placewe shall point out to them <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and together raise the issue of how far we can reasonably expect to go in safeguarding the position of those who at present have protection under the rent act <e> <s> it is as the committee is aware a basic principle of our approach that existing rent act tenants should remain unaffected by the new proposals <e> <s> thus anyone who has a rent act tenancy when the bill becomes law will retain his existing rights in terms of both rent and security for as long as the tenancy continues <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that the noble lord has hit on a good point here <e> <s> we accept the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> if he will withdraw it at this stage we can deal with the point at a later stage <e>", "<cs> the theme behind these amendments is that succession to a rent act tenancy is a right and that any qualifying member should be able to accede to one on rent act terms after a short qualifying period as set out in the rent act <e> <s> it is indeed entirely reasonable that the surviving partner of a couple should take on the tenancy on the same terms enjoyed by his or her spouse <e> <s> many rent act tenants are elderly couples who have passed a large part of their married lives assuming that when one of them dies the other will be able to take over the tenancy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady faithfull for the manner in which she introduced the amendment <e> <s> she is quite right to say that i wrote to her on th july and met many of the points covered in the amendment <e> <s> i draw attention to amendments nos <e> <s> and in my name in which i cover most of the points raised in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i therefore hope that my noble friend may feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> copies of the consultation document have been sent to every local authority in england and to organisations and individuals interested in multiple occupation problems <e> <s> copies have also been placed in the library and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales will be consulting separately the welsh local authorities and those interested in wales <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord is also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would give all rental purchasers who entered into agreements after this bill the status of tenants under this bill with all that that implies <e> <s> but practically a rental purchaser is not an assured tenant <e> <s> he is someone purchasing his property in instalments whose rights and obligations under his contract to purchase are different from those of a tenant under a lease <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would not help him very much <e> <s> a rental purchaser enters into a fixed term contract with the vendor of the property he is purchasing <e> <s> therefore he will not have the right to go to the rent assessment committee for it to consider the sum that he is paying for his property until the end of the fixed term by which time he will own the property and it is already necessary to go to court to evict a rental purchaser so he has some security <e>", "<cs> this amendment deals with a very complicated issue which has preoccupied distinguished legal minds for many years <e> <s> the judgment in the case of <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord not speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> to and to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> these amendments deal with a subject which is only tangentially related to the subject matter of the bill but is one about which the government are concerned <e> <s> much research including some by my department has been done into houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> it has revealed that the conditions in many of them are poor <e> <s> the department appointed an environmental health adviser who has been visiting local authorities all over the country finding out about their problems <e> <s> his visits have confirmed the research findings and also confirmed the governments view about local authorities powers to deal with houses in multiple occupation <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree that it is important for tenants to know who is their landlord and how he can be contacted <e> <s> those points were forcefully made in the analysis of the nugee committee whose report on the management of privately owned blocks of flats provided a basis for the landlord and tenant act <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh has used most of the answers that i was going to give him <e> <s> he looks at it from one side and i look at it from the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment numbered to which the commons have disagreed for their reason numbered <e> <s> with the leave of the house i should also like to speak to amendments numbered and a which all relate to the same subject <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the intervention of the noble baroness lady seear has led to a most interesting debate on the constitution <e> <s> i think that it would be wrong for me to prolong that debate but with your lordships permission perhaps i may say a few words on the matter <e> <s> i should like to take noble lords back to amendments nos <e> <s> and which we are now discussing as well as to amendments nos <e> <s> and a <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have covered the point that the noble lord raised <e> <s> before i close perhaps i may pick up a point that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord said and i stand to

the house i should also like to speak to the amendments and reasons numbered a b a and b which are all related to the same point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> i apologise for the spelling mistake in amendment numbered <e> <s> of course this should read these and amendment should read amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful to your lordships if i deal briefly with some of the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is true then of course i fully accept it and retract what i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> to lords amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendment made by another place simply corrects a missed consequential by deleting a reference to special designated premises <e> <s> that reference was included by amendment on report in your lordships house when it was proposed in certain cases that the collective community charge and collective community charge contributions should be automatically reduced to give the effect of full rebates for all residents in specially designated collective community charge premises <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i was grateful for some of the things that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just about to say <e> <s> the consultation exercise that we have gone through was one of the things and he said that there had been improvements as indeed i said when i opened this debate and at least the noble lord was courteous <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hate the noble lord to class me as being pompous <e> <s> i was merely saying that he had dropped below his normal standards <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we are naturally advised on the health aspects by the dhss <e> <s> the environmental health officers have not recommended us to close any beaches <e> <s> so my lords i wish you good bathing <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> the short sea outfalls to which he refers have not proved satisactory <e> <s> that is why the recommended solution which is approved environmentally is the long sea outfall <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord is looking forward to debating that bill as much as i am <e> <s> doubtless we shall be looking at those clauses in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is well versed in these matters <e> <s> however i can assure her that from an environmental point of view the sea is the most useful agent when a properly constructed long sea outfall is used <e> <s> that is the environmentally beneficial way of dealing with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> i know that the water authorities have been at great pains to make sure that any industrial effluent is taken care of before it reaches that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords a moment ago the noble and learned lords noble friend the noble baroness lady nicol raised a question relating to the greenhouse effect which might alter the temperature of the seawater in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows i listen to all the arguments before i decide what to do with each amendment <e> <s> i look forward to discussing amendment no <e> <s> ab with him in due course <e>", "<cs> we are discussing amendments nos <e> <s> ab and c but many of my remarks in response to our most useful and interesting debate will cover amendment no <e> <s> which i have no doubt the noble lord lord stallard will move shortly <e>", "<cs> because the part to which i referred is all on one page in the six different languages so that only one sheet of paper was needed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry about that <e> <s> the last sentence of the letter says <e>", "<cs> i want to write down exactly what the noble lord said as i shall return to that matter later <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord reads the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying that <e> <s> we will look at the <e>", "<cs> indeed it is <e>", "<cs> i am concerned to hear what the noble baroness said <e> <s> i should like to discuss that with her <e> <s> attached to the copy of the letter in my possession is something different <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord clarify that <e> <s> i thought that when he read out the petition it concerned only the voting structure in part iv of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to what the noble lord lord dean of beswick and the noble lord lord ross of newport have said about how hats should work alongside local authorities in helping to deal with the homeless <e> <s> a very similar debate took place in another place where we responded to opposition concerns by bringing forward clause <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> b and a now seek to impose a further statutory requirement on hats which we do not believe to be necessary <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble baroness received the letter <e> <s> there was nothing between us <e> <s> i never said that the letter was in any language other than english <e> <s> i was referring to the form attached to it <e>", "<cs> i shall deal with that last point first <e> <s> i should need to look into the details but as my noble friend is aware we are talking about a very small percentage of the housing stock of a local authority in whose area there might be a hat <e> <s> from the very definition of hat and the type of property that the hat is designed to try to look after or improve for the benefit of the tenants i know that my noble friend as a valuer will soon spot that that will not be the highest valuation of local authority property <e>", "<cs> clearly the noble lord has raised an important issue <e> <s> as he knows this is a very new policy area for me and i should like to look at it <e> <s> as the noble lord also knows the amount that local authorities will be given will be considered <e> <s> we do not know where the hats are going to be or indeed their value <e> <s> it is possible in some cases that there might be a deficit value <e> <s> that is something that i should like to look at in a little more detail <e> <s> then i shall write to the noble lord about this matter <e> <s> however we hope that they will be positive values <e>", "<cs> i was somewhat confused when i first saw this amendment so i spent some time with officials this morning trying to work out exactly what the the noble lord was driving at <e> <s> however i think i can say to him that we have got it right <e> <s> we want to be able to involve as post-hat landlords any landlord who is deemed to meet the housing corporations approval criteria which will carry with it the tenants guarantees we have already discussed whether or not they have previously been involved as tenants choice landlords <e> <s> the clause therefore allows the corporation also to approve landlords specifically for the purpose of being post-hat landlords <e>", "<cs> i think that we are seeking to achieve the same object <e> <s> as i understand it that is how one interprets the bill <e> <s> obviously i should like to look at the legal point raised by the noble lord between now and another stage but nevertheless i think we are on common ground <e>", "<cs> i am slightly confused <e> <s> i thought that amendment no <e> <s> a had already been spoken to when amendment no <e> <s> b was dealt with and that it had already been answered <e>", "<cs> that is the amendment that i thought the noble lord was speaking to but the deputy chairman of committees called amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> we have already made it clear that we want to see hats offering tenants a wide range of options and have strengthened the provisions for consultation with them on disposals <e> <s> when the housing action trust has finished its improvment work it will offer its tenants a new landlord <e> <s> this could be a housing association a tenants co-operative or a private landlord <e> <s> if they wish and the council agrees the council may again become their landlord <e> <s> apart from transfers back to local authorities hats will be able to transfer secure tenants and their properties only to landlords approved by the housing corporation <e> <s> all the options will be fully discussed with tenants before any decisions are made <e>", "<cs> hats will be short-life bodies charged with carrying out a programme of improvement and repair <e> <s> once they have completed this work they will be wound up <e> <s> it is in the tenants own long-term interests that hats be wound up as soon as their job is done <e> <s> it therefore cannot be right to give tenants a right to frustrate this objective by being able to veto all disposal options put before them <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord dean of beswick spoke about the finance given to local authorites he omitted to say that for the third year running gross capital resources made available to local authorities have been increased <e> <s> this year the figure stands at over billion <e> <s> within that amount million is being provided for housing action estates almost double last years figure <e> <s> we are making an extra million available for hats over the next three years <e> <s> i believe that that is further evidence of our desire to provide resources to deal with run-down local authority housing <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer the noble lord as regards bids and what was received in the past few years <e> <s> i have not been able to look at those papers yet <e> <s> doubtless they will be passed to me while the noble lord is sunning himself in some foreign emerald isle <e> <s> i hope that he will spare a thought for those of us at the doe who are beavering away <e>", "<cs> i can understand why the noble lord is concerned that the provision that this amendment seeks to remove places a difficult duty on officers of a local authority <e> <s> we would not seek to require them to comply with this duty lightly <e> <s> but the important issue as i know the noble lord lord mcintosh is aware is the needs of the tenants on the estates that we have proposed for designation <e> <s> we want to do the best we can to make hats work effectively for the benefit of their tenants and that is the reason for this provision <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i should like to make a general comment to the committee <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what all noble lords have said during our debates on the housing bill and particularly their remarks on housing action trusts <e> <s> i shall be spending quite a lot of time during the recess understanding the way in which we propose that housing action trusts should work and indeed meeting some of those involved <e> <s> we want housing action trusts to work and i shall be looking for a positive response from local authorities and those tenants who may become members of housing action trusts <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that i shall be taking extremely seriously the duties of this very important area of housing in which i am now privileged to be actively involved <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be for the local planning authority of the london borough of lambeth to consider in the first instance any application that is made for a change of use or for listed building status <e> <s> i know that your lordships will appreciate that it would be wrong for me to attempt to anticipate that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will know not all of the county hall complex is listed <e> <s> certainly the riverside block is grade ii star <e> <s> any alteration to that block will therefore need listed building consent <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware there will be the usual planning procedures to go through when representations can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong for me to comment specifically on the point of hotel use for county hall <e>", "<cs> my lords the london residuary body has statutory duties <e> <s> there are no grounds upon which the government should interfere with them <e>", "<cs> my lords the sale at the moment is still subject to contract <e> <s> i do not know in full detail what the prospective purchasers will submit in the way of a planning application if any <e> <s> we shall have to wait and it will be up to the london borough of lambeth to decide the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords doubtless westminster city council will be receiving a planning application from the noble lord in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the present situation i know that the noble lord would think it wrong for me to go any further than i have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a slightly different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i reject the charge that my right honourable friend is a vandal <e> <s> i think that is totally wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord has said to be correct <e>", "<cs> it would be helpful if i prefaced my response to this our first debate in committee on part iv of the bill with some general remarks about the general objections to what has become known colloquially as tenants choice <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> this is the point that has perhaps not been understood <e> <s> the electoral reform society will be paid by the applicant to record the votes <e> <s> there will be a period over which the voting takes place <e> <s> if the tenants in a particular flat or house or the tenants in that area have not voted it will be for the electoral reform society to go to those tenants and say you have the opportunity to vote and would you like to vote <e> <s> it will be up to the applicant and the landlord to put before the tenant the choices available to him <e>", "<cs> if i can help the noble lord further i shall try <e> <s> the point is that the independent tellers i quoted the example of the electoral reform society will be independent of the applicant or the landlord <e> <s> their duty will be to collect and record the votes in an independent way <e> <s> they will also have the opportunity to go to tenants because it is phased over a period of time to say you realise a vote is going on and this is your opportunity to vote <e> <s> that is why it is a different process from what i believe the noble lord thought before i had a chance to explain it to him <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the electoral reform society has agreed to it and whether or not it is against the noble lords best judgment that is the situation <e> <s> we believe that is the fairest way and that is why we believe that this phased voting system with that ability gives every tenant the opportunity <e>", "<cs> i thoroughly agree with the noble baroness that it is absolutely vital that both sides put their case <e> <s> all i was saying about the independent tellers was that they have the opportunity to go back to someone who has not voted and say there is a vote going on and now is your chance to vote <e> <s> it is not up to them to put the case for the applicant or the landlord <e> <s> i very much hope that some of the tenants that the noble baroness spoke about will get together and form tenants cooperatives and become suitable proposed landlords for the housing corporations <e>", "<cs> yes it will be paid <e> <s> the applicant will be responsible for the cost of the independent teller <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend who perhaps explained the position better than i the electoral reform society is not there to put views on behalf of the applicant or the landlord it is there to collect the vote and to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to vote <e> <s> surely that is right for the tenants so that they all know what is going on <e> <s> if they do not happen to be there on a particular day it does not mean that they do not have the opportunity to vote <e> <s> our proposals allow an independent teller to go back to a person and to tell the tenant that there is the opportunity to vote <e> <s> does the noble lord object to that <e>", "<cs> the contract into which the electoral reform society will enter with the applicant will be the same as the contract into which it enters with trade unions when it comes to a ballot <e>", "<cs> that is absolutely true <e> <s> a trade union pays the electoral reform society but that does not threaten the societys independence <e> <s> i cannot see why an applicant paying for the same contract should threaten its independence <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the contractual relationship will be no different from that with trade unions <e> <s> there will be an opportunity to vote over a period <e> <s> there will be every opportunity for the vote to be drawn to the tenants attention <e> <s> we do not want as the committee does not want tenants in an area that an applicant wishes to purchase from a local authority to find that there has been a ballot without their having had an opportunity to vote <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the right reverend prelate and the noble baroness who both raise important points <e> <s> although the argument of the noble baroness carried much force she ignored one vital point <e> <s> that is the great difference between what we are talking about today and for example what we discussed when the education bill was before the chamber namely that the vote is not binding on those who do not want it <e> <s> they have the opportunity to opt back <e>", "<cs> i wish the solution were as simple as that <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey knows only too well it is not so simple <e> <s> it is right that both sides should have the opportunity to put a fair case to the tenant <e> <s> as the noble lord lord callaghan said perhaps in some unfortunate cases people need to be told clearly and in simple terms what the consequences are <e> <s> that is absolutely right both sides should have an equal opportunity to do so <e> <s> however it is also right and surely the fairest solution in such a situation where one has a group of tenants one has to start with a group of tenants who wish to transfer and move out of local authority control to encourage those people but at the same time give the true democratic choice to those who do not wish to do so <e> <s> so that having given them all the information they have the right to say no i have heard what you say and i want to stay with the local authority <e> <s> that is what the bill provides <e> <s> surely that is the right way forward <e>", "<cs> perhaps on the question of precedent the noble lord would remind the committee of the voting procedures in section of the housing and planning act <e>", "<cs> i said right at the beginning that the process we had proposed was precedented <e> <s> it was precedented in the housing and planning act <e>", "<cs> i can tell the committee that we have had discussions with the electoral reform society on the practical aspects of the consultation and voting systems <e> <s> the society is content to take on the operational role that we have in mind and we welcome its co-operation and the practical advice it has given us on this matter <e>", "<cs> we shall naturally be holding discussions with the electoral reform society <e> <s> i am sure that the society will read what the members of the committee have said with interest <e> <s> we do not want the society involved in any political role as regards the applicant or the landlord <e> <s> we want <e>", "<cs> just to put the matter in perspective i mentioned the electoral reform society but i qualified that by the words independent teller <e> <s> it may be the electoral reform society but that is not necessarily the case <e> <s> i simply wished to clarify that point for the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of newport knows that i have listened very carefully to what he has said <e> <s> i look forward to the opportunity of having a discussion with him and indeed with all members of the committee in a general debate on this subject in the future <e> <s> we can then discuss housing in its broadest sense <e> <s> i disagree fundamentally with some of the assumptions of the noble lord lord ross in justifying his case <e>", "<cs> i intended to come to the question of rent in a moment <e> <s> we do not believe that the tenants choice will reduce the availability of rented accommodation to house homeless persons or others in the future <e> <s> it is a firm principle of the scheme that transferred housing should in all normal circumstances be retained for continued renting to people who need it at prices that they can afford <e> <s> perhaps that covers the point raised by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> may i just finish the quotation <e>", "<cs> as i have said it is part of the draft guidance upon which the housing corporation has consulted very widely <e> <s> it was published on rd august <e> <s> the list of organisations includes bodies such as shelter the national federation of housing associations the commission for racial equality all the local authority associations that i can recall the british property federation and national tenants associations <e> <s> so this document has been circulated widely <e>", "<cs> i should like to take legal advice upon that point <e> <s> perhaps i may just add something to what the guidance says when dealing with allocation policies <e> <s> the guidance makes clear <e>", "<cs> i thought i had a note on that point which would answer the noble lord but i cannot find it at the moment <e> <s> i promise however that i shall answer him <e>", "<cs> i bow to my noble friends greater experience on this subject <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate has made a fascinating speech <e> <s> i was particularly interested when he reminded the committee that he had come down in favour of helping the person rather than giving grants for bricks and mortar <e> <s> this is a problem with which i have been wrestling since i took over the portfolio on housing that i am lucky enough to have been given <e> <s> we appreciate the great difficulties <e> <s> where there is a shortage of housing it happens to be where it is most built up at the moment in the cities where there are perhaps no more sites available <e> <s> however i would stress to the right reverend prelate that where one is giving people tenants choice which is the link to the amendment we are considering one of the criteria that a tenants choice landlord it may well be a housing <e>", "<cs> i should like first to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> k and a <e> <s> as i understand them the amendments seek to clarify that the applicants right to acquire is limited by the right under clause for certain tenants homes to be excluded from the acquisition or leaseback to the existing landlord <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for his last intervention <e> <s> i think that that was extremely helpful and supported what i said earlier <e> <s> i am not sure that i fully understood what the noble baroness was getting at <e> <s> the regulations will be laid before parliament and will be considereed in that context <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> l would like amendment no <e> <s> t mean that tenants choice transactions could only take place at positive valuations <e> <s> i believe that is what lies behind the amendments spoken to by the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> that means it is with a payment in every case to the landlord by the applicant at completion <e>", "<cs> i totally agree with the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon that it is essential for the public to get a fair deal <e> <s> that is where the district valuer if necessary can be brought in to safeguard the interests <e> <s> i disagreed with him when he said that per cent <e> <s> of the value of any property is in the land <e> <s> i was a valuer for many years and i know that my noble friend lord swinfen is a current valuer <e> <s> i have never been able to value land and property as accurately as that and i certainly have never used that yardstick <e>", "<cs> i cannot disagree with the noble lord that in some instances it might be but as a rule of thumb no <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton struck a chord with me because i was educated by him during our debates on the criminal justice bill that bills should be written so that lay people rather than merely lawyers can understand them <e> <s> as he will be aware lawyers will be the first to unravel language into laymans terms and so defeat the object of the legislation <e>", "<cs> i was coming to the point about freehold and fee simple estate <e> <s> i was talking in general terms about the drafting of legislation <e> <s> both my noble friends lord renton and lord swinfen commented on that point <e> <s> the word freehold describes the tenure in which the land is held <e> <s> the expression fee simple describes one of the freehold estates which is capable of existing in law <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am sorry to hear that the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth is not well and i am sure that all members of the committee will wish to join me in sending her our very best wishes for a speedy recovery <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to impose two main changes to tenants choice <e> <s> first to allow disabled tenants living in special housing to <e>", "<cs> the wording is <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i gave that impression <e> <s> that is not what i meant to say <e> <s> what i meant to say and what i hope i did say was that the very anxieties that have been expressed are already taken care of by the document which the housing corporation has produced <e> <s> as i said to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway earlier this afternoon that document does not have the force of law but at any time during the consultation exercise the housing corporation can withdraw its approval of a proposed landlord if he does not meet the stringent tests that the housing corporation sets out <e> <s> moreover if that transaction has gone through it can monitor that new landlord at any time and may withdraw the approval that he has <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at the point which my noble friend has raised which is the valid point concerning not only those people who are already disabled people but those people who might become disabled people <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could offer the noble lord the opportunity to come and discuss it with me at any time <e> <s> i should be happy to do so between now and another stage <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord graham of edmonton mentioned tenants choice he invariably referred to the potential landlord as a housing association <e> <s> i was willing him to say that tenants co-operatives will also act as future landlords and to say how important that will be for tenants <e>", "<cs> i am glad that i gave the noble lord the opportunity to clarify his exact position on that matter <e> <s> i could not agree more with the basis of what the noble lord was saying which was that it was important for tenants to know in advance what their situation will be and what the future holds for them <e> <s> but i must say that we have always thought it better to give the corporation the responsibility to establish criteria drawing on its existing experience and on its recent consultation exercise <e> <s> perhaps those criteria have changed more than anything since discussions took place in another place probably since the amendments were put down as a result of the consultation that has gone on this summer on the housing corporations documents <e>", "<cs> i believe i am right in saying that when moving amendment no <e> <s> e the noble lord was also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> f <e> <s> the intention of amendment no <e> <s> e is to strengthen the sanction that revocation of approval would provide against landlords who did not meet the terms attached to their approval under part iv after they had acquired property <e> <s> conversely however i am advised that the effect would actually be to weaken this sanction <e> <s> the only ground for revocation if the amendment were accepted would be performance and service falling significantly short of the agreed criteria for approval <e> <s> this could marginally limit the corporations freedom of action on revocation in a way that would be unwelcome and i believe unhelpful to the tenants <e>", "<cs> the intention of the approval of a future landlord under tenants choice is to confirm one who will be in the long term business of renting property <e> <s> that applicant therefore has to pass very stringent tests set out by the housing corporation which i have spelt out <e> <s> the landlord will have to enter into binding tenants guarantees which will apply for as long as the tenants are there and for future tenants <e>", "<cs> the future disposal of property which i think is the point raised by my noble friend lord selkirk is of course strictly controlled <e> <s> the applicant who becomes a tenants choice landlord cannot next day suddenly dispose of the property because he will need the secretary of states approval <e> <s> the whole purpose of this measure is to provide the kind of guarantees for which my noble friend is looking <e> <s> however one can envisage a situation remote though it may be perhaps in which a housing association has run into genuine difficulties or perhaps there is a tenants co-operative which has run into difficulties <e>", "<cs> or a private owner who becomes a tenants choice landlord and runs into difficulties <e> <s> it might be that instead of renting with the secretary of states approval it is agreed that he can dispose of two or three units <e> <s> the basic point that i am trying to get across is that these properties are for renting in the future <e> <s> that is what we wish to ensure <e>", "<cs> yes i can in a moment i hope <e> <s> i shall come back to my noble friend if i may <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that he is unduly pessimistic <e> <s> one hopes <e>", "<cs> i thought the noble lord might be tempted to come in on that amendment <e> <s> he will recall that i said that the criteria and they are a burden on some landlords and rightly so will continue as long as the leases remain unaltered on transfer <e> <s> but i said that if there were the odd occasion when a tenants co-operative had run into trouble or indeed any future landlord had run into difficulties it might be a better solution not necessarily to have an approved landlord <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> for the sake of clarification is he also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b as well as amendment no <e> <s> d <e>", "<cs> my honourable friend who was my predecessor as minister for housing made it clear in another place that the housing corporation would wherever possible arrange for an informal preliminary competition between more than one alternative potential applicant where there was tenant interest in the possibility of transfer <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey used the dreaded words beauty contest which i have tried hard to avoid today <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving my amendment on my behalf <e> <s> i am delighted and i am sure that there is room on this bench for him <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised an important point which we are considering <e> <s> i sympathise with him but we are running into severe problems as regards the question of statutory definition and we are looking at the matter from a legal point of view <e> <s> i confirm that the corporation will be able to take account of such prospects when operating its approval power <e> <s> however at present i cannot give any guarantee that we shall be able to come up with a suitable definition to add to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to discuss the matter between now and a later stage of the bill to ascertain whether wording can be agreed <e> <s> i point out the severe difficulties but i am quite prepared to try <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord ross of newport that we should all like to see the tenants choice procedures although extensive and potentially time consuming proceed apace <e> <s> of course it is regrettable that some councils are perhaps <e>", "<cs> any valuation has to be by reference to a specific date <e> <s> we have chosen the relevant date as the day on which the application is made <e> <s> this follows the right to buy precedent set out in sections and of the housing act by <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dean of beswick said that we were also discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and which are in my name <e> <s> it may be easier for the committee if i were to explain those amendments and then return to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> in designing tenants choice we have made it clear from an early stage that transactions should take place at market value subject to tenancy <e> <s> that we believe is the only appropriate basis for sales without subsidy to independent landlords subject to commercial pressures and considerations <e> <s> clause is put together on that basis <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i wish to stress what i said right at the beginning <e> <s> we are not talking about the ability to pay of a potential applicant we are talking about market value subject to tenancy <e> <s> i hope that that will prevent the situation that the member opposite has explained so clearly of one side getting a special benefit <e> <s> we wish to avoid that situation <e>", "<cs> first i agree with the noble lord lord mcintosh that the terms on which the homes of those who continue to be tenants of public sector landlords are leased back is a very important subject <e> <s> my honourable friend the then minister for housing said in a commons committee that before exercising the right which my right honourable friend the secretary of state has under clause to prescribe their terms we would consult local authorities and others with an interest <e> <s> it seems to me that that is a better way than the noble lords prescriptive list of subject areas for leases to ensure that legitimate interests are appropriately covered <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what both the noble lords lord ross of newport and lord mcintosh of haringey said <e> <s> i too believe that it would be wrong and against the rules of debate for me to repeat what i said earlier in our general discussion on the voting procedure <e> <s> notwithstanding the decision of the committee earlier this afternoon i shall read with great care what both noble lords said and i shall be happy to discuss it with them <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> ze would be to allow public sector landlords to re-let flats which had been leased back to them in transferred blocks as and when the tenancies of tenants who had opted to remain with the landlord came to an end <e> <s> the public sector landlords new tenant supposedly would then be given a choice between staying with that landlord or becoming the tenant of the former applicant now the freeholder of the block <e>", "<cs> of course i will look at everything that has been said today <e> <s> what has encouraged me in what the noble lord lord dean of beswick has said is what a potential success he believes tenants choice is going to be <e> <s> i am rather encouraged after hearing noble lords opposite <e> <s> we always believed that it would be a success <e> <s> the terror that it has struck into the noble lord of vast areas of council housing going over to alternative landlords really quite excites me <e>", "<cs> i believe that at this hour of night the noble lord misunderstands me <e> <s> i said that i was encouraged by the concern that he had that tenants choice was going to be the success for which we were hoping <e> <s> as he knows in england per cent <e> <s> of the housing stock is owned by owner-occupiers <e> <s> of the remainder per cent <e> <s> is private sector and the vast majority over million are council house tenants <e> <s> there will be a substantial local authority influence on housing for many years to come <e> <s> we are offering tenants choice and a greater opportunity than they have had <e> <s> the noble lord spoke as though every single local authority flat and house is going to be taken by tenants choice straight away <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can explain to the satisfaction of the committee how our proposals meet the concern which underlies amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> as i read it and though the two are linked amendment no <e> <s> a seems to be more relevant to amendment no <e> <s> a and i shall have more to say about it in due course <e>", "<cs> i shall read with care what the noble lord lord dean said <e> <s> he gave an example which slightly perplexed me <e> <s> i wonder whether the tenants to whom he spoke were tenants under tenants choice or whether it was a local authority disposal under part v of the bill which we shall be discussing tomorrow <e>", "<cs> government amendment no <e> <s> g to which the noble lord lord graham of edmonton quite rightly in the grouping of this amendment <e> <s> has made reference follows a <e>", "<cs> we intend as i have mentioned to prepare detailed regulations governing consultation under clause <e> <s> one important issue to be covered will be timing <e> <s> the amendments of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey suggest a statutory scale for this varying with the size of the application <e> <s> he does not specify from when the period would run but the natural reference point would be the service of a notice by the landlord under clause proposing a purchase price or the determination of any dispute under clause by the district valuer whichever was the later <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to tell the noble lord that in no case involving applications of any size do we intend to allow less than weeks for the applicant and teller to prepare for consultation and carry it out <e>", "<cs> that will depend on the applicant and the tenants <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require tenants choice landlords to inform their tenants every year of a great long list of facts which i doubt many of them will want <e> <s> they would receive details of all their landlords acquisitions or disposals of property under tenants choice in their area of all the local tenants associations of any non tenants choice properties held by their landlord in their area not to mention details of the business and financial interests of their landlord <e> <s> presumably the secretary of states regulatory powers in proposed subsection a might be able to limit the latter to the interests relating to housing but even so this remains a formidable list <e>", "<cs> i must begin what i say about these amendments with a word of caution more addressed to myself than to members of the <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows we are reviewing the situation of the homeless and i have already mentioned that i am looking with interest at the reports put forward <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the kind words of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> bearing in mind what he has said perhaps he could give me an early night tomorrow night <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern of the noble lord that council tenants should not be subjected to a barrage of unwelcome applications <e> <s> in reply to that i can say with confidence that the corporations preliminary contest and the tenants voice in that contest protects those tenants who are genuinely not interested in a transfer from being pursued by applicants <e> <s> i am sure that the corporation will pay particular attention to cases where a second application is made for the homes of tenants who have already voted down one application <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm my noble friends figures but i can tell the house that the deaths since april in the eastern north sea now amount to about and deaths reported in the uk since august are about <e> <s> the immune system of seals is one of the items of research that we are undertaking at the moment <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> however i know that the dutch are carefully monitoring the situation and are also undertaking extensive research <e> <s> this is an area of research where the work of one country is obviously not enough <e> <s> all the countries around the north sea must take part <e>", "<cs> my lords the conservation of seals act is kept under review by my right honourable friends the home secretary and the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> they are looking at the act at the moment and considering in particular whether section should be implemented <e> <s> as regards the nasty chemicals that flow from rivers into the sea as the noble baroness will know per cent <e> <s> of these come from the european mainland countries <e> <s> that is why we together with our european neighbours agreed to certain points at the north sea conference in november of last year in order to reduce the number of those chemicals <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no general licences for culling seals have been issued in recent years <e> <s> this is a matter that will be carefully looked at by my right honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that when i was in caithness earlier this summer some dead seals were found but it was not known at that time whether the deaths resulted from the virus <e> <s> as far as i understand the atlantic ocean and the north sea meet up there in one of the nicest counties in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am certain of is that my right honourable friends the secretary of state for scotland and the home secretary will be very careful in issuing licences under section and will be looking at the particular points that the noble baroness has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i should of course have mentioned orkney and shetland as well as caithness <e>", "<cs> not to my knowledge my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the case which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> he will recall that he wrote to my noble friend the leader of the house who in turn replied to the noble lord <e> <s> the government do not believe that a developer should have to acquire land before testing whether his proposal to develop it is acceptable to the local planning authority or to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that in order to implement what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton would like there would have to be alterations to primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the example that the noble lord has given <e> <s> however it is right and it is what parliament has agreed that if a planning application is turned down by the council there is a right of appeal to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord molloy will know certain notices have to be served with planning applications <e> <s> if what he suggests were put into effect it would defeat the object of the suggestion of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e>", "<cs> my lords the developer certainly does not go behind the backs of the residents or the council he puts his case to an independent inspector <e> <s> both sides have an opportunity to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course consider that suggestion <e> <s> i believe that it runs counter to many of the bases on which we have proceeded with planning in the past and would mean a major upheaval with enormous consequences as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in mortgage interest rates is likely to have some restraining effect on the rise in house prices and perhaps also on the number of houses sold <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the last part of the noble lords supplementary question the building societies and the banks which have arranged mortgages have written to all those who are affected <e> <s> i know that they have offered help either by suggesting a different date by which repayment should be made or by making other arrangements <e> <s> it is too early to say whether it will retard house-building in general <e> <s> however <e> <s> i am able to take this <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the reasons that interest rates were increased by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer was indeed to curb inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that in the first half of the number of repossessions was down per cent <e> <s> on a year earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords for very many years houses have been repossessed when people have not been able to meet their commitments <e> <s> what i have been able to confirm to the house is that in the first half of this year repossessions were down per cent <e> <s> on a year earlier <e> <s> there are some mortgages and there were repossessions in the first six months of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows full well from our recent debates we are seeking to encourage the rented sector <e> <s> we seek not only to increase the number of houses available to rent but also to enlarge the diversity in the type of houses available <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i totally disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> since there have been million first-time home buyers <e> <s> there were alone last year <e>", "<cs> my lords my figures were for the first half of <e> <s> they are the most up-to-date figures that i am able to give your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer on numerous occasions has answered the question put by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i have many comments to make but i shall not weary your lordships with a full exposition of them <e> <s> we need a vibrant and viable rented sector <e> <s> it needs to be diversified from the monolithic blocks of some local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i welcome this new clause which gives effect to a reform proposed in another place and the associated consequential amendments to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i believe that a bankrupt tenant whose tenancy has no financial value is put in an even more unfortunate position if he should lose his tenancy too <e> <s> if he loses his home he is not going to be in a position to sort out his affairs nor possibly to use the tools of his trade which the insolvency act also allows him to keep <e> <s> this new clause ensures that tenancies which do have a value assured tenancies for which a premium can be charged for example will continue to vest in the trustees so that the creditors of the bankrupt will have access to any funds which that sort of tenancy may realise <e>", "<cs> i first deal with amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i sympathise with the purpose behind this <e>", "<cs> clause is an important clause in the bill <e> <s> like the noble lord lord mcintosh i believe that it may be helpful to the committee to offer a few introductory remarks about the general principles underlying the clause before turning to the amendment in question <e>", "<cs> i first deal with the question raised by the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> this morning i looked into this matter in preparation for todays debate and i know that in certain areas we do not have the numbers that we would like <e> <s> that is why we are recruiting in order to strengthen the rent officer force <e>", "<cs> my noble friend raises an important point because one can imagine circumstances where there is a shortage of accommodation and a tenant who is in a well-paid job is prepared to pay above the market rent for a tenancy in order to obtain occupation of the premises <e> <s> such a person will no doubt be aware that a considerable amount of literature is available on this point <e> <s> he can go to the dss or the local authority both of which have literature which is widely available <e> <s> although one would regret circumstances such as those described by my noble friend i am sure that such a person would have ready access to the literature to help him in such an unfortunate situation <e>", "<cs> i believe that the words that stood out in the speech of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey were when he said that the amendments should not be long-term on the face of the bill <e> <s> in that case one would need primary legislation in order to remove them because they would be there on the face of the bill until another piece of legislation came along <e> <s> that is why we believe as the noble lord rightly drew to the attention of the committee that the regulation procedure allows the flexibility that both the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and we want <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it allows me to thank him for what he has just said and also to comment on one other point about the rent officer service <e> <s> although we are aware that we need to recruit more people it is not because the rent officer service is under strength at the moment for the job that it is doing we require extra people for the enhanced role of the rent officer service <e>", "<cs> i said that the service is not under strength for the job that it is doing now but we need more people for its enhanced role <e>", "<cs> i thought i had answered the noble lord <e> <s> the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said when withdrawing a previous amendment that not all the progress today would he sweetness and light <e> <s> i fear that on this amendment we have struck the first of the areas where the approach is contrary to that of the government <e>", "<cs> i stated that case as an example of a situation which could arise <e> <s> as the noble lord knows it is entirely possible indeed it follows on from the situation that my noble friend raised in respect of the last amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i reassure the committee again that what has been said will he taken into account in the discussions <e> <s> my noble friend lord skelmersdale has listened throughout the debate on housing benefit <e> <s> i know that he will take hack what your lordships have said and discuss it with our right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am glad that we agree <e>", "<cs> i must confess to the noble lord that i had some difficulty in understanding the purpose of his amendment <e> <s> however i believe that as he has elucidated it to the committee i have interpreted it correctly <e> <s> as i understand it the effect of the noble lords amendment would be to require that the local authority treats the rent officers assessment of a reasonable rent as the minimum eligible rent for housing benefit purposes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> of course i too shall read what has been said <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord skelmersdale has also noted what noble lords have said <e> <s> the very points which the noble lord has mentioned concerning the elderly or the widow who has always lived in a house are the very points that i picked up myself when i first replied to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal in her amendment <e> <s> these are the people about whom we are very concerned <e> <s> it is the most difficult area and it is the area to which a great deal of consideration is being given in the consultations to which i have already referred <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the remarks made by my noble friends and in particular for what my noble friend lord swinfen said about the limit to mortgage tax relief <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness too is aware that the total sum applied to mortgage tax relief in was less than the total paid in housing benefit and rent rebate <e>", "<cs> i feel duly chastised by my noble friends lord renton and lord boyd-carpenter and indeed by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i am grateful that my noble friend the leader of the house is here to listen to their comments with me <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is very kind but i feel

it would be wrong for me not to answer the specific points raised by my noble friends and by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e>", "<cs> i take note of the points made by the noble lord and i

indeed i am being pressed at the moment to tighten up this procedure quite dramatically <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will know that we have had representations that there should not even be a month for the landlord to serve a counter-notice and that there should at the end of a statutory limit automatically be a penalty <e> <s> we believe that we have struck a fair balance in allowing the landlord one month to refute the allegations of the tenant but we also think it fair that where the landlord cannot refute the allegations of the tenant the rent should be deducted from the purchase price for the period in question from the date that the first notice was served <e>", "<cs> i take that point <e> <s> we have looked at the matter in a balanced way and i only <e>", "<cs> perhaps i

absolutely clear what i am saying to the noble lord is that i think it would be unwise to extend the right to buy to tenants until we have gone through that consultation because we need that first <e>", "<cs> i fear that my noble kinswoman is right <e> <s> of course some local authorities will be against this <e> <s> some local authorities are still against the right to buy <e> <s> that does not mean that they won the argument <e>", "<cs> i can say to my noble friend that i do not see any way in which the formal consultation will be carried out by the next stage <e> <s> i have no doubt that it will come back before your lordships whether it is brought forward either by the government or as an amendment to another housing bill which i am sure your lordships will be pleased to look at in future sessions but to give my noble friend any assurance that we could complete the formal consultations by the next stage would be something with which we could not comply <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to add to what i said without my noble friend the chief whip being available but my noble friend knows that this is a matter which is of serious concern to the committee <e> <s> i have no doubt that after the formal consultations have been concluded and we have received replies the matter will come before this place in one form or another <e>", "<cs> i deliberately refrained from entering into that argument because members opposite will know what i am going to say we want diversity of housing <e> <s> we do not necessarily want the housing built by local authorities although they have an important part to play as enablers <e> <s> we have the existing local authority stock the housing associations and encouragement to the private sector to invest in rented housing <e> <s> in view of what i said about tenants choice yesterday and the need for housing associations to take account of those with special need need i say more <e>", "<cs> how could my noble friend suggest that it was a last minute matter <e> <s> perish the thought <e> <s> we have not yet started formal consultations <e> <s> it is for the committee to decide upon the amendment but i can assure my noble friend that if he withdraws the amendment we shall proceed as i suggest that is by accepting the deletion of paragraph at another stage and conducting formal consultations on paragraph <e>", "<cs> i fully recognise that the intention behind the amendment is to help tenants who do not have the right to buy because they live in special housing for disabled people <e> <s> as my noble friend lord swinfen said there is a precedent for such assistance in what is known as the hotcha scheme home ownership for tenants of charitable housing associations <e> <s> this was introduced in to help housing association tenants who do not have the right to buy because their landlord is a charity <e> <s> further clause of the bill would give local authorities a power to assist their tenants to find homes of their own <e> <s> i am not sure whether a clause which we have yet to debate can be called a precedent but at least it shows that our minds are running on similar lines <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was so keen to interrupt me that he failed i believe to listen to the last part of my argument <e> <s> one is demand-led expenditure in cash the other is demand-led expenditure in an abatement of the purchase price <e> <s> they are two very different things <e>", "<cs> the object of clause is to give local authorities a new management tool to help them make the best use of their housing stock <e> <s> it would confer on them express powers to give financial assistance to tenants who would like to move out of their present rented homes and buy homes of their own elsewhere <e> <s> the government have decided to put forward legislation for this purpose in the light of the encouraging results achieved by the london boroughs of brent and bromley in schemes operated under general powers <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady gardner of parkes was certainy right in saying that the amendment introduced a new element into the bill <e> <s> it is an important element and i know that it is not the first time that we have discussed homelessness in repect of this legislation now before the committee <e>", "<cs> i have listened with very great care to what has been said tonight <e> <s> i would take issue with the noble lord lord ross of newport on one point in particular that is that the position of the homeless will be weakened under this bill <e> <s> i do not agree with him on that <e> <s> i know we shall differ on that but looking at the total picture of what the government are doing i do not believe that that accusation stands up <e> <s> i would just draw to your lordships attention the last clause we debated clause which will enable local authorities to give grants which can be used in a helpful way for the homeless <e>", "<cs> the problem is not on the back burner <e> <s> it has received enormous consideration especially during the past three weeks <e> <s> numerous papers on it have passed through my hands <e> <s> i discussed it only recently with my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> as i told the noble lord lord graham of edmonton earlier i cannot give a precise timing for the review <e> <s> we know that recent reports including the shelter/shac report that has just come out will play an important part in our considerations <e> <s> i assure the committee that this is not on the hack burner and it will come forward <e>", "<cs> this debate takes place against a background of widespread interest from local authorities in transferring their housing to new organisations usually housing associations <e> <s> it was because of the prospect that some local authorities might wish to apply for the secretary of states consent to such a transfer that we introduced clause <e>", "<cs> and amendment no <e> <s> h i hope <e>", "<cs> in considering these amendments we need to remember that we are talking about a situation where the local authority itself will have made the choice to transfer its housing to a new body <e>", "<cs> the differences of emphasis between the noble lord and myself is demonstrated when he uses the words just because <e> <s> that is the key to the difference concerning tenants choice about which we were talking yesterday <e> <s> one may have a situation where tenants wish to have an alternative landlord to the local authority <e> <s> it may be against the wishes of the local authority <e> <s> it may be that they wish to retain their housing stock maintain their empire and their monolithic blocks <e> <s> in those circumstances where it has been put forward by the tenants and one has tenants choice those who do not wish to go to a new landlord can opt back <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend will know <e> <s> part iv of the rent agriculture act requires local authorities to use their best endeavours to provide alternative accommodation for displaced agricultural workers <e> <s> it is interesting to hear my noble friend still talking about best endeavours <e> <s> it takes me back years but i am glad that he said that he would not mention it very much more this evening <e>", "<cs> i understand what is in the mind of the noble lord lord dormand of easington but it is a fundamental principle of the legislation that dwellings should only be designated as inherently defective where as a type or category wherever they are situated they all exhibit the same major inherent defect of design or construction <e> <s> if that requirement were altered as the clause proposes by allowing designation by reference to the area in which the buildings are situated it would give small groups of owners privileged treatment by grant aid or repurchase while denying assistance to others living elsewhere in properties of the same type <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i think the noble lord was right to say that i did not cover one of the points as fully as possible and perhaps this gives me the opportunity to do so <e> <s> the real point of what the noble lord lord dormand of easington was saying was that he acknowledges that the problems of skarne houses are obvious on survey <e> <s> that is the key <e> <s> the key point is that designation under the housing defects act has to be reserved for serious inherent defects that an owner or an authority could not have known about on survey or sale or purchase <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what my noble friend said on the issue <e> <s> i appreciate that it is a point to which he has drawn our attention in the past <e> <s> i am rather persuaded by his argument and therefore welcome the amendment <e> <s> indeed we were already thinking on similar lines ourselves as a result of correspondence from him and others and following discussions with the law society <e> <s> in the light of these discussions we think that section could be considerably tidied up in addition to dealing with the common parts point <e> <s> the tenants we want to exclude are those who are in effect intermediary landlords <e> <s> we want to achieve a similar result to that which my noble friend wishes to achieve but to make a slightly wider ranging amendment <e> <s> moreover if the definition of a qualifying tenant is changed for the purposes of part i similar considerations should apply in parts iii and iv dealing with the acquisition of the landlords interest and the variation of leases <e> <s> if my noble friend will agree to withdraw the amendment we will consider for report stage a set of amendments to cover not only the omission of the reference to common parts but also the other points to which i have just referred <e>", "<cs> we recognise as indeed my honourable friend the then minister for housing and planning said more than once in another place that there is a need to provide advice and information on the effects the legislation will have <e> <s> the department has already gone to considerable lengths to make leaflets on the contents of the bill freely available <e> <s> once the bill has received royal assent we shall be taking further steps to ensure that people understand the legislation including the very points that the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> for example the department will ensure that leaflets explaining the changes for private sector tenants and landlords are available in libraries post offices and other public places there will also be a poster campaign to alert tenants and landlords to the importance of the changes <e>", "<cs> of course we all want to see the number of empty council houses and flats reduced but in accusing us of being vapid i think the noble lord uses perhaps the wrong adjective or the wrong noun depending on how he used the word at the time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for putting down and moving this amendment <e> <s> i find his arguments thoroughly convincing and i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the way in which the noble lord lord tordoff introduced his amendments and i welcome him to participation in the committee albeit at a late stage <e>", "<cs> i believe that i covered some of what the noble lord said under the tenants guarantee which the housing corporation is looking at for england <e> <s> i am sure that a similar procedure will happen in scotland although i cannot speak for my noble friend lord sanderson <e> <s> i believe that it would be wrong for me to comment further on the scottish aspect <e> <s> i know that the noble lord has raised a point that my noble friend lord sanderson has heard and i am sure that he will take it up with the noble lord in due course <e>", "<cs> i rise to wish the noble lord a happy birthday <e> <s> i was happy to give him one birthday present but three is a little much for a scotsman to give <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords will well know britain has and will continue to take a lead particularly in trans-boundary pollution <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that we recently received a report from the stratospheric ozone review group and i immediately announced that we would call for a reduction of at least per cent <e> <s> in cfcs <e> <s> we are also taking the lead in climate change <e> <s> i have arranged for both those matters to be put on the agenda for the next meeting of the council of ministers <e> <s> i am delighted to see that at long last germany has followed us

noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> we look forward to seeing the replies which governments of other countries manage to produce to the brundtland report with a prime ministers foreword <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> i have seen some of the reports most of which are unfounded or produce only one aspect of a complicated problem <e> <s> of course we are not

the job of the planning system to deliver a particular level of coal input nor to prevent development which is acceptable in planning terms <e> <s> as the noble lord will know each case is considered on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will be aware that nerc funding has risen by per cent <e> <s> in real terms since we came to power in <e> <s> it is per cent <e> <s> higher than it was last year <e> <s> it is up to nerc to decide how it wishes to spend the money which we allocate to it <e> <s> in - it will be million <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised an important point <e> <s> we are in contact with the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we have taken up the matter and both the department and the foreign and commonwealth office are in contact with the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to answering many questions on the environment <e> <s> there is a good story to tell <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition will know that we were the first country of the group to ask that the gramme limit should be reduced to grammes <e> <s> i moved to that position on the basis of scientific evidence showing that that was the right way to go <e> <s> we hope that the agreement will be signed in november and that other countries which followed britain by reducing the limit to grammes will sign it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall bear in mind what the noble lord says <e> <s> however it is up to industry and to each of us <e> <s> i wonder how many of us are at the moment driving cars with unleaded petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware britain is fortunate in that it has one of the four global meteorological modelling stations in the world <e> <s> there is one in germany two in america and one in britain <e> <s> one might well ask why other countries have not been prepared to commit the resources to that that we have <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that this is perhaps the most potential threat to sustainable development and the environment and it is a matter which we take extremely seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that voluntary effort is part of the problem <e> <s> what is important is that we have international agreements regarding the large combustion plants and acid rain <e> <s> i hope to be going to sofia at the end of the month to sign the nox protocol with some of the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stallard asked some questions which i hope i answered during the debate on th october when we were in committee on the housing bill <e> <s> it is parliaments duty to lay down the rules and it will be for the independent teller to see that those rules are interpreted properly and fairly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that was clear to the whole house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon will know that i disagree with him for the reasons that i set out in committee <e> <s> of course he has failed to point out to the house that those who wish to remain with their existing landlords can opt to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i disagree with the basis on which the noble lord formulates that question <e>",

very much welcome this opportunity to debate the committee report on the montreal protocol <e> <s> i should like to echo the point made by so many of your lordships that the environment is too important to be treated as a political football <e> <s> i am all for criticism at the right time when it is justified but to use it for <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the amendments cover private landlords <e> <s> i considered the matter at some length because there were arguments on both sides as to whether one should give this right to private landlords <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state and i considered that the right thing to do was to allow private landlords to help local authorities in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am happy to confirm that the same rules apply to everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord tordoff that this is a pretty rum grouping of amendments if i may put it in those terms <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> has nothing much to do with part i it proposes to deal with secure tenants under the housing acts <e> <s> it is therefore the odd man in this grouping <e> <s> of course we all deplore racial harassment <e> <s> however if the noble lord lord mcintosh agrees i prefer to deal with that separately when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is on a different point from the one we are discussing in the group included under the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said they are fearsomely complicated <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord mcintosh is better able to explain them than i am <e>", "<cs> my lords when amendment no <e> <s> is moved i shall have quite a lot to say <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> is part of a group to which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey spoke with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in his preamble he then said he would not move it as there was a problem with it <e> <s> as the noble lord was gracious enough to acknowledge that he had received help from the department on this i wonder whether if this amendment were moved it would enable him to tell us what the problem is on drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however all amendment no <e> <s> does is to transfer the definition of fully mutual housing associations otherwise known as cooperatives in some circumstances from where it is in the bill to clause which is the interpretation clause for part i <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are indicative of the wide divergence of view between the two sides of your lordships house on the approach to lettings by private landlords which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and i commented on as regards the first amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment on one aspect of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i believe that there is a fundamental flaw in his argument with respect <e> <s> he said that there may be a landlord who under certain circumstances finds the rent determined by the rent assessment committee not acceptable <e> <s> he went on to say then the landlord wants more <e> <s> how is the tenant going to pay the x factor the amount of money between what the rent assessment committee determines and what the landlord wants <e> <s> there is no x factor because the rent determined by the rent assessment committee will be the statutory maximum recoverable <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that the noble lord again misunderstood me <e> <s> the rent is a statutory maximum recoverable by the landlord <e> <s> there is not an x factor <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall that the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs argued eloquently for the cause of non-tenant spouses in committee and had some support from both sides of the chamber <e> <s> i should say that i appreciate the case made by the noble baroness then and that made by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey today in moving the amendment <e> <s> as i am sure your lordships appreciate i am not unsympathetic to the aims of these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that and i shall cover the point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> finally i might add that it would be wrong for the committee to have to consider what might in essence be a marital dispute over terms of the tenancy when what it should be looking at is any disagreements there might be between landlord and tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that would very much depend upon the circumstances <e> <s> i can envisage the circumstances which the noble baroness has put forward <e> <s> as i said at the beginning the way to overcome the situation in the first place is to have a joint tenancy which is something that we shall be advocating as i said earlier <e> <s> i shall take up again the point raised by the noble baroness when i sum up at the end because i believe that she has a legitimate point <e>", "<cs> my lords the contract is with the landlord and the tenant and not with the non-tenant spouse <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house of course it is a proper matter to be debated on the housing bill <e> <s> i have not denied that <e> <s> but being restricted to assured tenants it does not cover rent act tenants or long leasehold spouses <e> <s> and perhaps it ought to <e> <s> one is not unsympathetic but with respect the noble lord underestimates the complications of the amendments <e> <s> it is right that this should be a matter for my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment would require that a tenant against whom a possession order is made on ground which is the redevelopment ground should receive compensation <e> <s> the amendment does not actually <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am happy to look at the proposition the noble lord has put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for raising this matter again <e> <s> i wanted to speak about it separately because i consider it to be very important <e> <s> it was a point picked up by the noble lord lord tordoff and by the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool after the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey introduced the earlier amendment <e> <s> i recall making this point in earlier debates on home affairs matters with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i have no hesitation in making it again the government fully share the general concern about racial harassment and the desire to stamp it out <e> <s> it is simply not acceptable that people should be prevented from the quiet enjoyment of their homes and should in some cases go in fear of <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raised this matter in committee as he

that i might not <e> <s> it may be as my noble friend says that many farmers are letting property which they temporarily do not need for their employees and which they let for long or short periods

this subject later <e> <s> the point was raised in committee and i sympathised with the point she made <e> <s> i believe that it was the noble lord lord ross of newport who said that it was quite a good idea and i referred to the problem in london at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that we are on a collision course again <e> <s> the amendment is clearly against everything that we are trying to do to free the market the noble lord lord mcintosh is trying to put landlords back into handcuffs <e>", "<cs> my lords how disappointing i had believed that we were in harness together on these amendments <e> <s> we have here several amendments with a common aim <e> <s> we had always intended that the details of the ground on which a landlord is seeking possession should be set out in the prescribed form which he will have to use <e> <s> however both amendments nos <e> <s> and would make it clear on the face of the bill that this will be the case <e> <s> when the ground is set out in full in the notice the <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed the subject of premiums at some length during committee stage <e> <s> i am not sure that there are any major new arguments waiting to be deployed on either side <e> <s> certainly i did not hear any from noble lords opposite or the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i am sure that they will say much the same of me when i have completed what i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that in some areas of the country there is a shortage of property and that in others there is a surplus <e> <s> that happens to be one of the facts of life <e> <s> it varies from area to area <e> <s> i do not agree with the noble lords philosophy of trying to put no premiums on those areas where there is a shortage of supply <e> <s> it is exactly to those areas that we will be encouraging people <e> <s> they will go of their own accord without further encouragement from the government in order to provide rented accommodation now that we are to free them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and concern succession to an assured tenancy <e> <s> the noble lord would like me to give the right to an assured tenancy to subsequent spouses of a spouse who has succeeded to an assured tenancy on the death of the tenant <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot accept that <e> <s> what we have created in clause is a single right of succession for the spouse only since we accept that the tenancy should be extended to a tenants partner by marriage or with whom he has lived as man and wife so that that partner may spend the rest of his or her life in the property in which they lived together <e> <s> we have not agreed that people who are not related to the original tenant should be entitled to succeed <e> <s> a subsequent partner by marriage has not got any particular claim on the property <e> <s> if a landlord should choose to let the partner of a subsequent marriage stay in the property all well and good <e> <s> however we are not going to give such people an automatic right <e> <s> indeed as the amendment is drafted if there were subsequent deaths and re-marriages the tenancy could extend well into the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say too strongly that i fully appreciate the anxieties that lie behind my noble friends amendment <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that i do not believe the amendment is necessary <e> <s> i could enter into a dispute with him as to lawyers opinions of the precise meaning of the present wording and go through cases where the courts have given their opinions on what is meant by placing a local authority under duties of this kind <e> <s> however i do not think that your lordships would be very pleased if i were to do so at this time of night <e> <s> essentially my noble friend is concerned that local authorities are increasingly unable to provide accommodation for agricultural workers who need to be rehoused <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall of course take note of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i shall study his remarks carefully <e> <s> however i thought i had already covered the point <e> <s> if my noble friend wishes to pursue that point my right honourable friend the secretary of state will not be able to issue general consents any more <e> <s> the implications of my noble friends proposal would mean that he had to have specific proposals which i do not think in the short or indeed in the long-term would benefit my noble friend <e> <s> therefore he might feel that he was better off with the situation as now appertains <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord graham will allow me to reply to him in three parts <e> <s> i should like to deal first with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the way in which the noble lord lord meston introduced this amendment <e> <s> i am however sad that the noble baroness lady phillips who earlier spoke on something similar is not here to participate in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords under the existing law it is not necessary to obtain a court order to evict a licensee whose contract has ended <e> <s> that seems to the government to be anomalous and in clause we have extended the requirement in the protection from eviction act to obtain a court order so that it covers most residential occupiers <e>

include licensees whose agreements have expired living in hostels provided by the bodies listed in subsection <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey summed up the problem facing your lordships very succinctly when he wondered whether we should try to prejudge the decision of the judicial committee of your lordships <e> <s> the answer to

to the form in which the rights of new housing association tenants should be expressed than to the content of those rights though perhaps not exclusively so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misunderstood the noble lords point <e> <s> i am glad that he was able to clarify it <e> <s> i should like to examine that specific point <e> <s> as i understand it that situation will not be <e>",

right <e> <s> of course we all want to get rid of double scrutiny <e> <s> if the local authority is doing its job there will probably be no need for it <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will no

hoped that having read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lords lord graham of edmonton and lord mcintosh of haringey that i have listened with great care to what has been said this evening when your lordships discussed their fears about the effect of the setting up of hats on local authorities attempts to deal with the problems of homeless people and indeed the whole question of hats themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much i welcome the contribution of the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> let me say at the outset i should very much like the co-operation of the local authorities <e> <s> i agree with him that many local authorities have done a splendid job in many aspects of the work they carry out <e> <s> but that does not make them

i do not agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey who raised the question of the arrangements for payments for properties transferred to

of that policy so heavily criticised by the opposition parties one million people have now had the opportunity which otherwise they would not have had to buy their own homes <e> <s> moreover two-thirds of those people never thought that they would be given the opportunity <e> <s> that is a success story as indeed tenants choice will be a success story <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware of that and i thoroughly support it <e> <s> however the point that the noble lord refuses to acknowledge is that each tenant will have the opportunity to stay with the local authority if that is what the tenant wants <e> <s> that answers the point of the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> the question that he posed contains a paradox <e> <s> if the tenant is opposed to change he will

opportunities that they are being given under the bill <e> <s> they have wished to get away from the stranglehold of local authorities but the local authorities have been unwilling to let them go

finish <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the noble lord has stopped i shall do so <e> <s> that is what i was trying to do but the noble lord interrupted me <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are

pursuing them so determinedly <e> <s> i say that because i believe that we did not vote on these amendments in committee but we gave our opinion on other amendments that came forward at report stage

strengthen the situation <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not <e> <s> it is headed by the word my and follows on with the word lords <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord that we have discussed similar amendments before <e> <s> i can assure him that i have given the matter considerable thought since then <e> <s> i fully understand and share the concern that tenants should not be pestered by successive applications which they do not want that was a point which the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal mentioned earlier this afternoon in connection with another amendment <e> <s> that applies whether they come from the same applicant or from a whole string of them <e> <s> the procedures which we shall impose with the housing corporation will not allow that to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is cherishing this moment <e> <s> not only was the last amendment one on which we were very close in principle but this is the fourth

to my noble friend lady blatch for what she has said <e> <s> she has put her finger absolutely on the true reasons why it is difficult to accept the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that

noble friend has made it so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend lady blatch was entitled to explain after the remarks made against her by the noble lord lord dean of beswick why she made the intervention <e> <s> i believe that was perfectly in order and with the leave of the house i shall respond to the noble lord lord dean of beswick as he has asked me to do <e>", "<cs> my lords

defence against obstructive action which i regret to say some landlords might be tempted to try once it was clear that an application was going ahead <e> <s> there will be in some applications dwelling houses vacant on the relevant date <e> <s> there will be others which for a variety of reasons fall vacant between the formal start of an application and its completion <e> <s> the landlord rightly should be able to make use of his vacant properties during that period by granting tenancies or licences to occupy such houses or more frequently flats <e> <s> clause is needed to make provision with respect to those tenancies or licences <e>", "<cs> mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> would require the secretary of state to prescribe provisions governing what would happen when joint tenants or non-tenant spouses disagreed about how their household vote should be cast on a tenants choice proposal <e> <s> votes cast in response to consultation under clause will have two effects <e> <s> taken together they will determine whether the applicant is able to complete the acquisition <e> <s> individually they will determine the future of

case of houses or in the case of flats have them leased back to their existing landlord by the applicant <e> <s> that individual element in the vote means that there must indeed there can be only one vote per household <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e> <s> it has been agreed through the usual channels that we shall resume consideration of the housing bill immediately after the church of england measure has been dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we shall keep the matter under review because it is very serious if streets are not cleaned <e> <s> however surely the answer is for the local people the residents to vote out those councillors and in the meanwhile put pressure on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the residents of brent in that ward in particular showed clearly what they thought of the councils policies <e> <s> i am happy to note that the labour party managed to pip the greens for third place and registered per cent <e> <s> of the vote while the conservatives had per cent <e> <s> of the vote <e> <s> it is clear that what the people want is proper local services provided cost-efficiently by local

my lords before i answer the noble lord i hope the house will allow me to put clearly on the record the answer to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal <e> <s> i was half right <e> <s> the claimant has a right of appeal but not to the body to which i thought he had a right of appeal <e> <s> he has a right of appeal to the housing benefit review procedure established by the local authority under social security legislation <e> <s> it is the local authority that can invoke an appeal if it chooses to the independent group of rent officers which i mentioned <e> <s> i hope that that makes the position absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has accused me of bringing something new before your lordships and of changing my position since the committee stage <e> <s> i must repeat that there is nothing new in what i have said about paying benefit at market rates <e> <s> housing benefit subsidy will be payable up to market rent but certainly not beyond <e> <s> there will of course be a subsidy order under the social security act which will determine that provision <e> <s> that is the reason why it cannot be put on the face of the bill which

in the legislation relating to the right to buy dwellings which have been purpose-built or adapted by the landlord has been put most eloquently at committee stage and again this afternoon by my noble friend lord swinfen <e> <s> all of us are concerned to see that those with disabilities enjoy the same rights and privileges as the able-bodied <e> <s> the provisions we are discussing are not designed to exclude disabled people from the right to buy but rather to enable landlords to retain a stock of special housing suitable for disabled people <e> <s> that was the basis on which the noble viscount defeated the government a few years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lady blatch said it is a difficult decision <e> <s> perhaps i may take up some of the points that have been made by your lordships <e> <s> on the last point made by the noble viscount lord ingleby i cannot accept the proposition that he has put to us <e> <s> the whole thrust of government policy on housing is in a very different direction from that which he has put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i also said that we would consult not only the local authorities but those concerned with the disabled <e> <s> i must repeat this <e> <s> i should not mind if paragraph was omitted after the consultation <e> <s> as i explained at my meeting with my noble kinswoman the noble lord lord carter and my noble friend lord swinfen the whole point of consultation would be that one would either leave paragraph as it was one could repeal paragraph one could have regulations to cover paragraph or one could amend paragraph and have regulations to cover the amendment to paragraph <e> <s> my mind was totally free <e> <s> i went in with a completely open mind on that <e> <s> however i am sorry that my noble kinswoman has not accepted that offer <e>", "<cs> i repeat that i have never been against paragraph <e> <s> all i felt was that we should go to consultation <e> <s> but now we have from the very bedrock of socialism the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> who says no consultation my lords <e> <s> we do not want any of that <e> <s> let us get on <e> <s> let us have action <e>", "<cs>

strong statements in this house but the amendment that was discussed at committee stage was the important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to what the noble lord lord carter has said <e> <s> the amendment seeks to provide that a local authority must include tenants of housing converted or adapted for the disabled in a cash incentive scheme and that such a scheme may be solely for such tenants <e> <s> there is certainly no need for a specific provision to say that a scheme may be only for tenants of housing suitable for the disabled <e> <s> subsection a provides that a scheme may include provisions specifying the persons who are qualifying tenants or licensees for the purposes of the scheme there is nothing to prevent an authority coming forward with a scheme solely for the class of tenant the amendment specifies <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether this is a suitable moment at which to adjourn <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would allow my right honourable friend to issue guidance on the establishment and administration of schemes after consultations with organisations representative of local authorities <e> <s> as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton expected i remind your lordships that this clause is intended to give local <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of newport for again raising the important issue of the homeless <e> <s> as i said in committee the matter is very much on my desk at the moment <e> <s> where i fundamentally disagree with the noble lord as indeed he would expect is in his assertion that the position of the homeless will be weakened because of the bill <e> <s> i strongly disagree with him on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord a date <e> <s> indeed it would be wrong of me to do so at this stage <e> <s> however i can tell him that there is a great deal of urgency in the matter to try to process the review as quickly as possible <e> <s> but as the noble lord knows full well there are many other reviews in progress on the issue of the homeless for example the shelter/shac report is one <e> <s> in fact i think there are about four reports which have appeared over the past few weeks or so and obviously we wish also to digest their contents <e>", "<cs> my lords our new clause controlling subsequent disposals of housing sold under section or of the housing act was designed with large scale transfers of council housing in mind <e> <s> however as the noble lord has recognised those sections cover not only large scale disposals but virtually all voluntary disposals of tenanted council housing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is right that there might be some property occupied by the elderly or disabled within proposed hat areas or areas where landlords put forward proposals under the provisions of part iv of this bill <e> <s> in the case of hats as i have already explained on a number of occasions careful thought will be given in consultation with local authorities about the very best options for the tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords we covered this ground very fully yesterday when we discussed it on hats <e> <s> i recall the discussion well <e> <s> right at the beginning we shall be seeking to make sure that the right landlords are properly vetted by the housing corporation <e> <s> we hope that very few occasions will arise where a landlord does not live up to the high standards that will be required of such landlords but i believe this has been well covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i also recognise the benefit of mobility schemes but we consider that the current voluntary arrangements have worked effectively <e> <s> at present we see no reason to introduce statutory provisions <e> <s> i was wondering whether the noble lord lord mcintosh had a different view and i was expecting him to give a catalogue showing where the voluntary arrangements had not worked so well and why one needed a statutory scheme <e> <s> i do not think that that section of his argument was at the front of his mind when he proposed the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with care to my noble friend and the more i listened to him the more i thought that in equity he had a good point and was right <e> <s> when the discount repayment provisions were introduced they were intended to provide a short-term limitation on a purchasers freedom to dispose of his property in order to discourge tenants from buying simply in order to realise a quick cash profit <e> <s> i recognise that this can bear unfavourably on tenants whose right-to-buy purchase has already been delayed by the landlord and this amendment will allow the repayment period to be backdated in such cases <e> <s> i am happy to accept my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> the latest quality survey report which was produced by independent scientists found that per cent <e> <s> of the pollution in the north sea came down through british rivers whereas per cent <e> <s> came down through european rivers <e> <s> we are looking forward to seeing what the europeans are doing about it <e>", "<cs> my lords like all other countries in europe we are discussing with the commission the full implementation of the bathing <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful for the work that my noble friend does on this important committee <e> <s> in order to keep the momentum

showed that the north sea was relatively good <e> <s> there were a couple of areas of bad pollution the waddenzee and the german bight mainly as a result of pollution from european rivers on the east coast of the north sea <e> <s> i also disagree with the noble baroness that we are in any way complacent <e> <s> we are tackling our duties in a number of different ways <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course the fish are being monitored <e> <s> but because some fish appear perhaps to have two fins instead of one or no fin that is not automatically due to pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord does not know that the incineration of waste at sea by britain is very limited <e> <s> it is a major problem for germany as he will know <e> <s> it was agreed that we should phase it out for the whole of europe by the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords in february we published a detailed guidance note on all aspects of the declaration addressed to water authorities

know of no other country that has responded as we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is absolutely right <e> <s> as in many areas of government more than one government department and more than one agency are involved <e> <s> the lead department is the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to query what is meant by pollution <e> <s> it appears to some people that the discharge of sewage through long sea outfalls into the sea is pollution <e> <s> when one realises that that is the environmental method approved by the royal commission on environmental pollution it puts the matter in a different light <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not make light of the problem <e> <s> i was merely saying that the fact that a fish may have no fins does not necessarily mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the last part of the noble lords question <e> <s> it is a matter for everyone not just for those to the east of the watershed <e> <s> it is also a matter for everyone in europe and doubtless the rest of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for a healthy exchange of views so long as the result is that we improve the environment <e> <s> yes of course that is what we are trying to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> yes my hair has not gone grey it has just fallen out <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me the amendments are amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord dean of beswick said with these amendments we return to issues that were debated at some length at both committee and report stages and clearly the divergence of view between each side of your lordships house will be no less wide today than on the earlier occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords it may seem a slight thing to create a prior notice requirement for ground when that requirement already exists for grounds to as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has sought to argue <e> <s> but i contend that grounds to are much more limited and specific <e> <s> an owner-occupier letting his property a property subject to a mortgage or a letting of property which is normally used for holiday or student lets or for use by a minister of religion are all precise cases in which the landlord will know that he is likely to want the property back probably within a known timescale <e> <s> it is right that the tenant should specifically be advised of the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he will appreciate that i cannot agree with his summing-up of the governments position <e> <s> as i made clear in my explanation for resisting amendment no <e> <s> the more that the noble lord tries to complicate the issue the more complicated the procedure becomes <e> <s> we shall end in the situation which the noble lords party tried to rectify with the rent acts which tried to protect tenants <e> <s> as noble lords are aware they did nothing of the kind <e> <s> they were a contributory factor to the exploitation of tenants by landlords who wished to exploit them <e> <s> to go down the route which the noble lord wanted to go down would only encourage that <e> <s> i believe that the governments position is wholly tenable <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said amendment no <e> <s> is based on the premise that amendments made to clause have not gone far enough to meet the commitment given in committee to clarify the point that in certain circumstances an assured tenancy offered as alternative accommodation might not be sufficient security to a tenant if he or she is a former rent act tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords in this amendment the noble lord has returned to two issues which we have already discussed in committee and during report stage namely the financial arrangements for transferring property to hats and for repurchases by the local authorities from hats <e> <s> the noble lords amendment invites the secretary of state to issue guidance to local housing authorities on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that i had made that clear <e> <s> it is because the local authority may be in a position to raise some or a great part of the cost from within its existing credit limit or from its own resources <e> <s> that is the reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate that the noble lord would prefer to have full credit approval of per cent <e> <s> in each and every case <e> <s> however i am sure that he will agree that if the local authority can afford it from its own resources which it and the department know that it has surely it is right to ask the local authority to use some of its own resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i had a nasty feeling that however generous i was to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey i would never satisfy him fully <e> <s> however i feel that i fulfilled the commitment i made to the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i said that i wanted to look at the matter <e> <s> on consideration i felt that it was appropriate to put this provision on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> in which case my lords we are all delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the noble lords question even if the connection between charitable housing and hats is rather tenuous <e> <s> they may be the same thing from the tenants point of view but i accept the tenuous connection that the noble lord lord pitt has made <e> <s> unfortunately i cannot tell him anything definite but i can tell him that i have looked into the matter <e> <s> we are taking the best advice that we can and so far that advice seems to give me grounds for hope that the situation will result in a satisfactory outcome <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the point that the noble lord lord ross of newport missed with respect was that the tenant could stay with the hat until it has fulfilled its obligations <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e> <s> the hat may be disposing of part of its estate and if the tenant wants to stay with the hat for the time being the provision will allow him to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord totally misrepresents me again <e> <s> i am amazed that the noble lord could use such language <e> <s> he has taken the twisting of words to a ludicrous extent <e> <s> i hope that he will read with great care what i said <e> <s> how the noble lord summed up my words was totally different from what i actually said <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it means that the tenant will be given the choice <e> <s> that is exactly what i have been saying all the way along <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now using a very wide phrase in order to make a certain set of assumptions <e> <s> what i have said is that there will be choice for the tenants <e> <s> but the noble lord lord ross of newport was absolutely right <e>", "<cs> not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate has raised some important issues most of which we have covered before but i say to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal that one thing that we are giving in part iv and for the first time and which must surely be welcomed by many tenants is the opportunity to choose a new landlord <e> <s> that is something which has been denied to them for far too long <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble earl i shall rephrase my words and say that the analogy is not a strict one because this time one has individual choice <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that point covers the ground that has been discussed at all stages of the bill <e> <s> we are offering indvidual choice for the tenant <e> <s> we are not allowing tenants to be transferred against their will <e> <s> we are making every effort during the consultation period which will be a total of about weeks in all three weeks of which will be available for the independent teller to return to those who have abstained to ensure that the tenants fully understand the implications of abstaining <e>", "<cs> my lords now the noble lord is arguing against what the noble lord lord seebohm and the government want <e> <s> the government want exactly what the noble lord lord seebohm seeks in his amendment the only difference is that we have provided for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey wants to ensure that qualifying tenants who were in residence on the relevant date do not have a vote on the future of their former homes if they have moved out before the consultation <e> <s> he also wishes to ensure that those who complete the purchase of their own houses under the right to buy between the relevant date and consultation do not have a vote <e> <s> i quite agree with his aim and i am happy to be able to say that the bill as drafted achieves it almost completely <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start by reaffirming once more what has already been emphasised many times in the course of debate in your lordships house and in another place and indeed outside parliament as well housing benefit will continue to be available to those who genuinely need help with their housing costs <e> <s> that includes private tenants paying rents up to open market level <e> <s> let there be absolutely no doubt at all about the governments commitment in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern expressed by the noble lords lord mcintosh and lord tordoff who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> having decided that tenants of housing particularly suited for the disabled should no longer be excluded from the right to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the amendment means exactly what the noble lord lord mcintosh asked me to confirm <e> <s> perhaps he would be good enough to read what i said in the <e>", "<cs> my lords alas the noble lord has not and for this reason <e> <s> the amendment as drafted does not cover just those people the noble lord wanted to cover the carers he so eloquently described <e> <s> unfortunately it also covers any qualifying family member who moves in with the tenant and makes a contribution to his or her living expenses <e> <s> indeed the amendment goes so wide as to cover cases where the tenant is hale young and healthy as well as cases where the tenant is infirm and in need of attention <e> <s> although i appreciate what the noble lord is seeking to do for carers the amendments go very much wider and include many other cases <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think it is within my remit to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to my noble friends comments on the procedure for the variation of long leases of flats which was introduced in part iv of the landlord and tenant act <e> <s> our starting point like that of the nugee committee on whose recommendations the act was based was that such a procedure should be primarily for the benefit of the individual residential flat owner whose amenities and living conditions would suffer if the lease failed to make proper provision for the management of the block <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords when on th july the bill already heavily amended in another place had its second reading in your lordships house i pointed out that it represented the governments measured response to the need for change in the rented housing market <e> <s> i said that our central aims were to stimulate choice and competition in a vital area of housing which has for decades been in decline and wherever possible to involve the private sector in meeting housing needs <e> <s> i believe that these central aims of our policy have been endorsed during the detailed scrutiny that the bill has undergone in this house <e> <s> but i also believe the bill represents a better balanced and more comprehensive set of measures than it did when we began our consideration nearly four months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises an important point <e> <s> we have targeted aid by giving an extra million to local authorities in the past few months <e> <s> that has resulted in an increase in the number of available dwellings <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole point of the housing bill is to encourage the private sector to rent property which we want to be built but which at the moment has not been built or property which is empty <e> <s> as the noble baroness will be aware there is a sufficient number of empty properties to offer a great opportunity which local authorities can take with the encouragement of the private sector in order to give added help to the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall of course take account of homelessness in the rural areas <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord what we shall do about it because we have not yet completed the review <e>", "<cs> my lords the audit commission report is at a preliminary draft stage <e> <s> there is a little work still to do before it is produced in its final form at which point we shall carefully consider the conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> the bed-and-breakfast situation is very worrying <e> <s> it would be resolved by a reduction in the number of empty properties <e> <s> if local authorities re-let their empty properties within three weeks it would produce another units which would amply cover the number of people in bed-and-breakfast accommodation <e> <s> that is perhaps the line one should take <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> i said that i would look into the matter <e> <s> i can now give her the answer that i could not give her at that time <e> <s> as i understand it there are about government properties that are empty <e> <s> they were built for a specific purpose and are not necessarily in the right areas <e> <s> at the latest count there were something like empty local authority properties <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be fully aware that those who sleep rough or the single homeless are not strictly homeless under the definition of the act about which the noble lord lord ross of newport knows so much <e> <s> the noble lord started the act as a private members bill in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely right <e> <s> however the question related to homelessness and the specific definition in the act excludes those people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment to clause to which the commons have disagreed and do agree with the commons in their amendment in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome given to the governments amendments both by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and by the noble lord lord tordoff even though he had a moments hesitation <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey did not even have that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment to clause to which the comons have disagreed and do agree with the commons in their amendments in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their consequential amendments to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the bill the areas that are surplus to requirements which was the subject of a question earlier this afternoon in your lordships house will be a matter for the water authorities themselves when they have passed into the private sector <e> <s> the bill will also establish <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the leader of the opposition will be aware the bill is a long and comprehensive document in which there are many safeguards <e> <s> indeed i believe the bill was referred to in the <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know my noble friend has an immense knowledge of the water industry <e> <s> he is quite right to point out that the water companies that are already in private hands own reservoirs at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look into the point that my noble friend has raised <e> <s> however he will be delighted to learn that the communitys trans-boundary hazardous waste directive came into force on th november to cover the very points which my noble friend raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i was giving a perfectly factual account relating to the rer for the year to <e> <s> under the rules in that act we used information submitted by brent earlier <e> <s> it is clear to me that brent was given every opportunity to reply and that its failure to do so before close down is its responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the point on which i would disagree with the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is that there is a housing shortage problem throughout the country <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> there are areas of housing shortage <e> <s> in some areas the problem is quite significant <e> <s> overall there probably are enough houses but as the noble lord is fully aware the trouble is that we have a lot of houses in the wrong places serving the wrong people <e> <s> that is why there are shortages in certain areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say to the noble lord lord pitt that of course the annual distribution of the grant is carefully assessed every year <e> <s> there is the needs assessment and there are opportunities for representations to be made when it comes to allocating the resources that are made available <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i gave the house no hint of any complacency whatsoever <e> <s> i tried to put a factual account in a serious and considered manner before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of issues still arising out of the january consultation paper which are still being actively pursued <e>", "<cs> my lords if common land is to be deregistered i repeat that we have to await the decision on the hampshire county council case <e> <s> until we get that it would be wrong to take further action at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to help the noble baroness <e> <s> she is right in saying that agreement has not yet been reached among the various parties concerned with access to the heather commons and those lands that involve grousemoors <e> <s> the countryside commission has negotiations in hand at the moment and has submitted its own set of proposals in august <e> <s> the moorlands association has also made further representations that is why dicussions are continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords although that body might compared with some other associations be considered numerically small it is nevertheless very important <e> <s> those who pursue access to the countryside such as the ramblers and the open spaces society are also involved in the discussions and are not happy with some of the proposals put forward as understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there are certain rights of access over commons which as your lordships will appreciate are privately owned property subject to common grazing rights <e> <s> they are not common land as perhaps one might interpret it <e> <s> it is necessary to weigh the balance between access and the rights of those who derive a living from the land and who live locally <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is a separate question from the one on the order paper <e> <s> the noble lord has very strong views on this matter <e> <s> those views are not perhaps entirely in agreement with those of some other noble lords <e> <s> however if the noble lord wishes to write to me i shall be happy to try to answer him <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there will be considerably more money <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware the gross provision for local authorities is up for the fourth successive year to million for which is a per cent <e> <s> increase on this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the improvement grants to which the noble lord refers will be revised with the approval of your lordships house so that the resources that we devote to them can be better targeted <e> <s> that surely is the right way to use public sector finance <e>", "<cs> my lords a lot of people have been consulted <e> <s> all those who wanted to write to the department have had every opportunity to do so <e> <s> shortly we shall be consulting the other organisation parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the report shows that the private sector has had great difficulty in maintaining the quality of the stock to the standard to which we would have hoped <e> <s> the housing act of which your lordships helped to pass will allow the landlord to earn a reasonable return on new lettings and also contains strengthened powers for local authorities to act where properties are unfit or in serious disrepair <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell my noble friend how many countries will be attending the conference <e> <s> i hope a great many developed and developing countries will attend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his welcome of the government action on this <e> <s> it is precisely for the reasons that the noble lord has mentioned that we felt it right to call an international conference <e> <s> it will be basically for governments <e> <s> it will complement the unep conference in helsinki in april which will be looking at the possibility of improving the montreal protocol <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know at the moment but my right honourable friend the secretary of state is now in china with an invitation to them to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> we are again fortunate in this house to have many experts on this subject but we welcome all contributions from every part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord is right to point out the link between afforestation or deforestation and the greenhouse effect <e> <s> the conference next year will be dealing solely with cfcs the man-made product <e>", "<cs> my lords the technology for the most part exists and it is a question of making sure that everyone is convinced that it is being used to the best advantage <e> <s> as my noble friend so rightly said there are enormous benefits as a result of the work carried out in hospitals and universities which lead to some low level radioactive waste <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards england which is the area for which her majestys <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises an important point but i am sure that he is fully aware that those instruments which produce the waste are in most cases returned to the manufacturer for recovery and/or recycling <e> <s> a strict account of all such sources are kept by the users and the regulatory authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords those that do not need to go back to industry or to the manufacturers can be disposed of in a way subject to the authorisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> we are referring to low level radioactive waste and that is strictly defined and carefully catered for <e> <s> i am sure that some of your lordships wear luminous watches and have no hesitation in putting those in the dustbin when they go wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advisedly informed that my noble friend was seen taking a meander in st jamess park in springtime <e> <s> he observed what was going on but did not observe very much of what the pelicans were doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take that point on board and raise it with the bailiff <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the present ones do not have names because we do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that my noble friend was spotted in daylight <e> <s> however it has done the pelicans a power of good that my noble friend spoke to them in the early hours of that morning because none other than my noble friend and my noble friends lord chelwood lord rippon and lord eccles have all been involved in pelican questions in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that they laid one then either <e>", "<cs> my lords the eggs are chalky white but we shall continue to look for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish it was that simple but alas it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords the nature conservancy council has recently re-submitted to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales a case for the designation of a statutory marine nature reserve at skomer island and the marloes peninsula <e> <s> i cannot of course anticipate my right honourable friends consideration of the issues <e> <s> he will announce his decision in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right in saying that there is an outstanding objection from the sub-aqua club <e> <s> the south wales sea fisheries committee suggested the by-law and believes that it is necessary otherwise it would not have been proposed <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales will no doubt consider whether such a by-law is needed in all the circumstances before reaching his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord conveniently takes me on to another environmental matter that i shall be happy to answer <e> <s> however that is a different subject <e> <s> as regards the marine nature reserve we believe that getting the agreement of all those involved is the right way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords all interests have to be taken into account and that is why it is taking longer than we had hoped to reach agreement and consensus on this matter <e> <s> as the noble lord will fully understand a marine nature reserve is a much more difficult area to police than a reserve on land that can be fenced and people or animals excluded from it <e> <s> one cannot do the same with a marine nature reserve unless one has agreement with as many people as possible <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the delay is not due to a shortage of resources <e> <s> from memory i believe that in real terms the grant to the ncc has gone up per cent <e> <s> in the past eight years <e> <s> the delay is in order to try to get agreement between all the parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer the noble baroness on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords we always seek the agreement of as many people as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have this opportunity on behalf of her majestys government to respond to the wide range of issues raised by this very interesting debate <e> <s> i am not alone in being grateful to my noble friend lord blake for making it possible and for provoking such a stimulating discussion this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> i referred to the other bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean is right to say that there are about households which have been classified as homeless and which have been found accommodation by the local authorities <e> <s> as the noble lord will know there is a substantial programme of money devoted to the housing associations <e> <s> they have had an increase of per cent <e> <s> over the next three years in the moneys that they are to receive from the taxpayer <e> <s> that combined with the continued resources to local authorities and the improvement in local authority efficiency and the private sector should make a great dent in the homelessness figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> it is important that this matter is the responsibility of the local authorities and if they brought back into use a proportion of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has come up with an interesting idea which i should like to study with care <e> <s> however before one takes powers away from local authorities one should give them one more chance to put their own house in order <e>", "<cs> my lords if the money were used precisely for the homeless and targeted in that way it might help <e> <s> however as the noble baroness knows it is up to local authorities how they spend their money <e> <s> i can tell her that from december until just recently we had given the local authorities a further million specifically targeted towards helping the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton asks what the minister is doing <e> <s> the question is what are the local authorities doing about empty housing <e> <s> one sees vast differences between certain london local authorities which use a lot of bed and breakfast accommodation and others with virtually identical problems but which use no bed and breakfast accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a very important point about the definition of homelessness <e> <s> of course the single parent or single person particularly the young single person does not tend to qualify under the definition in the act <e> <s> that is the responsibility of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security <e> <s> i know that there are special hostels and he is looking at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is fully aware part i of the act relating to assured tenancies only came into effect on th january a week ago yesterday <e> <s> there is a lot of interest in the ability of the private sector to provide an increasing part of the market which it has been forced out of since the introduction of the rent acts <e> <s> i confirm that housing benefit is available <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed one of the problems <e> <s> the other is the need for more efficient management of those properties and a proper housing policy <e> <s> i am sure the noble viscount would wish to support that <e> <s> he will be aware that there has been no restriction on the use of accumulated receipts for capital repairs <e> <s> if some local <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord a detailed answer <e> <s> all i know is that there is a big drive within central government to ensure that when properties become available they are disposed of

the housing associations also provide housing and they are being heavily funded <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we encourage owner occupation <e> <s> i am pleased with the way the right to buy provisions have progressed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course the government consider that aspect <e> <s> but if the noble lord refers to the answer that i gave to the noble lord lord dean of beswick

that inflation is kept down <e>", "<cs> my lords if one compares the figures for the first half of with those for the first half of one will see that repossessions are down overdue loans are down and the proportion of homeless as a result of this is also down <e>", "<cs> my lords it is sometimes very difficult to keep up with the policy of the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that there is the link that the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> there was a long discussion yesterday at question time about the homeless in response to a question by the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> there are a number of other reasons such as alas <e> <s> the break-up of marriages which cause people to give up their houses <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and the government are in agreement that it is of primary importance that inflation is kept down <e> <s> there have been high interest rates before but as i said in answer to the noble lord lord dean of beswick on llth october the building societies and mortgage lenders will look at every case in order to minimise their impact <e>", "<cs> my lords we touched on that issue yesterday <e> <s> i should remind the noble lord that it is not only local councils which are involved <e> <s> provision for the funding of housing associations will go up by per cent <e> <s> in the next three years and there is also the private sector <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that one can blame the building societies in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should seriously contest that my right honourable friend the chancellor

housing corporation so that housing associations can build houses as well as the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends on a number of permutations including the time during which the person has lived in the property and whether it is a house or a flat <e> <s> the maximum discount for a house is per cent <e> <s> and for a flat per cent <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> unfortunately there are a number of local authorities which are not proceeding to deal with the right-to-buy applications as speedily as we should have liked <e> <s> i remind my noble friend that as a result of the housing act which we discussed during the last session there will now be penalties on local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is mixing up three or four very important areas <e> <s> the question on the order paper relates to sales of council houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i replied to that in answer to the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> i said that it was another question not related to the sale of council houses which is the question on the order paper <e> <s> as regards those local authorities which are not proceeding with right-to-buy applications <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord

that there is less property to rent as a result of the right to buy is quite wrongly founded <e> <s> if we look at the statistics we see that local authority lettings to new tenants in - were comparable with those of - although about million right-to-buy applications were successful <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid that i have to tell the noble lord that that goes considerably wider

consultation papers which have gone out <e> <s> as soon as parliamentary time permits a bill will be brought before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered my noble friend <e> <s> my suggestion was one that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey did not take terribly kindly to at the time <e> <s> i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> there is no ambiguity in the governments policy on the environment <e> <s> we are taking a huge range of initiatives many of which your lordships and members of the public could take up by using <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that we have commissioned research totalling in this financial year in order to show up any possible link between disease and contaminants <e> <s> that will continue next year <e>", "<cs> my lords the last occasion on which i came to the dispatch box to answer a question on this matter the noble baroness asked particularly about section <e> <s> she will be pleased to hear that the measure was implemented soon after i

has been speculation that there could be a further outbreak during the summer <e> <s> however i should like to draw your lordships attention to an article published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords concern but government funding for the maintenance of historic buildings is channelled through english heritage whose policy is to exclude cathedrals and equivalent churches from its general programme of church repair grants <e> <s> that is in line with the church of englands own view that parish churches should get priority over cathedrals which are better placed to raise substantial sums from the public and other private sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take up the noble lords point but of course it was a labour government which in came to this agreement with the church of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for raising this important subject <e> <s> as so many noble lords have already pointed out it is extremely timely that my noble friend should raise it particularly at the end of a very environmental week as the noble baroness lady white said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lords afternoon has been more free than mine <e> <s> i have not quite reached that stage of the report <e> <s> however as i said earlier i shall read it in detail and we shall be responding <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord carefully reads the debate in tomorrows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should know the answer to that question <e> <s> indeed <e> <s> i said that we are doing so <e> <s> moreover i have told him that before in this house during the pollution debate if he cares to remember <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is wrong to accuse the government of not listening <e> <s> i can tell the house the advantages of privatisation <e> <s> the separation of environmental and economic regulation from the provision of water supplies and sewage treatment work is vital if conflicts of interest are to be avoided <e> <s> only privatisation can separate ownership of the industry from its regulation <e> <s> only privatisation can unlock the door to access to private sector funds ending the present position where spending on water industry infrastructure competes annually with spending on hospitals and schools for a share of the public purse <e> <s> nothing could be clearer than the effect of the imf paymaster on water authorities investment which was cut by one-third between and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is more than his usual ebullient self <e> <s> they were merely part of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords the increases to which the noble lord refers are of course the increases of those companies that are already in private hands which supply per cent <e> <s> of the water to england and wales <e> <s> some of us can remember large increases <e> <s> in those halcyon days of and there was a per cent increase following a per cent <e> <s> increase in the same year that investment in water was cut <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a sensible suggestion <e> <s> i am happy to debate the bill at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first question i do not have control of the press or of what the opposition parties say <e> <s> no date has as yet been fixed for flotation <e> <s> that is not surprising <e> <s> one will be fixed in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are doing is stepping up the amount of money spent on the infrastructure of water to improve the quality <e>", "<cs> my lords those three questions are very different from the question on the order paper <e> <s> i hope the noble lord is not suggesting that he is against foreign investment <e>", "<cs> my lords although it was british scientists who discovered the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere we cannot solve the problem single-handedly as a nation <e> <s> it requires every single country in the world to participate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> to increase the contribution to unep was of course agreed before the conference <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why in particular broad-leaved trees are being planted on an increasing scale <e> <s> however again that is a world-wide problem <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord the leader of the opposition the question is about funding to unep <e> <s> i am very happy to take up with him the question of funding to nerc which we have covered on numerous other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords because with respect it is wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the discussions that were held in the hague at the weekend were very limited in nature because only about countries attended and there were some objectionable parts in the declaration even after it was watered down and signed <e>", "<cs> my lords legislation is required <e> <s> a new bill will have to be placed before parliament and we hope to introduce it in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords considerable progress was made but it was not until the final minutes that any kind of agreement that could form a convention was reached <e> <s> there were last-minute negotiations in which the united kingdom played a very active part <e> <s> as with many countries although we have been unable to sign the convention because of last-minute changes of wording it was a first step on the road to getting a better policy for waste in general <e> <s> these developments arose in the last hours <e> <s> because other member state ministers were there i took the opportunity to stress the importance of tackling all wastes and not just the hazardous ones <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we treat this matter as having top priority <e> <s> that is why <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we shall be able to legislate within the life of this parliament and i very much hope that it will be in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> i shall go a stage further than him by saying that any waste if it is not dealt with properly can be hazardous and that includes domestic waste <e> <s> that is why it is important to look at all the waste and not just concentrate on one category <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for the debate that he initiated the other day in your lordships house and for this question in order to make the position clear <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no new draft directive aimed at toughening nitrate pollution standards in drinking water <e> <s> however the government broadly support the recent proposal from the european commission for a directive which puts forward a range of measures designed to protect surface and groundwaters and coastal waters from pollution by nitrate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any of the supplementary questions which the noble lord asks me relate to the question on the order paper which is about the new draft directive <e> <s> however he is mistaken in thinking that there is a discrepancy between the rest of the community and ourselves indeed we all insist upon the same standards <e>", "<cs> my lords the standards are consistent throughout europe every country has difficulties in meeting the standards of the existing directive both for drinking waters and for bathing waters <e> <s> indeed i saw that there was a case in germany only hours ago where the authorities had to stop pumping up the water supply because of excess nitrates in that particular area <e> <s> as i said every country is facing problems in meeting the levels set by the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> the drinking water in this country is perfectly safe to drink <e> <s> indeed we have more connections to the mains than any other country in europe <e> <s> moreover i do not think that there is any other country in europe where one can be totally confident when drinking water out of a tap <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree <e> <s> if we have signed a directive in europe we shall honour it and other countries will also do so <e> <s> as my noble friend lord nugent said we must now improve our already good standards <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of areas at which we are looking in respect of the nitrate problem as the noble lord knows <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister for agriculture fisheries and food made a recent statement in another place on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that prevention is always better than cure <e> <s> however we face a problem at present and we must deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the water is perfectly safe to drink <e> <s> indeed i have been to norfolk on many occasions and have drunk water there quite happily <e> <s> we do conform to the standards required <e> <s> what the ec has done is to set even tighter standards and therefore we must improve as must other countries <e> <s> whether to buy bottled water is entirely a choice for the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords that is our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is well known that a number of water supplies in this country do not meet ec standards <e> <s> there has been a great deal of expenditure to meet them <e> <s> but that does not mean what the noble noble lord implies that the water is unsafe to drink <e>", "<cs> my lords as for the time of getting the beaches up to the right standard it would have helped if the labour party with a little bit of liberal support had nominated some beaches before when we took power <e> <s> we were the first government to do so <e> <s> we were again behind to start with <e> <s> we are well up to the average standard of europe <e> <s> we are the only country to have put a decent and full programme designed to meet the standards in full before the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the total cost of cleaning up the bathing waters to meet the standards in full will cost about billion <e>", "<cs> my lords on st february i answered a question about the quality of bathing waters in <e> <s> in england northern ireland and wales bathing waters out of met the standard <e> <s> that was a substantial improvement on the figures when out of met the standards <e> <s> as to a health hazard the chances of catching any disease from swimming in an area that does not meet the standards is very small <e> <s> if the water authority considers that the bathing water is unsafe i am sure that it will seek medical advice <e>", "<cs> my lords the nra will be of enormous benefit to drinking water and bathing water customers <e> <s> we seek to intensify the programme of improvements to bathing waters so that we meet the directive in full by <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord asked me three questions of which i answered two <e> <s> on the third point it is right that the water authorities customers should be responsible for meeting the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that my noble friend is entirely right <e> <s> i do not have the up-to-date situation <e> <s> i shall look into it and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords with water we are talking about virtually the same number of people <e> <s> but it is right that the customers the polluters should pay and the charge be put on to the customers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will agree with me that the bravery of the noble earl in going snorkelling in those waters is to be commended <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that most of us consume water <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i was wrong in saying that the labour party had not nominated any bathing beaches or bathing waters although the directive came into force early in <e> <s> there were three years in which the labour party could have got its act together but it did not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the beaches in caithness are of worldwide repute but my noble friend is absolutely right that there is not a nominated bathing water in caithness <e>", "<cs> my lords to a large extent it is sewage pollution from the short sea outfalls built by our victorian predecessors <e> <s> those out falls are not satisfactory <e> <s> but the long sea outfalls which are replacing them are environmentally satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a range of policies to encourage both public and private sector development <e> <s> that is shown by the fact that the number of starts last year rose by per cent <e> <s> the noble lord talked about public sector dwellings <e> <s> some were started last year <e> <s> however it is interesting to note that if the trend in the public housing starts from to had continued there would have been no public sector starts by the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there are too many houses empty in this country at the moment <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware there are well over in local authority ownership alone that should be brought back into use <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot at the moment without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords the standard of housing has improved according to the last survey of english house conditions that your lordships discussed not so long ago <e> <s> however the point of the discretionary grant is exactly that it is up to the local authority <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that we hope to change the home improvement grant system in the bill that is currently before another place <e>", "<cs> my lords overall there is not a shortage of housing in this country <e> <s> since there has been an excess of households over dwellings <e>", "<cs> my lords no because no decision has been finally taken by the tenants on a vote <e> <s> as i am sure the noble baroness is aware we have decided not to proceed with the hat in the tower hamlets area but have asked tower hamlets to come back to us with further proposals if they so wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i did <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> perhaps i may make the position absolutely clear <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for permitting me to do so <e> <s> the number of dwellings has exceeded the number of households since <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has gone very wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to remind him that we are currently reviewing all the homeless legislation and the reports that have been published <e> <s> i shall announce the governments response in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what we are doing but some local authorities have not taken it up <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the amount of empty property in the private sector is in excess of that owned by local authorities <e> <s> but it is not true in respect of government-owned empty properties of which there are approximately <e> <s> of course it was the rent law about which the labour government were so proud which denied any opportunity for the private sector <e> <s> we reversed that by the act which came into force on th january <e>", "<cs> my lords we can but encourage the local authorities it is their responsibility <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord noted the recent case which was taken to the ombudsman <e> <s> it concerned the length of the delay taken by the local authority to bring the property back ino repair <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord wishes to deny the opportunity to someone who wishes to own a house <e> <s> that is exactly why the right to buy has been so popular and why now more than million people are owner-occupiers who were not so in <e> <s> the noble lord has a point in saying that both the private and public rented sectors need support <e> <s> for that reason we have given an increased amount to the housing association and its starts increased by one-third last year <e>", "<cs> my lords with such an important measure it has come as no surprise to me that so many noble lords should choose to speak in the debate <e> <s> i am encouraged by this interest it shows that we shall be giving the bill proper examination <e> <s> i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part and especially grateful to those who have stayed <e> <s> from these benches we shall be listening carefully to the debates over the next couple of months <e> <s> building on what we have heard today i believe that we shall enjoy some stimulating arguments <e> <s> we have heard some exceptional speeches i refer in particular to those of my noble friends lord crickhowell and lord jenkin of roding with their vast experience of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is putting it back to the public where it belongs and where it can really be managed in the best way for everyone <e> <s> if the noble lord had listened to the second part of what i said that fact would have been clear to him <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained the report was not looking at the privatised water industry because as the commission said that was not within its remit <e> <s> but it commented on the model and i think that was a fairly damning condemnation <e>", "<cs> my lords i will accelerate it as fast as i am convinced that what we propose is the correct answer <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord will be aware it is better to wait for a while to make sure that we are correct than to hurry into a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a question which has been answered recently by my noble friend lady hooper <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty we have in this country which other countries in europe do not have is of course the climate <e> <s> one has to be certain that the technical risks associated with our proposals such as increased condensation or rain penetration do not counteract the benefits that could be derived from implementing the proposals for revised building standards because in that case one only requires more energy for the problems created <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not the point <e> <s> we have a very different climate from other countries in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about building regulations for new houses a very small proportion of the total housing market and representing a very small proportion of what can be saved by energy efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords provided it does not cause additional problems that have to be counteracted and remedied at a later stage at great expense with more use of energy i agree with the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords the department and i are very well aware of the houses that have been built in milton keynes <e> <s> of course we look to any ways whereby energy efficiency can be improved <e> <s> however i repeat that we must be certain that additional problems are not caused <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper relates to new building regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords no date for an announcement of the second marine nature reserve can yet be given <e> <s> of sites under consideration most progress has been made on that proposed for the area around skomer where problems relating to the control of fishing within the proposed reserve have still to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right in that there are difficulties particularly with a sub-aqua club <e> <s> the difficulty of a marine nature reserve as i know the noble baroness is aware is that it cannot be ring-fenced <e> <s> a fence cannot be put round it <e> <s> therefore one has to work out a solution by discussion and co-operation because that is the only way to obtain a lasting benefit <e> <s> of course i will pass on the concerns of the noble baroness to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord says about the delays <e> <s> obviously we wish to proceed as quickly as possible <e> <s> however i am sure he will appreciate that with something as complicated as a marine nature reserve it is essential that we get all the interests together otherwise it will take a great deal of policing which in all probability is not practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have my right honourable friends diary with me but i shall pass on the comments made by the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> as regards the menai straits the nature conservancy councils consultation paper was published in september and responses were requested by january this year <e> <s> to date letters opposing the proposal and some in support have been received <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> i cannot give that information to my noble friend now <e>", "<cs> my lords we prefer to work by consensus <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware the first marine nature reserve at lundy is working well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked a question relating to that on the order paper and i will now answer him <e> <s> i will pass on what the noble lord has said to the nature conservancy council <e> <s> however one has to take into account all the interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on how the nature conservancy council decide to apportion its work or the finances that the government have given it on a very rapidly increasing scale <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that we have certainly not lessened our commitment to marine nature reserves <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is right <e> <s> i seem to remember that he was very keen that the secretary of state should take into account all those who were in favour and those who were against the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment is to change the name of what the bill calls the national rivers authority in order to describe more accurately its functions <e> <s> my noble friend lord cranbrook has suggested that the nra is neither national because it does not cover either scotland or northern ireland nor solely a rivers authority because its writ extends to other inland and coastal waters as well as to flood defence and other functions stretching well beyond the management of rivers <e>", "<cs> i toss the ball firmly back to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and to my noble friend and i ask why they do not come forward with amendments as indeed might the noble lord lord mcintosh and my noble friend again and the noble lord lord mcnair so that we can vote on each amendment at report stage <e> <s> the one with the largest majority might take the day <e>", "<cs> that is what we want to do too <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful for subsequent speakers if i said a word now <e> <s> i do not want to shorten the debate in any way but it might be helpful if at this stage i set out our position <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is keen to get to her feet <e> <s> we are always keen to listen to her but if she would listen to me until i finished that might speed matters up because i shall deal with the point she has yet again reminded us of <e>", "<cs> as i understand it at the moment yes <e> <s> but of course that is one of the amendments which we shall discuss <e> <s> i look forward to debating it and hearing the views of my noble friend lord onslow and doubtless those of the noble baroness too <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord mcintosh will clarify the situation <e> <s> as i read the amendment it concerns all land whether it is surplus to requirement or not <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say to the committee that i agree that there is a fundamental difference of philosophy <e> <s> however it is worth recording that it is with some considerable disappointment that i noted that the noble lord discarded my offer of further discussion on this matter with a commitment to bring forward an amendment at a later stage to deal with exactly the sort of points that he now seeks to pre-empt <e>", "<cs> these two amendments focus upon the role of the nra in improving the water environment and the means by which this is to be achieved <e>", "<cs> there is a more conciliatary tone from the opposition now <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton says that he does not want a commitment <e> <s> of course i shall look at this <e> <s> i do not oppose amendment no <e> <s> and never have done <e> <s> i merely say that it is unnecessary because of the reason which my noble friend lord renton gave <e> <s> this matter is very much at the forefront of the governments mind and at the forefront of everything in this bill <e> <s> let us look at the wording between now and another stage to see whether the noble lords wording is absolutely right or whether some other form of wording is more appropriate <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i think that it is worth making one point for the sake of the record <e> <s> the noble lord referred to my noble friend lord crickhowell for the record my noble friend is not in the chamber <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would require the nra to prepare and publish at some unspecified time in the future a plan for the carrying out of its functions <e> <s> some are mentioned of <e>", "<cs> i disagree with the noble lord on this

condense those into six eight or points as the noble lord requires at this stage would be misleading and would not help the position <e> <s> when we come to discuss clauses to i hope then to be able to convince the noble lord that we should leave matters as they are <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carter has made his case with the usual overwhelming conviction and clarity <e> <s> i fully accept the rap on the knuckles <e> <s> i shall try not to let it happen in the local government and housing bill which will be the next bill which the noble lard lord <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is

environmental functions as well <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is also designed to widen the powers provided in the bill for the national rivers authority to undertake <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ezra has told the committee the purpose of these amendments is to change the nature of the regional rivers advisory committees so that they have a number of specific functions <e> <s> these additional functions relate to giving its approval for any by-laws to be made by the nra for pollution prevention under clause or for navigation under clause to designating waters for which the nra would be under a duty to establish minimum acceptable flows and to agreeing the nras programme of anti-pollution works under clause <e>", "<cs> we are all grateful to the noble baroness for explaining her amendment so succinctly <e> <s> i remind her that in december the policy statement on the nra was issued <e> <s> in that we proposed that the existing regional recreational and conservation committees be expanded into wider committees the regional rivers advisory committees <e> <s> we intend that these will be important committees bringing together all the main river interests

member of an rrac was appointed to the board of the nra these amendments if passed would mean that he or she could no longer serve on the rivers authority committee <e> <s> surely that is not right

a few words here <e> <s> the committee must be grateful to my noble friend lord nugent for so clearly setting out his amendments <e> <s> i hope it will help if i explain the reasons why the government

that companies holding appointments are able in particular by securing reasonable returns on their capital to finance the proper carrying out of their functions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to my noble friend lord stanley of alderley that i see room on the benches opposite if he feels that he is uncomfortable on this side of the committee <e> <s> i suggest to him that he reads what i said on amendment no <e> <s> a because i covered fully the two points that he raised <e> <s> i draw his attention as i drew the attention of the noble lord lord mcintosh to clause a rather than <e>", "<cs> i do not know what part of the words that i spoke concerning amendment no <e> <s> a are referred to or what the noble lord lord mcintosh said <e> <s> having been chastised by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for referring to my noble friend when i turned around he was not in his place <e> <s> perhaps we may begin that again at a later stage if necessary <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to try to elucidate further <e> <s> the noble lord will not be surprised to hear me say that we are considering very carefully what will be the appropriate rate of return for a stable utility industry in the private sector <e> <s> a final decision has not been taken <e>", "<cs> it is the amended form as in the bill <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot at this moment give the wording of the act <e>", "<cs> in that case i sincerely apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i have come equipped with thick files and now i have a book <e>", "<cs> it has nothing to do with my brief not being up to scratch <e> <s> it is entirely my fault <e> <s> i have to limit the amount of material i bring into the chamber <e> <s> i have two red files with me <e> <s> i know that those two files do not contain what the noble lord requires <e> <s> i hope to be able to give him an answer shortly <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to take the opportunity so to do <e> <s> perhaps i may start by addressing the remarks made by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i shall read to him from section of the water act <e>", "<cs> i can assure members of the commitee that it was no trouble at all indeed it was a pleasure to answer the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can reassure the noble earl lord shannon that the bill already achieves the aims of his amendment <e> <s> i think with respect that he is slightly missing the point <e> <s> clause contains the general duties on the secretary of state and the director not the duties on the water and sewerage undertakers <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i think that if the noble earl turns to clause b on page of the bill he will find the words <e>", "<cs> i am happy to give the answer not only to the two noble kinsmen on opposite sides of the chamber but to the rest of the committee as well <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley referred to section of the water act <e> <s> i am sure he will also recall similar words in section of the act <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would require the secretary of state and director general in exercising their relevant powers to promote not only economy and efficiency in the way undertakers carry out their functions but also to promote effectiveness <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will bear with me even at this late hour of night <e> <s> i want to give the noble lord a full reply <e>", "<cs> i interrupt the noble lord to make an important announcement which i am sure all members present will wish to know <e> <s> i should like to report that the dowager lady hesketh has taken towcester and district as a conservative gain <e> <s> that shows our commitment to local government <e>", "<cs> it was a liberal <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord russell said that he was surprised that the amendment was necessary <e> <s> i must tell him that it is not necessary for such an additional duty as is contained in this amendment would be otiose <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that in certain areas the standards are not what we should like <e> <s> that is why we are spending so much money in trying to improve the standards to those of the community regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second point the blue flag scheme is not only for bathing waters but for the beach as well <e> <s> the beach is very much the responsibility of the local authority <e> <s> part of the criteria for a blue flag award is that there should be no dogs on the beaches as the noble lord will know <e> <s> therefore although the bathing water might be clean the beach might be disbarred not only as a result of dogs but because of litter and <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows we give substantial sums of money to local authorities <e> <s> how they spend that money is up to them <e>", "<cs> my lords if temperatures such as those at present continue it might be possible to bathe in some comfort off the british isles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it is a tradition of this chamber that it gives particular care and attention to the protection of our environment <e> <s> with its ability to stand back and take a long-term view it is <e>", "<cs> there is a considerable amount of recreation on water authority land at the moment <e> <s> as i said it has been increased in the last years <e> <s> that too is a matter which we shall be debating <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and deal specifically with certain issues which have already arisen in the amendment that we have just discussed ending the link between the environmental duties and the functions of the relevant body and extending the duties to subsidiary companies and to others to whom undertakers land might pass <e> <s> i hope that the committee and my noble friend lord norrie will bear with me if i reiterate at greater length points that i have already made <e> <s> these are important matters that we need to set out clearly <e>", "<cs> as i understand it if the land can be termed functional that is the broad definition and could well apply in the case to which my noble friend alluded and if the water authority or plc wants that particular land but gives it to a subsidiary in the meantime it would still be classed <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend concludes let me say that i am grateful for that <e> <s> at least he takes an assurance of mine seriously <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh approaches the whole question of this and other parts of the bill under two definite misconceptions both of which he has highlighted again today <e> <s> the first misconception to which the noble lord continually refers is that profit is the prime motive <e> <s> profit is not the prime motive the customer is the prime motive <e> <s> i have previously dealt with that fact in great detail <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will not listen and that he will continue to pursue his own angle <e> <s> however i hope that other members of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am delighted and am now reassured by the noble lord <e> <s> there was a moment when i was not quite so sure <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for so clearly putting exactly the message i was trying to get across <e>", "<cs> much hinges on whether or not the land is functional which is a point i covered earlier for my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> if the land is not functional and not involved with the operations and therefore is surplus to requirements there is the assurance i have given the committee that i will be bringing forward an amendment which might involve some of that land but might not in which case there is the proper planning procedure to go through and indeed other planning <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord clarify for the committee whether he is speaking to all three amendments together <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to impose a restriction on the ability of successor bodies to dispose of land not as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said substantial land but land <e> <s> it would require that no disposal or change of use of land should take place without consultation with the relevant local authority on recreational or environmental matters <e>", "<cs> in his first reply to my remarks the noble lord concentrated very firmly on sub-paragraph b of his amendment which relates to a proposed change of use of the land <e> <s> it was quite right for him to do so <e> <s> however as he knows and as members of the committee know if there is to be a change of use of the land local authorities have to be consulted <e> <s> that is the planning law <e>", "<cs> if more than one authority is involved it depends whether they are in agreement between themselves <e>", "<cs> again that depends upon the agreement between the local authorities <e> <s> it also depends on what the noble lord means by affected by a proposed change of use <e> <s> a proposed change of use will be submitted to the local authority <e> <s> if the local authority wishes to consult adjacent local authorities because there is common ownership or a boundary is involved i am sure that the agreement will already be there as my noble friend lady blatch has said <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords argument and i shall take it to its logical conclusion <e> <s> but the intermediate step is how does one consult the local people when one goes only as far as the local authority <e> <s> i want to take the noble lords argument all the way <e> <s> he is concerned about any land that the water authorities at present own <e> <s> surely if he is to be consistent he should argue that any disposal of land including his house should be notified to the local authority to all the other owners and to the person in cumbria who might happen to like his home in lee valley park and think that the noble lord is a suitable owner but would dread the thought of me buying it <e>", "<cs> i am rather intrigued by these amendments which would in effect apply the duties under clause to land disposal including historic buildings or portable antiquities by requiring that no such disposal should prejudice the purpose of the clause <e>", "<cs> the purpose and effect of clause has been widely misunderstood <e> <s> and i am sorry to say there have been those outside this committee who as often as we have set the record straight have refused to listen <e> <s> clause is in fact a technical provision of purely declaratory nature simply making clear that the clause duties do not require recreational facilities to be made available free of charge <e> <s> it does not alter the effect of the bill it is there purely for clarification <e> <s> nor and this is an important point does it in any way alter the present position <e> <s> in practice the only result of exclusion of clause would be to mislead the unwary into a belief that the duties in the bill required relevant bodies to provide recreational facilities free of charge <e> <s> i do not believe that is not an outcome members of the committee should seek <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord would be much more disposed but he knows i cannot give him the assurance that he seeks particularly on the second point <e> <s> he will be fully aware of the concession made in another place in regard to the water authority land <e> <s> this is an area of great concern <e> <s> we have listened with interest to what members of the committee have said today and this is one of the many aspects that we should like to brood upon <e>", "<cs> i do not often take strong issue with the noble lord lord winstanley but i really was very upset by what he said <e> <s> the noble lord obviously has not taken an active part in your lordships committee <e> <s> i think he has misunderstood what has been appearing in the <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> a would be to require the secretary of state to approve any code or codes of practice rather than simply that he shall have power to do so <e> <s> the effect of the remaining amendments would be to extend the bodies to which the code of practice will apply beyond the water and sewerage undertakers <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b would extend the application of the code to the nra and the remaining group of amendments would extend the code to the nra and internal drainage boards the other relevant bodies under clause and to the owners lessees or occupiers of any land which is subject to a scheme under schedule <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help my noble friend on the first point he asked about which i think was directions to the nra or other bodies <e> <s> i refer him to clause which doubtless we shall reach in the fullness of time and which says <e>", "<cs> of course i shall read with care what has been said <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord renton was right to say that we should all take a deep breath and read the <e>", "<cs> of course i undertake to think about it <e> <s> the noble lord knows that i undertake to think about all the amendments we consider and particularly ones where concern is expressed on all sides of the chamber <e> <s> on this particular amendment it is true that two of my noble friends have expressed concern besides the noble lord <e> <s> i said that i found it difficult to follow the argument of the noble lord and that applies equally to the concern of my noble friends <e> <s> however i shall of course look at this matter again <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is peculiarly silent <e>", "<cs> the only difference between these two amendments is that the noble lord lord greenway seeks a negative resolution and the noble lord lord ross of newport seeks an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament <e> <s> i have listened with great care to what has been said and i understand the concern of your lordships <e> <s> however there are a number of points that i should like to put before the committee <e> <s> i shall of course use the argument that some noble lords anticipated that i would use about the question of time <e> <s> we want to have a code in place for the undertakers without any delay but i strongly take issue with my noble friend lord caldecote and say that that does not mean that we do not attach importance to it <e> <s> we attach great importance to the code <e>", "<cs> all the amendments in this group concern liability for compliance with the code of practice <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend would make contraventions civil and criminal offences <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> a a and b would make compliance a condition of appointment of the companies <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> a and a would make the code an enforceable statutory requirement in its own right <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment as my noble friends have so ably pointed out would be to delay the appointment of the water and sewerage undertakers for at least a year after the establishment of the nra <e> <s> i should make it clear to the committee immediately that the amendment is technically defective <e> <s> that is not an argument i often use but in this instance it is so defective that it is worth bringing to the committees attention <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is opportune for me to clarify the situation <e> <s> the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> on the advice that i have i think the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> i shall of course check because the matter has now been raised by three members of the committee <e> <s> however in my view and on the advice that i have it is clear that clause makes the secretary of state responsible <e>", "<cs> i shall answer my noble friend on that point <e> <s> i was getting seriously worried that we had arrived at day four of the committee stage without having a discussion with my noble friend on the legal drafting of the bill <e> <s> we have done that on every bill in a very happy manner <e> <s> i shall of course take the concerns of my noble friend and draw them to the attention of my advisers <e>", "<cs> i begin by congratulating the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey on bringing forward this amendment for as any noble lord who has read the bill will recognise it is totally out of place in clause which deals with the appointment of utility companies initially and at a future date <e> <s> the clause is not about the privatisation of the holding companies of the utility subsidiaries which will be successor companies to the water authorities <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment is to modify the power of the secretary of state or of the director where the secretary of state has given his consent or a general authorisation to appoint water and sewerage undertakers by subjecting their decisions to parliamentary debate <e> <s> the amendment would apply not only to the initial appointments but to replacement and inset appointments <e> <s> this term inset appointments is used to describe appointments made under clause b to make new appointments for areas which are not served by the existing appointee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i sense that he is coming towards a decision on what he might do with the amendment <e> <s> i should therefore like to take this opportunity to make a couple of points in answer to what he and the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said in his intervention <e> <s> i take great issue with the noble lord lord graham in saying that we are downgrading the interests of parliament <e> <s> we certainly are not <e> <s> the interests that noble lords have taken in the bill is testimony to the importance that we give to the interests of parliament <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> c would make it a statutory requirement that the appointed companies should pay due regard to any customer service codes of practice issued by the director <e>", "<cs> the enforcement duty for leakages and disconnections is through clause of the bill <e> <s> on the second point i am unable to answer the noble lord now <e> <s> i should like to take his point away and consider it <e> <s> as i have said there is a very general obligation which is for information only <e> <s> whether one can take part of that code out and make it more enforceable without affecting other parts of the code is something which i think needs a little more thought than i have been able to give it since the noble lord asked me that question <e>", "<cs> the effect of the directions in the amendments would be that the director could impose requirements as to the service to be provided in respect of these three aspects of service <e> <s> however i put it to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that the framework provided by the bill and the model instrument of appointment of the water and sewerage undertakers already provides a better answer <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can help the noble lord <e> <s> i understand the gist of what he is saying with regard to the amendment <e> <s> i again put it to the noble lord that the framework provided by the bill and the model instrument of appointment of the water and sewerage undertakers i refer the noble lord again to condition i cover the points about which he is concerned <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has now reached the point i reached when i answered him earlier <e> <s> his concerns are of course met because as i said it will be a requirement for a company to state its target on such matters as water pressure interruptions to supply and foul water flooding <e>", "<cs> i did <e>", "<cs> it was already on the record i said it <e>", "<cs> the amendment would specifically allow the director to be enabled to give directions about the charging of non-domestic consumers for the cost of reception treatment and disposal of trade effluent <e> <s> once again the bill and the model instrument of appointment already provide a better regulatory framework than the one the amendment seeks to erect <e> <s> schedule of the bill amends the existing legislation concerning trade effluents <e>", "<cs> i referred the noble lord to schedule and i also referred him to clause <e> <s> i repeat what i said for the sake of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> all such charges schemes will however be required to comply with the requirement in condition d of the model instrument of appointment that they must show no undue discrimination between classes of customer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords contribution <e> <s> we must realise that water is a cheap commodity in this country although it will inevitably for the reasons which i have given become more expensive <e> <s> for a -litre flush on a lavatory it costs p or thereabouts for a shower one might use litres and the cost is p and for a washing machine the cost is p <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon said that the reasons why i did not use the conservation ground argument as i might term it which was so ably put by my noble friend lord jenkin of roding was that i had seen some article that he had read <e> <s> no that was not the reason <e> <s> the reason was that i was dealing with the amendment and not entering upon a general debate about metering which the discussion on the amendment has inevitably turned into as was perhaps only to be expected <e>", "<cs> i fear that i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i was trying to give the committee a general idea of the possible nature of a system of tariffs <e> <s> a low tariff could be designed for the essential use of water <e> <s> then i gave the example of an intermediary tariff and a high tariff <e> <s> the high tariff would catch those who used an excessive amount of water <e> <s> i merely used the example of drought to illustrate a situation where someone was using a larger than normal supply of water because he was continuing to water his garden in drought circumstances <e> <s> i did not refer to a drought <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the words of my noble friend lord jenkin of roding and also for his indication that he will not move his amendment which tries to achieve the same as the governments amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his support <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh raises an important point to which i shall return in a moment <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon is absolutely right in what he says as regards the great majority of cases <e> <s> when we are talking about a new development involving increased infrastructure costs those will have to be paid <e> <s> however as i explained to the noble baroness lady nicol where somebody is not on an existing mains supply but is possibly on a private supply or is connected to a cesspit or a septic tank then there will be a connection fee <e> <s> therefore we are talking about two matters <e> <s> the great majority of what we are talking about will be new infrastructure costs <e>", "<cs> although the noble baroness despises the development it is a sign of the growing prosperity of the country <e> <s> surely in some cases that is to be welcomed <e> <s> as housing minister i am very pleased to see some houses demolished to give way to new houses better suited to the accommodation of peoples needs <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness clarifies her remarks <e> <s> but offices do provide opportunities and jobs which people want <e> <s> therefore there are both sides to that argument <e> <s> of course if there is an increase in the use of facilities which will be the case in some instances leading to a further capital cost then that will be taken into account <e> <s> the powers by which the non-domestic water supply and trade effluent services are provided which is very much what the noble baroness is talking about are sufficiently flexible to ensure that new customers for those services pay their way <e> <s> like customers for domestic water services that is water for cooking hygiene and disposal of domestic sewage new industrial and commercial connections will pay a charge <e>", "<cs> it may very well improve the environment because it may lead to a new reservoir which the noble lord wants on the flight path of a rare species of duck or geese which will winter there <e> <s> however the noble lord has a valid point <e> <s> i repeat what i said to the noble baroness <e> <s> those people will have to pay the costs <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stanley said that he feels quite strongly about these amendments <e> <s> i have never known him to move an amendment about which he did not feel strongly <e> <s> both the amendments would have quite an effect <e>", "<cs> it is not clause on its own but a combination of clause and the model instrument of appointment <e> <s> my noble friend is right <e> <s> clause which we debated at length earlier in the committee stage deals with general duties with respect to water supply and sewerage services <e> <s> one has then to look at the model instrument and at conditions b and d to tie the whole thing together <e>", "<cs> my noble friend might be paying more or might be paying less at the moment <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that my noble friend does not know where he stands <e> <s> he is deliberately misinterpreting what i said <e> <s> condition d prohibits undue preference and undue discrimination among classes of customer <e> <s> i repeat that the charge to the village on the top of the hill cannot be varied unjustifiably from what it is at the moment because of the basket in model conditon b that is his safeguard <e> <s> it is the one thing that he dislikes but it is the one thing that safeguards him <e>", "<cs> that is linked in the basket to the retail prices index <e> <s> i believe that it would be a matter for discussion with the director general who has a duty under clause a to try to avoid undue discrimination which is the concern of the noble baroness <e> <s> however let us not forget that the village on the hill might well be benefiting and have a lower charge at present than is the case in the urban situation <e>", "<cs> perhaps it was not a very felicitous phrase to use i withdraw it unhesitatingly and apologise to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to my noble friend lord nugent for setting out so clearly the intentions behind his amendments <e> <s> perhaps i may recap the effect of these amendments is to require the secretary of state to offer securities in the water authorities successor companies for sale to the public by auction or tender in a way that realises the best price obtainable <e> <s> they then require that the sums received by the secretary of state on disposal of the securities are divided between the companies and the treasury <e> <s> the amount received by the companies is to represent the value of property rights and liabilities transferred to the relevant water authority under the water act <e> <s> companies are to use their share of proceeds for purposes for which capital is properly applicable <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of newport would also divert proceeds from the consolidated fund but in this case they would be used to set up a water development fund which would be managed by the national rivers authority to fund grants to water and sewerage undertakers and local authorities for a range of purposes associated with sewage treatment and disposal water treatment works to achieve minimum acceptable flows and remedying of pollution from abandoned mines <e>", "<cs> i must admit that i found it difficult when reading this amendment to know what the noble lord lord mcintosh intended to convey by the phrase net liabilities of any company <e> <s> i wondered whether he meant that the value of debt in loan stock and other fixed interest forms should not be increased or whether he meant that the value of such debt taken with the value of equity should together not be increased <e> <s> i regret to tell him that i must confess to still not being clear about his intention <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and particularly for his further explanation of the amendments <e> <s> it helps me to a certain extent and therefore allows me to say a little more <e> <s> i think that it is worth repeating a point that i made earlier namely that debt write-off in the run-up to flotation is well precedented in other privatisations <e> <s> the noble lord seems to indicate that we are proposing something quite new <e> <s> it is a well precedented measure <e> <s> it is part of the process of putting in place new capital structures appropriate for the company to be floated <e> <s> the assets of the national loans fund will be reduced accordingly but the government will have new assets in the form of equity and debt security in the ws plcs <e> <s> in all cases equity will have to be increased because there is none now <e> <s> in some cases debt will be reduced and in others debt may be increased <e>", "<cs> i am always happy to try to help the noble lord <e> <s> i am grateful that he has found this evening rewarding from that point of view <e> <s> while there is no intention of concealing our proposals in respect of debt extinguishment i have to tell him that the amendment is not practicable <e> <s> the provision to extinguish debt is necessary to adjust company structure prior to flotation in order to achieve a successful flotation and in order to give money back to those who paid for the water services in the first place <e> <s> the necessary decisions will not therefore be made as soon as the amendment suggests but i assure the noble lord that it will be done immediately before flotation so that the adjustments may reflect circumstances at that time <e> <s> i put it to him that that is the appropriate time to make these adjustments <e>", "<cs> clause requires the secretary of state to set a target investment limit for government shareholding in each nominated holding company of a successor company not later than six months after flotation <e> <s> the clause allows this limit to be lowered but not raised <e> <s> that is well precedented in other privatising legislation <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would allow the limit to be raised <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i should like to emphasise something just in case he wants to change his mind <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> does he not realise that his honourable friend dr cunningham has told the electorate that a labour government will take it back under public ownership and public control <e>", "<cs> it totally contradicts what the noble lords honourable friend in another place has said <e> <s> the noble lord wants control <e> <s> the labour party in another place which does not seem to communicate with the labour party up here that is its look out if its members do not talk to one another wants public ownership and control <e> <s> that is a different matter <e> <s> there is of course the question which my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls raised <e> <s> he asked about compensation <e> <s> it looks as though the labour party is up to some of its worst performances tonight <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is thinking of a nice answer to that question may i ask what really is the point of the policy review <e>", "<cs> so it is a manifesto <e>", "<cs> the aggregate amount of borrowing undertaken by a group of companies to which a successor company belongs is subject to a limit imposed by clause <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to prevent any of that debt including loans made by the secretary of state while the company is wholly owned by the crown from being extinguished <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord will find it clearer in his mind when he looks at subsection which defines group <e>", "<cs> as i understand it and read it from the bill in front of me it is million for each group of companies <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords before answering i think it right and an opportune moment to pay tribute to the noble lord for his continued concern over this matter both in another place and in this chamber <e> <s> many people are grateful for the interest that he has shown <e> <s> with regard to his first point of course quite a lot is happening <e> <s> as he will be aware when the licence was renewed by maff last year it was on condition that british coal report on alternative disposal options <e> <s> these are now being considered by my department and my right honourable friend the minister for agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords second point we believe that the polluter should pay and in this case that is not the taxpayer but british coal <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the only active tipping at the moment and i stand to be corrected is in the north-east but of course we are concerned about any pollution whether on our beaches or elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer to my reply to the noble lord lord dormand about the licence that was issued by my right honourable friend the minister for agriculture fisheries and food last year and the condition regarding british coal reporting <e> <s> we are considering the situation <e> <s> there are alternatives but each one has difficulties either from the environmental or the employment point of view <e> <s> of course this is not unique in respect of the environment because there are always other considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree totally with the noble lords statement that the government have not taken any action <e> <s> of course the cry is always that the government must do everything <e> <s> however the operator is british coal <e> <s> it has taken action <e> <s> there has been quite a substantial reduction of tipping on the beaches and i hope that we shall be able to make an announcement on our consultations very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord highlights the dilemma of this particular problem with the environment <e> <s> there are other options <e> <s> in fact the humberside county council is investigating whether as an alternative the mined stone could be used to prevent erosion of the holderness coast <e> <s> however that requires a great deal of testing work to be carried out <e> <s> but as the noble lord reminded the house whatever option one looks at one finds serious problems there too <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> we begin todays proceedings with the pollution control provisions of the bill and the amendment by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey goes to their heart <e> <s> before i respond to it in detail i must necessarily refer more generally to the present position of water pollution control in england and wales and to what in this bill we are seeking to achieve <e> <s> in view of the programme before us today i shall endeavour to keep my comments short <e> <s> but for the assistance of the committee there are a few points i must make <e>", "<cs> i believe that all of us can have some sympathy with what my noble friend lord cranbrook says <e> <s> indeed the definitions in this area are unfortunately inevitably complex <e> <s> but as my noble friend appreciates we cannot start wholly anew without regard for the definitions in other legislation <e> <s> moreover we do not believe that what we have given will cause misunderstanding <e> <s> first we specifically make the point in the bill that the definition of inland water in this chapter is different from elsewhere in the bill <e> <s> secondly and perhaps more important the definition on page makes clear that inland water extends only to the fresh-water limit <e>", "<cs> these amendments concern the establishment and operation of a system of classifying waters and associated quality objectives providing the general framework for protection and management of water quality <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said that he was knocking at an open door <e> <s> i suggest that he should come right in and join us because we are already going for the widest possible consultation procedures by requiring the secretary of state to publish his proposals and consider objections <e> <s> we want to take the views of local authorities and of the ncc into account but i must reject the amendment because it does not go wide enough <e> <s> we should prefer it to go much wider <e> <s> of course those are important views but other bodies also need to be included in order to play a full part in the procedure <e> <s> that is taken care of in the bill <e>", "<cs> yes that is what i was saying that procedures are written into the bill which do exactly what the noble lord wishes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord norrie for speaking to his amendment <e> <s> both these amendments as he rightly said cover the same point namely they seek to debar the secretary of state from using his power to review objectives so as to replace an existing statutory water quality objective by a weaker one specifying a lower class of water as the goal and to require self-purification as an aim <e>", "<cs> i have to say to my noble friend lord renton that i have no strong reasons for resisting the amendment <e> <s> in fact i think it is rather a good one and that the noble lord lord addington had some good points when he moved it <e> <s> if he will withdraw the amendment perhaps he will please accept my assurance that i should like to consider the wording of the amendment with a view to coming back at a later stage to meet the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> i shall do more than bear it in mind <e> <s> i shall ask those who advise me to look at it <e>", "<cs> when i first looked at the amendment i thought it looked rather attractive <e> <s> there may be a certain justice in the effect it seeks to achieve that if a consent is breached in respect of a number of its terms those separate breaches should be regarded as separate offences <e> <s> but having thought about it a little more i find it to be inconsistent with the way in which the offence provisions are structured both in the bill and in the current control of pollution act and i suggest the way in which it is best structured to be understood and effective <e> <s> that is in the legislation in the bill before us <e>", "<cs> in a serious case it will always be open to the nra or other prosecutor to proceed on indictment when if convicted an unlimited fine or imprisonment can be imposed <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern expressed by my noble friend lord cranbrook particularly in the light of his experience with the anglian water authority <e> <s> however i wonder whether he will be convinced that clause provides the necessary powers for the nra to take emergency work measures to forestall or remedy pollution without recourse to the courts <e>", "<cs> we have already announced our intention to introduce regulations under clause to govern construction standards for silage and slurry stores which are the two most common causes of pollution from farm waste and also oil storage facilities <e> <s> under the regulations the nra will not only be able to require new facilities to meet satisfactory design standards but will also be able to serve improvement notices on farmers and others with existing installations which are thought to pose significant pollution risks <e> <s> contravention of the regulations will be an offence subject to the normal maximum penalties for pollution offences set out in clause <e> <s> thus the maximum fine on summary conviction would be or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months <e> <s> it would also be open to the nra to take the case to a higher court where unlimited fines are available or terms of imprisonment not exceeding two years <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord a guarantee <e> <s> the question of raping the women and children is something that i shall have to refer to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health <e>", "<cs> it is also a matter for my right honourable friend the secretary of state for <e>", "<cs> concern has been expressed that a discharger could add to his discharges a new pollutant not covered by the specific terms of the consent <e> <s> if a discharger does this in a way which materially adds to the noxious quality of the effluent he will be guilty of an offence unless he seeks a review of the consent <e> <s> it is always possible that a badly worded consent may mean in a particular case that an element of a discharge is not covered and that an additional element may be added <e> <s> but it will be inappropriate and indeed ineffective to seek by the terms of primary legislation to deal with issues which are for the detailed terms of consent <e>", "<cs> these two amendments refer to two significant features of the arrangements in schedule for the making of applications and granting of consents for effluent discharges <e>", "<cs> my noble friend raises an interesting problem but i wonder whether i could draw his attention to the duty that the nra will have to which it needs to have regard under clause particularly the duties of the water and sewerage operation <e> <s> i am sure that we can rely on the nra to be sensible about the type of storm overflows for example or the intermittent use of such discharges because they serve a necessary purpose <e> <s> it would <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton for explaining the intention behind the amendments as i must confess when i read them they seemed to have two alternative meanings <e> <s> now i am clear that the intention behind them is to make it clear in the context of conservation that the phrase water resources is to be taken as including associated land <e> <s> however i remind my noble friend he does not need reminding because he mentioned this fact that that duty is placed on the nra by clause <e> <s> i draw that clause to the attention of the committee <e> <s> it makes it very clear that it is a duty on the nra to promote conservation with respect both to inland waters and to the land associated with them <e> <s> i was therefore quite surprised by what my noble friend lord norrie said because he appeared completely to have ignored this important duty which was the subject of considerable discussion at an earlier stage in our committee proceedings <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord onslow said that he was per cent <e> <s> certain that my noble friend lord renton was right when he said that different parliamentary counsel had dealt with different parts of the bill <e> <s> i very nearly took a bet with my noble friend but he was engaged in something else at the time and i could not attract his attention <e> <s> he would have lost that bet <e> <s> there was one parliamentary counsel involved throughout <e>", "<cs> this amendment would place the nra under a duty to engage in a five-yearly cycle of activities consisting of surveying water resources and demands on them forecasting future demands and crucially proposing what action should be taken to meet any foreseen shortfall in resources <e> <s> i emphasise that point <e> <s> the last element is the central element because it would clearly put the nra in the driving seat in respect of matters where subsection of clause quite deliberately leaves the major responsibility with the water companies <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that what i said to the noble earl lord shannon covered the answers that the noble lord lord hylton wanted <e> <s> when speaking on that amendment i meant to draw to the noble lords notice exactly what i was saying because i thought that it covered the very point which concerned him <e> <s> if it does not i shall be happy to discuss it with the noble lord between now and another stage to make sure that he is happy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for moving this amendment which was linked and grouped with amendment no <e> <s> za <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the concern of members on all sides of the committee on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> however i am happy to assure them that the clause as drafted already achieves what the noble lord lord moran seeks to achieve in the amendment <e> <s> it is implicit in the provision that the secretary of state may act in this respect either on his own initiative or in response to representations that he receives <e> <s> i can assure the committee that my right honourable friends door will always be open to those who wish to suggest a minimal acceptable flow for any particular inland water <e>", "<cs> first with the permission of the committee perhaps i may add to what i have said on the previous amendment of the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> it was a point raised by my noble friend lord gibson-watt and i should have answered him then <e> <s> i can give my noble friend the assurance that he seeks <e>", "<cs> this amendment is aimed at securing acceptable levels of river flows and in principle i am sure that not for one moment would any of us quarrel with that objective <e> <s> what it actually achieves however is rather different and i should like to examine each of its parts in turn <e>", "<cs> i do not quite understand what the noble lord is seeking <e> <s> when i read exactly what he said in the <e>", "<cs> i compliment my noble friend on his brevity and ingenuity <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall have to take a little longer to reply to him <e>", "<cs> i hear the pleas of my noble friend lord monk bretton <e> <s> i suggest to him however that we are talking about abstractions for various purposes <e> <s> many of the items with which he is concerned the dairy herd or spray tanks could be filled up from the main supply at the farm <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with what my noble friend lady blatch has just said <e> <s> there may well be occasions when the variations to licences applied for are such that they will have no adverse effect at all on the flow of water or on other abstractions <e> <s> however the difficulty that i see with the amendment is that it gives no guidance on the size of increase or other change in a licensed <e>", "<cs> part iv of the water resources act relates only to the impoundment and abstraction licensing system which will be transferred to the nra but does not cover its wider water resource duties notably the costs it will incur in paying the water plcs for the right to control the waters contained in their river-regulating reservoirs <e> <s> there will be two to three dozen such agreements and they will be the largest single cost incurred by the nra in ensuring continued supplies of water to abstractors <e> <s> it would be entirely wrong for the nra to be precluded from passing on these and other relevant charges to those who benefit from them namely those who abstract water <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that is the situation <e> <s> i also hope that that answer helps my noble friend lord radnor <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for moving this amendment <e> <s> it enables me to say a word or two more specifically with regard to fish farmers <e> <s> clearly any charging scheme must not involve such heavy burdens as to drive fish farmers straight out of business <e> <s> but neither must it artificially protect them from paying costs from which they derive real benefits <e> <s> there will be ample time for full consultation to take place on this issue since the nra will almost certainly not be in a position to institute a charging scheme for this new group of licence holders until next april <e> <s> meanwhile i am sure that fish farmers have no need to be alarmed <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> b and offer the committee dramatically opposite alternatives to the provision in the clause that where the nra has failed to deliver any part of the sample to the occupier of the land at the time it is taken and divided it shall be sufficient if he has done so as soon as is reasonably practical thereafter <e>", "<cs> my noble friend quite rightly referred to the statement of my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another <e>", "<cs> i have before me a copy of the <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the point just made by my noble friend lord radnor <e> <s> he talked about some motorway service areas <e> <s> of course where those are proposed by the department of transport the department can acquire the land under compulsory purchase powers <e> <s> the specific example to which my noble friend lord stanley of alderley referred is i think different from that <e> <s> it is not one where the department of transport is acquiring land under compulsory purchase powers it is a non-governmental scheme <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord middleton has raised an important point which i should like to deal with fully if the committee will bear with me <e> <s> clause provides that the nra and water and sewerage undertakers may be authorised by the secretary of state or the minister of agriculture fisheries and food to purchase compulsorily land anywhere in england and wales for the purposes of or in connection with their functions <e> <s> they may also be authorised to acquire interests in or rights over land by the creation of new interests and rights <e> <s> water and sewerage undertakers will only be able to acquire compulsorily land for the purposes of their statutory water supply and sewerage functions <e> <s> the power will not be available for any other purpose <e>", "<cs> this important general issue has been before this chamber on three occasions during recent months <e> <s> it was discussed during the debate on the channel tunnel during the debate of my noble friend lord kinnoull on land compensation on th may and more recently during the committee stage of the electricity bill <e> <s> i think that it is such an important issue of concern that if the committee will bear with me i shall take this opportunity to restate the governments views <e>", "<cs> i believe that one can divide the commercial operations as i explained to my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> however my noble friends fears should be further allayed because i reiterate each acquisition will be subject to confirmation by a minister <e> <s> the merit of each will be examined with the same rigour as is currently applied to all compulsory orders <e> <s> if the companies wish to acquire land for incidental commercial projects they will need to compete in the open market on the same basis as other private concerns <e> <s> so we are talking here only about the limited types of acquisition for which compulsory powers will be available <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh raises a valid point in that he confirms what i said that we are now discussing a very much greater and wider ranging issue than that relating to the present bill <e> <s> however i believe that having spent seven and three-quarter days in committee to take minutes to try to give a full answer is perhaps not excessive <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would remove altogether the nras power to make by-laws with respect to certain inland waters and as the noble lord said when he moved the amendment would render the other amendments redundant <e> <s> i am afraid that there really can be no question of accepting it <e> <s> the nras power in subsection of this clause stems from the very real need to bring order to stretches of river where there is conflict particularly between anglers and canoeists <e> <s> we come back to the question of balance something which i have raised on numerous occasions at second reading and in committee <e> <s> here we have another example of where balance is even more necessary because the boating interests feel under threat <e> <s> however there are other interests to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a would i think it is fair to say turn what we intended to be a useful but modest provision for bringing order to rivers such as the wye and a few others into one which would almost justify changing the bills title to the water and navigation bill <e> <s> to give the nra such powers would cut right across the powers of all other existing navigation authorities including the british waterways board and many harbour authorities <e> <s> even if it were judged right at some future time to make such a provision it would have to be linked with a review of the whole of navigation law in england and wales and be accompanied by a mass of other legislation <e> <s> i therefore really cannot see how this amendment could possibly be accepted in the context of this bill <e>", "<cs> any work in the nature of pipelaying or the breaking open of a street carried out under the bill will be subject to the provisions of the public utilities street works act <e> <s> i recognise that utilities work in the highways can cause inconvenience <e> <s> it was because of concern about the arrangements governing utilities street works and their costs to the community that the department of transport commissioned the home <e>", "<cs> the new clause will require a water and sewerage undertaker to comply with a request to alter or to move its pipes to the extent that it is reasonable and i stress reasonable to do so <e> <s> we fully accept that there will be circumstances when it will be unreasonable for undertakers to move pipes <e> <s> this may well include situations such as those my noble friend suggests where the undertakers ability to carry out its functions would be prejudiced or there is no reasonable practicable alternative <e> <s> it is for this reason that we have included in the clause a role for the director general <e>", "<cs> water authorities and statutory water companies benefit from the general permission under the second schedule to the town and country planning general development order <e>", "<cs> i can understand my noble friends concern but i must say to her that her amendment would involve additional and unnecessary bureaucracy <e> <s> this is something which she would not favour <e> <s> it would offer scope for all planning applications likely to give rise to the provision of water or sewerage services or both to be referred to the water and sewerage undertaker concerned <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to my noble friend <e> <s> i thought that she had a convincing argument <e> <s> as the committee will see the amendment is starred on the marshalled list <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will permit me to take it away and consider it <e> <s> i shall be happy to discuss it with her before another stage when i hope we shall be able to agree an amendment to bring forward to cover the point that she has raised <e>", "<cs> the subject of discussion under the amendment is essentially local and specific and it would be i suggest to the committee most improper for it to intrude into general legislation of this kind <e> <s> for this reason it should not be accepted <e> <s> but before asking the noble lord to withdraw the amendment let me make within the boundaries of parliamentary propriety one or two remarks about the matter he has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords all those who took part in the committee stage missed the contribution of the noble lord when we discussed the matter at some considerable length earlier this week <e> <s> with respect i think that the noble lord has confused water authorities and statutory water companies <e> <s> so far as concerns the future of prices they will have to rise in order to meet the higher standards <e> <s> that is quite different from what happened under the labour government when prices rose investment was cut and pollution increased <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is not right to put a figure on it <e> <s> i said that water prices and sewerage costs will increase to meet the higher environmental charges <e> <s> that is why we have brought the bill before the house in order to make sure that we can meet the higher standards <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> that is why all noble lords who took part in the debates in committee regret not having the presence of the noble lord lord molloy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not put the same interpretation on the question of the noble lord lord molloy as does the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> however it is good to see the noble lord is still in such fine health <e> <s> the increases in the prices will come through a basket of water and sewerage undertakers charges and will be limited to an amount related to the retail prices index the so-called rpi plus k formula <e> <s> charges to individual classes of customers will be prohibited from showing undue discrimination <e>", "<cs> my lords we intend to stick to it and with the support of my noble friend we shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that that is not the situation <e> <s> my noble friend put it exactly right <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot give the noble lord that assurance because of the very important fact that those sources may contain elements that do not conform to the european community standard <e> <s> if they do not conform to that standard the water supply will have to be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be an increasing number of steps taken to monitor water supplies <e> <s> we are setting up a new body the national rivers authority which has an increasingly important role to play and will be able to do much of the work to create the improvements that are badly needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct the noble lord on that point <e> <s> if he turns to the chart of the select committees report he will quite clearly see that in the steep and almost straight decline in investment from onwards turns around and goes back up <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made it clear on a number of previous occasions that our intention will be to appoint to the nra board members with knowledge relevant to the functions of the nra <e> <s> last week my right honourable friend the secretary of state announced the names of people who will in due course be appointed to the nra board under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord crickhowell <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will accept that we have in these people brought together a team with a wide variety of experience who will be able to speak authoritatively on the important issues with which the nra will be concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord will find a copy of the press release in the library <e> <s> the secretary of state has said that the following people will be appointed <e> <s> dr john bowman who is secretary to the natural environment research council <e> <s> peter brandt who was a merchant banker <e> <s> peter coverdale who has enormous experience of land drainage work <e> <s> lady <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for mentioning walter bagehot <e> <s> it enables me briefly to reminisce <e> <s> i remember studying walter bagehot for british constitution a-level and i find that i still have some of his books on my shelves at home <e> <s> however i must not digress into those increasingly long ago days <e>", "<cs> my lords when the committee considered clause i undertook to reconsider the points put forward by noble lords in support of a similar amendment <e> <s> we have always made clear that the members of these committees should generally be outsiders <e> <s> the reason for allowing for the possibility of a member of the nra board being on a regional committee was that this could be useful in some very limited circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords schedule describes the arrangements for dividing the water authorities property rights and liabilities between the national rivers authority and the successor companies <e> <s> as it is drafted a scheme of transfer will detail the property rights and liabilities to be transferred to the national rivers authority the remainder without the need for detailed listing will be transferred automatically to the successor companies <e> <s> the effect of these amendments is to reverse this arrangement with only as much of the property rights and liabilities being transferred to the successor companies as is necessary for the fulfilment of its functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i found it difficult to understand why this amendment had been tabled because is is similar to one that we discussed in committee <e> <s> however that has been cleared up by the careful explanation of the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware of the unease which surrounds any transfer that is quite a legitimate concern indeed people are always concerned about such matters <e> <s> i am sure that all of us have been concerned at one stage in our lives when we have moved from one pension scheme to another <e> <s> however nothing specific on the matter has been brought to my attention nor to the attention of my officials but i can tell the noble lord and my <e>", "<cs> my lords in clause a there is a duty on the secretary of state and the director general to exercise their powers in the way best calculated to secure that the functions of water and sewerage undertakers are properly carried out everywhere <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and would make the duty narrower <e> <s> the role of the secretary of state and the director general would be limited to securing that the functions were carried out in the interests of consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord renton for that constructive intervention <e> <s> that answers many of the points of the noble lord lord mcintosh and sees straight through the true meaning behind the amendment <e> <s> i am tempted to give a short reply to the noble lord but this is an important matter i believe that it is surrounded by considerable confusion and that the waters have now become rather muddied <e> <s> i believe that a full clarification is needed <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will bear with me <e> <s> i know that those on the liberal benches who are so keen to go home will be very happy to stay so that their minds can be put at rest before they do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord ross for initiating this debate and to all your lordships who have taken part <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall have to gallop because we are short of time <e> <s> as your lordships will know the matter of homelessness is a particular concern of mine <e> <s> it has been consistently on my desk since i took over the housing portfolio <e> <s> what particularly interests me today is the emphasis laid by so many of your lordships on the need to build houses and yet many of your lordships who spoke in favour of that are also in favour of the very societies and organisations that have objected so consistently to any proposal for development of new housing <e> <s> it only serves to confirm if we did not know it already that this is a complex problem and a set of problems for homelessness that lacks any simple solution <e> <s> there is no magic wand to wave <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it will get there in any case but i can assure the noble lord and the house that i brought it to the attention of the united nations environment programme in nairobi three weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> one of the great unknowns is the antarctic <e> <s> developments there could have an enormous effect on climate change and therefore we need further research <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one of the ways however it is not necessarily the prime way <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware the energy efficiency office has done is doing and will continue to do a tremendous job <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> any combustion of a fossil fuel adds to the problem and coal is worse in that respect than either oil or natural gas <e> <s> as my noble friend will be aware we have a rather ridiculous european directive which limits the amount of gas we can burn in large combustion plants <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to which fund the noble baroness is referring <e> <s> however i can assure the house that if only other governments would commit the same amount of money to research as has this country we have the only global climate monitoring station outside the united states we might then see a little more international effort <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is absolutely right indeed i can confirm that even before he was born the same thing was happening <e> <s> some of your lordships will be aware that when my ancestors the vikings discovered greenland it was in fact green <e>", "<cs> my lords the energy efficiency offices budget this year is over million <e> <s> it has already generated a high level of awareness through a major publicity campaign and it is right that that effort should now be directed more specifically because the effect of that campaign has already become apparent <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will be aware sir crispin tickell made a major speech to the united nations explaining the governments view and their wish for a global climate convention <e> <s> we shall take every opportunity to raise the matter <e>

next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to the amendment i am sure it would be a help to the house if i were first to sketch the background in two separate and important respects <e> <s> the first concerns the general sewerage duties of the undertakers and the second concerns the governments policies for dealing with the long-standing problem of poor performance by a proportion of our sewage treatment works <e>", "<cs> my lords clause sets out the general duties of the undertakers with respect to water supply <e> <s> under subsection every water undertaker is required to develop and maintain an efficient economic and wholesome supply within its area <e> <s> further it is required to maintain improve and extend the supply network so that it is able to meet its water supply obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an entirely valid point <e> <s> it shows that little thought has been given as to how the amendment would sit in the bill as it stands <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we are back on to this same old subject and i am grateful that my noble friend has raised it yet again <e> <s> i ask him to open the bill and turn to clause <e> <s> he will see in subsection this is exactly what i told him in committee that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> with the leave of the house as my noble friend lord stanley knows full well if i offer to meet him everything is up for grabs <e> <s> i agree with him on his first point in so far as there is a change of ownership <e> <s> to me it is not really the ownership that matters what matters is getting the bill right and keeping the fairness that is there in the act and as we believe we have it in this bill <e> <s> i am happy to discuss whatever my noble friend would seek to raise with me <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think i did answer that question <e> <s> i said that i was happy to discuss anything with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what my noble friends lord cranbrook and lord balfour have said <e> <s> however i remind the house that we are on report <e> <s> my noble friend has replied to the mover of the amendment <e> <s> with respect it would have been helpful if these points had been made before my noble friend replied <e> <s> i wish to say from the dispatch box that i have noted what my noble friends have said and i shall discuss it with my noble friend <e> <s> however i think we should stand by the rules of the house on report <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said we debated this issue in committee <e> <s> then it was the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey who moved the amendment and my noble friend lord hesketh who spoke on behalf of the government <e> <s> there has been a change of bowling in the opposition <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham has put forward the arguments in a similar way to that proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> there has also been a change of batsman and i shall defend in much the same vein as did my noble friend lord hesketh <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lady blatch said this amendment was discussed previously in committee <e> <s> i appreciate that the amendments relate to the current legislative position <e> <s> my noble friends concern is that water undertakers shall not immediately after the transfer date be required to dig up and relay pipes laid under the old conditions <e> <s> i do not believe that this is the effect of the clause as drafted <e> <s> it will ultimately be a matter for the courts to determine what constitutes reasonable steps and the exercise of all due diligence in relation to any case <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have explained in earlier discussions full details of all analytical data for an area taken in accordance with the water quality regulations will be freely available to customers <e> <s> the results will show any breaches of the standards <e> <s> however i am sure that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton will agree with my noble friend lord renton that the imposition of a requirement on undertakers regularly to send out all this unsolicited information to every customer regardless of whether they want it would be a costly and time consuming exercise and thus quite unjustified <e> <s> but we are not alone in that we are anxious that customers are fully aware that they can easily obtain this information if they want it and <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i did mean free <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think that i can add very much to what i said to the noble lord <e> <s> i have given him a very full answer <e> <s> there will be more information than the noble lord originally asked for in this amendment <e> <s> it will be made available under regulations <e> <s> this will enable the customer to receive a great deal of detail <e> <s> if the noble lord wants all of that detail enclosed with the half-yearly water bill it would be considerably more than that which we receive with the rates because we are talking of a very comprehensive set of details that will be defined under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends reasons for tabling this amendment but we consider the points that they raise to be fully covered by the existing words in the subsection <e> <s> subsection states that directions may be given concerning the cases and circumstances in which authorities are or are not to exercise those powers and the manner in which those powers are exercised <e> <s> i am advised that that fully provides for directions to be given requiring local authorities to have regard to existing contracts licences and agreements governing private supplies when requiring improvements to any such supplies <e> <s> i have written to my noble friends as they kindly said <e> <s> i confirm my undertaking that such a direction will be given and to consult on its terms <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained when i wrote to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey recently subsection lb of clause provides for regulations to be made to secure that water that has been supplied to any premises is not contaminated or its quality prejudiced before it is used <e> <s> for water to have been supplied by the undertaker it has to have left the pipes of the undertaker and be in the pipes for which the consumer is responsible <e> <s> i hope that provides the reassurance that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the noble lord is correct <e> <s> however i shall want to see what the <e>", "<cs> my lords clause sets out the financial conditions that have to be satisfied before a sewerage undertaker is required to respond to a requisition for a public sewer under clause <e> <s> the person requisitioning the sewer has to undertake to pay the relevant deficit on the sewer for each of the years following the provision of the sewer <e> <s> the relevant deficit is the difference between the income to the undertaker each year from certain charges for the use of the sewer and the annual borrowing cost of a loan equivalent to the costs incurred by the undertaker in providing the sewer <e>", "<cs> my lords although i did not have time to take tea with my noble friend i hope that he has found an opportunity to refresh himself both with food and liquid since we spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care to my noble friends <e> <s> i believe they have a very good point <e> <s> i accept that the issue of such notices on tenants under subsections and might cause considerable distress to the more vulnerable members of the community <e> <s> i also accept that the water undertaker will always have the option of seeking to recover bad debts from previous landlords through the courts and that risk of disconnection has been substantially reduced now that in virtually all cases the customer in arrears will have the protection of county court scrutiny of his circumstances before disconnection can take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care both to the noble lord lord mcintosh and to my noble friend lord balfour <e> <s> what my noble friend has said reinforces me in my contention that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am beginning to be concerned about the similarity of the amendments of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and those of my noble friends lady blatch and lord cranbrook <e> <s> i hope that this will not continue for too long <e> <s> however i am glad to note that it is the noble lord lord mcintosh who on this occasion has a starred amendment <e> <s> he has obviously been influenced by my noble friend lady blatch <e> <s> i think that gives me greater comfort than a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i offer my congratulations to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> as your lordships know he has an unrivalled ability either to bring forward a debate or introduce a further debate at a later stage in the bill and he has done so again tonight <e> <s> tribute is due to him as it keeps us all very much on our toes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is essential that the government have the flexibility to create a capital structure which best suits the requirements of a successful flotation and reflects the market conditions at the time <e> <s> in exercising the powers provided by the bill to create an appropriate capital structure ministers will act properly and they will be accountable to parliament for the results <e> <s> one dimension of this will be assessing the appropriate level of debt in the opening balance sheet <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right in drawing to the attention of the house the undoubted practical advantages envisaged from these amendments <e> <s> i have to say that i am taking advice on them because they are quite complicated and raise drafting and procedural problems <e> <s> it is for that reason that i fear that i cannot accept them as they stand <e> <s> i have to say to my noble friend that it is not clear that the complexities arising from a concept of a conditional resolution can be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord elliott of morpeth for taking on board so much of what my noble friend lord hesketh said at an earlier stage <e> <s> my noble friend undoubtedly has some very sound arguments <e> <s> however i must say to my noble friend that i still have some important reservations on his proposals <e> <s> for example while shareholders are jointly members of the company and it is therefore appropriate to consider changing their rights by majority vote debenture holders have an individual relationship with the company and it is far from clear that a majority vote should override the rights of minorities unless the debenture holders have individually agreed to accept such voting provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments moved by my noble friend lord elliott of morpeth show that if one perseveres one will succeed <e> <s> it is third time lucky <e> <s> we are always keen to improve the bill and we end todays proceedings as we began by recommending acceptance of the amendment and the two consequential amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords there will not be much effect on the ozone layer but i can tell my noble friend that there will certainly be an effect on greenhouse gases <e> <s> the three-way catalyst increases the amount of carbon dioxide that a car emits because of the increased fuel that it burns <e> <s> accordingly i insisted that as part of the agreement that we reached in luxembourg the commission should come forward with proposals as soon as possible in order to tackle the gas that the present agreement does not take into account <e> <s> i shall continue to chivvy the commission until it does <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows full well just how seriously we take these matters <e> <s> although we take them seriously we shall doubtless differ from the noble lord on many occasions still to come <e> <s> i can assure him that renewables in the energy policy are considerations that the department of energy and my right honourable friend the secretary of state are looking into <e> <s> we are spending a great deal of money in researching them <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered most of the noble lords question yesterday <e> <s> i am sure that he will be satisfied by what i said when he reads the <e>", "<cs> my lords we can all do a great deal to help <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that we fit thermostats to our radiators and then turn them down that we use long-life low-powered light bulbs where appropriate that we ask about energy consumption when buying home appliances that we cut out unnecessary car journeys and take a little exercise that we keep within speed limits not only because it is good for the environment but is also safer <e> <s> finally i suggest that we use ozone-friendly products <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the house will join with me in saying how disappointed we were that the noble lord was not in the house yesterday to listen to me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> one needs a strong economy and the co-operation of all the other countries in the rest of the world <e> <s> the basis of the london ozone conference was to seek the support of other countries and to raise the awareness of the problem <e> <s> the conference was a great success <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to chide me for not answering his question yesterday <e> <s> for that i apologise <e> <s> i have not yet had time to draw it to the attention of my noble friend lady hooper <e> <s> i shall do so at the first opportunity when we have finished the water bill <e>", "<cs> my lords yes there is a depletion but there is also a depletion over britain norway and other parts of europe and people do live there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for the way in which he introduced the amendments <e> <s> as your lordships will have realised it is only amendments nos <e> <s> aa and ab which are consequential on amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> the other two amendments are not consequential on each other or amendment no <e> <s> b but the noble lord has sought to group them together for convenience of debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not reply to the point made by the noble friend lord nugent of guildford because i was dealing specifically with the amendment <e> <s> my noble friend was making a much wider point relating to the bill and to other parts of the bill that we have discussed at length <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord dormand of easington has read those accounts in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding i can only reiterate the three overwhelming considerations which in our view lead me to suggest to the house that the amendment is not an appropriate one <e> <s> first we regard it as essential that the nra should be up and running and able to advise the secretary of state as to what the objectives should be as my noble friend lord balfour has just reminded us <e> <s> in fact we debated this matter in connection with an earlier amendment <e> <s> the objectives constitute an important long-term commitment for the authority and it would be unreasonable not to have its full advice in setting them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to the noble lord lord addington as indeed we did in committee <e> <s> i can assure him that we have looked at the matter further between then and today <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton answered his point far better than i could <e> <s> however perhaps i may try to add to what my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend that in the modifications he has made to amendment no <e> <s> d as compared with the amendment he moved at committee stage he has recognised the two difficulties which his earlier amendment would have created <e> <s> the requirement for five-yearly licence reviews has been replaced with a duty to review them from time to time and the role of the nature conservancy council and the other three bodies mentioned has i think been made rather less burdensome in that they are now to be allowed only to request the nra to review a licence <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton from a sedentary position asks where <e> <s> he might refer to schedule paragraph i which covers the point that he was worried about <e> <s> briefly the bill provides that all abstraction licences granted by the nras predecessor bodies under the water resources act are to be deemed granted by the nra <e> <s> so that takes care of that point <e> <s> as the act provides that even licences of right are licences granted that was my noble friends other concern section of that act has the clear effect of allowing them to be amended or revoked either as now by the water authorities or in the future by the nra <e> <s> those who have advised my noble friend that licences of right cannot be amended or revoked except at the request of the holder are simply in error <e> <s> i think this explanation deals also with amendment no <e> <s> k since it too implies that licences of right will not already be able to be revoked or amended by the nra <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i can meet the noble lords concern <e> <s> in the bill there is the duty on the nra to review the licences in order to maintain a flow in the rivers <e> <s> the nra can review any of the licences to enable it to carry out the duties laid upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think i need to give my noble friend that assurance because it is already in the bill <e> <s> however let me look at that point because i should like to be clear on it too <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh is absolutely right <e> <s> for that reason i am disappointed that neither my noble friend lord renton nor my noble friend lord norrie who sadly is no longer present in the chamber was prepared to enter into the debate <e> <s> this is another example of the necessity to strike a balance <e> <s> it is not merely an arbitrary balance because as my noble friend will be aware the issue was considered carefully in a consultation exercise <e> <s> there have been no significant new developments which may lead us to change our minds <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i hope that we can stick to the rules of the house at report stage <e> <s> on this occasion i shall make an exception for my noble friend <e> <s> as he knows there was a consultation exercise during which all these matters were fully discussed <e> <s> i understand my noble friends concern and i know that he will take on board the concerns of those who see the matter from a different point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i immediately pay an acknowledgement to the noble lord for the changes that he has made which in part reflect the concerns which we expressed earlier <e> <s> however he has not taken on board our fundamental concerns <e> <s> we believe that this is an area in which the nra must be left to reach an appropriate conclusion in the particular circumstances of each case <e> <s> given that prosecution may follow it is surely supremely an area where discretion should be left to the enforcement authority and where the appropriate steps should be decided on a case-by-case basis <e>", "<cs> my lords it is intended that a general authorisation will be issued to each undertaker and to the nra requiring disposals to be made in accordance with the crichel down rules <e> <s> so far i think that we are all on the same side <e> <s> however i must now put a stop to the unseemly behaviour of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey who wishes to get back into favour with my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> i hope that he realises that this amendment is not really about the principle of disposal it is about the price to be obtained in a very limited set of circumstances <e> <s> indeed i suspect that the amendment is really more about the compensation payable on compulsory purchase which we debated fully in committee than it is about disposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that my noble friends amendment is concerned only with the limited case where land has been acquired for a statutory purpose and is then disposed of because it is no longer needed for that purpose but has acquired value because it can be used for a commercial purpose which is incidental to the statutory purpose <e> <s> but it is unlikely to be the case that land will simply become surplus and available for an incidental <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be aware that water authorities are currently able to lay pipes after serving reasonable notice on the owners and occupiers of the land through which the pipes are to run <e> <s> the consent of the owners and occupiers is not needed <e> <s> we have decided that these powers should be retained by the nra and water and sewerage undertakers for public health and operational reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but can he give me the reference again <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly have a look at what the noble lord has said and seek advice on the point that my noble friend makes <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said the principle we are discussing is precedented in the telecommunications act <e> <s> that legislation does not restrict the obligation in the way that this amendment proposes and i am not persuaded that the position of water and sewerage undertakers is so different as to warrant a different approach although i accept that the question of pipes in streets is less straightforward <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord trafford asks for an assurance <e> <s> obviously i should like to read with care what he has said before i give that assurance particularly at this hour of the night <e> <s> however let me confirm to him that there is already a great deal of flexibility in chapter v of part ii of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords part iv of the bill includes various provisions under which the national rivers authority water undertakers and sewerage undertakers may compulsorily acquire ownership of or rights over land <e> <s> the owners of such land are compensated under the terms of the compensation code <e> <s> in the case of compulsory purchases under clause and also the acquisition of interests in or rights over land under clause the provisions of the compulsory purchase act are applied by schedules and respectively <e> <s> among other things these provisions give the landowner the right both to an advance of compensation prior to the final amount being settled and to interest on any compensation which has not been advanced from the date on which the claim arises and the date on which the final payment of compensation is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only apologise to my noble friend lady blatch if i have sown confusion in her mind <e> <s> it was not intentional and i assure her that there was no discrepancy between what my noble friend lord arran said and what i said on previous occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it does <e>", "<cs> my lords we already give considerable support to kenya <e> <s> we have three expatriate staff in the wildlife department <e> <s> we also provide spares for vehicles and radios and other equipment <e> <s> i asked mr leakey who has taken over the department if he wanted any further vehicles or spares would he please bear britain in mind <e> <s> we should consider any request that was made <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to influence from this country the export of whatever product it may be from other countries <e> <s> it requires the world to say we dont want to import ivory any more <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships have read in the press today as i have done and i am waiting for clarification that japan has banned the import of worked ivory and raw ivory which does not come direct from the african producer countries <e> <s> so already the action which we have taken has had effect elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the matter on which i am waiting for clarification <e> <s> certainly if what i read in the press is right japan bans the import of raw ivory other than from a producer country <e> <s> i do not believe that there are african elephants alive in hong kong so there would be an <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right to say that there is a need for rented housing <e> <s> it applies across the whole country <e> <s> that is why we have undertaken a number of schemes <e> <s> we have certainly taken action in the rural areas where we have made three initiatives to produce low-cost housing which have been widely welcomed <e> <s> there is the freeing of the private sector to take advantage of the new opportunities there is the bes scheme which has produced over million already for assured tenancy lettings and there is something that we must not forget namely that best use should be made of public sector dwellings both by central government and local government <e>", "<cs> my lords we are acutely conscious of the need to provide housing at rents that those on low incomes can afford <e> <s> that is why we have specifically asked the housing corporation to allocate more resources in that area <e> <s> we have given them more resources an increase of per cent <e> <s> by to billion <e>", "<cs> my lords the help we are giving through the housing associations will soon be units a year which is more than four times greater than a year ago <e> <s> the noble lord should not only be considering the subsidised housing through the housing associations <e> <s> we have opened up a wide range of opportunities for local authorities to help in various ways as well as the private sector <e> <s> one must not exclude those opportunities i hope that advantage will be taken of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has covered two points <e> <s> the first concerns the number of dwellings that come on to the market each year <e> <s> last year there was the highest number in total for years in the private sector the figure was the highest since <e> <s> that is very encouraging <e> <s> last year saw too the highest number of first-time buyers for years two-thirds more than the number we inherited in <e> <s> with regard to mortgage repossessions as i am sure the noble lord knows the total number is very tiny <e> <s> it is less than one-third of per cent <e> <s> of all mortgages granted <e> <s> the latest figures show a decline in repossessions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not at all rest on my laurels <e> <s> i appreciate that there is more to do <e> <s> i gave the house some very useful figures showing where there had been enormous increases <e> <s> i appreciate the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that he was fully answered last week by my noble friend lord hesketh <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the market is flat in certain areas and certainly not as buoyant as it has been over the past three years <e> <s> that is not surprising <e> <s> however the mortgage interest rate fluctuates <e> <s> of prime importance to all those who rent or buy is that we control inflation <e> <s> that is the most important point <e>", "<cs> my lords there is private sector housing available and increasingly so i am glad to say to relieve some of the stress areas <e> <s> we have given the housing corporation extra funds specifically to deal with those areas where low cost housing is required <e> <s> we have therefore varied the grant rates in order to bring in private finance to make the public sector money go further and therefore obtain more houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted by the sale of council houses <e> <s> people rightly aspire to own their own house and should be able to do so where it is built with public funds <e> <s> the noble lord misinterprets the situation <e> <s> a family who were paying rent may now have bought the property but it does not mean that that house is lost to the market <e>", "<cs> i believe my lords one million <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point <e> <s> some of the evidence that we have received in the course of our review on homelessness has shown that because of the priority list created under the housing homeless persons act which was introduced by the noble lord lord ross of newport those on the traditional if i may call it that council house waiting list find that the creation of a priority group means that other families in that group come in front of them on numerous occasions <e> <s> evidence has been brought to us to show that that creates some resentment <e> <s> so far as new <e>", "<cs> my lords the audit commission has made a number of very important points which we are assessing at the moment as have a large number of other organisations <e> <s> we are assessing that data and hope to come forward with our report as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness misinterprets the situation <e> <s> we are encouraging local authorities to improve their stock and capitalised repairs are not subject to any financial controls <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw this reasoned amendment to the third reading motion last thursday i wondered whether it signified that the noble lord had run out of amendments <e> <s> perhaps i thought he has decided to put all of his amendments into one and debate them at the start of todays business <e> <s> i was not far wrong in that guess because he has touched upon many of the amendments which he will be moving later <e> <s> however i was disappointed in my original thought because on friday morning he put down many more amendments <e> <s> i was also saddened because the noble lord among many of your lordships has had great influence in changing much of the bill <e> <s> indeed no fewer than groups of amendments today alone are designed to meet your lordships concerns <e> <s> i must say that this is not an amendment in the usual constructive terms which we have come to expect from him <e> <s> it is little more than a ritual hand-wringing before we can move on to the business of revising the bill which is our duty <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> it is true to say that this is the most difficult debate which i have ever had to sum up <e> <s> it is part second reading part a re-run of the debates on amendments we have already discussed part a preliminary encounter with the amendments we shall discuss this afternoon and part bill do now pass <e> <s> perhaps i may touch on three themes which came out of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said amendment no <e> <s> is identical to the one tabled by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley at report stage <e> <s> it was discussed with a similar amendment to clause which was tabled by the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment would require that charges schemes made under clause provide only for charges to be set so that the same level of charge is fixed for the same level of service throughout the area of the undertaker <e>", "<cs> my lords this was exactly the point i made at report stage <e> <s> what does the noble lords amendment mean <e> <s> does it mean the same level or does it mean the rateable level <e> <s> it could very well be argued that the pence per pound of rateable value is the level that should be levied <e> <s> there is the very conundrum that made it so difficult for me to accept the amendment of my noble friend lord stanley and why i am happy to recommend to the house that his revised amendment on clause is the one that should be accepted because it covers the point that he was so concerned about <e> <s> i should <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord gallacher has just reminded us this amendment takes us over familiar ground <e> <s> it has the same weaknesses as similar amendments moved at earlier stages <e> <s> it is both too wide and too rigid <e> <s> i put it to the house that the outcome of the amendment would be wholly undesirable <e> <s> despite the major efforts made by the noble lord to meet the comments of my noble friend lord hesketh i pay tribute to him for that i contend that the amendment would impose unreasonable limitations on the circumstances in which a company may recover its costs directly from those who benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments would introduce new procedures in the case of sssis and national parks <e> <s> for simplicity i shall confine my response to the case of national parks although the points apply with equal force to sssis <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh has developed arguments that he first put forward at report stage in relation to the licensing of supplies <e> <s> but i must say that notwithstanding the major attempts that he has made to alter his amendment i credit him for that our objections in principle to a farther tier of regulations for private supplies remain <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much in the amendments which we already have in mind to apply to the technical assessors or the drinking water inspectorate as we are now calling it <e> <s> i set out some of the tasks which we envisage for the inspectorate when we discussed the topic on report <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh has clearly taken what i said to heart and has elegantly re-presented these tasks in the proposed subsection a in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i confirm to him and the house that it is our intention that the inspectors should monitor compliance with the drinking water regulations and with the other duties concerning water quality set out in part ii of the bill <e> <s> we will also want them to monitor improvement programmes and advise the secretary of state in connection with his enforcement duty in clause <e> <s> they will also need to liaise with local authorities and carry out a certain amount of check samplings and analysis <e> <s> indeed this is all provided for in the existing clause as my noble friend lord renton has just reminded the house <e> <s> the only additional matters brought in by this new subsection are the reference to the director general and the use of the word shall in relation to the tasks of the inspectors <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments seek further to protect the interests of customers and i must say that the existing provisions are already adequate to meet the noble lords concerns <e> <s> i base my argument on two points <e> <s> first the customer is protected from excessive increases in charges by the terms of the bill itself which lays down the way in which the secretary of state must act in setting charges initially and similarly the responsibilities of the director general subsequently <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> however that implies no discourtesy to my noble friend or the house <e> <s> in moving the amendment my noble friend told the house exactly how i would answer it <e> <s> i think we can both award ourselves out of for perseverence with the same arguments and nought out of for bringing forward any new arguments on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the third occasion on which we have debated this issue during our consideration of the bill <e> <s> i have to say that although i very much appreciate that my noble friend lord radnor has again tailored his amendment to meet the remarks i made on report the effect of his latest amendment would be to impose extremely cumbersome arrangements on the secretary of state and water and sewerage undertakers which would to a large extent defeat the object of the pipe laying powers <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the code of practice will be mandatory and the powers will be subject to the oversight of the director general rather than the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what my noble friend lord trafford has said because with respect i believe that some of your lordships followed speaking notes prepared before i had spoken <e> <s> a great deal of what i said covered and met the concerns subsequently raised by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords at eight minutes to three on the afternoon of th april we set out in your lordships house to consider the second largest bill in living memory <e> <s> i said then that the main purpose of the bill was to restructure the provision and regulation of water and sewerage services in england and wales and to enable the privatisation of those services <e> <s> i said that the bill would be a good one for consumers and for <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> it is becoming a pest in various parts of england and indeed also in the principality of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my knowledge of weeds and grasses is perhaps not as good as it should be <e> <s> however i know that in the s it was known as hancocks curse <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> we want more diversity in our housing market <e> <s> to date there has been a great deal of restriction <e> <s> there has been either owner occupation or council house tenancy <e> <s> many of those who have been on the waiting list have said that they want diversity more choice and more opportunity <e> <s> that is what the act gave them <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall not know what the true situation is until a detailed survey is done <e> <s> we are considering how that can be done <e> <s> we may well be able to use the opcs survey which is associated with the labour force survey <e> <s> that is something that we need to keep under review <e> <s> with respect the noble lords question goes wider because homelessness is part of housing <e> <s> in providing an opportunity for someone to rent which was not there before the act one is relieving pressure elsewhere in the system <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for raising that important point <e> <s> as he will be aware we are the first government to have designed a package for rural housing <e> <s> it involves changes in the finance act which my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer has brought forward and it has meant changes to the planning system so that for the first time land can be set aside for low cost housing for local people <e> <s> extra funds have been made available to the housing associations to enable them to take advantage of the new climate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in that question from the noble lord <e> <s> he said clearly that it would be the local authorities in conjunction with the housing associations <e> <s> that is a major step forward it is what we are seeking to pursue <e> <s> there is a role for the local authorities which have about million properties of their own <e> <s> many need repair indeed many are now receiving repair <e> <s> there is due provision for the housing associations and there is the private rented sector housing <e> <s> under the local government act the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to tell the house and to reassure the noble lord that he is wrong on this matter <e> <s> capital expenditure on housing this year will be billion <e> <s> that is per cent <e> <s> higher than previously planned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has taken a specific item and i am unable to check his figures from this position at the moment <e> <s> perhaps i may re-emphasise that the total capital expenditure for local authorities and housing associations is per cent <e> <s> higher than previously planned this year <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware there has been a substantial increase in funds to the housing corporation <e> <s> by we expect its funds to be per cent <e> <s> higher than now <e>", "<cs> my lords the statistics that i gave show that funds have not been cut <e> <s> they have been increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons reasons and amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords of the or so amendments that your lordships made to the bill the other place have disagreed with only six covering just two groups <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will agree that that is a clear indication of the value of our work as a revising chamber and of the many important modifications that your lordships have made which will pass into legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendents nos <e> <s> to to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to

any noble lord who had succeeded in the way that my noble friend has would not have felt any differently <e> <s> i hope that the house will agree that we have been able to meet my noble friend a great part of the way although perhaps not as far as he would have liked <e> <s> we have made every effort to meet him on the points that he raised and we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hunt has asked me a number of questions <e> <s> the first thing to point out is that the ncc is entirely responsible both for the selection and the declaration of nnrs <e> <s> i am not quite sure therefore what the noble lord means by statutory responsibility <e> <s> the ncc is statutorily responsible for all nnrs <e> <s> the great preponderance of national nature reserves are already in private hands <e> <s> there are some in the country whereas those wholly owned by the ncc amount to only <e> <s> that is about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is i know aware as i hope the house is now aware that we have increased the funding of the ncc by per cent <e> <s> in real terms since <e> <s> that is a substantial increase <e> <s> every year we discuss finance with the ncc but it is up to that body to allocate its programme having been given the sum of money as it thinks best <e>", "<cs> my lords the per cent <e> <s> increase was in real terms <e> <s> i am sure that very few of your lordships would have predicted in that the ncc would receive such a substantial increase in real terms <e> <s> however the amount paid to the ncc continues to go up <e> <s> last year it was million this year it is million <e> <s> the job of the ncc is now altering slightly <e> <s> it has spent many recent years the noble baroness knows this full well renotifying sssis <e> <s> that work is coming to an end so the programme is shifting <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know of a single body with which i have been associated that has not said to me that it does not have enough funds <e> <s> there has been a substantial increase to the ncc <e> <s> we are very grateful for the work it has done <e> <s> it has done a very good job <e> <s> the future for conservation in this country looks extremely bright <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what delay the noble lord lord winstanley is concerned about <e> <s> further work is needed on the report <e> <s> in the meantime the nnrs most of which are sssis or likely to be designated as such are receiving protection <e> <s> however they are the very special sites <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> of course we appreciate the very valuable work not only of private owners and those who have nnrs on their land but also of some of the voluntary bodies <e> <s> that is why out of about hectares some are not in ncc hands <e> <s> they are very well protected under present arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i take issue with the noble lord <e> <s> we have never said that the private sector cannot do just as good a job as the public sector in this regard <e> <s> many of us go to places throughout this lovely country of ours which we thoroughly appreciate and which are in the hands of private owners <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously we shall look at that situation if it arises <e> <s> as the noble lord knows full well it is with government approval that the ncc funded the rspb to buy part of abernethy forest <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had discussions with the ncc <e> <s> however it is an ncc paper and it is right that the ncc should have the discussions rather than the government <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord seeks the opinion of the committee i ask him to consider the fact that my noble friend has offered to reconsider <e> <s> i have listened to the arguments and i too should like to reconsider all the amendments <e> <s> i hope that in view of the fact that we have reconsidered many things in the past and that we have now offered to reconsider the matter the noble lord does not wish to seek the opinion of the committee at this hour <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> however i can assure him that i should like to look again at the whole matter including his amendments nos <e> <s> and in the light of the circumstances and in view of the arguments which members have put before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the situation to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> however i know that he will understand that i cannot comment on that because of the investigations being undertaken by the cumbrian police <e> <s> as a matter of principle i am sure that i share the view of all your lordships that the illegal killing of all species of birds especially those which are rare and vulnerable is deplorable the more so when wanton cruelty is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i reassure the noble lord that considerable discussions already take place particularly between the ncc the rspb other interested bodies and the police authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not a national countryside commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord touched on the very important question of habitats <e> <s> i believe that he was referring to the special protection areas in the birds directive <e> <s> those are a subset of the sssis sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> over sites are now designated <e> <s> that is the major work undertaken by the ncc and that covers million hectares <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure from where the noble lord obtains his figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the penalty under the act is a fine of but for more endangered species under schedule it is up to <e> <s> according to the home office which collates the statistics for enforcement under section of the act for the three years up to the last year for which figures are available there were prosecutions <e> <s> that figure excludes the private prosecutions that might not have been recorded <e> <s> of those that is per cent <e> <s> were successful <e>", "<cs> my lords we continually look at our list of endangered species but we rely on advice from the ncc on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question takes us a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i draw to his attention that there is an unstarred question next week on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord knows of any occasion where the act has not been enforced i hope that he will draw that to my attention <e> <s> however from the letters i receive particularly from racing pigeon fanciers some birds on the endangered species list are considered to be pests <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great care to what the noble lord said <e> <s> i can only apologise again i shall certainly draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way and for reminding me of the labour governments record <e> <s> i did not mention investment <e> <s> i said that the labour party did not implement many parts of the control of pollution act which related to water <e>", "<cs> he was the chief secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords before i formally move the next stage of the bill i hope that your lordships will permit me to say how grateful i was to hear the kind remarks which were made <e> <s> i realise that i have a great deal to learn in order to live up to the high standards set by my predecessors in my new office <e> <s> i shall certainly endeavour to meet those standards <e>", "<cs> i think that point has been covered in detail before and will doubtless be covered when we come to part vi of the bill <e> <s> i must confess to a feeling of slight disappointment in that i shall probably not be available to discuss part vi of the bill with the noble lord <e> <s> however the noble lord lord dean of beswick raises the important point of housing expenditure funded from allocations <e> <s> this is precisely what part iv will tackle <e> <s> it will enable us to increase the proportion of expenditure allocated through credit approvals <e> <s> that is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> i sincerely hope that local authorities will continue to improve their management performance <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why we shall bring in management performance indicators <e> <s> there is more to it than as the noble lord has suggested capital expenditure and capital improvements there is renovation and management <e> <s> for the adc now to say that it must treat its tenants as customers only goes to show that the housing act last year and this bill are pushing local authorities housing associations and private sector landlords in the direction of better performance <e>", "<cs> there is mortgage tax relief <e> <s> i also mentioned housing associations <e>", "<cs> the concept of the credit arrangement is of prime importance in the new system and i hope that members of the committee will bear with me while i explain the rationale behind it <e> <s> we start from the position that borrowing and transactions which have the same economic effect as borrowing should be controlled <e> <s> credit arrangements are in simple terms transactions which although not borrowing in law have the same economic effect <e> <s> for example an authority might on the one hand decide to borrow to buy the freehold of a building <e> <s> it might then make annual loan repayments of <e> <s> on the other hand it might take a long lease on a building at a rack rent of per annum <e> <s> the legal definition of the transactions is not the same but the economic effect is clearly similar <e> <s> in both cases the authority gets possession of a new building but pays for it over a period of time which is equal to or less than the life of the asset <e>", "<cs> i am happy to confirm to my noble friend that in clause n is meant to be a power <e> <s> i shall look at the warding and the formula to see whether it can be made absolutely clear since he has raised this doubt <e>", "<cs> the amendment would exclude capital receipts from the present system from the definition of capital receipts in the new system <e> <s> instead they would be fully available to be spent in the new system <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord ross of newport for his kind words in introducing the amendment <e> <s> i was interested in the speech of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i wondered whether he would turn to his ama brief on this amendment as that would have been of interest to the committee <e>", "<cs> my answer is to the adc brief which i thought the noble lord would be picking up on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am interested in my noble friends point <e> <s> i am sure that he will agree that we are talking about a mismatch of needs and resources <e> <s> that is the achilles heel of the present system <e> <s> we hope that it will not be the achilles heel of the proposed system <e> <s> that is the idea and why we have proportioned the figures in the way that we have <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i explain the rationale behind clause <e> <s> one of the principles underlying the new capital finance system is that when local authorities dispose of capital assets they should make provision for debt redemption <e> <s> i should draw the committees attention to the fact that local authority debt stands at about billion and is still rising notwithstanding the overall reduction in the council housing stock brought about by the success of right to buy <e>", "<cs> i always try to please the noble lord <e> <s> the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has reminded the committee this matter was raised in another place <e> <s> my argument is much the same as the argument made there <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord has said <e> <s> however i go back to the principles of the precise terms of the agreement whether they are pure planning agreements or development agreements <e> <s> on the pure planning side such agreements do not fall within clauses to <e> <s> if there is a development gain in it it is quite right that it should be taken into consideration because it is a barter deal <e> <s> the local authority has disposed of an asset and has received a benefit in return <e> <s> that should be taken into account <e>", "<cs> in a perfect world the noble lord is right <e> <s> however i am certain he will agree that notwithstanding their auditors comments and reports certain authorities have in practice allowed bad debts to run on indefinitely <e> <s> it is right that we should draw the line where we have <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i cannot be more precise in order to satisfy the question of the noble lord <e> <s> he must wait for the autumn statement as must the rest of us <e> <s> as regards interest rates i should be happy to discuss them although they are rather a separate matter <e> <s> however unit labour costs are very important <e>", "<cs> my lords three-quarters of the current deficit that we are encountering at the moment is due to investment coming in from overseas <e> <s> that in turn will make enormous inroads into reducing the deficit in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords in particular the figures of the past three months or so have been distorted by the large number of cars that have been imported <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i missed most of what the noble lord asked me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> that is one of the significant differences between the deficit that existed under the party opposite which was due to gross overspending and the current deficit which has nothing to do with the government but is a private sector deficit <e> <s> however the paying off of debt will be a great relief on the burden on our children and grandchildren <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord will appreciate from his own recollection forecasting is a difficult science <e> <s> regarding the deficit only about one-quarter of the growth in the value of manufactured imports less erratics between the two latest -month periods is accounted for by consumer goods including cars with the remainder fully three-quarters made up of goods production and investment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has stated the obvious <e> <s> i am happy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords first question takes me into the area of forecasting which i am not prepared to enter into <e> <s> regarding the second question i believe that the balance of payments will improve <e> <s> however as my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer has said it will be one of the last items to show improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first question is no <e> <s> the answer to the second is that the government always act in unity <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that world currencies are shunning this country <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord i do not have the advantage of having served on that committee <e> <s> if i understood the basis of his question correctly i think that the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> the government are not running a deficit they are running a surplus <e> <s> but there is a deficit due to the activities of the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord the leader of the opposition will agree with me that when it is right to make a decision even though that decision may be very unpopular in certain areas that decision should be made <e> <s> it was right for my right honourable friend to make that decision <e>", "<cs> first i wash to say how nice it is to see the noble lord lord evans of claughton back in his place <e> <s> it is good to be debating with him again we have missed him <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said when introducing the amendment this new clause is concerned with the nature of the housing revenue account itself <e> <s> the question of what <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> unfortunately i regret that i cannot give the matter the consideration i might have done three months ago <e> <s> however i know that my noble friend lord hesketh has taken careful note of that point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> i did not respond to the detailed points he raised because of the discussions which are taking place <e> <s> i do not wish to pre-empt those discussions <e> <s> if i can be of any further help i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> it is right that he should be made aware of the result of the discussions and i shall ensure that that happens <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord mcintosh would like to speak to his amendment amendment no <e> <s> db at this stage <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross said it covers much the same ground <e> <s> alternatively he may wish to take it separately <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for kindly speaking to his amendment now <e> <s> that will make discussion on the common point easier <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may have made a mistake in inviting the noble lord to speak on the amendment <e> <s> however it has been most helpful to have the discussion <e> <s> i take on board the reservations which he has made <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to calm his fears on many of them as we continue to discuss the rest of the amendments which he has tabled because they appertain to this matter <e> <s> indeed the more we discuss the hra the clearer both sides will be as to what is the position <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i misled the noble lord i did not mean to go on to mention housing associations <e> <s> i was referring to local housing authorities <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would benefit the committee if i were to spend just a short time going into the principles underlying these proposals <e> <s> i believe that it may be of assistance <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may try to explain a little further <e> <s> we are trying to put the local authority in the same position as any other landlord because that is the best way to achieve the efficiency and management competence that we seek <e> <s> i was purely illustrating that there was a big problem with a small number many were doing a very good job <e>", "<cs> we have gone off at a slight tangent to the main discussion by mixing up arrears and write-offs <e> <s> arrears are not the same as write-offs <e> <s> authorities will still have plenty of flexibility to help people who have temporary difficulty with paying rents <e> <s> these temporary difficulties do not affect the hra at all <e> <s> the costs only fall on the hra when the authority thinks that arrears may be uncollectable <e>", "<cs> they also provide for bad debts <e> <s> that is normal business practice and that is what we hope local authorities will be doing <e> <s> most authorities already do write off rent arrears to the hra just like a business writing off its bad debts <e> <s> a few <e>", "<cs> of course i have seen accounts but we are putting local authorities into the same position as other landlords and the building societies because the costs are passed on <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that we do not receive a letter explaining why the service charge or whatever has gone up but the costs are passed on <e>", "<cs> there are a number of ways in which it happens <e> <s> the new incoming tenant often has to take on that extra cost <e> <s> but the cost is passed on <e> <s> what we are seeking to do in future is to ensure that those few local authorities which have not carried out the work with the efficiency that we expect of them will no longer be able to carry on the pretence that the built-up arrears are collectable <e> <s> they will be forced to make an appropriate write-off <e> <s> if they do so before st april the cost can go either to the hra or to the rate fund <e> <s> that is the current system <e> <s> if they wait until after st april they will not be allowed to charge the cost to the hra <e> <s> that ensures that the ring-fenced account starts with a clean sheet <e> <s> thereafter the build-up of arrears is a cost of inefficiency and just like any other inefficiency it has to be paid for out of the hra <e>", "<cs> i can only apologise to the noble lord lord tordoff for not having made myself clear <e> <s> i thought i had clarified that we were putting the local authorities in the same position as other landlords or other businesses <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord dean has misunderstood the situation <e> <s> we are saying that if a council wishes to write off as a bad debt the arrears that it has not collected and does so before st april next year the costs go either to the hra or to the rate fund <e> <s> therefore they can be written off <e> <s> we are saying that in future under a ringed-fenced hra that should not be permitted <e>", "<cs> the committee may recall the argument deployed by the noble lord lord dean of beswick because this amendment harks back to a debate in committee some weeks ago on part iv of this bill and in particular clause <e> <s> in that debate the noble lord lord graham argued that the effect of the bill as drafted would be to discourage local authorities from disposing of housing land to housing associations at an abated price in return for nomination rights <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean of beswick has followed the same sort of argument this evening <e> <s> i am pleased to tell him that we have thought over this matter and we now propose to introduce an amendment to part iv at report stage empowering the secretary of state to make regulations by which he may among other things relax the debt redemption requirements in respect of certain non-monetary considerations received by authorities <e> <s> the relaxation could be applied generally by regulations or in specific cases requiring his consent by direction <e>", "<cs> i have spoken to this amendment with amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> i am not sure that i can add much to what i said then <e> <s> if there is anything specific which he seeks i shall try to answer him <e>", "<cs> i understand that we are dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> dc and le <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> dc would include certain extra items or credits in the housing revenue account <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> le would then exclude those items from the calculation of subsidy <e> <s> i should repeat that we intend schedule to provide a comprehensive list of the credits and debits in the hra <e> <s> in fact we intend it to be an exclusive list <e> <s> anything which is not provided for in the schedule will not be allowed to be credited or debited to the account <e> <s> against this background i can quite understand the reasons for amendment no <e> <s> i dc <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean wishes to be quite sure that interest on cash balances and on the reserved part of receipts can be credited to the account <e>", "<cs> i understand that the decision will be made in the near future <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will wait on tenterhooks until then <e>", "<cs> i understand that is the case <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is more than his usual persuasive self <e> <s> until i had thought about it carefully i was almost tempted to agree with his so-called modest improvement <e> <s> however if the amendment is looked at in another way it will be seen that it undermines one of the foundation stones of the new financial regime namely the ring fence around the hra <e> <s> it is not such a modest improvement as he would lead us to believe <e>", "<cs> i think i can see the point of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> it appears to be concerned with providing that authorities are able in to charge to the repairs account items which they had previously charged to the housing revenue account <e> <s> we have of course already discussed at some length our intentions of the definition of the hra <e> <s> as i said earlier our strong inclination is to leave authorities present practices in place for and make clearer rules for future years <e> <s> we are not quite ready yet to make a final decision on this <e>", "<cs> yes i think that is what i said earlier <e> <s> if i am wrong in thinking that is what i said earlier i shall come back to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> these two amendments relate to the allowance which is to be made in the subsidy formula for local authorities expenditure on the management and maintenance of their housing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for reiterating that point <e> <s> there are two aspects here the capital side and the maintenance side <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord graham of <e>", "<cs> i can confirm to the noble lord that the total allowance will reflect the different needs of diferent authorities <e> <s> therefore that would overcome some of the problems that we have at the moment <e> <s> as to a firm commitment to an increased level of resources i think it would be rash of any minister in any government of whatever political complexion to give a firm commitment on that and particularly a treasury minister <e> <s> however i hear what the noble lord has to say <e>", "<cs> before i turn to deal with the details of the amendment perhaps it would be useful to the committee if i were to say a few words <e>", "<cs> deemed is what a council would do if the amendment were accepted <e> <s> again given his experience i must bow to the noble lords knowledge on the detailed questions of a local authority <e> <s> however as i understand it in general resources are pooled that is the reality of the situation <e> <s> but as i said discussions are taking place and i do not wish to prejudice the outcome of the review <e> <s> nevertheless i shall take careful note of the remarks made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised an important point <e> <s> but before i come to it i should refer to his statement that consultation does not mean agreement <e> <s> of course i appreciate that point <e> <s> however as i have argued on many occasions and answered the noble lord i hope that there will be consultation <e> <s> i had hoped that he and the noble lord lord mcintosh would have been delighted when i reported that consultation had taken place as he had envisaged and that this was the result that our minds were flexible and that we were prepared to adapt to consider any points made by the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> that is a very enticing argument <e> <s> however i am sure the noble lord will recall that when we discussed the first amendment which was in his name i said that we intended to introduce amendment no <e> <s> la and that it was quite proper for these things to be taken into account <e> <s> not surprisingly i take a wholly different view from that of the noble lord about the question of affordability in his amendments <e> <s> i commend our amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> i understand the difficulty of the noble lord lord mcintosh when referring forward to part viii <e> <s> there are a number of amendments standing in his name which would change the proposal as set out in the bill <e> <s> perhaps it would be to the advantage of the committee if we deferred detailed discussion of the substance of those amendments until we reached that part of the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may therefore keep to policy for the purposes of the argument <e> <s> i am quite willing to agree that if the grants were payable in respect of local authorities own housing it would be nonsensical then to make a corresponding reduction in hra subsidy and the subsidy formula would need to reflect this <e>", "<cs> it is true that improvement grants for the local authority are demand led as the noble lord said <e> <s> in principle this could mean that an authoritys capital resources are used up too much by private sector demands <e> <s> but we shall be giving spearate allocations to authorities to help them meet their obligations to the private sector <e> <s> none of these questions which are important i agree with the noble lord affects the hra subsidy <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord indicated this is an important amendment of concern not only to local authorities but to many people involved in the housing sector <e> <s> at present local authorities are prevented from spending more than the so-called prescribed proportion of their capital receipts on new capital projects in any year <e> <s> however there is an important exception to this rule <e> <s> as the noble lord explained expenditure on repairs and maintenance does not count as prescribed expenditure so it is not subject to the prescribed expenditure limit <e> <s> this means that an authority may use up to per cent <e> <s> of its capital receipts to finance any expenditure on repairs and maintenance which qualifies as capital spending <e> <s> any such expenditure does not of course then count as revenue expenditure and it does not score in the housing revenue account <e>", "<cs> the situation is perhaps a little more complicated than the noble baroness believes <e> <s> we need to know whether it was capital in the first place and where it came from under the new definition <e> <s> that is the first matter <e> <s> the second point is that when we assess the management and maintenance allowances we need to take into account the kind of matters that the noble baroness has just mentioned <e> <s> in particular i referred earlier to the age and condition of the property as some of the items that we shall need to take into account <e> <s> at this stage i cannot give the noble baroness the answer <e>", "<cs> we hope that the local authorities will continue the good work in maintaining and improving the stock but it very much depends on whether it is revenue or capital which i am sure the noble lord will understand <e> <s> authorities have been spending some million on capitalised repairs <e> <s> that is not the question that we are concerned about <e> <s> we know how much the local authorities have spent <e> <s> at the moment what is difficult to determine is whether the money was spent mostly on repairs of a capital nature or on maintenance of a revenue kind <e> <s> in principle we shall try to take account of the transitional problems of authorities in two ways for capital works via the hip allocations and for revenue works via the hra subsidy <e> <s> on each side of the coin there is a difficulty <e> <s> the more we give to help local authorities that have been capitalising repairs a great deal the less can be allocated by assessment of future needs <e> <s> we shall try to get the exercise right and the discussions will continue <e>", "<cs> i understand the point made by the noble lord but it is difficult for me to comment because of the discussions which are taking place <e> <s> i hope that we shall be able to crystallise our thoughts in the near future thus enabling the discussion to take a more focused view <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will understand the concerns that i have put forward <e> <s> i understand his concerns <e> <s> perhaps we can wait until another stage when we shall have further details which will crystallise the matter <e>", "<cs> hopefully <e>", "<cs> i understand some of the concerns expressed tonight in committee and outside the chamber <e> <s> it might help the committee if i put the subject into context because i believe that some of the concern arises from a misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has reminded the committee the amendment reopens the issue of council house rents and the governments policy which we have discussed at some length under earlier clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right to remind the house of the strong position of the uk net overseas assets <e> <s> the uk net overseas assets are the highest of all the major countries as a percentage of gnp <e> <s> that is something of which we can all be proud <e> <s> when one thinks of the figure that i have just given to the house of billion at the end of it is worth recalling that when we came to office the labour party had left us with only billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quoting from the pink book which as i understand it has the most reliable statistics that we have <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords but i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not casting an aspersion <e> <s> i was stating a statistic <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection is that the labour government did have to go to the imf <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right when he says that it is taken into account in the calculation <e> <s> it is interesting to note that the interest profits and dividends increased from billion in to billion at the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raised some interesting questions which i should be very happy to discuss with him but we are talking about the net overseas assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be wise for me to pass judgment on that point <e> <s> however i think it is worth recalling the very strong position of britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit that there is a balancing item that has occurred over recent years but that has come about from the problems of keeping pace with the new financial developments in a dynamic deregulated economy <e>", "<cs> not without checking the facts my lords <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> j seeks to empower authorities to waive the test of resources provided for in clause in circumstances where in the opinion of the authority the applicant would suffer hardship and the condition of the dwelling or common parts of a building is such as to warrant a waiver <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the point made by the noble baroness lady fisher which was also picked up by the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> that is an important point <e> <s> i was going to come to it on a subsequent amendment but perhaps it may be helpful if i say something about it now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord swinfen for explaining the amendment with such clarity <e> <s> i have to admit to him that i could read it in at least two ways and i am grateful that my attempt at understanding it was in one of the ways in which he described it to the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for so carefully explaining these amendments which are aimed at curbing the activities of cowboy builders <e> <s> i have no doubts as to the merits of the aims that the noble lord put to the committee but i question whether the amendments offer the best way of achieving those ends <e>", "<cs> i shall try to bring the noble lord up to date as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> both the noble lords lord graham of edmonton and lord ross of newport have raised important points that need consideration <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> there is a very good technical reason why the amendment that the noble lord has tabled does not fulfil its purpose <e> <s> however i have never been one to rely on technical details to dissuade the committee from accepting an amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that it is reasonable to shut the door completely on the use of a builder other than the one who provided the estimate <e> <s> there are a number of situations where this may be unavoidable <e> <s> indeed some have already been mentioned <e> <s> perhaps i may add to those <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham has succinctly summed up the amendment as one that seeks to make grant available for improvements which a local authority tenant wishes to make with the consent of his landlord <e> <s> clause has the effect of combining a tenants eligibility for grant to those works which he is required by the terms of his tenancy to undertake <e> <s> this applies to all tenants regardless of who is the landlord <e> <s> the effect of the amendment therefore would be to put local authority tenants in a better position than private sector tenants as they would be free to apply for grants towards the cost of certain works for which tenants of other landlords including secured tenants whose landlord was not a local authority could not apply <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord lord dean of beswick would wish me to comment on amendment no <e> <s> a at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> though the amendment has not been spoken to yet i believe that it will be easier for me to comment now <e>", "<cs> with respect i do not think that it is in order for the noble lord to quote remarks made by a back bencher <e> <s> as i understand it the only person one can quote is a minister <e>", "<cs> i obviously did not make myself clear <e> <s> i went out of my way to say that i wanted to listen to all the arguments on clause <e> <s> i heard clearly what the noble lord said <e> <s> it is difficult to reply to him when we start getting into the details of the figures without having comparable figures in front of us <e> <s> i offered to discuss the matter between now and another stage <e> <s> some valuable points have been raised <e> <s> i wish to listen to all the arguments on clause and then i can report back to my right honourable friend <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord hesketh is also listening with great care <e> <s> it would benefit us both to hear all the arguments <e> <s> i hope that the committee will not divide on any of the amendments because that would rather spoil the purpose of the exercise to which i alluded earlier <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we have had many discussions with many people but if we have not discssed some of these matters with radar that will have been brought to our attention and someone will be doing something about it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the discussion we have had <e> <s> it has been extremely useful <e> <s> as regards the amendment of the noble lord lord seebohm i have no doubt that the income and resources normally available to those over and living in properties in a poor condition are generally small <e> <s> if that is the case they have nothing to fear from the test of resources which i described earlier <e>", "<cs> in view of the statistics that the noble lord has mentioned which are always difficult to grasp as they are said perhaps he could set them out more fully in a letter to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with a copy to me <e> <s> that may be helpful to both of us <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however i wish to put a few questions to him as that will help me when i come to consider this matter later <e> <s> it is not clear whether the to which he refers as a cut-off point concerns annual income savings or both <e> <s> perhaps he could elucidate on his thoughts on that matter <e>", "<cs> if i flip quickly through the bill and i look at clause i see that special certificate is defined <e>", "<cs> i was a little surprised by the way in which the noble lord lord graham ended his remarks on the amendment <e> <s> he asked whether the amendments were landlord loaded <e> <s> the point of the amendments is to enable the landlord to improve the circumstances of the tenant <e> <s> unless the landlord is treated on a fair basis for grant as others are he will not seek to obtain the grant and the tenant will remain in poor conditions <e> <s> the noble lord has argued all afternoon that such conditions should be improved <e> <s> that is what we seek to do with these amendments <e> <s> the government as a flexible and listening government brought forward the amendments as a result of our consultations <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am not able to say who was consulted and who responded <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to my noble friend lord swinfen in a general way and then deal with each amendment individually <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> to seek to extend the purposes for which mandatory disabled facilities grant would be available <e> <s> before we consider the merits of each individual amendment it might be helpful if i explain briefly the reasoning behind the choice of the purposes presently listed in clause <e> <s> i hope that this will answer the point made by the noble lord lord carter <e>", "<cs> before i deal specifically with the amendment perhaps i may just reassure my noble friend although i am sure he knows it already that i shall read with great care what he has said and <e>", "<cs> i believe that clause already effectively provides mandatory grant in respect of this concern of my noble friend since it provides for access to all the principal areas and centres of home life <e> <s> subsection g is designed to provide mandatory grant for any special adaptions needed by disabled persons to enable them to care for children and any other dependent relatives <e> <s> i suggest that the exclusion of the words <e>", "<cs> discretionary grant is already available under clause for the provision of adequate thermal insulation <e> <s> assistance is also available under clause <e> <s> additionally if a disabled person requires any form of insulation to secure his welfare grant may be given under clause <e>", "<cs> once the bill is enacted i am sure that we shall be making it widely available not only to local authorities but to others who are concerned with the disabled and those with interests in the disabled <e> <s> we shall try to make the information as widely available as possible <e>", "<cs> i should like to consider the full implications of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> obviously we try to make the information as widely available as possible <e> <s> i know that on some occasions the noble lord and his party have accused us of being over enthusiastic on this <e> <s> however i shall bear in mind what he says <e>", "<cs> i do not underestimate the value of transport to the disabled or the very real importance of a car if someone is not to be housebound <e> <s> clause would permit an authority to give grant for the purpose set out in amendment no <e> <s> where it considered that the works were for the purpose of making a dwelling suitable for the accommodation welfare or employment of a disabled person living there <e> <s> i believe it is right that this should be discretionary <e> <s> we must not overlook the fact that no form of grant mandatory or discretionary for building a garage is available to those who are not disabled or who do not have a disabled person living with them <e> <s> this applies whatever the family circumstances and regardless of whether those who are elderly or infirm but not disabled are involved <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the opportunity given to me by the noble lord lord dean to explain the governments position <e> <s> let me reconfirm that in connection with amendment no <e> <s> the availability of grant to secure tenancies is restricted by the provisions of clause a <e> <s> that prevents an authority from entering a grant application from a tenant if that tenant is not required by the terms of his tenancy to carry out the works for which grant aid is sought <e> <s> secure tenants are unlikely to have that kind of repairing obligation <e> <s> the restriction does not however apply in the case of disabled facilities grant <e>", "<cs> moved amendments nos <e> <s> c to j <e>", "<cs> as far as i understand yes he has <e>", "<cs> how nice it is to welcome back the noble earl lord lytton <e> <s> i was disappointed to hear his remarks about the rics and others not being involved at the crucial time <e> <s> obviously i shall check on that <e> <s> however when i last investigated the matter i know that they felt that they had been properly considered <e> <s> but i shall investigate the noble earls point <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> azu which has been agreed by the committee was consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> aze <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> azv was spoken to by my noble friend lord hesketh and was consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> azc <e>", "<cs> it is perfectly in order for any amendment to be taken with other amendments and discussed with them <e> <s> however one can move only the amendment that is the basis for that discussion <e> <s> it is quite normal to add in other amendments <e> <s> then in turn the chairman will call those amendments and if further discussion is warranted it can take place <e> <s> the chairman called both amendments nos <e> <s> azu and azv <e> <s> when no one took up the offer which the chairman had made in accordance with the usual practice they were agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are keen to encourage more personal savings but our priority for national savings is to attract funds that investors will leave for a number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am keen to debate these matters with the noble lord but perhaps he would look at the question on the order paper and relate his supplementary questions to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i contest the last remark made by the noble lord <e> <s> national savings have very important tasks <e> <s> for instance they provide a home for the savings of non-taxpayers including many pensioners and children <e> <s> interest on the investment account income bonds and capital bonds is paid gross of income tax so are dividends on government stock held on the national savings stock register <e> <s> national savings can also encourage longer term saving and offer within the available resources the best possible service to the many millions of investors in national savings <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly encourage long-term saving <e> <s> that is why a fixed rate of interest is paid after five years for certain of the savings certificates <e> <s> when those certificates are mature they can be encashed at short notice <e> <s> in a period of substantial budget surplus the government are no longer seeking short-term money from national savings in that way <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for the introduction of his amendment <e> <s> we welcome him back to our committee proceedings and i am glad to hear that he is in such good voice obviously inspired <e> <s> i also thank my noble friend for the clarity with which he expressed his amendment no <e> <s> nb <e> <s> as the committee will be aware my noble friends amendment is not consequential on that of the noble lord lord mcintosh but it is obviously for the convenience of the committee that the two amendments should be discussed together <e>", "<cs> i shall try to answer that question at the end <e> <s> perhaps i may turn first to the point that my noble friend lord coleraine mentioned as regards new tenants namely those subject to the housing act <e> <s> shorthold tenants have the right to ask the rent assessment committee to fix a market rent during the initial fixed term of the tenancy <e> <s> that rent will be exclusive of rates <e> <s> so they too have a remedy <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> as so many of the community charge demands will be made to owner-occupiers who may not be affected i wonder whether that is the most cost-effective way of getting the information to the tenants <e> <s> i take on board what the noble lord has said and i shall ask whether anything can be done to try to help the situation <e>", "<cs> as i understand it it is the solution to the problem <e> <s> i said that there was a problem and i then explained that some tenants were not in any way affected by it <e> <s> i also said that those who remained had remedies <e> <s> having considered the matter we think it best to provide the leaflet <e> <s> we shall monitor the situation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying his intervention <e> <s> perhaps he will give me a little time to consider it <e>", "<cs> i am now able to help the noble lord lord northfield a little more <e> <s> i can tell him that million leaflets have already been distributed <e> <s> the general leaflet says words to the effect that if one is a tenant with queries a leaflet is available <e> <s> we have already done what the noble lord has asked <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the reasonable and rational tones in which the noble lord lord norhtfield <e> <s> put forward that last proposition <e> <s> i was somewhat surprised by the perhaps intemperate words of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i thought that i had moved a great deal towards the noble lord lord northfield and has tried to be helpful to the committee <e> <s> obviously that did not suit the noble lord <e> <s> i should like time to consider what he has said <e> <s> however i have to tell the committee that there are difficulties and as the noble lord lord northfield has just reminded the committee the position is so complicated that it would be wrong to deal with this on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows i cannot give him that firm guarantee <e> <s> however i can say that i shall draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state exactly what has been said <e> <s> it would be totally wrong for me in my present capacity to give the firm commitment which the noble lord desires <e> <s> but i shall certainly report to my right honourable friend the strength of the feelings which have been expressed by noble lords <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be as helpful as possible <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to do what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter suggested <e> <s> however i did not want to mislead the committee in any way because of the difficulties that are involved in the matter <e> <s> i shall certainly talk to my right honourable friend the secretary of state to see what can be done to allay the concerns of all members of the committee <e> <s> but of course i cannot guarantee anything and i cannot make a commitment that we shall be able to come forward with a solution in this legislation <e> <s> however i am willing to take the matter back so that it may be discussed again <e> <s> on that basis but i stress without any guarantee i hope that the noble lord will feel that i am doing the best i can <e>", "<cs> i hear the concern which has been expressed <e> <s> i understand that members of the committee would like the provision placed on the face of the bill <e> <s> the difficulty in the matter is that i do not know whether it can be <e> <s> that is the point i wish to reconsider <e>", "<cs> the way the noble lord said that the committee would be gravely disappointed slightly pre-empts what i am supposed to be doing <e> <s> i am taking the matter away with the best will so that it may be looked at again <e> <s> if members of the committee are disappointed it will not be because of my lack of trying <e>", "<cs> i can understand the noble lords concern about the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may assure him that there is nothing sinister in those two provisions <e> <s> it is perfectly normal for regulation-making powers to specify that the regulations may include such provision as the secretary of state sees fit <e> <s> in this case the provisions exist for the avoidance of doubt since other <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has said only serves to <e>", "<cs> this amendment would limit in the case of fees and charges the general provisions that regulations made under this bill may make different provision for different cases including different provision for different areas and that different regulations may be made in england and wales <e> <s> it would allow such different provisions to be made only in respect of authorities which had had their community charge capped <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton for welcoming clause <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for so clearly explaining the amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to try to answer the point that he raised <e> <s> i understand that we hope to have discussions this winter with local authorities <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ross of newport told the committee these amendments aim to control a type of property transaction that is most unusual <e> <s> it is a form of buying property on hire purchase under which the purchaser does not have the stake in his property that a mortgagor does with a conventional mortgage <e> <s> nor does he necessarily have the status of a tenant he may be a tenant or licensee depending on the terms of the agreement <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the concerns of my noble friend and i apologise if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i said that there was a problem and that i was very sympathetic to the plight of people who had entered into a voluntary agreement <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will understand clearly with his involvement in property that what the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord ross are trying to do is to impose on a purchase agreement a tenancy provision <e> <s> that is where the difficulty lies in trying to deal with the matter in the way that the noble lord lord ross wishes <e> <s> nevertheless i take my noble friends point <e> <s> it is something about which we are concerned but the way in which the noble lord wants to deal with it is the wrong way <e>", "<cs> what i am not sure of at the moment is whether it can be dealt with in another way <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly endeavour to find out between now and report stage whether there is another way of doing it <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble lord lord dean of beswick said <e> <s> i wonder whether he might not be giving this clause rather more significance than it deserves <e> <s> it is simply a declaratory provision confirming that under the law as it stands local housing authorities are not required to own housing or land in connection with their powers under the housing act in scotland the housing scotland act <e> <s> as a declaratory provision it does not change the law at all it merely states explicitly what is already the position <e> <s> there is nothing in the clause that forces a council to dispose of all of its housing it remains for the council to decide whether to do so <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> there was a certain logic to the noble lords argument provided that the matter rested where he left it <e> <s> but of course it does not stop there because and i repeat what i said earlier local authorities have a statutory duty and before they can divest themselves of their housing they have to provide appropriate safeguards to convince the secretary of state that they can meet their statutory obligations <e> <s> that is exactly what sevenoaks and chiltern have done <e> <s> they have contracted with the purchasing associations to provide housing for those whom they accept as homeless <e>", "<cs> i repeat and let me make it absolutely clear that they have contracted with the purchasing associations to provide housing for those whom they accept as homeless <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will find it useful if i explain in short order what we are trying to do <e> <s> clause is about the variation between rents for different council properties within a local authority area <e> <s> and that is all <e> <s> the clause does not require councils to set their rents at the level of private sector rents this clause is not about the absolute level of rents <e> <s> the point is that councils own a wide range of different types of housing detached or semi-detached houses with or without gardens terraced houses maisonettes flats and so on <e> <s> we are concerned that council rents within a single authority should reflect these differences fairly <e> <s> at the moment section of the housing act allows authorities to <e>", "<cs> all we are asking the local authorities to do is to take into account the fact that rents should vary for different types of property in the same way as they would in the private sector <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has indicated in moving his amendment that the new status in certain cases should be that of a secure tenant <e> <s> i have some sympathy with that view in the case of the tenants of a co-operative where there is already something of a parallel in the existing legislation for their being granted secure tenancy status when their homes are taken over by another registered association <e> <s> the arguments in the other case are less well defined but i am certainly prepared to consider the option put forward by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> this is of course a complex area and i should therefore like the opportunity to consider the details further <e>", "<cs> i am always willing to be helpful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton if i can <e> <s> i am happy to tell him that the <e>", "<cs> yes it does <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that tax is deducted at source and is not recoverable <e> <s> it is a composite rate tax <e> <s> it is below the basic rate at per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of the noble lords supplementary was based on a wrong assumption <e> <s> he said that it was brought into effect in <e> <s> at that time the banks were brought into line with the building societies which have had a composite rate for nearly years or at least since the s <e> <s> therefore many governments of all colours and persuasions have thought that the composite rate was the right method <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter as chief secretary would have been responsible for the composite rate in his time <e>", "<cs> my lords that was discussed at length in another place <e> <s> because it was a finance act it was not discussed in your lordships house <e> <s> i think that there are perhaps three reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards any investment by a non-taxpayer it is true that if that investment is with a bank or building society tax is not repayable <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord bruce of donington said there is national savings where the interest is paid gross <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> there is a choice of opportunities for the investor one is paid net of tax and the other is paid gross <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend was right to say that it was to produce a level playing field <e> <s> as i understand it the rates net of tax as a result of a level playing field and more competition are more beneficial than the old gross rates <e>", "<cs> oh no my lords my noble friend will know how carefully we listen to arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly apologise to the noble lord if i misunderstood the first part of his question <e> <s> i thought he said that the composite rate was invented in <e> <s> with regard to independent taxation when that comes in next year at the moment depositors will be taxed under the composite rate scheme as at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i always draw to the attention of my right honourable friends what has passed in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been told that i did say reserved <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey did not hear me clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord lord dean of beswick that local authorities have been treated shabbily and i am not giving way to him <e> <s> within that total capital allocations have fallen from billion to billion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment perhaps i might say <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke earlier to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> his amendment is to follow that of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey which has just been spoken to <e> <s> my answer to the amendments of both noble lords will be the same since i have to refer to later government amendments starting with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord ross of newport would like to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall therefore cover many of the points on the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> my lords what i wish to do is in answering the amendment which has been moved to speak to the governments amendments because they cover the points of concern <e> <s> as i have just said i do so because of the government amendments standing in the name of my noble friend lord hesketh amendments nos <e> <s> to to to and <e> <s> those amendments concern the powers in the bill to vary the reserved part of capital receipts <e> <s> the reserved part of a receipt is the part that has to be set aside for debt redemption <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it it is the global debt because a great many local authorities cannot define what part of debt refers to which site <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall try to find out and let the noble lord know <e> <s> we shall try to get the regulations to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i should perhaps have said that i wanted to cover this amendment in what i said earlier because the matter is related <e> <s> i cannot accept his amendment because it does not go far enough in our view <e> <s> that was the burden of what i said earlier <e> <s> we shall accept the principle of the amendment <e> <s> we fully understand the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> it is very helpful and i am grateful to him for having made it <e> <s> we shall make it wider by means of regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall extend the scope of the amendment because the noble lords amendment is confined as i understand it to housing associations <e> <s> we do not see why it should not be extended to any subsidised rented housing <e> <s> we shall take all that into account under regulations <e> <s> the principle of what the noble lord wants is agreed <e> <s> i believe that he will find that in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the objectives behind this amendment which the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord northfield specifically asked me to reply with the leave of the house i shall do so <e> <s> clearly i cannot give him the assurance that he seeks because i am not in a position to do so <e> <s> i do not know enough about the scheme at the moment but i assure the noble lord and the house that i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what the noble lord said and in fact the whole of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has said this amendment would allow local authorities to choose what minimum provision they should make from a revenue account each year to meet debt redemption provided that accorded with proper practices <e> <s> i believe it was the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey who said in committee that this was an area where we are likely to remain in disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be to remove from clause the requirement for any grant received from the ec to be set aside as provision for debt redemption <e> <s> it is of course aimed at providing that the grant can be used directly by that authority to supplement its capital programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a much happier man now than i have been for the past four or five weeks when i thought that i was not going to continue to debate with the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i am glad to see that he has joined the long list of speakers on the opposition benches who want to speak on treasury matters <e> <s> i feel sure that we shall be discussing these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is seeking to exploit a situation to confuse the public if i may put it like that because my right honourable friend the prime minister said in the house of commons in a statement on th june following the madrid summit a statement repeated in this house by my noble friend lord belstead <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend feels very strongly on this matter as indeed do all noble lords <e> <s> there have been arguments that the erm of the ems might cease to exist if there were no exchange controls <e> <s> we shall see whether or not that is true when france and italy remove the remaining exchange controls in july next year <e> <s> meanwhile the governments position is as i have made clear <e>", "<cs> my lords both my right honourable friends the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer have made clear on a number of occasions the criteria which they will adopt before entering the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> i was a little surprised by what the noble lord said <e> <s> surely if one has an adviser one can either accept the advice or not <e> <s> but it is not our party that seeks to silence what the adviser says are his own views <e> <s> perhaps that is the policy of noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> no my lords we shall join the erm when the time is right <e> <s> clearly the noble lord would prefer to take us in on more disadvantageous terms than we would like <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not yet had time to read the book to which my noble and learned friend refers but it is well known that on the opposition benches there are numerous spokesmen who purport to speak on treasury matters <e> <s> most of them contradict each other and the opposition have a policy which is totally imcomprehensible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right and i think everyone is agreed to say that the erm is not a panacea <e>", "<cs> my lords much as i should like to help my noble friend i am not quite sure from where noble lords opposite receive their briefings <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is no difference between the two people mentioned i agree with both of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the quotation mentioned by the noble lord lord bruce of donington must be put into context <e> <s> however i am sure that my right honourable friend the prime minister will shortly be back in the country and will then be able to answer such questions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to maintain a period of silence when one is asked questions <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer have given exactly the same replies to the same questions time and again <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt your lordships will recognise a great deal of what was <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i meant to pick up earlier one point which he mentioned again when summing up <e> <s> he suggested that i had said that the maximum would be <e> <s> i have quickly skimmed through the <e>", "<cs> my lords i return your lordships to the amendment before us <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> c would add a further item to the list of items of expenditure which may be debited to the housing revenue account <e> <s> it would provide that costs incurred by an authority in connection with its functions under part iii of the housing act housing the homeless should subject to a formula determined by the secretary of state be debited to the account <e> <s> this amendment would however extend the scope of the hra beyond that which it has now and beyond that which we have said it should have in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of opportunities open to somebody in the situation that the noble baroness puts before me <e> <s> we are talking about a supply-led matter and it cannot be predicted with accuracy <e> <s> but there might be accommodation in private hands that could be used and that could be leased <e> <s> i know that a number of schemes have been undertaken whereby through <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that as i understood it the gist of the noble baronesss remark was that local authorities are above criticism on housing <e> <s> it is not for me to comment but i would merely draw your lordships attention to the numerous reports on the homeless situation where criticism has been made of local authorities <e> <s> in particular i recall that the audit commission made some fairly telling points <e> <s> it also made telling points against the government that i freely admit and that is why among other reasons we undertook a review of the whole situation of homelessness <e> <s> we hope that the report of the review will be published in the very near future <e> <s> for me to comment beyond that now would merely add to the speculation to which some of your lordships have given voice this afternoon <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to prejudge the outcome <e> <s> i am sorry to have to keep the house waiting a little longer but i am sure your lordships will agree that it would be wrong to prejudge the situation or to add to the press speculation <e>", "<cs> my lords whether legislation is needed or not will depend on the report and i am not going to prejudge that <e> <s> however i am sure that knowing the interest of your lordships in this matter your lordships will seek to debate the report <e> <s> that will be a matter to be dealt with through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would run directly contrary to the provisions of subsection and so would make a nonsense of the proposals which we put forward yesterday <e> <s> in short like the first amendment it attacks the heart of what we are discussing and if agreed would drive a coach and horses through this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is an error then that gives me a great deal of difficulty because i have taken the amendment as it is shown on the marshalled list <e> <s> it is difficult for me to second-guess what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton intends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to speak to the words used by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i examined the amendment and we considered whether the noble lord meant notional or national reading it in both ways i am happy to tell the noble lord <e> <s> i have to tell him that the situation is even worse because this is a totally cuckoo amendment using notional <e> <s> only in fairyland could anyone think that a subsidy which is intended to cover a potential deficit could be calculated without knowing the size of the deficit <e> <s> as there is no inflation in the fairyland of the noble lord lord graham rents never need to go up for any reason at all <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i do not possess that information i am not in the department and do not know what it has said <e> <s> i can only repeat what i said earlier that the department has told the london boroughs association that as has been said on numerous occasions by ministers there are no targets <e> <s> if we were to make targets it would be on a false basis <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would bring into subsidy an item of expenditure which in the governments proposals will not be included in the subsidy calculation at all <e> <s> item in part ii of schedule specifically allows authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i misread something that i intended to say to the house <e> <s> when i spoke about the abolition of admissible cost limits i said that they could only be abolished if the proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord lord graham of edmonton will realise there has been considerable discussion with the local authority associations <e> <s> the government have been quick to take on board the points of concern raised by the local authorities <e> <s> i remember discussions with the authorities after which i was happy to go away and try to meet their concerns <e> <s> of course we shall continue to do so <e> <s> in this house we have been happy to bring forward amendments which take into account the arguments <e> <s> the government will not suddenly change <e> <s> we shall continue to listen to what is said both inside and outside the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that i do not think it would be wise to follow the noble lord down the path on which he is trying to lead me because of the hypothetical nature of the question <e> <s> as i said earlier there are consultations with the local authorities <e> <s> obviously we want to see how that works and take into account the reaction in order to make it the best possible system <e> <s> however as the noble lord rightly said it could be tightened or loosened <e>", "<cs> my lords the subsidy calculation for each year will include a notional allowance for expenditure on management and maintenance <e> <s> however for the year beginning on st april which is the subject of this amendment we propose to calculate the allowance by reference to authorities actual past expenditure on management and maintenance charged to the hra <e> <s> we shall take the average of their spending for the years to and uprate it to prices plus an extra per cent <e> <s> except that where their notional spending in the old subsidy system if given the same uprating for inflation plus <e>", "<cs> my lords i mean the expenditure spent on true capital project rather than a capitalised maintenance item <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to this amendment i am tempted to say here we go again <e> <s> at every stage in the progress of the bill both in this house and in another place the party opposite has introduced amendments all different but all with the same purpose in mind namely to ensure that local authorities continue to receive government subsidy to cover the full cost of the rent rebates which they grant to their tenants without regard to whether this is needed <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> l is the latest amendment in this series <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never known the noble lord lord graham duck a question so quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many of us in the chamber today who will remember the extensive discussions we had both in committee and on report while discussing the local government finance act regarding a similar amendment to that moved by my noble friend this afternoon <e> <s> at the conclusion of those debates i conceded that where farmers kept one or two horses for their own enjoyment or for breeding on a small sicale largely as a hobby rating could be an unwelcome additional burden as well as presenting some practical valuation problems <e>", "<cs> my lords there could be one mare and one gelding <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i said about a minute ago <e> <s> i said that we recognised that there is concern among a large number of breeders who keep one or two horses only and breed on a small scale <e> <s> my noble friend then asked me whether that would be two mares <e> <s> i said that it could be a mare and a gelding <e> <s> that is still one or two horses <e> <s> we are talking about a small point <e> <s> i do not believe that my noble friend has anything to fear <e> <s> i hope that what i have said will reassure the great majority of breeders that they will not have to pay rates <e>", "<cs> my lords the first amendment no <e> <s> a would remove the provisions which enable the secretary of state to set the limits on annual reductions in rate bills by order <e> <s> as your lordships will know we have just considered the governments own minor amendments to these provisions including amendments to clarify the purpose of this order-making power <e>", "<cs> moved amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment is to remove from the basic transition scheme for the new non-domestic rating system the provisions which govern the limit on gains for those <e>", "<cs> my lords if my memory serves me right both the previous labour government and this government did not carry out the revaluations <e> <s> that is one of the causes of the problem <e> <s> it is some years since there was a revaluation <e> <s> that exacerbates the distortions already in the system from the previous revaluation <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble lords will recall as well as i do the discussions that the noble lord lord ross of newport and i had on th june <e> <s> i refreshed my memory by reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i fully appreciate that that is a most honourable course to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for raising the matter and also for the representations that we have received from the national consumer council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about the position of the officers <e> <s> however i can reaffirm to my noble friend that some local authorities are using this as a device to get around the capital finance system <e> <s> of course it is disappointing that they should use this as a device to do so when it was introduced specifically to alleviate a short-term problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has reminded the house that i made an announcement last week at report stage concerning certain exemptions which we intended to provide by regulations <e> <s> let me remind the house what i said <e> <s> first where a local authority disposes of land for the provision of subsidised rented housing and receives nomination rights to that housing in return we propose that there should be no debt redemption in respect of the nomination rights <e> <s> secondly we propose to have an exemption for build for sale schemes in the new system <e> <s> thirdly we are urgently considering whether there should be help for other low-cost home ownership initiatives which received favourable treatment in the present system <e> <s> that remains the position and i am very grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for the reception he has given to the initiative which i announced <e> <s> obviously i have to say that i am afraid that i cannot give the house final decisions on all the exemptions yet but i hope we shall be able to make a further announcement shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the feeling that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey believes that this is a relatively small matter for the government simply a matter of degree because we have already proposed that in some circumstances erdf grant should be matched by extra credit approvals equal to per cent <e> <s> of the grant <e> <s> so why not provide that some of the grant should convey spending power directly <e>", "<cs> my lords under the present system of local authority capital controls the statutory distinction between capital and revenue expenditure is only loosely drawn <e> <s> some councils have taken advantage of this to spend capital receipts on day-to-day maintenance and jobbing repairs <e> <s> they were permitted to do that <e> <s> i do not want to imply that they were going beyond their powers <e> <s> most people however would expect a landlord to fund day-to-day maintenance from rental income especially as housing subsidy had augmented that income for over one-fifth of the authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that strike pay is not taxable because it is not income for any tax purpose since it is classified as effectively return of trade union subscriptions which are generally paid out of taxed income <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord veers quite a long way from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that also is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome that both noble lords gave to the statement that i repeated <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington started to quote from table a to which your lordships in due course will refer in the greatest detail <e> <s> it is unfortunate that he stopped when he did <e> <s> if he had only continued down the line he would have produced some very different figures <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend says there could be some implication <e> <s> but i would say that it would be a knock-on effect because the main implication of high wage claims is to push up unit labour costs and to increase costs to industry <e> <s> unfortunately it is invariably the people ancillary to those who have put in the high wage claims who will suffer because it means that businesses have to become more efficient and that could mean a reduction in staff in order to compete <e> <s> we want manufacturing and other industries to be able to compete <e> <s> they cannot compete if they have to pay excessive wage costs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked a number of questions <e> <s> if i cannot answer them all i shall try to do so in a letter to the noble lord <e> <s> the privatisation proceeds of billion are based on the best available figures now available and therefore they take account of the current situation in the best way possible <e> <s> i was grateful for the noble lords welcome of the increase of billion in resources for health <e> <s> that is a per cent <e> <s> increase in real terms <e> <s> with moderate pay negotiations it should prove to be of considerable benefit not only to the health service but also to the patients who will receive better treatment as a result of our reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i shall pass on his comments to my right honourable friends the chancellor of the exchequer and the chief secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last question is obviously no <e> <s> of course we aim to continue the policy of turning the economy round <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord stoddart would be only too delighted to have our present inflation rate <e> <s> i do not think the rate stood at that level for very long during the time of the labour government that is if they ever reduced the underlying rate of inflation to the present level <e> <s> therefore we are in an extremely advantageous position which the noble lord would be happy to take over from us <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that expenditure rose as a proportion of gdp <e> <s> the point is that it has fallen significantly and will continue to fall to figures which have not been reached since the mid-s <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of regional aid there has been some alteration in that <e> <s> that is because it would be wrong as we have believed for very many years to intervene too heavily in business <e> <s> the government seek to create the right climate for business in all the regions and we have been extremely successful in doing just that <e>", "<cs> my lords the industrial reorganisation corporation did much to support industries that should not in our view have been supported <e>", "<cs> my lords to prove the point that i have just made under this government manufacturing output is up per cent <e> <s> since <e> <s> yet under the white heat of technology of the last labour government it was lower at the end than at the beginning <e> <s> i trust that your lordships will bear these facts in mind when it comes to a vote later this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that in the circumstances described by my noble friend to put the employee in exactly the same position as he was before will involve the employer paying more than the nominal cost of the community charge <e> <s> the precise arrangements for remuneration between an employer and an employee are a matter for the parties themselves <e> <s> however perhaps i may jog my noble friends memory <e> <s> i am sure that he will recall that having listened to the views of your lordships house the government decided last year to increase the level of mandatory relief on non-domestic rates for charities from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> that will be of great benefit to all charities <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is a charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is keen that we should be fair when it comes to tax <e> <s> if an employer meets any personal liability of an employee then as a general principle a charge to income tax arises <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree that that is fair <e> <s> as i said in certain cases it will be more than just the nominal cost of the community charge but as my noble friend lord moyne said where the employer is trading there can be an offset for the tax liability <e> <s> however as he so rightly said that will unfortunately not apply in the case of charities <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the situation will remain the same in that the employee will be assessed for income on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not had the time that the noble lord has had to read the papers <e> <s> i shall endeavour to get round to that sometime today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my noble friend has lost me <e> <s> if an employer pays a community charge for an employee the employee will of course be assessed for income tax <e> <s> if an employer pays the community charge for a previous employee who continues to live in a tied cottage that is a different question and will depend on the circumstances surrounding the arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a reason indeed it is a very good reason <e> <s> unlike rates the community charge is a personal charge unrelated to accommodation <e> <s> in view of that i am surprised that the noble lord does not have section of the income and corporation taxes act beside his bed for a little nighttime reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord has a copy of the inland revenue press release <e> <s> we have never sought to hide any of the benefits or extra costs that might arise from the charge in certain cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the house that it will be a fully detailed survey <e> <s> it will be a benchmark survey covering all enterprises with or more employees <e> <s> that is one which is carried out every four years <e> <s> i am not sure where the noble lord has obtained the figures for the assertion that he has made <e> <s> but on total expenditure on rd as a percentage of gdp we are in the middle of a group consisting of france west germany italy japan and usa <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> however i hope that from information provided by the committee and that which i shall be able to give him once i return to my office the noble lord will have all the data that he needs <e>", "<cs> my lords that would entail a considerably bigger survey <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord appreciates about per cent <e> <s> of research in industry is done by about the top companies <e> <s> a great deal of research is undertaken by the bigger companies therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the exact words that the noble lord was paraphrasing <e> <s> i should like to look at those before i made any further comment <e>", "<cs> i would rather look at the exact words <e>", "<cs> my lords i have good news for the noble lord <e> <s> i know that it is a matter of concern to him <e> <s> for the first time the survey will be asked to provide separate information on rd performed by industry for civil and defence purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords we have confidence in the visible balance <e> <s> there is also the invisible balance in the accuracy of which we have slightly less confidence <e> <s> that makes up the current account balance <e> <s> we then have to take into account the capital flows identified which are large <e> <s> in order to get the balance we have a balancing item which is quite large <e> <s> i believe that to be the reason behind my noble friends question <e> <s> we are aware that this situation has led to some poring over the entrails but i can reassure my noble friend that the central statistical office and the bank of england are working hard on this matter in order to get more accurate figures <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly would like to see an improvement in the current account deficit <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is aware of the good news regarding exports in the past year <e> <s> we hope that next years exports will also improve <e> <s> in those circumstances the current account deficit should come down <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> some parts of the invisible balance are more <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i do not remember the situation with quite the clarity that my noble friend does <e> <s> where figures are subject to revision they are revised <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot remember whether he did or not <e> <s> i shall talk to my noble and learned friend about it later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord said about customs and excise for i have a special responsibility for it <e> <s> i shall pass on the compliments of the noble lord <e> <s> he raised a very important point because with matters will change <e> <s> i can reassure the noble lord that the european commission is organising discussions on a replacement measurement system which could for example be linked to the control of vat on inter-community trade <e> <s> therefore we shall continue to have reliable figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit that the situation is not what we would like it to be <e> <s> that is why i hope that my answers have been slightly more accurate than the balancing item <e> <s> i confirm to my noble friend that an enormous amount of work is being done by the bank of england and the cso to try to rectify matters for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will be aware the question as the noble lord lord dean phrased it relates to the last increase in minimum lending rate <e> <s> however he has proceeded to regale us with figures from may which are considerably wide of the question he originally wished me to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords after a record year in and the tremendous growth in the economy it was inevitable that there had to be a pause for breath <e> <s> however i am sure that the noble lord also has welcomed the dramatic increase in funding for the housing corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships have read with interest the report on the homeless which the government recently published <e> <s> the latest figures show that only per cent <e> <s> of homeless people accepted by councils were homeless due to arrears <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite wrong he is wrong on all counts <e> <s> we have done an enormous amount for housing as he knows <e> <s> i was sad that he did not take as full a part as i hoped he would have done in the debates on what became the local government and housing act which has done an enormous amount to put funds where they are needed <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three groups of people who can help the homeless the voluntary bodies and the churches the local authorities and the government <e> <s> my noble friend asked specifically about the government <e> <s> perhaps i may tell him the figures that were announced on the day when my right honourable friend the chancellor made the autumn statement <e> <s> the government will give a further million over the next two years specifically to help the homeless in london and the south-east <e> <s> that is a large sum to give to both the local authorities and the housing associations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean of beswick is quite right to chide me <e> <s> i did not quantify the figure of the record <e> <s> it was the highest number of private sector houses started since <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord for not putting it in quite the perspective i should <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the number of houses that are built as the noble lord knows that is determined very much by planning permission <e> <s> overall there is an equilibrium of houses throughout the united kingdom but there are shortages in certain areas <e> <s> in those areas there will be a need for planning permission to enable new houses to be built to meet the demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the information that would help my noble friend <e> <s> i might have been able to reply to that question six months ago but i do not have the information with me now <e> <s> however i believe there is some information in the review of homeless people <e> <s> if my noble friend would care to look at that he may find something that helps him <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the primary concern is to bring down inflation <e> <s> that is the governments responsibility which they will not abdicate <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i shall not give the noble lord that assurance but i shall certainly pass his thoughts on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lords first point <e> <s> on the second point that matter was discussed fairly extensively in our recent debate on the delors report <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will recall that it was not the mood of the house that there should be an independent bank in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that the matter was as simple as that but as the noble lord will be aware there are constitutional differences and a different attitude particularly in the countries mentioned by the noble lord which affect the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we plan to lay a green paper before parliament tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the eagerness for the government response <e> <s> if the friendly societies would only wait for another hours or so that will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a question which is rather tangential to the question on the order paper but i should not like to commit myself in advance of what is said tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated already the government are totally committed to the nhs and to increasing resources <e>", "<cs> my lords mo has proved a reliable indicator of monetary conditions <e> <s> therefore we take particular note of it <e> <s> it is the only monetary aggregate that is targeted but we look at other measures such as m <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that mo will come within its target range <e> <s> however forecasting is a hazardous business and i shall not make a forecast today <e> <s> i know that the noble lord would like everything to be under the strict control of the government but mo is not necessarily under such control because it takes into account consumer expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne we take the broad money indicator m into account <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to review both monetary and fiscal policy on a regular basis <e> <s> if further measures are needed they will undoubtedly be taken <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that it was a complete waste of time <e> <s> it was a great deal better than anything that we could have had from the other side <e> <s> i do say that the economic policy has been much better in this -year period than it was under previous administrations since the war <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i wrote down <e> <s> if i did not write it down correctly i can apologise but i shall look at the <e>", "<cs> my lords in other words the noble lord has confirmed that he said that nationalised industry should be properly controlled <e> <s> i presume that to mean as the noble lord lord cobbold so clearly spelt out his keen desire to interfere <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been winding up the debate for minutes apart from the odd speeches that the noble lords have made as they have intervened <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a good deal better than the one that the noble lord managed to produce <e> <s> the government have also encouraged schemes which give employees a greater stake in the performance of the companies for which they work through profit-related pay and employee share ownership schemes <e> <s> these changes have made the labour market more flexible improving its ability to deal with the changes inevitable in a dynamic economy <e> <s> a properly working labour market is the key to creating jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me many questions which i believe run into almost double figures <e> <s> i shall pick on the one on which he majored at the end namely the question of bankruptcies <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the figure <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that in over more businesses opened rather than closed <e> <s> in december alone there were over net new registrations announced by customs and excise <e> <s> it is the governments job to create the right climate for businesses and that is why under this government new businesses have been set up and it is also why during the last year of the labour government net businesses closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not alone in the government or indeed in the house in having a young family and a mortgage <e> <s> we know full well the difficulties that ensue with the latter <e> <s> i am sure that all of your lordships will agree that it is much better to keep a tight monetary and fiscal policy to defeat inflation which did so much damage to pensioners and to all those who had savings when we had rife inflation in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that when in government the noble lord was keen to know whether he was popular or unpopular <e> <s> we are concerned to do the right thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that in the last quarter of business investment went down <e> <s> but the noble lord will i am sure wish to be the first to congratulate the government on the fact that the figure was still over per cent <e> <s> and that in the three years up to it was over per cent <e>", "<cs> the treasury certainly has a heart my lords but it also has a head <e> <s> in financial matters it is necessary that the head should rule the heart as otherwise inflation would get worse <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> we do look at the various alternatives <e> <s> we have looked at credit control as the opposition have suggested to us but found it to be totally wanting <e> <s> no other country uses it <e> <s> it is not effective in modern financing <e> <s> however i am grateful for the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> i am sure he will agree with me that the key is to reduce inflation <e> <s> we do not want to retain interest rates at a level any higher than is necessary but at the same time one must not ease up from a tight financial or monetary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals of the party opposite vary considerably <e> <s> one of its most recent documents has ways of increasing public expenditure <e> <s> what that would do for inflation it has not yet told us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a budget representation <e> <s> the answer to his question is therefore yes i shall convey it to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to one aspect <e> <s> there is no doubt that higher wage claims lead to a greater loss of jobs which is to the detriment of those who put in the higher wage claims <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said not only today but on previous occasions that we look at the whole range of options <e> <s> that is why the government are using both a tight monetary and tight fiscal policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord tempts me to answer a question which is very different from that on the order paper <e> <s> i reassure him that under this government those on average earnings have certainly had a great increase in their take-home pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the reception given by both the noble baroness lady turner of camden and the noble lord lord rochester to this modest but i am sure the house would agree complex bill <e> <s> i look forward to discussing the details in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in italy the pension age for men is and for women it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i said <e> <s> i am therefore even more grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for intervening and allowing me to correct the impression i

to report to the authorities details of any transactions cash or otherwise which they know or suspect to be linked to drug trafficking <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that in november the bank of england wrote to all authorised banks reminding them of their responsibilities under the act <e> <s> the building societies commission issued a prudential notice through building societies in july and drew attention to the relevant provisions of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the uk is participating fully in what is known as the financial action task force which the noble lord will know resulted from

grounds to qualify for a pensions increase if they have a dependent child <e> <s> very few women qualify under that provision <e> <s> as the noble baroness reminded the committee as far as we know only eight women come into this category in the centrally administered schemes for which details are available <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the concerns of the noble baroness <e> <s> she will understand that i cannot give her the cast-iron guarantee that she would like me to give <e> <s> however i can assure her that every scheme will be considered on its merits because every scheme will be different <e> <s> one has to look at the entire picture <e> <s> in this particular case after a great deal of thought we decided that it would be right to deal with the matter as we have <e> <s> i am not in a position to judge at the moment whether similar circumstances apply to other schemes <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be to require consultation with staff and employers representatives in teaching before regulations were made covering either the teachers supperannuation scheme or the nhs scheme <e> <s> however i understand from what the noble baroness said that she also wished to ensure proper consultation with the appropriate bodies in the nhs scheme although her amendment does not cover that point <e> <s> i take it that that was her intention <e>", "<cs> the aim of clause is to rectify an ambiguity in the provisions of the superannuation act which protect the pension rights of members of certain pension schemes if changes are made to scheme rules after they have left the scheme <e> <s> the clause clarifies those provisions in their application to re-employed scheme members namely those who have left but subsequently re-join the pension scheme <e> <s> it places the re-employed scheme member in the same position as a retired scheme member or a scheme member who has left and has a preserved pension until his last break in service <e> <s> it places the re-employed scheme member in the same position as a serving scheme member who has not had a break in employment so far as his current and future service is concerned <e>", "<cs> what i said was that the amendment that we are making which clearly applies to the re-employed scheme members will not be a deterrent to managements re-employing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that this afternoon we in this house have had the chance to debate the bill which though modest in itself marks an important contribution to the wider reforms which are taking place through the next steps initiative in the way in which government go about their business <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the contributions of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i thank him for his constructive remarks and point out that my door is open too should he wish to discuss matters between now and another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says about statutory <e> <s> as i concluded that part of my speech it occurred to me that he mentioned statutory <e> <s> he has covered the point again and we shall be debating it at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e> <s> in doing so i know that the house will wish to take note with very great regret of the sad news of the death on saturday of lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> not only was he a former secretary of state for education and science but he was also a good friend to the house <e> <s> we shall miss him particularly in our debates on this bill <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> we have before us two sets of amendments <e> <s> one set in the name of my noble friend lady young has as i have heard an impressive array of support from all sides of the chamber <e> <s> i have to say that if i were on the back benches i should have supported my noble friend and because i am on the front bench my support is in no way diminished <e> <s> we accept the principles that my noble friend lady young has put before the committee <e> <s> i have listened with care to the debate <e>", "<cs> we have had a good wide-ranging discussion in some respects almost a second reading debate <e> <s> i have listened with great care and attention to what members of the committee have said <e> <s> perhaps i may start with what i consider to be common ground <e> <s> i believe that we are agreed on all sides of the chamber on the importance of expanding higher education <e> <s> but as noble lords have heard me say before it is not possible for taxpayers and parents alone to support the living costs of an increasing number of students <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows full well the grant is being uprated this year <e> <s> the loan on top is new money it is in addition <e> <s> that is what the students would not be able to have at their disposal <e> <s> the amendment would take this facility away from students in <e> <s> i suspect that students would not thank the noble lord lord jenkins for that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to members of the committee for linking amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> which is rather more specific in that it seeks to make available loans to part-time students on a proportionate basis but as members of the committee have realised the principle of the two amendments is the same <e>", "<cs> it is both <e> <s> i thought that it was absolutely right to give the argument of the question of priorities but i was asked a specific question by my noble friend lord eccles and i thought it right to answer it <e>", "<cs> i tried to answer the bulk of what the noble baroness said <e> <s> it is not a question of our giving part-time students no priority at all <e> <s> however they are already treated differently under <e>", "<cs> as i said at the beginning the noble baroness makes some important points <e> <s> i am sorry if i did not answer her as she would have wished <e> <s> the emphasis at the moment is on getting the scheme for full-time students up and running but i have at no stage closed the door for the future <e> <s> in the bill as it stands merely by regulation that shows the bills flexibility we could extend the scheme to part-time students <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that we need more full and part-time students <e> <s> that is what the government want as much as she does <e>", "<cs> this is a small but significant amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david is not concerned merely that the reference should square with the title on the white paper <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that i had clarified the matter and i apologise for not making myself clear <e> <s> perhaps i did not go to the right <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord peston pointed out to my noble friend lord haig the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> that is due to the bills first substantive sentence in clause which would empower the secretary of state to make arrangements only <e>", "<cs> the intention of the amendment is to make loans available only for students starting their courses in the academic year and thereafter <e> <s> it is the governments intention that loans should be available to all eligible students in the autumn of not just new entrants in that year <e> <s> of course it is up to the students whether they take the loan or not <e> <s> the reason is the one that i gave earlier this afternoon the loan offers students more resources and we want all students to have access to the addition as soon as possible <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton has misunderstood the scheme <e>", "<cs> that leads me back to the argument that that suggestion would involve two schemes and a great deal more administrative complexity <e> <s> my noble friend will wish students to be clear as to where they stand <e> <s> the grant will be uprated in the forthcoming year <e> <s> the loan scheme is in addition to it <e> <s> one can see that the students are not put off and that they are enrolling in increased numbers for next year <e>", "<cs> it is a great compliment from the noble earl that i keep him on his toes by surprising him <e> <s> i did not say that one could not have two systems <e> <s> i said and i stick by it that to have two systems was more complex and administratively more costly <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady carnegy makes an extremely good point <e> <s> i say to the noble baroness lady blackstone however that the loan is optional <e> <s> to have two schemes side by side would add to the complexities and the costs <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is a breach of faith at all <e> <s> i contest that because i contest the very basis on which the noble baroness makes her assumptions <e> <s> if a student qualifies for a grant because a grant is means tested as the noble baroness will be aware there is no guarantee with regard to uprating <e> <s> it is uprated annually by a varying amount <e> <s> the noble earl is highly critical of this government <e> <s> but i would draw his attention to the white paper <e> <s> he will find on page chart which indicates that ever since when my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was chief secretary to the treasury the real value of the grant has been decreasing year by year <e> <s> that is the beginning of the problem facing us in higher education <e>", "<cs> while such a person was a student one would be running two parallel schemes which would add to the cost and the complexity of the operations <e>", "<cs> no with respect they will continue to receive a grant which this year will be uprated by per cent <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness takes a final decision i wish to take up an important point which was also raised by the noble lord lord adrian <e> <s> i am sorry if i did not deal with the matter fully <e> <s> the government are concerned about students who are now in areas of high-cost housing and are in receipt of housing benefit <e> <s> it is of concern to the government to get the provision right <e> <s> currently it is being dealt with by the access funds of which there are three of million <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to settle all the concerns expressed by members of the committee in regard to this important amendment <e> <s> i know full well the important part that osteopaths and chiropractors have played in keeping me in this chamber in some sort of sensible shape <e>", "<cs> if they qualify for mandatory awards they will certainly obtain the loan <e> <s> it is more extensive than just pure mandatory awards so other people may benefit as well <e>", "<cs> the amendments are intended to protect graduates who are believed not to be provided for adequately under the standard arrangements proposed <e> <s> in both cases amendments nos <e> <s> and their liability for repayment or repayment at zero real interest would be disapplied <e>", "<cs> the present grant system provides for special circumstances with a range of additional allowances <e> <s> these include for example allowances for extra weeks attendance vacation hardship and costs incurred by disabled students as a result of attending their courses <e> <s> for the extra weeks allowance is worth for someone studying away from home outside london up to a week is payable during the vacations in cases of hardship and the disabled students allowance is worth up to <e> <s> as i understand the scheme before the committee these will not be affected by the bill <e>", "<cs> this is another amendment intended to protect a certain category of student those on long courses by cancelling part of their liability for repayment <e> <s> my general comments with regard to amendments nos <e> <s> and apply here as well <e> <s> we believe that the arrangements proposed offer sufficient protection but if experience shows that special provision is necessary it can be made through regulations <e> <s> it would be inappropriate to make provision in primary legislation when we are not clear that such special provision is necessary or that we have identified the most appropriate solution for the problem <e>", "<cs> i had intended to come to that specific point otherwise i shall deal with it later because i want to make sure that i have the right answer <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat because this is an important point for all those members of the committee who are concerned that we are looking at courses which are longer than four years so that annual repayments do not become too burdensome <e>", "<cs> before i reply to amendments nos <e> <s> and perhaps i could return to the previous amendment and answer the point made by the noble lord lord peston who asked about sandwich courses <e> <s> if a grant is available during a sandwich year the loan will also be available <e> <s> however i understand that a grant is not generally available if the student is paid during the sandwich year in which case there will not be a loan available either in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> once again we are discussing amendments which are intended to protect a certain group of graduates <e> <s> i refer the committee to the comments that i made concerning amendments nos <e> <s> and which i shall not repeat now except to emphasise that the flexible structure of the bill permits changes to be made through regulations should monitoring reveal that adjustments are necessary <e>", "<cs> i did not say that it was a guarantee <e> <s> i asked the noble earl lord russell whether he would agree with me that there was potential for that <e> <s> i answer the noble baroness by saying that if that person does not receive the expected income that he might have got from completing the course and that income does not take him above per cent <e> <s> of the national average wage then the deferment provisions arise <e>", "<cs> i have listened with particular care to what my noble friend lady young supported by the noble baroness lady seear has said <e> <s> the deferment provisions which i mentioned earlier will come into effect if their income is not up to the expected level for repayment and in due course the stage will be reached when the person is aged and the loan is cancelled <e> <s> but without any commitment i should like to study carefully in the <e>", "<cs> i always find the noble baroness lady david convincing in her arguments and sometimes she is even more convincing than usual <e> <s> i thought that she was particularly persuasive tonight <e> <s> as she will be aware the government always consult before taking any action <e> <s> in my view it is probably right that we should put this on the face of the bill <e> <s> i should however like to check between now and the next stage of the bills proceedings the wording of what is proposed <e> <s> in the circumstances if the noble baroness feels able to withdraw her amendment i shall see whether something can be done in the matter at a later stage <e>", "<cs> let me make it absolutely clear that the government are firmly committed to improving the supply of very highly qualified manpower <e> <s> this commitment is reflected in the number and value of awards available to postgraduate students and in the care and rigour with which these are allocated <e>", "<cs> i explained at some length on the previous amendment why the government do not intend loans to be made available to postgraduate students <e> <s> i said then that i should look carefully at what had been said so i now say to the noble baroness that i hope that she will read what i have said <e>", "<cs> we believe that not all students should receive housing benefit although those who are disabled will still be able to claim housing benefit <e> <s> that was a basis of the scheme <e> <s> we then thought it right to have the access funds for areas of particular hardship as the noble earl knows <e> <s> we should then separate the students who are studying on a first-time course from those whom we are discussing under the terms of the amendment <e> <s> as i said i understood the situation of the two types of student to be different <e> <s> that is why within the resources available we have been able to offer loans to one which are not means tested but not to the other <e>", "<cs> as i understand the situation support is provided for postgraduates through government funded bursaries and studentships which are distributed mainly by the research councils and the british academy <e> <s> some are paid for by the department itself <e> <s> therefore it will be the research councils that will make the decisions about which the noble baroness asked <e>", "<cs> my lords with a budget surplus we need to borrow less net from the public than we have done in the past <e> <s> premium bonds are not a form of national savings to which we attach priority because as i said earlier they can be repaid on demand without penalty <e> <s> it is those factors not the movement of other interest rates which influence the premium bond rate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord tempts me into a slightly wider question than that on the order paper but i can reassure him that we have a number of measures to encourage longer-term personal savings of which i am sure he is aware <e> <s> there is the national savings capital bond save as you earn schemes personal equity plans and of course the budget measures that my right honourable friend introduced last year <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend is absolutely right <e> <s> he is indeed lucky to have won on more than one occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords alas the noble lord lord bruce of donington does not seem to have been as fortunate as my noble and learned friend in winning on the premium bonds <e> <s> the whole question of interest rates is kept under review on a day-to-day basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that all members of your lordships house are keen to know what is in the budget <e> <s> i should remind noble lords that we only have to wait a week in order to find out <e>", "<cs> my lords i contend the assertion of the noble lord that premium bonds are a bad buy <e> <s> there is no question of kidding people into buying them <e> <s> there is a choice of options which people can undertake and there are many benefits for those who have national savings especially non-taxpayers such as pensioners arid children whom i am sure the noble lord would seek to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to table a question on the matter i should be more than happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a difference in law between the united kingdom and the united states <e> <s> in the united states liability can be taken against a company as regards any of its employees who do something wrong <e> <s> however that is not the case in the united kingdom <e> <s> the noble lord presses me to disclose information under part v of the banking act <e> <s> however i know that he realises that section a means that if i do so i could face a term of two years imprisonment or a fine <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would like that but i would not <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no more than draw the attention of the noble lord to the wording of the banking act <e> <s> it is a decision for the bank of england whether to revoke or to restrict the banking licence of an authorised institution <e> <s> that is the power that parliament gave the bank of england <e>", "<cs> my lords under the terms of the act it would be an offence to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords opposite may be right but that is my advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for explaining the position more clearly than i did <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord says may or may not be true but that is a matter for the bank of england <e> <s> i know that noble lords opposite would be the first to complain if they felt the government were interfering <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what has been said i think that my noble friends question is very pertinent <e> <s> we have absolute confidence in the bank of england <e>", "<cs> my lords the banking act also requires the bank of england to satisfy itself that owners and controllers are what it terms fit and proper persons <e> <s> i am sure that that is what the bank will do <e>", "<cs> my lords treasury ministers have discussions with the bank of england on a number of issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of anything particular regarding this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass those comments on to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as i understand these amendments they seek to ensure that the student loans company and any companies to which it sub-contracts will act in accordance with the requirements of the data protection act <e> <s> the student loans company will like any other organisation holding data be subject to the data protection act <e> <s> the act both protects the individuals which is very much a concern of all members of the committee while recognising the importance of controlling the exchange and use of personal data <e> <s> it is there covered in an act which parliament has already approved <e>", "<cs> there is no wish on the governments part to put the student loans company in a different situation from that of any other lending agency <e> <s> the noble lord went on to talk about student loans <e> <s> of course they are different from commercial loans <e> <s> they are arranged on a very generous basis <e> <s> they are granted to all students who wish to take them up irrespective of a means test <e> <s> it puts them in a different category from other loans <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that it will be a fee not exceeding <e> <s> perhaps i could come back to the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> in view of what i said there is no need for reassurance from me or from the person who heads the student loars company <e> <s> it is there in the legislation <e> <s> that is where the noble lord ought to seek the reassurance that he wants <e>", "<cs> i should want to be absolutely certain before i gave a yes or no to the noble baroness <e> <s> quite obviously i do not wish to mislead the committee <e> <s> the student loans company would be in no different a situation from <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord stallard knows i am no lawyer either <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend can help <e> <s> otherwise i shall obtain a definitive answer for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> of course i shall reflect on what i have said <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord in his normal way will reflect on what i have said when he reads it in the <e>", "<cs> there will be a relationship of some sort between the student loans company and the universities otherwise the student loans com any will not know who are the students <e> <s> there has to be some connection <e> <s> if my noble friend lady faithfull would like more information i shall deal with that separately <e>", "<cs> i did not overlook what had gone on in another place <e> <s> indeed i read that with great care <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not overlook what i said about the data protection act for records which are held on computers or indeed what i said subsequently about records held manually <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the anxieties of the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i should like to make certain that i have given the answers to her points and that there have been no contradictions <e> <s> i know that there is a difference between what is held on computer which is covered by the data protection act and that which is not so covered <e> <s> i made that clear <e> <s> however i said that both would be treated with the same care <e> <s> the same confidentiality applies to the student loans company as to banks <e>", "<cs> that is one of the points on which i wish to be clear <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look into that <e> <s> however i know that my noble friend will be the first to acknowledge that there are many students at university at present who are in debt because they have overdrafts or have built up borrowings on an access card or another form of credit card <e> <s> the significant difference which i know my noble friend will wish to take on board is that we are not asking the student to pay back the loan as he would do at present <e> <s> if a student takes out a loan now he starts to repay from day one <e> <s> we do not ask students to repay the loan <e> <s> we are asking graduates to repay the loan and not until nine months after the course has been finished and not until an income is received which is per cent <e> <s> of the national average wage that is <e>", "<cs> i am not so sure that i see it as my noble friend does <e> <s> however i gave him the assurance and i repeat it that i shall look into the specific point he raises <e> <s> but as so many students <e>", "<cs> i absolutely understand the two points made by my noble friend <e> <s> i have said on previous occasions this afternoon and i repeat it now that those are the points among others which i shall be considering <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say something at this stage in view of what has been said <e> <s> i agree that the noble earl lord russell had every right to call a division if he so wished <e> <s> i was more than just a little surprised that he did so in view of the categorical assurances that i had given but that was the noble earls wish <e> <s> the committee decided and that is the end of the matter <e> <s> however i shall stick by the assurances that i gave despite the fact that we had a vote <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendment is to look at the regional variations of housing costs to students <e> <s> the government have made it clear that there will be a differential between the loan facilities available for study in london and elsewhere <e> <s> there will also be a smaller loan facility for those students who continue to live in the family home <e> <s> that point was stressed by the noble lord lord cocks of hartcliffe <e>", "<cs> i shall look into that point <e> <s> i am sorry if i have misinterpreted what the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the point that the noble lord lord flowers has made <e> <s> one of the reasons for our introducing the access fund was to cater for those students who will face the additional difficulties that the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> i understand his concern and that he would like students to continue to receive housing benefit <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble baroness said but she rather surprised me <e> <s> i was coming to that point but i had not intended to comment on the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that the higher education establishments would not be as good at administering the funds as the dss <e> <s> i do not want to get involved in that argument particularly as i know that many universities already have hardship funds which they use for precisely the purpose for which the access funds will be used <e> <s> they have the money and they make precisely the judgments about which the noble baroness is so worried <e>", "<cs> i do not have the figures to hand <e> <s> i shall certainly look them up <e> <s> i was about to come to the question of funding for students because that was a point that was raised by the noble lord lord flowers when he spoke <e> <s> that is what the bill is about <e> <s> what has happened over time is that the amount that a student can receive from various sources has declined since <e> <s> to date that has been a question of a means-tested grant parental contribution and some earned income <e> <s> that has not proved satisfactory and the value of the grant has gone down <e> <s> it is for that reason that we are bringing forward a loan scheme <e> <s> it will boost the income available to students by per cent <e> <s> this year <e> <s> it will cover many of the points about which the noble lords lord flowers and lord adrian are concerned <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady david for bringing those figures to the committees attention <e> <s> i now have the figures too and i must agree with her <e> <s> as i understand it the value of the benefit to be withdrawn is million <e> <s> the value of the loan is million so that is another million available for students <e> <s> in addition there are the access funds of million which is the sum that we are considering <e> <s> that entirely substantiates the argument that i have put to noble lords namely that the amount of money that will be available to students is a considerable increase <e>", "<cs> yes because as i understand it that is how housing benefit works at the moment <e> <s> that will be withdrawn other than for <e>", "<cs> i hear what my noble friend says and i shall draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> there are two points to bear in mind here <e> <s> one must look at the package as a whole <e> <s> part of the package was the withdrawal of benefits and the loan which is considerably more <e> <s> my noble friend is right to say that some students will receive a loan and will still be worse off <e> <s> that is precisely why we added the second point which is the access funds <e> <s> i have already given an assurance on the value of the access funds to the committtee and i know that my noble friend will take it in good faith <e> <s> if we seek to take out one part of that equation it upsets the balance of the rest of the equation <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness seeks to extend the equation to include the community charge one must also extend it to include rates <e> <s> as a student i had to pay my fair share of the rates for the cottage in which i lived <e> <s> one must also take that into account <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to offer a more firm assurance than i have given already to the committee <e> <s> i said that my right honourable friend was looking very carefully at the value of the access funds <e> <s> that is precisely to meet the point raised by the noble lord lord addington <e> <s> it is as we all know a valid point <e> <s> it is precisely to meet that point that over and above the loan are the access funds <e> <s> the value of the access funds has been a matter of some dispute both here and in another place <e>", "<cs> to anybody who has been connected with the treasury and had to look after expenditure the last words of the noble lord lord peston would ring like well i am not educated enough to get the words out <e> <s> what would the government do if they had the resources available to them <e> <s> that is what he said or words to that effect <e> <s> that is something which every government including that of the noble lord lord callaghan of cardiff whom i am glad to see in his place would like to have <e> <s> every government would love to have more resources available to them <e> <s> all of us who spend money would love to have more resources available <e> <s> however we have to live within budgets <e> <s> that is very much the key to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the greater clarification that the noble lord has been able to bring to the amendment that he has proposed <e> <s> the student will be in no different position from now <e> <s> as with the grant so it will be with the grant and the loan <e> <s> any uprating in future years will need to be considered in the usual way in the public expenditure survey <e>", "<cs> i can understand the concern of the noble earl about the bill and the regulations <e> <s> he has made it perfectly clear on numerous occasions his first amendment at second reading which was not the one we discussed his amendment at second reading which we discussed his amendments on the first day of committee and his amendments today <e> <s> i understand the concern of the noble earl <e> <s> i happen to differ from him and the bill is as it is now before us <e>", "<cs> i was sorry to hear the sad news about the noble lord lord grimond and i hope that the noble baroness lady seear will pass on the very good wishes of the whole committee to her noble friend and on our behalf wish him a speedy recovery <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord lord grimond was well enough to see the great triumph on saturday afternoon at murrayfield which so many of us enjoyed <e>", "<cs> before i reply to the points that have been made i should like to welcome the noble lord lord henderson of brompton back among us <e> <s> i am delighted to see him <e> <s> i hoped very much that with his experience he would be here this evening and we are very pleased that he is <e>", "<cs> on the second question i should say that that is very much dependent upon when the student feels he needs the particular benefit <e> <s> although one would wish to get the money to the student as soon as possible and i fully appreciate that fact it is not possible to do so until he knows what he wants <e> <s> indeed it may be at the beginning of the course or at some stage thereafter <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that it wilt be done as soon as possible <e> <s> as regards her first point perhaps i may write to her specifically on the matter <e>", "<cs> as i understand it this will be done by regulations and therefore there will be no need to amend the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may come back to the point of the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> local authorities will look after the grants <e>", "<cs> i mentioned that the dsa would continue to be means tested <e> <s> the reason is that within the limited resources it is right that the government should target the allowance at those most in need <e> <s> that is its purpose and that is where we shall be able to get the money to those most in need <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should rise to my feet to give an answer <e> <s> i certainly say to the noble baroness that of course my door is open <e> <s> we could perhaps look at the package in the cold light of day <e> <s> if the noble baroness or the noble lord lord henderson of brompton have any concerns i should be happy to discuss any of the issues <e> <s> however when we examine it overall and take into account what we are doing as opposed to having a fourth access fund i believe that the noble baroness will understand why i am colder on that but warmer on other suggestions <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee i did not cover that point <e> <s> it is at the moment in draft regulations relating to student social security entitlement which are currently being considered by the social security advisory committee <e> <s> of course i shall draw what has been said today to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have the opportunity again to go over the question of repayment terms a matter about which i believe some members of the committee already know <e> <s> the government recognise that it is important to get those terms right <e> <s> the repayment regime has been carefully considered to take account of the need to protect those on low incomes and to produce a cost-effective administration of the scheme <e> <s> the bill sets the framework for deferment and cancellation but as the committee knows we do not intend to set the detailed repayment conditions in the bill <e> <s> we have already debated the nature of the bill as enabling and i have agreed that when the subordinate legislation is introduced to establish the scheme it will be subject to this houses approval under the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> your lordships will then have the opportunity to debate the regulations which deal with repayments <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i meant to cover those points and i did not <e> <s> what is important when we are talking about repayment is not necessarily the course that the student has been on <e> <s> it is the amount that that student has to repay the amount which he took up in the way of a loan <e> <s> accordingly students will not be asked to repay anything until they have completed the course <e> <s> at the end of the course there is a nine-month gap from the end of july to april the following year when the repayment period will start <e> <s> that repayment will start only if the income is above per cent <e> <s> of the national average which is at the moment <e> <s> so it is not the course that the student has been on but the income he receives which is the determining factor in the cases of both the noble lord lord dormand and my noble friend lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> i hear and note carefully what the noble lord lord peston and the noble lord lord flowers said <e> <s> what i said was that we <e>", "<cs> the first amendment tabled by the noble lord lord peston would require the student loans company or any other person or body discharging functions under the scheme to publish annually details of any sources of data which it has used for the purpose of carrying out its functions <e>", "<cs> i knew that this debate would eventually arise <e> <s> it is no surprise to me that it has because wherever one had drawn the level whether per cent <e> <s> of national average wages per cent <e> <s> of male earnings or per cent <e> <s> of the national average wage i know that noble lords opposite would have said that it was far too mean and that we should have a figure of per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or even per cent <e> <s> for a start <e> <s> i could see that coming <e> <s> i have been involved in enough legislation in this chamber to know that every line the government have drawn has been queried <e>", "<cs> we are referring to the national average taking into account the earnings of both the male and female <e> <s> if we went for the male national average wage that would be about in todays circumstances <e>", "<cs> for a moment i felt positively excited that i had managed to reassure the noble lord on something but he was quick to dispel any illusion that i had achieved that <e> <s> however perhaps i can try yet again to reassure him <e> <s> the general intention of these amendments is to tie the indexation of the loan to the inflation rate <e> <s> as the committee knows this is exactly what the government intend <e> <s> however i must say that the link cannot be exact because the inflation rate cannot be known in advance <e> <s> indexation of the loan in one year will have to be based on actual inflation in the previous year <e> <s> borrowers will then know in advance what the impact of indexation will be <e>", "<cs> i shall take a little time to answer the points that have been made <e> <s> to some members of the committee it will not be the repetitious argument that has gone on for most of today but some of it will <e>", "<cs> it was very much what the noble baroness lady david was talking about during a great deal of what she said and i have to deal with it <e> <s> as i said earlier today the total amount available to students in loan and access funds will far outweigh what would have been available in benefits <e> <s> we estimate that in the first year of the scheme expenditure on loans and access funds for undergraduates will be million compared with savings on social security expenditure of only million <e>", "<cs> it is an increase of new money available to the students should they wish to take it up <e> <s> let me repeat particularly to my noble friend lord eccles who raised this point that we acknowledge that even given this extra sum of money there is concern in some quarters about the effect on individuals of the loss of benefit entitlement <e> <s> we accept of course that a few students <e>", "<cs> for a start the noble baroness referred to access loans <e> <s> they are not loans they are payments and of course she calculated them on the basis that every student would be claiming them regardless which is a totally inequitable position from which to attack that problem <e>", "<cs> we have a little repetition again i am afraid <e> <s> the first amendment would allow no choice but to apply the inflation rate as the indexation factor <e> <s> it would thus deprive a future secretary of state of the option of indexing the loans at a rate below that of inflation <e> <s> we have heard many arguments to the effect that the loans should not be indexed at all or not for particular groups <e> <s> it does not surprise me that we now have an amendment which is totally contrary to those which the opposition have moved before by removing the possibility of using something less than the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord colwyn reminded us that i had brought this amendment to the attention of the committee <e> <s> i commented on it way back during our discussion on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it was then that i said that we intended that the annual repayment should be kept manageable for students on courses longer than four years <e> <s> the noble lord lord addington has also been ploughing that furrow even at second reading <e> <s> as he said we covered that point at least three times <e> <s> i do lot object to covering it yet again even though i have to be repetitious <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peston has made complaint about the lateness of the hour at which we are discussing an amendment such as this <e> <s> my noble friend the leader of the house has heard it <e> <s> all i can say is that i have sat not in his position but behind him when we were in opposition <e> <s> we were kept up to all hours of the night by the labour party when it was in power in the s <e> <s> it is a complaint made by whoever is in opposition <e> <s> whenever it gets a little late one tends to think that the next amendment is the most important and that it should be taken at a more convenient hour for a particular person <e>", "<cs> i think it would be helpful if i made one thing clear right at the start <e> <s> it relates to a point that the noble earl lord russell made which was picked up by my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> i wrote to him on the matter <e> <s> i wish to make it absolutely clear so that everybody knows that there is no question of referees acting as guarantors for a loan taken out by a student <e> <s> that should be placed firmly on the record so that there can be no dispute <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord says and i shall take up the point later <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether on consideration this matter of not acting as a referee is as serious as the committee considers it <e> <s> i of course take account of what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> however as i have explained the purpose of the measure is to help the student loans company to try to trace graduates who are in debt <e> <s> it may not even be necessary to go to a referee <e> <s> i do not see that as being a great deterrent to being a referee <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to what the noble lord lord peston said <e> <s> i take his point that some people will for some reason quite inadvertently get behind with their payments or will not start paying when they should <e> <s> i understand that but i believe there will also be the deliberate defaulters <e> <s> however what amazes me is the attitude of the noble lord as regards helping to track those people down <e> <s> those people have borrowed off the taxpayer and are due to repay the taxpayer <e> <s> the attitude of the noble lord as regards recouping that money filled me with amazement <e>", "<cs> i am not convinced of the last remark of the noble earl although i was impressed by his earlier arguments <e> <s> i should like to reassure the committee that as i said earlier i shall look at the matter again and bring it to the attention of my right honourable friend in view of the concerns that have been expressed <e> <s> there are some arguments that i should like to tease out perhaps later today <e>", "<cs> the original amendment is amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> that is a classic case of the noble earl saying that he does not have enough information and when we provide that information the noble earl seeks almost word for word to put it on the face of the bill <e> <s> i hope that he will accept that in principle i have agreed the amendment of my noble friend lady young that this will all be subject to affirmative resolution procedures when it will be discussed <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend is ingenious enough to get the subject into discussion <e> <s> he has done so very much through a side door but it is a well marked side door <e>", "<cs> i have been doing that a few years especially in the environmental council and more recently the budget council <e>", "<cs> there is one point that i should like to make after the last discussion that we have had and i see that the noble lord lord adrian is still in his place <e> <s> i should like to confirm just so that there is absolutely no misunderstanding the point that my noble friend lady blatch and i have been making at great length <e> <s> my right honourable friends door is open for further discussions on the scheme that we have before us <e> <s> i know that the noble lord has been to see my right honourable friend and i hope that that has been valuable <e> <s> i hope too that if he feels there is any point that he would like to discuss with me or my right honourable friend he will take the opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> i shall try to help the noble earl very briefly <e> <s> what we are talking about here is misrepresentation in an application for deferment not for the loan <e>", "<cs> i would like first to explain briefly the governments plans for the administration of the student loans scheme <e> <s> it is the governments intention subject to the passage of this bill that the student loans company limited will administer the loans scheme <e> <s> thus applications will be made to the company which will make the appropriate payments to students <e> <s> the company will also collect repayments and determine whether loans should be cancelled or repayments deferred <e> <s> it is therefore the loans company that will bear responsibility for the administration of the scheme <e> <s> i confirm to my noble friend that the government will meet the companys costs in full <e> <s> however my noble friend raised the important point of the role of those in the higher education institutions <e> <s> i confirm to my noble friend that we are considering whether it would be desirable to seek to amend the bill to place the higher education institutions under the duty they require <e> <s> that is an important point on which i know the noble lords lord flowers and lord adrian will seek reassurance <e> <s> any question of remuneration would have to be considered in the light of that decision <e> <s> the government intend that loans will be made available to students in the most cost-effective manner <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously in arriving at our figures the government take into account a great many factors some of which the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> however there were special factors with regard to the fall in the second half of <e> <s> the fall partly reflected temporary factors <e> <s> one was the high net community contributions in the third and fourth quarters resulting from delayed receipts and annual reassessments of the uk contribution in earlier years <e> <s> that contribution is likely to be substantially lower next year <e> <s> there were also exceptionally poor insurance figures as a result of recent heavy claims <e>", "<cs> my lords the invisible surplus in to which the noble lord refers was the highest on record <e> <s> at that stage the current account was broadly in balance <e> <s> as the noble lord said the subsequent turnaround has been dramatic but we foresee an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord tempts me into a long reply which is the subject of a debate in its own right <e> <s> i know that your lordships would not appreciate that when we have so much other business to cover later today <e> <s> there have been a number of factors involved but i know that the noble lord will be particularly concerned about the increased receipts to the community <e> <s> however he will also welcome the fact that our net overseas assets rose very strongly in <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right but i think we are straying a little far from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear the noble lord has an advantage over me as i cannot remember who the late chancellor of the exchequer was <e>", "<cs> my lords i try to answer whatever questions are put to me but i agree with my noble friend that we have gone rather wide of the question on the order paper today <e>", "<cs> my lords a bank of england survey estimated that the average daily turnover of the london foreign exchange market was about billion dollars undertaken in a variety of currencies <e> <s> it is impossible to identify the source of individual components of the overall figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware from the dti report that the sultan visited london in january <e> <s> with regard to any agreement with the sultan about supporting sterling i have absolutely no knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my opening answer the bank of england survey showed that about billion dollars was the annual daily turnover <e> <s> it is impossible to identify the resources from which those funds came <e> <s> as to government intervention it has been the practice of successive governments never to disclose details of past or present interventions in foreign exchange markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure to which of the many answers i have given the noble baroness refers <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> with respect the duty of the bank of england is to monitor the foreign exchange markets <e> <s> it so happens that in the bank did a survey and kept a daily total <e> <s> that is why i was able to give a rough figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree <e> <s> i find it difficult to see in such allegations any <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not they discussed the weather i do not know but it is true that the sultan met the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords a very full staterment was made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place and it was repeated by my noble friend lord trefgame <e> <s> there is also to be a debate next week <e> <s> i have nothing further to add <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord links two points <e> <s> one is allegation the other is a question about which there has been a report from the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is alleging fraud that is a matter to be dealt with by the prosecuting authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as i fully expected when i saw the question on the order paper the real purpose of the noble lord lord hatch is to ask a totally separate question which is not related to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not proficient in the ways of another place <e> <s> before i continue perhaps i may say that it is nice to see the noble lord back in his place <e> <s> i hope that he was fit enough to watch the great occasion at murrayfield which so many of us enjoyed <e> <s> if not he was certainly there in spirit i am sure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether it is a precedent <e> <s> it was orginally a private company <e> <s> the government then took it over <e> <s> we will bring in outside directors and the question of the shareholding is a matter in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the noble lords concern <e> <s> however i do not think that his concern is valid on this occasion <e> <s> if he would care to look at schedule he will see that it reads <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it will be governed by the companies act but it will also be covered by primary legislation and this legislation in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the situation it would not require primary legislation because the companies act does not require legislation in order to transfer the ownership of a company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a lawyer but as i understand it the bill limits the amount to the rate of inflation the principle being that the undergraduate who receives a loan repays to the taxpayer via the government the same amount in real terms as he borrowed <e> <s> however perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to look further into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say a word <e> <s> i am still of the opinion that that is the meaning <e> <s> the noble baroness raised the matter and i was trying to be helpful when i said that i would look at it <e> <s> now that my noble and learned friend has given full support to my understanding of the bill i have even more confidence that i am right <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord peston has reminded us the amendment is similar to an amendment that we debated in committee <e> <s> it seeks to give the secretary of state the option of making ineligible for loans all students beginning their courses before the academic year <e> <s> the amendment therefore drives a coach and horses through what the government intend <e>", "<cs> my lords first i pay tribute to the noble lord lord addington who has persisted in bringing this matter to the attention of the house <e> <s> he has done the house a service by doing so <e> <s> the noble lord and the government are at one in recognising that students on longer courses will have built up larger loan liabilities on completing their courses than will students on the shorter three-year courses <e> <s> as i have said before we intend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the access funds for higher education will be doubled as a result of the announcement by my right honourable friend <e> <s> they will cover scottish students <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must say to the noble lord that i cannot give him the answer because i do not have the figures <e> <s> the answer as to who will benefit from the access funds is very tricky to work out <e> <s> it depends on the students who are receiving housing benefit at the moment <e> <s> not all students are receiving it as the noble lord knows <e> <s> the grants are being uprated for the forthcoming year <e> <s> those students who have been taking four-year courses in scotland which the noble lord has assured us are still popular will be aware that the value of the grant has declined ever since <e> <s> that is one of the problems that we are seeking to rectify as regards the loan <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments were tabled at committee stage <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to look carefully at what the noble earls figures have revealed <e> <s> my latest information is that per cent <e> <s> of national average earnings amounts to <e> <s> those are the latest available figures <e> <s> the figures were revised upwards as a result of the work we undertook in order to give your lordships the most up-to-date figures available <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady david in support of her argument quoted from my noble friend lord carr of hadley with words to the effect that it would be sad to put this bill to bed without there being the power to be able to extend the bill to part-time students <e> <s> let me make it clear to the house that the bill as it stands provides for students in higher education generally to have access to loans <e> <s> there is no need to amend it to bring part-time students into the scope of the loan scheme <e> <s> the argument that the noble baroness used in support of her amendment is already catered for because in the bill as it stands part-time students can be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house is aware we have agreed that the regulations first made to establish the scheme should be subject to the affirmative procedure <e> <s> we have therefore met the main objective of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it cannot be right that those who have benefited from taxpayer support in the form of preferential loans when students in this country should avoid repaying the taxpayer by working permanently abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the noble earl withdraws his amendment is a matter for him <e> <s> in any event i hope that he listened carefully to what i said about the repayment process as outlined in the rules and procedure document which i am sure he has read carefully <e> <s> there is no question of an exit visa but i think it is appropriate that the company as a commercial entity should have the power to collect loans by whatever method it so chooses from undergraduates who have taken loans and who then go to live and work abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments intention that repayments should be about a year <e> <s> as i have already announced we are extending the period of repayment to seven years initially for those who borrow over five years so that their repayments do not exceed this level <e> <s> as the scheme develops and the maximum loan each year increases in real terms we shall extend the repayment period so that repayments remain at a manageable level <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would require the secretary of state to prohibit by regulation access by the student loans company or any other person or body discharging functions under the arrangements to any record held by a higher education institution concerning an eligible student <e> <s> there is no qualification that the access would have to be without the institutions consent <e> <s> i assume therefore that the noble baroness wishes to prevent such access even where the institution does consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very surprised to see this amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> after the noble lord lord peston said that he was very keen to follow the procedures of the house and not to break the traditions or orders under which we operate i have to say that i was even more surprised when he moved the amendment <e> <s> the amendment that we are discussing at the moment is based on exactly the same principle as one on which we voted last week <e> <s> that amendment amendment no <e> <s> k which was moved by the noble baroness lady david who now sits in her place was lost by to votes i am therefore more than a little surprised that the noble lord again raises exactly the same principle today <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the principle is exactly the same and i know that the noble baroness would agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to answer the noble lords lord addington and lord flowers <e> <s> the house decided to agree to one amendment which effectively nullifies this amendment <e> <s> the cost to the taxpayer will be at least another million <e> <s> we shall have to look at the matter in the cold light of day and assess it <e> <s> taxpayers have today had another million charged to their account in addition to the increase in the access funds <e> <s> it is all part of one equation which we shall need to examine <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was spoken to with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is not consequential on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords we announced last week a very generous package of assistance for disabled people <e> <s> the disabled students allowance will be enhanced significantly and we shall disregard disability-related benefits when assessing income for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome given to what i have said albeit that the welcome of the noble lord lord peston was grudging <e> <s> i hope that it was helpful all the same <e> <s> to have even grudging thanks from the noble lord is something <e>", "<cs> my lords the student will receive the money as soon as the process is completed <e> <s> in this respect i was grateful for the words of my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> the simplest and best scheme is to ensure that the student receives the money as soon as possible <e> <s> however it is only right and we are talking about taxpayers money that the student should be on a registered course and that he should be an eligible student in the eyes of the university or the college <e> <s> the process can then go forward fairly speedily <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make myself clear on that point <e> <s> if i <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall look into the matter <e> <s> the noble baroness is talking about two different aspects one is the grant and the other is the loan <e> <s> i would hope that the student loan company being a commercially orientated company would seek to get the loan dealt with as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords parliament is rightly interested both in the amount of money that will need to be made available to students each year and in the administrative costs of the student loans company <e> <s> we have already provided a great deal of information and a great many statistics relating to the scheme <e> <s> many of those have taken the form of estimates of costs <e> <s> much of the information sought by the noble baroness and the noble earl is already in the public domain <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a short interesting and useful debate which has covered most of the points involved <e> <s> i shall therefore deal with the matters of concern <e> <s> i believe that the important point was encompassed by the question posed by the noble earl lord russell who said that he was not clear what the effect of not having the amendment would be and that if he was clear on that he could decide whether to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> no my lords not it is <e> <s> it is nowhere near <e> <s> of that figure in universities in england there are <e> <s> in wales the kingdom of which the noble lord is so proud and rightly so the number is in scotland it is <e> <s> in polytechnics and colleges in england it is in wales it is eight and in scotland it is <e> <s> in scotland students are minors <e> <s> is the noble lord lord addington saying there was none at aberdeen <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not overlooked it <e> <s> the noble lord has overlooked it <e> <s> what we are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i rephrase what i said <e> <s> the noble lord lord addington appears to have overlooked it <e> <s> he admits that there were year-olds at aberdeen university <e> <s> if there was any doubt if there had been anything that i said that would not mean that minors would be getting loans i think that that would have been taken up by your lordships <e> <s> my noble friend the leader of the house has more than fulfilled the obligations that he gave to the house this afternoon <e> <s> i commend the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it a procedure has been devised <e> <s> so far as concerns the first question i am not aware of anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the remarks of the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> we shall miss him at third reading <e> <s> i am extremely grateful for his kind remarks and particularly for the role that he will play in his institution if the bill becomes an act which it has not done yet <e> <s> i am sure that we all hope vehemently that it will do so as soon as possible <e> <s> i know that the noble earl will read with his usual diligence the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not bet any more although i should be tempted to take on a bet with the noble lord <e> <s> however he will be the first to appreciate that the present underlying rate of inflation is lower than at any time under the previous labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords after madrid my right honourable friend the prime minister clearly set out the exact terms under which we should enter the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> those were repeated by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer in his budget statement <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer made clear in his budget statement which i am sure the noble lord has read with care he looked at the question of whether some form of credit controls would be appropriate <e> <s> he decided that they would not and that the interest rate was the most effective and direct method of bringing down inflation which is the governments overall concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon is right to remind the house that to join the erm is by no means a panacea <e> <s> a tight monetary policy will still be needed <e> <s> the right exchange rate at which to enter the erm is a matter to be decided <e> <s> it is important not only to bring down inflation in this country but also to ensure that other countries will fulfil their part of the bargain as set out in the madrid statement <e>", "<cs> my lords after some of the debates on the student loans bill it is nice to see that the liberals are more european than they have been of late <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there were exceptional factors in the last invisibles figures <e> <s> the noble lord will be pleased to know that the forecast published in the red book on budget day showed an invisibles surplus of billion for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that information of which i was not aware <e> <s> that is not the only money coming into <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest figures for the past quarter included those exceptional items <e> <s> the reason why they are heading the balance now is that the exceptional items are not included <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know exactly when we were last in deficit in invisibles <e> <s> i believe that it was just after the war if my memory serves me right <e> <s> it is not a trend <e> <s> there were exceptional factors and as i said the forecast for next year is in surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the house appreciates the noble lords concern with regard to the european community but his question is rather wider than that on the order paper <e> <s> i shall be happy to answer him on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords manufacturing and services both matter <e> <s> the noble lord will be pleased to know that manufacturing exports are rising rapidly they were up per cent <e> <s> in volume terms in over <e>", "<cs> my lords i stated the views of the government clearly both this afternoon and in the answer to the question last week on exactly the same matter <e> <s> the noble lord referred to hot money but that is a slightly outdated term <e> <s> in our modem deregulated world of highly mobile capital the distinction between short- and long-term flows is not especially meaningful <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to the accuracy of forecasts <e> <s> all economists agree that accurate forecasts are difficult to produce <e> <s> between the forecasts of the noble lord and government advisers my bet lies with the government advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is aware of the figures i gave on invisibles <e> <s> he now knows that demand is slowing and therefore the deficit will reduce <e> <s> that together with increasing exports will help <e>", "<cs> my lord i do not agree with the noble lords last remark <e> <s> with regard to what he said concerning the red book that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested to hear the comments of noble lords <e> <s> perhaps it would be convenient for the house if i separated amendment no <e> <s> from this amendment because different arguments are involved <e> <s> however i shall try to answer the questions that your lordships have posed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read out the information that i have been given as regards the effect of the amendment of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to take further advice on that point <e> <s> when it comes to debating legal matters with my noble and learned friend one has to be very sure of ones legal ground <e> <s> however i can say that that is the advice that i have been given <e>", "<cs> my lords the salaries are paid by the taxpayer as i hope the noble baroness will have understood from what i have said on numerous occasions both in committee and at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords no gain will be made out of the making of loans whether the company is owned by the government or is in private ownership <e> <s> under whatever ownership minors will continue to enjoy the protection of section of the consumer credit act <e> <s> the government amendment on that section makes it clear that no gain or profit will be made out of the loan scheme <e> <s> that is the key point which i hope will resolve the concerns of the noble baroness whether the company is in public or private ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord with his great experience knows better than i where such information comes from <e> <s> i am told that it is of the highest repute as one would expect in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered that question too fully on report <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord has read the answer in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the motivation behind this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord addington has been very persistent in bringing it to your lordships notice <e> <s> it is intended to secure fair treatment for students following longer courses particularly those in scotland <e> <s> however i have to say that on the test of fairness i believe that it fails <e> <s> it would mean that a student on a course of four <e>", "<cs> my lords we announced on th march that there would be special provision for disabled people repaying their loans in the form of a disregard of disability-related benefits for the purpose of assessing a disabled graduates income for deferment <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of whether the bill permits the disabled to be treated differently i draw the noble lords attention to clause and particularly the last line <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend i have heard him use the opposite argument namely if it is provided for in the bill there is no need to write it on the face of <e>", "<cs> my lords at report stage i described in some detail the role of the academic institutions in the student loans scheme <e> <s> i said that while that role will be important it will also be limited as indeed has been requested <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must point out that i did not say that the cost was not large <e> <s> i said that the costs have to be quantified <e> <s> i said that the government are willing to make a contribution <e> <s> one of the points of the tuesday meeting is to assess exactly that issue <e> <s> we have to discuss the matter with the institutions <e> <s> we are in touch with them at the moment <e> <s> if the officials put forward a good idea and say that within that framework they can carry out what is required in a slightly different way and the costs will be so much or if the officials say that it would be easier to use an alternative method that will affect the cost <e> <s> i cannot say what the cost will be <e> <s> no way did i ever say that the cost would not be large <e> <s> i do not know what the cost will be and that is what the tuesday meeting will be concerned with <e> <s> your lordships have a commitment from me that the government will pay the money <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is not what the amendment states <e> <s> it might well be one definition of how we assess the cost but as all noble lords will know it is not the only way <e> <s> however i have given a very firm commitment to the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords what the government are willing to do is obviously to meet the reasonable costs of this scheme <e> <s> what i do not know is what those costs will be <e> <s> i have made a very firm commitment that the government are willing to make payments to the institutions <e> <s> that has to be decided at the meeting on tuesday <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said that could be one of the methods by which we arrive at an assessment of the final cost <e> <s> at this stage to pre-empt the discussion that will take place would be wrong <e> <s> i shall certainly draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the feeling in the house that that is what the preferred method would be <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question of getting the matter right <e> <s> i put it to your lordships that the best way of getting it right is to have a commitment from the government that they will meet the costs <e> <s> that i have given <e> <s> the best way for that to be assessed and agreed is at a meeting between the parties <e> <s> that will be on tuesday of next week <e> <s> it might not be the last meeting but it will certainly be the first <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not an expert on the definition of audited costs <e> <s> however i believe that audited proves the probity of the accounts <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord flowers is keen to get this right as are the government <e> <s> i am sure that he would understand that it would be wrong for me to prescribe at this stage before the meeting exactly the best method of assessing the final picture <e> <s> that is rightly left for the discussions that will be held <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a different question to which i do not know the answer <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware there are many meetings between officials and the higher institutions <e> <s> as i have said on numerous occasions we wish to continue to foster that situation <e> <s> it is absolutely fixed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord grimond and my noble friend lord eccles <e> <s> i think that that covers exactly what i have been saying and meets very much the concerns that your lordships have stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> perhaps i may say with the leave of the house because with respect we are on the point of becoming quite out of order that the amendment provides for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords it is worth recalling that before we brought forward this bill to your lordships there was an enormous amount of discussion and consultation carried out so much so that experience was sought from other countries around the world that were either doing a loans scheme a grants scheme a mixture of the two or some other form of finance to education <e> <s> in that latter category there is only australia with a very new novel and untested scheme <e> <s> that led in due course to the white paper which was followed by yet further consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords there are more answers to the noble lords question than one might presume at first instance <e> <s> the exchange rate is a factor that we take into account but there are many others <e> <s> we would all like to see interest rates come down <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will agree with me that inflation is the most important factor to get <e>", "<cs> my lords we have an exchange rate policy <e> <s> we favour a strong exchange rate policy <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know from his great experience in these matters interest rates are high in order to bring down inflation <e> <s> we have therefore a tight monetary policy as well as a fiscal policy <e>", "<cs> my lords what does the noble lord mean by few <e> <s> since the beginning of the year the pound has remained remarkably stable <e>", "<cs> my lords we do want a strong exchange rate <e> <s> that has been made clear by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> this affects the domestic money situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am on exactly the same ground as the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> we have made it abundantly clear that joining the erm is not a panacea <e> <s> we have made clear the terms on which we will join <e> <s> but it is worth noting as the noble lord has said that some <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for what the noble lord said about my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> i am sure that all the house will want to be associated with his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to prejudge when exactly the time will be right to join because conditions have to be right at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i believe that there is a difference <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the noble lords first question i hope that he was not beguiled by the press reports but read the statement that was issued by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer afterwards which made it perfectly clear that the british position had not changed <e> <s> regarding the second question and the position of the city of london of course we are keen to see the city of london retain its pre-eminent position <e>", "<cs> my lords it was made perfectly clear in the debates in another place and in this house that the mood of parliament was that we should not go to stage three including a european central bank <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> the noble lord has also asked me a number of hypothetical questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have spelt out clearly on a number of occasions their attitude towards stage three <e> <s> i said that the gist of the governments position was supported by both houses in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of any bank depends on its terms of reference <e> <s> the extent to which a bank is genuinely independent varies from country to country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very clear statement of his position on the matter <e> <s> the government have made a very clear statement of their position <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the inter-governmental conference is due to start later this year in which we shall play a very active part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to which figures the noble lord refers <e> <s> i know that considerable work is now being undertaken by the statistical office to try to improve some of the information that is available to us <e>", "<cs> my lords the key problem which we face is inflation <e> <s> that is the important item which we must bring under control so that it is well down from its present figure <e> <s> that is best tackled by using interest rates <e> <s> it is also helpful to have a strong exchange rate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is easy to continue on the same point when it is correct <e> <s> i am disappointed that the noble lord as yet does not appreciate that <e> <s> with regard to the second string of supplementaries which the noble lord asked i am afraid that we are in a different country from that which he imagines <e> <s> the government do not control all the matters which he listed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there are a number of factors which are the cause of the recent rise in inflation or indeed any figure which the noble lord may wish to take <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston who is an acknowledged economist will say that there is a formula which could be used to try to determine such a figure <e> <s> however that formula depends on other things being equal <e> <s> as your lordships well know other things are not always equal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord wins the full admiration of the house for his consistency in trying but i am not going to answer his question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows full well that there are a number of factors <e> <s> there is an excess increase of demand over productivity which has led to some higher prices <e> <s> the present rate of inflation is something of which we are not proud but it is a rate of which the labour party would have been very proud <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not forecast what the figures may be in the future <e> <s> i have given an estimate for the figure towards the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate that the high interest rates needed to combat inflation have caused many difficulties for those with mortgages <e> <s> however let us contrast that with the situation of high inflation in the s <e> <s> that undermined pensioners savings by one-third <e> <s> the noble lord will appreciate that it is better to have a little pain now in order to solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had replied fully to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have replied <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord does not think i have done so <e> <s> i shall check the record with great care and if it is felt that i have not replied perhaps the question can be tabled again <e>", "<cs> my lords i always try to ensure that copies of any letters written to your lordships are placed in the library in accordance with the usual practice <e> <s> however i feel that i have answered fully the noble lords question today <e>", "<cs> my lords a detailed point programme of work to combat fraud was approved by the ecofin council in june last year <e> <s> a progress report was considered by the ecofin council in march this year <e> <s> the council took note of the improvements which have been achieved but emphasised that much remained to be done <e> <s> it made specific reference to the need to simplify legislation and the importance of continuing to improve and increase co-operation between the authorities of the member states and the departments of the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not share totally the noble lords pessimism on this matter <e> <s> it may be that not all member states attach the same priority to the issue of fraud as does the united kingdom <e> <s> however i can tell your lordships that our determination to ensure that the issue remains prominent on the communitys agenda is already bearing fruit <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that the community has done more to tackle fraud over the past months than in the whole of the previous decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the whole house would like to compliment the noble baroness on the work that she accomplished when chairing the committee on fraud from which a report was produced which was read widely throughout the community as are all the reports of your lordships house on european matters <e> <s> however we are not convinced that the court of auditors is the appropriate body to produce the kind of report mentioned <e> <s> its main duty is to examine the communitys budget accounts <e> <s> in doing that it fulfils a vital role in identifying weaknesses in management organisation and legislation which might hold the risk of fraud <e> <s> the commission is far more directly involved through its anti-fraud unit and is in a position to produce an annual report promptly at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission disallows expenditure when payments are not made in accordance with the rules of a particular scheme <e> <s> the noble lord was right to say that it is the responsibility of member states to enforce their own law and penalties on fraud <e> <s> however the commission is building up a database of national anti-fraud systems and penalties and consideration is being given to partial funding by the community of enhancements to member states existing arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look at the matter again without any commitment <e> <s> but we looked at it with great care and felt that the special anti-fraud unit in the commission was the right vehicle and that the court of auditors had a slightly different role from which it should not be diverted <e>", "<cs> my lords i can update your lordships regarding what happened at the ecofin conference in march <e> <s> the united kingdom representative my honourable friend the economic secretary was the only minister who spoke on the matter which shows the great concern of the united kingdom in trying to lead europe on this matter as it is leading on other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass that last thought on to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> but it is not something on which britain can act alone <e> <s> it has to be tackled by every country in europe <e> <s> the only effective way is to take the other member states along with us and that we are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the contents of the act <e> <s> however with regard to the noble lords second question it is the governments duty to bring down inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord bruce of donington that there is no need for change <e>", "<cs> my lords we are actually talking about the role of central banks <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware that varies from country to country whether one takes the example of america or japan <e> <s> over the past five years japans inflation rate has been the lowest in g although the bank of japan is one of the least independent central banks <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always delighted to receive opinion from all sources <e> <s> as the noble lord knows we study such opinion with great care <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most fascinating question <e> <s> however i think that it is slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no proposals at the moment <e> <s> the courts role is clearly defined in the treaty and any significant strengthening would require a change to the treaty <e> <s> at the dublin summit on th april it was agreed that foreign ministers would consider the question of institutional change <e> <s> they will report back at the summit planned for th-th june and decisions will then be taken on whether to call a second inter-governmental conference to consider institutional issues <e> <s> in the context of such an igc the uk would need to consider whether to pursue its long standing desire of improving financial <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss question on th april concerned fraud <e> <s> i stand by the answer i gave on that occasion <e> <s> we do not think that the court of auditors is the appropriate body to produce an annual report on progress in the fight against fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords i was clarifying the context in which the noble baroness phrased her question <e> <s> she indicated that i had changed my ground from that of th april <e> <s> i have not <e> <s> the subject of the powers of the court of auditors is one on which your lordships commented some years ago and which might be a matter into which we could look if there is a second igc <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the points that the noble lord has put to me <e> <s> he will <e>", "<cs> my lords fraud is a separate question from the one on the order paper <e> <s> we dealt with it in the question asked by the noble baroness on th april <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the noble lord is disappointed that the present inflation rate is not above per cent <e> <s> we stick by the chancellors forecast of what the inflation rate will be at the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that economic policy takes a long time to work but if one is asked a question one must answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords no interest rates are the right policy with which to deal with this problem <e> <s> consumer credit control does not work except in the short term and then it leads to massive distortions as every country has found <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the key markets such as the retail sales market he will find not on a monthly basis because that is the wrong way to look at such figures but on a three-monthly basis that in the last three months compared with the comparable three months a year ago retail sales are up per cent <e> <s> the noble lord will also be aware that car registrations are well down and the housing market is flat which show that high interest rates are working <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct but we can appreciate the difficulties of those who have to operate in a thought-free zone <e>", "<cs> my lords we clearly have reduced inflation <e> <s> the noble viscounts memory must alas be extremely short <e> <s> he does not have to think that far back to the days when inflation was well into double figures and up into the s <e> <s> as the noble viscount will be aware the recent monthly figures have been distorted by two items which are not taken into account in other european countries <e> <s> one is the community charge <e> <s> in that no allowance is made for the generous government rebates which are not taken into account when calculating the rpi <e> <s> secondly in the community no country other than ireland includes mortgage interest payments <e>", "<cs> my lords the previous labour governments average increase in rpi was per cent <e> <s> whereas ours is per cent <e> <s> that may be slightly misleading because if one takes out mortgage interest payments the matter becomes more relevant <e> <s> on that basis the labour governments average was per cent <e> <s> and ours is per cent <e> <s> one can see that the current inflation rate of per cent <e> <s> excluding mortgage interest payments is about only per cent <e> <s> above the lowest that labour ever achieved <e> <s> in comparison to europe in the -year period betwen may and february our inflation rate that is our headline inflation rate was per cent <e> <s> above the ec average <e> <s> if one works that out on a comparable basis i said earlier that one has to remove the community charge or the rates as they were and mortgage interest payments one finds that our inflation rate was per cent <e> <s> lower than the community average <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in the rate of inflation between september and april as the noble lord well knows will be reflected in the next uprating of benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that some countries charge nothing for owner-occupied or tenanted property costs <e> <s> some do <e> <s> i was trying to give a truer comparison than using the headline rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the date for which my noble friend is looking is august when the rate reached per cent <e> <s> that shows just how high it went <e> <s> i have explained on numerous occasions not only today how much better it is under our government than under the labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that the current rate of inflation both the headline and the underlying rate is far too high <e> <s> that is why we shall get it down <e>", "<cs> my lords this governments battle against inflation is never done <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the statement of the bank of england that economic policy is back on track <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the comparison that the noble lord seeks to make <e> <s> i am also aware that under labour the average inflation rate was per cent <e> <s> whereas under this government it is per cent <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware inflation rose as a result of looser monetary supply than we would have wished following the stock market crash when it was agreed by all nations that interest rates should be reduced <e> <s> indeed the party opposite wished us to reduce interest rates even further than we did and more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend is absolutely right <e> <s> we are treading very familiar ground <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord chided me the other day for straying from the question on the order paper <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to do that now <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised a most important point <e> <s> the headline rate of inflation is not a fair comparison for wages <e> <s> a more appropriate measure would be the tax and prices index which showed a rise last month to per cent <e> <s> which is considerably different from the headline rate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments duty to bring inflation down and we shall succeed in doing so <e> <s> one of the reasons for the substantial rise in the headline rate of inflation was the change from rates to the community charge when local authorities applied the equivalent of a per cent <e> <s> rate rise which added per cent <e> <s> to the index <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take this opportunity to condemn those high-spending local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords using credit control to reduce inflation does not work <e> <s> as mr greenspan the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the exact number but all european countries use interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords the result of the increase in inflation has been high interest rates which inevitably react on mortgages <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will agree with me that inflation is ultimately much more serious than high interest rates <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that in the seventies pensioners savings were reduced by a third during the term in office of the labour government due entirely to inflation <e> <s> under this government those savings have risen <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is referring to the minimum reserve requirements of some banks <e> <s> that is merely a device to control interest rates <e> <s> the german constitution will not permit the banks to act in the way that the bank of england can through treasury bills <e> <s> therefore they use an alternative method known as the minimum reserve requirement <e> <s> that is purely a device to control interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a substantial amount of growth in the economy <e> <s> there has not been for many years such a long sustained period of growth as under this government <e> <s> that combined with the loosening of monetary policy following the stock market crash has led to inflation <e> <s> that is why we need high interest rates to bring it back down <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave that answer because it would be contrary to european community law to extend our current vat zero-rating provisions <e> <s> the relief for motor cyclists helmets was introduced in the budget and whereas the sixth vat directive allows member states to retain zero rates which were in force on st december we cannot widen the scope of existing provisions nor introduce new ones <e>", "<cs> my lords one would then have to arrange a survey of a new set of figures different from that on which the ifs made its survey <e> <s> it made the survey taking as a base the - rates bills uplifted for inflation <e> <s> it has not attempted to estimate what rate bills would have been this year <e> <s> your lordships will be well aware that local authorities have imposed a per cent <e> <s> rate rise this year <e>", "<cs> my lords one must remember that about half or a large proportion of <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual the noble lord is very quick to criticise but offers nothing in its place <e> <s> will the noble lord tell us what he has in mind for the ro of tax <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has a valid point <e> <s> it is also worth putting on record that the ifs study does not take account of very generous transitional relief offered by the government to the taxpayer <e> <s> it does not take into account the take-up of community charge benefits which an substantial and greater than those that existed under the rating system <e> <s> it does not take account of the charge capping of high spending authorities <e> <s> the government have put forward a lot of money in support of those on low pay <e> <s> however in order to help mitigate community charge bills i understand that some of your lordships are betting on lord bertie which is running this afternoon at salisbury races <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl will know under the inequitable rating system only some million households paid rates <e> <s> some million adults will pay the community charge <e> <s> the benefits system which the government have put forward means that about million people that is one charge payer in four will qualify <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall that we were constantly changing the rating system in order to make it fairer and we are presently looking at certain representations submitted to us <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question is no the answer to his second question is that there was as i am sure he will recall from his experience in a previous position which he held in another place a green paper <e> <s> there has been much debate on this subject most recently in your lordships house on th december of last year <e> <s> at no stage have we sought to exclude opinion from whatever source <e> <s> we have thoroughly encouraged debate throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right in saying that the erm is a mechanism <e> <s> the key point which we should bear in mind is that entry into the erm will not reduce the inflation rate but it will indeed help to keep it down once we have got it down <e> <s> my noble friend was right to remind the house that such membership would not be a panacea <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is particularly persuasive today <e> <s> i am happy to be able to reiterate to your lordships the full conditions upon which we shall join the erm which i have spelt out to the house on more than one occasion <e> <s> we are committed to join the erm when the level of uk inflation is significantly lower <e> <s> there is capital liberalisation in the community and real progress has been made towards completion of the single market freedom of financial services and strengthened competition policy <e> <s> we have had numerous debates and questions on the matter <e> <s> i hope that the governments position is now absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the erm will have benefits for this country in giving greater exchange rate stability against our community trading partners <e> <s> it will reinforce the governments policy to get inflation decisively down <e> <s> that is how we shall use the crutch <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i attach the same importance to that fact as my noble friend <e> <s> however it is important that we should have a very firm commitment to join the erm and we shall do so when the conditions that i have set out are met <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to welcome the noble lords question on the matter <e> <s> however that is a matter which will have to be decided at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be well aware that we have brought down inflation <e> <s> we shall bring it down from its present level <e> <s> we have brought down the level of unemployment quite significantly <e> <s> however the noble lord and the government disagree if he believes that the erm can be of no help we believe that it will be of help <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not sure <e> <s> i do not have the figures with me <e> <s> however what i know is that the average rate of inflation under this government has been about half that which existed under the noble lords government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord reads into those articles in the press what he wishes to read <e> <s> my replies on this subject yesterday and today make the governments position absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords before i answer that question i am sure the whole house would like to join me in wishing my noble friend a very very happy birthday <e>", "<cs> my lord the key point regarding erm entry is not a reduction of the united kingdom inflation rate in itself it is that our inflation rate should be on a downward trend and a little closer to that of our european partners on a comparable basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that the noble lord continues to adopt a different view from noble lords on his front bench <e> <s> i would not draw the same conclusion from the first part of the noble lords question as he did therefore he asks a purely hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends first question is separate from the question on the order paper <e> <s> with regard to his second question my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> we shall join the erm when it is right for the united kingdom to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of inflation is another matter <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to put down a question on that subject i shall be pleased to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely disagree with the noble lords assertion that the governments position has deteriorated i think that the position of the government is continuing to improve healthily <e> <s> regarding his second point as the noble lord will know we are already members of the ems <e> <s> we are talking about whether we should become members of the erm <e> <s> that decision will be taken <e> <s> the principles have been agreed the terms have been set out and the decision will be taken when it is right for the uk to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no contradiction between what my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer said and what i have said today <e> <s> the noble lord has sought to widen the question to such matters as unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the main thrust of the noble lords questions about the credit boom <e> <s> as to ensuring savings in the future he will be aware of the measures contained in the budget of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer in which he announced the setting up of a new tax-exempt savings account known as tessa <e> <s> i am sure that the house will also welcome the abolition of the composite rate of tax on income which will mean that some million people who do not fall into the tax bracket and who automatically pay tax at the moment will not be paying tax <e> <s> the noble lord will be delighted to know that the government this week announced further measures on national savings which i hope will be published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> a new tax would not help <e> <s> from what we have been able to glean of the labour partys proposals i understand that the tax on unearned income would increase by per cent above the present level <e> <s> i am sure that that is something to which no one would look forward <e>", "<cs> my lords that was shown conclusively by the noble lords party when it was in cahoots with the labour party at the end of the s <e> <s> those who tried to save found that under labour their saving incomes fell by per cent in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can agree with the noble lords figures <e> <s> it is true that the personal savings ratio declined in the s <e> <s> it reached a low in the third quarter of since when it has been

has because there has been considerable concern felt by those who are lending <e> <s> they do not wish to lend money to those who will be unable to repay it in due course <e> <s> that would not be

opposition on the importance of the subject <e> <s> i discussed the possibility of a white paper with my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> we are still considering the matter and a decision has not been taken <e> <s> however there is a great deal of evidence in front of everybody at the moment <e> <s> it is important to remember that this problem cannot be solved by the united kingdom alone it is a matter not only for all other member states but also for every country in the world that benefits from trade <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which the noble baroness has asked me before <e> <s> if i remember rightly it is something that we might consider if there is a second igc which has still yet to be decided at the forthcoming meeting of foreign affairs ministers <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is extremely difficult not only to assess the level of fraud but also the amount of the loss <e> <s> in cases were dealt with by the intervention board and customs <e>", "<cs> my lords the report to which the noble lord refers has been taken into account <e> <s> we shall study it very closely <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as a result of an initiative by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer the report was put on <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that there have been three reports in the recent past <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord agrees with me that there has never been such an intensive effort on this matter within europe as has occurred during the past months <e> <s> we agree that that is not enough however <e> <s> we know that every country has a lot to do and we know that the commission has a lot to do to put its house in order <e> <s> however we have taken action and we shall continue to study the reports <e> <s> where there is a need to take further action we shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the government remain firmly committed to the defeat of inflation <e> <s> tight monetary and fiscal policies will ensure that inflation falls from its current level <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord will be keen to know that for much of the s the uk inflation rate was below that of <e>", "<cs> my lords there is indeed a link between unearned wage costs and inflation <e> <s> however there is a much greater and longer link between unemployment and higher wage costs <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i did not imply that at all as the noble lord knows full well <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not read the docuent to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> therefore it is difficult for me to answer the question because it was rather general <e> <s> however i shall be happy to try to do so when i have a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be possible to reduce inflation by the means that the noble lord suggested <e> <s> it is the first time that i have heard anybody on those benches suggest a tax cut <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never said that it was negligible <e> <s> as the noble lords party <e>", "<cs> it is interesting to hear the noble lord put forward a proposition for reducing it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend certainly has a very valid point and some very valid questions if one is to believe that that is the policy of noble lords opposite <e> <s> i do not believe that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the way that the labour party presents its policies that it will do anything to try to sit on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is wrong on those figures <e> <s> taxation has been dramatically reduced under this government <e> <s> the one factor that he does not take into account is the consequences of the high borrowing which the noble lords party instigated <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first four questions of the noble lord the leader of the opposition is no <e> <s> i believe his figures to be wrong and not justified by those that were given to me by the commission yesterday at ecofin <e> <s> with regard to the fifth question the situation is being remedied by a tight monetary and fiscal policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> he includes various assumptions which are not taxes <e> <s> they are not and have not been classified as such <e> <s> we have dramatically reduced the tax burden for people in this country because what we have paid for we have paid for out of taxes not by high borrowing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to bring us back to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we use a tight monetary policy to reduce inflation <e> <s> that has been the proven way and the way accepted by everyone in the community <e> <s> that is backed by a tight fiscal policy which buttresses a tight monetary policy <e>", "<cs> on the noble lords second point i am sure that i can give him the assurance that he seeks <e> <s> as he so rightly said it is a question of the day-to-day running <e> <s> i took that point even <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord intends to raise the matter a little later perhaps i may deal with the point then <e>", "<cs> our aim in setting the initial limit was to make it sufficient to cover the lifetime of a parliament that is a period of five years <e> <s> beyond that we would expect the government to have to seek an order increasing the initial limit if they wished to set up further trading funds <e> <s> that is consistent with most other statutory provisions covering the borrowing limits of public sector organisations although i admit at once that determining the precise figure is subject to many uncertainties not least on how quickly new trading funds will be set up <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has the respect of all members of the committee <e> <s> i was grateful to him for reaffirming his strong belief in his partys principles of nationalisation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving the amendment <e> <s> it gives me an opportunity to set out clearly for the committee the governments intentions with regard to the form of trading fund accounts <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for not making myself as clear as i should have liked in moving the amendment <e> <s> it is for convenience that we seek the amendment and hope that the committee will agree to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a point with regard to the most recent report on export refunds where the commissions behaviour was perhaps ill considered in that it had the chance to give its comments with the report and then gave a press release at the same time <e> <s> however the practice of allowing the report or the institutional bodys comments to be fed to the court of auditors before publication means that there is an opportunity to correct factual errors which only serves to enhance the value of the report <e> <s> perhaps more important is that the inclusion of comments from the commission or the institution or body being reported on puts more information before the council <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord will agree with me that that leads to better informed scrutiny and conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord has told us <e> <s> the reforms that the united kingdom instituted recently whereby the reports are taken up to ecofin as was the case with the recent report on export refunds which was done specifically at the request of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer show that everybody takes the report seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the effect of the report is minimised but the noble lord has a point which perhaps could best be dealt with by a code of practice rather than a change to the treaty or amendment of the financial regulations <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the last amendment to the financial regulations took some years to agree <e> <s> therefore a code of practice might better serve his purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his first remarks <e> <s> regarding the question which he put to me i shall not forecast the monthly inflation figure between now an the end of the year <e> <s> the forecast remains the same as in my right honourable friends budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords first remarks <e> <s> i believe that his question is slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> the government are seeking to tackle inflation which we all agree is too high even though the underlying rate is still per cent <e> <s> below the lowest ever achieved by the labour party in the s <e> <s> we are seeking to reduce that by tight monetary and fiscal policy <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting question but it is rather wide of that on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree entirely with the noble lords suggestion that we have lost control of inflation <e> <s> inflation is a great deal higher than we would like it to be <e> <s> we have set about reducing it but as the noble lord will realise it is nowhere near the per cent <e> <s> that his government achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the reasons why inflation is at its present level is the addition of the community charge <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take this opportunity to condemn the substantial increase of rates equivalent in the community charge imposed by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for tabling this amendment which i recommend that the house should accept <e> <s> it proves the diligent work which the noble lord has carried out on this bill <e> <s> it is something that we have come to expect from him and he has not let us down <e> <s> he has given careful and detailed study to this measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read with care what the noble lord said when the <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that he is ignorant on these matters it is worth recalling that there is nobody in your lordships house who knows more about patent work than the noble lord <e> <s> therefore i am slightly wary in giving him a precise answer <e>", "<cs> my lords nearly all the million elderly married couples who gain from independent taxation will have some investment income <e> <s> for those couples the introduction of independent taxation will provide a welcome benefit <e> <s> many will also be helped by the abolition from next year of composite rate tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall need to study the noble lords question with care <e> <s> if i do not give a full reply perhaps i may write to him <e> <s> the gain from independent taxation will affect million individuals million wives million elderly married couples breadwinner wives and <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody will be worse off <e>", "<cs> my lords the second part of the noble lords question does not directly relate to the main question <e> <s> but i understand that there are some million pensioner couples and that million pay income tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord as i am sure are many of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords welcome for what i said <e> <s> it is true to say that if the system does not evolve into a single currency it will remain a parallel currency <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is aware the lower band of the exchange rate mechanism is per cent <e> <s> there could be some fluctuations <e> <s> it is a matter that is about to be discussed in the inter-governmental conference <e> <s> it is a matter on which further work needs to be done before the inter-governmental conference <e> <s> your lordships views are most welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords no it is not two policies it is one policy <e> <s> there is the proposal to put forward a hard ecu which could evolve into a single currency if that was what we wished at the time <e> <s> that decision does not have to be taken now <e> <s> the great strength of the british proposal is that it is evolutionary <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord is not quite aware of the implications of the erm in which any currency can trade within a narrow band at present <e>", "<cs> my lords it has certainly been accepted as a matter for very serious consideration with our european partners <e>", "<cs> my lords there would not be a soft ecu because one would have a hard ecu and the national currencies as at present <e> <s> the hard ecu would be in line with the strongest of the european currencies <e> <s> we believe that it offers good opportunities for tourists and business to begin with <e> <s> but it may then evolve in its own way as people desire <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords welcome for our proposal <e> <s> i was not aware that he still had difficulty on this matter <e> <s> i knew that he had difficulty with the previous proposition <e> <s> if the noble lord reads the proposal very carefully i am sure that he too will come to such a conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble and learned friends concern on the matter <e> <s> if he is concerned and confused what hope is there for the remainder of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be helpful to the house if i were to quote the exact words used by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> she said <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord in that it is not diktat by government <e> <s> there has been an enormous amount of consultation and the terms upon which we shall enter have been clearly set out <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall enter at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting question <e> <s> if the noble lord were to table it i think it would be appropriate to answer it at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to say that inflation is one of the key ingredients of the madrid conditions <e> <s> the way we calculate headline inflation in this country is totally different from the way in which our partners in europe do so <e> <s> for that reason we seek to take out the mortgage interest payments and the community charge so as to put us on a more level playing field <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate on joining the erm has continued for many years <e> <s> the government have always encouraged open discussion on it <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord in that it is not a matter for high economic theory it is a matter for everyone in the country <e> <s> that is why we have sought to involve everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not make a statement of the type of which the noble lord accused <e>", "<cs> my lord the decision as to when we join the erm is one that my right honourable friends the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister will make when the time is right for the benefit of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little surprised at the noble baronesss question <e>", "<cs> my lords capital gains tax changes whether increasing or reducing liabilities normally apply to disposals on or after the date on which they come into force <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> the purpose of the change is simply to close a loophole through which capital gains tax losses could be artificially created <e> <s> i am sure that that is a measure that your lordships will welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord will agree that if somebody had bought an investment in a unit trust that dealt in the way that specifically relates to this question and invested million at par and sold that investment for million a year later due to indexation that investor would have a theoretical loss of to set off against other capital gains tax <e> <s> that is why we are closing the loophole <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a separate question but the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting and constructive debate this afternoon <e> <s> the debate has given rise to a large number of points both in general on the economy and for some of your lordships on specific matters on the bill <e> <s> i hope to deal with as many points as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure from where the noble lord obtained his figure of million <e>
