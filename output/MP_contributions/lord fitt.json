["<cs> my lords in the absence of the noble earl lord mansfield i take this opportunity to make a few remarks on the order <e> <s> i had hoped that on the occasion of my maiden intervention in the house i should have been able to exude some confidence or express some hope for northern ireland in the future <e> <s> however the events of yesterday afternoon in county armagh have determined otherwise <e> <s> the happenings yesterday afternoon in a little church not far from the border in northern ireland will i believe have shocked and appalled every member of this house <e> <s> i myself who have spent my lifetime in northern ireland cannot yet fully understand what was the motivation of those who carried out such a brutal and callous murder of innocent people in a place of worship <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there are a number of factors attached to this very brutal murder which are not evident in other murders <e> <s> first it was deliberately and overtly without any ambiguity or qualification designed to be a sectarian murder <e> <s> it took place in a church hall <e> <s> what arose from that was deliberately designed to bring about retaliation from the other community <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that the sinister motive for this latest dreadful murder has as was intended been seen to lie in the fact that young edgar graham sought and received a mandate from his community for his political point of view <e> <s> therefore his murder will be seen as a direct attack on the people who voted for him and whom he represented in the northern ireland assembly <e> <s> indeed mr graham was to come to this house tomorrow to put forward his quite legitimately held point of view as he had been doing since he was elected <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will know that for years i was a member of another place <e> <s> during that period of time it was always a considerable disappointment to me that when northern ireland was discussed it was always in an almost empty house <e> <s> i am saddened again tonight because there are even fewer members in this house at this time than there were in the house of commons <e> <s> the problems of northern ireland are so intractable so difficult and so serious that it would be in the interests of all noble lords in this house and indeed members in the house of commons to sit listen and pay more attention to the awful problems which have beset northern ireland for so many years <e>", "<cs> my lords as always when this legislation comes up for renewal i have a crisis of conscience <e> <s> i was born and reared in northern ireland <e> <s> throughout my life i have lived under emergency legislation <e> <s> the special powers legislation of was on the statute book for years until it was abolished by a conservative government <e> <s> it was replaced by the northern ireland emergency provisions act <e> <s> on top of that we have the overlay of the prevention of terrorism legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords possibly there might be a vote but i wish to say that i have an inherent distaste for the legislation and the sooner it is taken off the statute book the better for everyone concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am suffering from the same complaint as the noble earl was suffering from in moving this bill but i have been furiously sucking throat lozenges over this past minutes to ensure that i would be able to make some small contribution <e> <s> at the outset let me say that i would want to congratulate the noble earl lord attlee on what i regarded as a very moving speech which obviously must affect those in the chamber who have been able to listen to it <e> <s> i congratulate him <e> <s> i have not been a member of this house for very long but i take great pleasure in congratulating the noble earl on his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords in the short period i have been a member of your lordships house this is the third occasion on which i have had to comment on the ferocious murders which have been carried out by the ira each of them just as grisly as before <e> <s> have your lordships taken into consideration that on saturday of last week a young irish policeman in the republic of ireland a young member of the irish army in the republic of ireland a young soldier in northern ireland a member of the udr regiment two <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether he is satisfied that the danish authorities have the machinery and expertise to recover these containers if they are not at the moment creating the damage that all of us fear <e> <s> has any request been made by the danish government to the united kingdom government for assistance in the recovery of the containers <e>", "<cs> my lords the report has stated that the maze prison is a unique establishment not only in the united kingdom but also in europe or for that matter anywhere in the world housing as it does not only republican terrorists but also loyalist terrorists <e> <s> in the past loyalists have escaped from prisons although on this occasion it was a set of the most ruthless murderers from the republican side who were successful in escaping <e> <s> the governor has resigned <e> <s> that impels me to ask immediately this question <e> <s> as this was a very unique undertaking anywhere in these islands was advice ever sought from or given by her majestys chief inspector of prisons or any other of the senior prison authorities in this island as to how that prison in northern ireland should be run <e> <s> it must be admitted that it is such a unique establishment that no one had any experience of precautions that should or should not be taken <e> <s> if no advice was given by senior prison authorities here in great britain to the authorities in northern ireland it would be very unfair i think to blame any individual or any set of individuals there <e> <s> twenty-two men have lost their lives in trying to maintain control of that prison <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept from me that there are scores of nurses at present in westminster hospital who will be completing their training in june and july of this year and that they spoke to me no more than hours ago telling of the fears they have that when they do complete their training they will then be forced to sign the unemployment register <e> <s> if there is no serious risk of that taking place could not some means be found of telling those young girls so that they will not he worrying about going on to the unemployment register after giving three years of unstinted service to the medical profession <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount the minister accept from me that there would be no-one more anxious than i to see the political experiment in which he and i were engaged in resurrected and brought to a successful conclusion <e> <s> but is it not a fact that there are three major political parties in the north of ireland the official unionist party the sinn fein party and the sdlp who are at the present moment boycotting that assembly <e> <s> if the government were to accede to the request of the noble lord lord hylton to create these offices would that not be regarded as something of a bribe <e> <s> with the experience that the noble viscount has had in northern ireland is it not the case that you cannot bribe politicians into that assembly that they will only go there when they are convinced that arrangements made to suit their own parties have become foreseeable <e> <s> at the moment it would seem that the furum deliberating in dublin may we all hope hold some sort of key to enabling those members who are at present boycotting the assembly to once again put in an attendance <e>", "<cs> my lords it is on an occasion such as this that i regret not being a member of another place because as i read the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl give way for a moment <e> <s> i have mentioned an occasion in the house of commons when the house of commons met to legitimise in one day the actions of the british army which were causing concern at the time <e> <s> that legislation went through in one day <e> <s> one of the most draconian acts of parliament ever passed in the house of commons the prevention of terrorism act went through all its stages in one day <e> <s> emergency provisions went through all their stages in one day and there were many more <e>", "<cs> my lords this order is a necessary corollary to the order we have just discussed in so far as it will group together a number of local government areas to make effective the principle of stv in elections in northern ireland <e> <s> without an increase in the number of wards the idea behind stv which is to give representation to minorities would not take effect <e> <s> i also noticed that when this legislation was going through another place many honourable members from northern ireland objected to it on the grounds that it was a departure from conditions whihc prevail in great britain <e> <s> i do not accept those arguments as valid <e> <s> i repeat that northern ireland is a peculiar place i underline that with peculiar people i am proud to be one of them <e> <s> but the paranoia and the neurosis which was shown by certain spokesman in another place is sufficient justification for the minister to promulgate this legislation <e>", "<cs> i want to say at the outset that i lend my full support to my noble friend lord mischon in opposing these clauses and asking for these amendments to be accepted <e> <s> in doing so i do not think it is necessary for me to make clear once again my total and unremitting opposition to the ira and all its consorts <e> <s> let me say at the beginning that i totally object to what has been said within the past hours by an honourable lady member of another place that the ira are freedom fighters <e> <s> the ira are nothing of the sort <e> <s> they are the greatest scourge of terrorists and murderers that we have ever seen on the soil of ireland <e>", "<cs> the more i listen to some of the comments in this house the more i am convinced that this house is as far removed from northern ireland as the sea of tranquillity <e> <s> clause just could not be made effective in northern ireland <e> <s> there is so much intimidation of whole sections of the population both in the republican sector and in the loyalist sector particularly in the city of belfast <e> <s> i ask the noble and learned lord lord denning a specific question about a specific case because we have heard him say that there is a duty to give information if one has such information at ones disposal <e>", "<cs> the minister need not have any fear on this score because most irishmen whether they be in the ira or the inla are as frightened of aeroplanes as i am and it is unlikely that they are going to hijack anything <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the records at the northern ireland office will confirm that over a period of years almost every weekend during the football season i was making representations on behalf of people who had been arrested at ports of entry into great britain <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a word of support to the noble lord lord henderson in his promulgation of this amendment <e> <s> i do so having had experience of another place <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson has mentioned the criticisms that normally we were discussing this type of legislation late at night for an hour or for one and a half hours <e> <s> it is fully understandable to me that there are many people in the other place and i am certain many in this house who find discussion of this type of legislation distasteful <e> <s> they do not like to be here because the measure impinges on what they consider to be dubious law <e> <s> i am certain that this is why many noble lords are not here to take part in the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have advanced arguments against this clause in another place and in this house <e> <s> it is obvious from the remarks made today that none of us has found a damascus road since we last debated the matter none of us has been converted into a change of opinion <e> <s> i wish briefly to say again and again that this clause is superfluous to the bill <e> <s> the clause will not strengthen the bill <e> <s> in the eyes of many people the clause is completely unrealistic <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble and learned lord lord denning knows this but there are people in belfast and in northern ireland generally who do give information to the police about both crimes that they think are about to be committed and those which have been committed <e> <s> we have in northern irleand a confidential telephone which is used frequently as the authorities will confirm <e> <s> it is the position therefore that people do give information to the security forces without the compulsion that appears to be contained in this clause <e> <s> i believe that those who are going to give information to the security forces will not be influenced by this clause <e> <s> those who are not going to give information will not be prepared to change their minds because of the existence of this clause in legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for just a moment <e> <s> because there are exceptional circumstances in the case which has just been referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that there will be very many more occasions when i shall find myself in such total agreement with the sentiments expressed by the noble and learned lord lord denning in his support of the amendment <e> <s> as has been said on a number of occasions by a succession of secretaries of state at the home office this is the most draconian legislation that has been put on the statute book for understandable reasons <e> <s> as has been said it can be used the wrong way it can mean a very serious invasion into all the rights of all the citizens of this country not only irish people but english scots and welsh people too <e> <s> in those circumstances i think that everyone in the whole country both inside and outside <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wish that i had as much faith in human nature as the noble lord lord hylton has just indicated to the house <e> <s> however living in northern ireland as i have done for many years i am afraid that i cannot be optimistic about its future <e> <s> i am quite certain that in we shall probably be speaking in much the same vein as we are speaking today <e>", "<cs> my lords because of all the circumstances attaching to this escape i do not think that anyone can exaggerate the concern that has existed since the outbreak from the prison and even up to the very moment <e> <s> one would have thought that with the publication of the hennessy report and the subsequent debate in another place something would have been said which would serve to have allayed the feelings of concern in northern ireland regarding this escape <e> <s> the contrary has been the case because in both communities in northern ireland discussion is still taking place daily about the circumstances of this escape what the hennessy report contains and what is left out of it and what was said and not said in another place <e> <s> i certainly recognise that it might be better if this debate was not taking place here tonight <e> <s> but knowing the concern and the suspicions that exist in northern ireland i think it is right that any misgivings which are being felt should be spoken of here <e> <s> i have no doubt that this debate in itself will not conclude by allaying the suspicions that we have had for so long in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords no it was exactly the same block <e> <s> it was the in-between bar of the h they are different places the two bars of the h and the in-between bar which allowed them association with the other leg of the h block <e> <s> they were therefore able to take over and to work freely within the confines of that block <e>", "<cs> but there are members of the prison staff who live in the same districts as the families of the loyalist prisoners and there are members of the prison staff who are well known to the republican inmates of the maze <e> <s> there is a paragraph in hennessy which says that the government will give all the support that is necessary to prison staff who may feel that they are in danger <e> <s> all i can say is that since the publication of the hennessy report that help and support has been sadly lacking <e> <s> in fact it has been noted by its nonexistence <e> <s> so if the government want to have an effective prison service in northern ireland they will have to give all the support that is necessary to a sincere and dedicated prison staff otherwise we are going to have a continuation of the so-called military running of the prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with a great deal of attention to the case which has been put forward by the noble lord lord hylton and the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> i take an entirely opposing view to that which has been put forward by those members of your lordships house who have spoken except for my noble friend lord donaldson <e> <s> i have lived my life and more particularly my political life in northern ireland <e> <s> therefore i am aware of the reality of what happens in northern ireland <e> <s> i do not live in the english countryside in london or outside of london <e> <s> i lived in belfast and one of the reasons why i became a political outcast in northern ireland is that i had more sympathy humanity and compassion with the victims of the terrorists than with the terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly <e>", "<cs> i am waiting for the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is rather a foolish argument for the noble earl to advance <e> <s> if you carry that argument to its logical conclusion you could say that a fellow called sirhan sirhan who is in gaol in america for having murdered robert kennedy should be sent back to iran to be imprisoned <e> <s> then there is the fellow whose name i cannot pronounce the turkish fellow who was convicted of attempting to assassinate the pope in italy <e> <s> you could say that he should be sent back to turkey <e> <s> if you <e>", "<cs> my lords he would say that if all these prisoners who are serving prison sentences in britain for the most horrible crimes are sent back to northern ireland it will so enhance the political situation that all the catholics and let us face it most of the prisoners are catholics will say the english are not too bad so we will all start voting for moderation and we will reject the ira <e> <s> that does not happen <e> <s> there were people and i say it with a great deal of regret that they were all catholics who voted for the sinn fein ira candidates in the westminster elections last year and i do not hesitate to predict that more than will vote for the ira candidate in the european elections which are to take place on the th of next month <e> <s> so in no way will the sending of prisoners back to northern ireland decrease this so-called alienation which is taking place between the catholic population and the institutions of government <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not regard it as being of the extreme right because in northern ireland they would regard it as being in many ways of the extreme left <e>", "<cs> that my lords i quite accept but i would absolutely and totally reject every argument which has been put forward <e> <s> you are saying this not only to the harrods bombers you are sending a smoke signal and saying if you are caught and sentenced you will be sent back to northern ireland or to the republic <e> <s> but this is more difficult you are saying to people who have not as yet committed a crime in london or in england scotland or wales that you are giving them some kind of priority <e> <s> you are saying we do not agree with you setting off bombs at harrods or anywhere else in britain but if you do misguided though you may be you may be sentenced and then you will be sent back to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the noble lord and i shall certainly read what he has said <e> <s> more particularly however readers in northern ireland will take what the noble lord has said as giving succour and support to the ira <e> <s> that is the one thing which i <e>", "<cs> my lords he was a naughty boy <e>", "<cs> my lords as we traverse the corridors of this house in particular the corridors that lead to the library we are constantly reminded of the irish problem which is still with us <e> <s> two of the most famous paintings in one of the corridors of this house depict the scene as it was in this house in when nearly lords voted on the irish question <e> <s> today years later we are no further on in trying to find a solution to the conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords with my noble friend lord underhill last monday evening i sat in the gallery in the other place when the debate on the new ireland forum took place <e> <s> i was left with the impression and i am certain that it was the impression left with other <e>", "<cs> my lords in i represented the constituency of belfast west in another place <e> <s> in that capacity i was a member of the committee which discussed the implementation of the act <e> <s> the committee stage lasted right through may and june and during that period i voiced many reservations about certain sections of the act <e> <s> i deliberately say certain sections because no one realises more than i do that in the awful situation in northern ireland we must have legislation of some description to try to apprehend those engaged in the awful campaign of murder and maiming which has lasted for such a long time <e> <s> it would be very foolish for anyone to say that an act of this type is not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite true <e> <s> i think it is up to the minister to reply to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise for only a few seconds to congratulate my noble friend lord underhill on his detailed and constructive criticism of this order <e> <s> i do not myself have the research facilities which i formerly had in another capacity <e> <s> therefore i was not aware in any great detail of what was contained in this order but having listened to my noble friend i believe that he has asked a number of valid questions <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising that there will be fierce competition for this order will the minister agree that the tender by shorts is as british as any other tender that has been considered and that in fact the aeroplane that has been tendered by shorts is in operation <e> <s> will he also agree that of these planes are in operation in various countries throughout the world and that per cent <e> <s> of the airframe will be built on british terrritory namely in northern ireland with the exception of the canadian engine which i believe all the other tenders will use as well <e> <s> given the state of the economy in northern ireland were such an order given to shorts will he not agree that it would immediately create jobs in shorts and jobs throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> given the experience which shorts has and that it has only per cent <e> <s> of aircraft orders from the ministry of defence will the minister not agree that on this occasion shorts has a legitimate claim provided that it can fulfil the specifications for this order <e>", "<cs> my lords the british irish association has for many years attempted to bring together british people and irish people reasonable people at an annual function to see whether it would be possible to find some way forward with the intractable problem of northern ireland <e> <s> at some of their gatherings there have been some very unreasonable people and i think an attempt was made to show the unreasonable people who were there how reasonable other people could be in the hope that an atmosphere would be created in northern ireland which would allow for further progress <e> <s> indeed i seem to recall that people from both the unionist community and the nationalist community who had associations with paramilitary organisations were brought to the british irish association to see if any move forward could be made <e> <s> unfortunately the attempt was not successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i would suggest that the northern ireland members of that committee would certainly have had some objections to the minority report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt just for a second <e> <s> whatever my own private opinion may be those figures were given to me by the reverend denis faul <e> <s> they were not my figures and they were printed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that the main organisation which contributes funds to the ira is the irish-american organisation known as noraid and that that organisation has stated quite clearly as we saw on our television screens earlier this year and which has been accepted by the fbi in america that anyone who contributes to noraid does so in the full and certain knowledge that their money will be used to buy arms for the commission of murder in northern ireland <e> <s> is the noble baroness further aware that noraid and its supporters no longer hide behind the pretence that their money is being used for welfare purposes in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise immediately for not having been present to hear the earlier part of the debate <e> <s> i was unfortunately detained <e> <s> let me say at the outset that on one day last week i was given rather surreptitiously a whip from this house whether it be from the government side the opposition side or the cross benches i do not know and it said that this debate was to take place and would probably last for one hour <e> <s> i saw that document one day last week and since then i have been reading the record of the debate which took place in another place and i have also been reading the proposed bill <e> <s> i think that the remoteness of this place from northern ireland is shown by the fact that a debate on such a fundamental issue as a change in the franchise laws would probably have gone through this house within the very short period of one hour <e> <s> that is totally wrong <e> <s> even though i support this bill i understand the reasons why it has been promulgated i think that such a change in the election laws in any part of the united kingdom is worthy of more than one hours debate <e> <s> i realise that i am now standing on my feet and given my long involvement in northern ireland politics i would certainly do away with the one-hour stricture <e> <s> however i have no intention of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords two of them sit with my noble friend lord dunleath in the northern ireland assembly their surnames begin with m <e> <s> personation was not restricted to one section of the community <e> <s> i apologise if i was not present to hear the ministers remarks but again i must put on record that there were two types of impersonation as they call it in northern ireland <e> <s> one was benign one was a catholic within the catholic community or a protestant within the loyalist community <e> <s> in my early days in politics people voted in a very tribal fashion <e> <s> on numerous occasions when i was fighting elections a person would come up to me and tell me my mother is ill my father is unavailable because he is working my brother is outside the constituency if they were here they would be voting for you <e> <s> that is what in northern ireland they call benign personation <e> <s> they never gave me the card or if they did <e> <s> i would not tell your lordships house <e> <s> they would give the card to someone they chose perhaps a relation who was unable to vote at the particular polling station but who with their full support would vote for me <e> <s> that vote would probably be cast <e> <s> in those circumstances it was recognised as being benign <e> <s> in effect their relative could be dead and the story would have been if my mother was living if my father was living if my brother or sister was living they would have voted for you anyway <e> <s> there is a good deal of folklore attached to this <e> <s> that was understandable to each community given the polarisation and the emotional fervour that there is at election time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been involved in elections since for nearly years <e> <s> the penalties for personation in northern ireland were severe under the old legislation but magistrates the cases were usually heard before magistrates normally inflicted penalties of and which were laughable penalties <e> <s> even under the present legislation where the penalty can be or noraid the agencies which support the ira will pay the fine <e> <s> can the noble lord say from the dispatch box this evening that anyone found personating will be dealt with serverely in conformity with the maximum penalties in other words that it may be quite likely that he will go to prison if he is found personating <e> <s> i believe that that would have a deterrent effect on those proposing to personate <e>", "<cs> my lords he will take only three copies <e>", "<cs> my lords since becoming a member of this house i have become increasingly aware i have said this in another place as well just how remote this place can be from everyday events in northern ireland <e> <s> for quite a number of years i represented a belfast constituency <e> <s> i stayed in london on tuesday wednesday and thursday of every week i was in belfast on friday saturday sunday and monday <e> <s> i met my constituents when i was a member of parliament <e> <s> they sat in my home which was my advice centre <e> <s> they told me their problems and it was much more instructive than anyone speaking at the end of a telephone or writing a letter <e> <s> so i can say to the noble lord lord dunleath that he has a distinct advantage over me <e> <s> this applies also to other noble lords including the noble lord who will be speaking from the dispatch box <e> <s> one has to live in an area to get the feeling of the needs of the people in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at the outset to set the ministers mind at rest that i have no intention of <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether in the deliberations and the inquiries which took place and which are conveyed in this report account was taken of an article written in a sunday newspaper in ireland the <e>", "<cs> my lords any legislation pertaining to local government in northern ireland has for many years been of a highly controversial nature <e> <s> one will recall that in after the onset of the civil rights movement an inquiry was held by lord justice cameron and his report subsequently became known as the cameron report <e> <s> after inquiring into every aspect of discontent and frustration in northern ireland he came to the conclusion that it was because of a lot of maladministration or injustice in northern ireland at local government level that this was the light which set fire to the tinder in northern ireland <e> <s> so local government has always been controversial and on reading reports of the debate that took place in another place one can be of the opinion that local government is still and will be for a long time a matter of major political interest and controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that sometimes the safety aspect of this matter is carried just a little far <e> <s> for example this week in my own little flat i needed to have a small asbestos pad placed at the back of the gas fire <e> <s> i went to the showroom to try to buy it and was told that i could not fit it myself but that it had to be fitted by a qualified gas engineer <e> <s> he arrived a few days later <e> <s> i got the bill this morning which was for for the little asbestos pad and for five minutes work by the qualified engineer <e> <s> i think this is an aspect which should be looked into as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to lend my full-hearted support to the proposal of the noble lord lord henderson to set up a disability council <e> <s> i do so because of a particular experience which i had in my <e>", "<cs> my lords it had not been my intention to speak in this debate tonight <e> <s> it is less than two years since my home was burnt in the city of belfast in <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ruthless and relentless campaign of savagery that we have seen carried out by the ira over this past fortnight is it not time to say that a new atmosphere must be created <e> <s> over these past days the ira have murdered civilians and members of the security forces both catholic and protestant and they have carried on a campaign of murdering on the doorsteps of their places of worship of their chapels members of the judiciary the ruc and the prison service <e> <s> these murders have been carried out on the doorsteps of their own churches and chapels as they have gone to or come from mass <e> <s> would this not indicate that there is a new element of savagery entering into the activities of the ira <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise for less than a minute to reinforce a point made by my noble friend lord prys-davies in relation to the situation of young nurses in the royal victoria hospital and we have not as yet ascertained the figures for other hospitals in northern ireland after the completion of their three or four years training <e> <s> i have always regarded nursing as a very noble profession <e> <s> i may be inclined to be biased because two of my own daughters are nurses but i think it is very sad to reflect that these young nurses have given more than three years of their lives in the very difficult circumstances of northern ireland and particularly at the royal victoria hospital which is the hospital which takes in most of the wounded and those who have been caught up in terrorist offences <e> <s> it also applies to the mater hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords since the abolition of stormont in when this government took over responsibility under direct rule for the running of affairs in northern ireland on many occasions i sat in another place and with my colleagues looked at the various orders and bills which came before the house <e> <s> we referred to them seriously and facetiously <e> <s> when we looked at the bills and listened to the minister at the dispatch box promulgating the order or the bill there was a constant repetition of two themes on the one hand the bill would bring northern ireland into line with other regions of the united kingdom and on the other hand we were looking for the longest and most convenient barge pole with which to push northern ireland away from the united kingdom <e> <s> this order is doing exactly that <e> <s> i am not objecting to the order because i know and understand the situation in northern ireland and i think that the government are honestly trying to deal with the situation which has emerged in its most serious form over the last two or three elections it was always there but recently it has become very serious <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that i am the only one in the house who can welcome the statement this afternoon without any reservations because i know very well what it will mean to the people of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> as i look across the house i can see the noble earl lord gowrie and the noble viscount lord whitelaw and from their involvement in northern ireland they will realise as i do just how important this announcement is <e> <s> it will give great confidence to the people in northern ireland to know that they have achieved this contract on their merits <e> <s> it would not be right to say that the decision of the government was not influenced by political considerations in northern ireland <e> <s> just as political considerations were uppermost in the mind of the government in sending the ill-fated de lorean enterprise to northern ireland that was political i have no doubt that the decision announced in the statement today was to some extent influenced by political considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords my taking part in this debate this evening is certainly not due to any academic interest but because i believe that this is one of the most serious cases to be brought before this house <e> <s> your lordships house has for a number of weeks been aware that a debate on the supergrass system was to take place this evening and i am disappointed to say the least that there are about one dozen of us here to discuss debate and pass opinions on what could be regarded as one of the most fundamental decisions by an elected or non-elected chamber <e> <s> i have listened to my noble friends lord gifford and lord longford as well as my noble friend i would hope lord hylton the noble viscount lord brookeborough and the noble lord lord blease <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that he would not be released in any circumstances or that he would not be <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but there are circumstances in northern ireland where the only evidence available is the uncorroborated evidence <e> <s> for example let me go back to what i said a few moments ago <e> <s> a gunman went into a builders office <e> <s> the builder was in charge of a building site in northern ireland <e> <s> the man pulled a gun on him and told him that he would kill him if he did not give him so much money every week or every month <e> <s> in a normal society that builder when the man was apprehended would be able to go into court and stand there and say yes i identify that man as the person who pointed a gun at me and who demanded money of me <e> <s> but he cannot do that in northern ireland because he is afraid of being intimidated and killed <e> <s> and i do not believe that the masks that they all wore last week will have any real effect because the gunman is quite well aware of the person he pointed the gun at <e> <s> whether or not he is sitting in the court wearing a mask the gunman will be able to tell his accomplices outside who it was he pointed the gun at <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a minute <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that i asked three specific questions during the course of my remarks <e> <s> they were to the following effect <e> <s> is it a fact that at the present time no case can be brought before the court without corroboration <e> <s> is it a fact that now if a person had positive swabs the case cannot be brought before the court <e> <s> is it a fact that before one can be charged with handling explosives there must be sufficient material to cause an explosion even a very small one <e> <s> more importantly is it a fact that a plo terrorist in the united kingdom was found to have a positive reaction regarding swabs which were taken from his hand but that there was no other corroborative evidence and therefore he could not be brought before the court and was deported from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have felt very much more at ease tonight if it had been a tory peer who had sponsored this bill because i have been used to voting in the other place in an adversarial way <e> <s> i rise to my feet not in any way to oppose the bill but to tell my noble friend that i do not believe that it is possible to ban cigarette advertising <e> <s> let me give a little experience <e> <s> i started smoking when i was eight or nine years of age <e> <s> as many of your lordships will know the main street in belfast is royal avenue <e> <s> i was a very active member of the royal avenue butt collectors association when i was nine years of age <e> <s> the rabca was one of the few non-sectarian organisations that existed <e> <s> the only thing that we <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the house will be grateful for the contributions which have been made by my noble friends lord blease and lord dunleath <e> <s> they have the distinct advantage of living in northern ireland and as i have found over these past two years since i took up residence in this country there is no substitute for living in the area that you represent so that you are able to keep in touch <e> <s> i try to keep in touch with events as they unfold in northern ireland but i admit to losing touch to a considerable extent by not having a home there <e> <s> the fact that i do not have a home in northern ireland is no fault of mine <e> <s> my home was destroyed by those who were politically opposed to me and i had to take up residence in this country <e> <s> but i think it is right that we should pay a good deal of attention to remarks which are made by those representatives in your lordships house who still live in northern ireland because i repeat that there is no substitute for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls intervention indicates how unsatisfactory it is to have direct rule to govern northern ireland <e> <s> if minutes to hear from someone who has spent his whole political life in northern ireland is too much for this house then i bitterly resent that and the intervention of the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not matter whether or not my name was down to speak <e> <s> if my name had been down the noble earl might still have sat there silently having the same objection <e> <s> northern ireland has problems which will not go away <e> <s> if this house sits on a friday it is entitled to hear the problems of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether prior to the arrests any approach had been made to the government or the security forces of the irish republic and whether there had been cooperation from those forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fortunate that this is to be a short debate because i do not think anything that we can say in this house tonight can be beneficial to the very dangerous situation now existing in northern ireland <e> <s> i have seen many ths of july throughout my lifetime <e> <s> while it was always a time of high emotion a time of triumphalism and a time of defiance i believe that this year it is much more dangerous than that which i have seen over those past years <e> <s> the reason for that is the events of last year since that act was last renewed <e> <s> we had the forum report <e> <s> we have had the anglo-irish talks <e> <s> most of all we have had the sinn fein electoral successes where sinn fein republican ira supporters were elected to local authorities in northern ireland <e> <s> to consolidate all these terrible issues in the eyes of unionism we have seen something happening to which i would have been bitterly opposed <e> <s> that appears to be the coalescing of the sdlp the constitutional nationalist party with elements of sinn fein through rather contentious council elections for chairmanships <e> <s> i know from a contact which i still have there that there is a great deal of emotion now existing in the majority community <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that correction <e> <s> the noble lord who has just spoken said that words mean what they mean in ireland and here <e> <s> the word loyalist is open to a good many interpretations <e> <s> the loyalists in castlewellan and in cookstown made very vicious attacks on the police <e> <s> i saw the police trying to defend themselves as indeed i saw them yesterday with a catholic mob <e> <s> all i can say is that ireland is cursed with anniversaries <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord prys-davies was kind enough to say in his remarks that during all the years of my lifetime i have always lived under emergency legislation <e> <s> the northern ireland state was created by the government of ireland act and on its creation it brought with it the special powers act <e> <s> that act was renewed annually from until and at the end of the unionist government in northern ireland said and of course i am paraphrasing it seems to be a bit of a farce going through this ritual every year and renewing this legislation which is so necessary to bolster and support the unionist government so we might as well make it a permanent fixture on our statute book and at some time in the future it may become necessary to repeal it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that <e> <s> i wish to god we could celebrate it only once every three hundred years <e> <s> we do it every year <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the non-controversial orders that has come before your lordships house in relation to northern ireland <e> <s> the noble lord lord lyell will be acutely aware that churches and those who attend them and those who go to them on marches and for commemoration services can be very controversial in northern ireland <e> <s> i know that when this order becomes known in northern ireland there will be many religious sections who will want to have their churches listed as historic buildings of some kind <e> <s> it may be that some of them will be genuine and some of them less genuine but i know that there will be quite a number of churches which will want to come in under the scope of this legislation <e>", "<cs> because some of those old orangemen who must be taking part in this sit-down protest are as old and decrepit as i am and i should not like to think that they were sitting down for very long at portadown on damp ground this afternoon <e> <s> it would be no good for them as regards their future marches <e>", "<cs> my lords there does not seem to be anything contentious in this order <e> <s> it appears to me to be in the nature of a consolidation order <e> <s> i notice as mentioned by the noble lord lord hampton that every time there is a debate on northern ireland it is almost a ritual that those speaking whether in this house or the other place object to the time limit placed on it <e> <s> i think it is a purely ritualistic objection which happens in your lordships chamber and particularly in the other place <e> <s> it is noticeable that when this order was debated in the other place there were only one or two parliamentary unionist representatives present <e> <s> the rest were at portadown for an orange protest gathering so whatever their priorities were it was not that they had any great concern about this order <e>", "<cs> my lords since the abolition of stormont and the introduction of direct rule in northern ireland in there has not been a single issue on which the political parties in northern ireland could be united or could find any agreement except this one <e> <s> every political party in northern ireland every representational group everyone who is concerned about the energy needs and the energy prospects for the future in northern ireland speaks with a voice of total unanimity when they claim that the government have taken a disastrous decision to close down once and for all the gas industry in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing the order the noble lord the minister said that this was one of the most voluminous orders that we had had before us <e> <s> i hasten to assure him that the size of the order will not dictate the length of my speech <e> <s> i think i spoke long enough on the last order <e> <s> however some things should be said <e> <s> i want to pose the question right away why are the government so resistant to bringing about a gaming board in northern ireland <e> <s> on setting up the gaming board in great britain the government said that they were doing so because they believed that the coming into being of such a board would prevent criminal elements from having any significant say in gaming in great britain <e> <s> if it is good for great britain the northern ireland industry is asking for exactly the same type of treatment <e> <s> one would go far and wide to find a parallel because this industry is saying let us have a gaming board <e> <s> let it be constituted by personnel of integrity people who will ensure that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that the ira is a murderous terrorist organisation that is illegal in both northern ireland and in the republic <e> <s> would he also agree that it has no significant support in the whole island of ireland and that less than months ago the activists of the ira tried to murder an entire british cabinet <e> <s> i repeat that that was less than a year ago <e> <s> they have also carried out the most indiscriminate ruthless and barbaric killings at harrods and in regents park and i am not counting all the murders that they have committed in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords in our search to try to find a solution to try to find some hope in the ongoing tragedy of northern ireland most of us in this chamber today and most of the members in the chamber on the other side of this building would want to express as much optimism as we possibly could regarding this agreement <e> <s> but let us not blind ourselves to the realities as they exist in northern ireland because if we set out with an inordinate degree of optimism and this agreement does not turn out to be what we would want it to be the despair and disenchantment would be all the greater <e>", "<cs> do not believe it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying exactly if you will listen to what i am saying that the unionists realise that britain cannot force them into a republic they themselves will decide whether or not they go in <e> <s> what the unionist population are so incensed about at the moment is the fact that there will be people from the irish government from the republic of ireland who will be sitting in this conference which will be virtually the government of northern ireland <e> <s> that is what this conference will be <e> <s> it will be virtually the government of northern ireland because this agreement makes it quite clear that the irish government will be able to pass opinions on every issue under the sun <e> <s> the agreement makes it quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am trying to tell your lordships house is that people in northern ireland who are affected by this agreement will see the wording on these documents as to how it is going to affect them <e> <s> the conference will meet and there will be people from the republic giving their views <e> <s> there will be british ministers and the minister of state from this house <e> <s> but there will be no unionist there there will be no protestant there <e> <s> and the protestants are the majority of people in northern ireland <e> <s> if only they even had but one observer who would allay their fears and suspicions <e> <s> i am talking now as a catholic as one who knew the jackboot of oppression under unionism <e> <s> i do not want to see the unionist population in northern ireland being treated in the same way as they once treated their political opponents <e> <s> the unionist also says why has this agreement been brought about <e> <s> the government will say because of the violence that we have had in northern ireland <e> <s> that is what they will say <e> <s> the unionist will reply but i was at the receiving end of most of that violence <e> <s> i was at the receiving end of it <e> <s> you come from one tribe and you see one thing one way you come from another tribe and you see it another way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say quite clearly to the noble <e> <s> viscount that anyone in his right mind with his proper senses could not do otherwise but co-operate with the government in this attempt <e> <s> no one in his right mind would attempt to do otherwise <e> <s> but i point out again and i make this my final word do not cast aside that unionist majority in northern ireland <e> <s> do not believe that they are all hysterical bigots <e> <s> they are not <e> <s> many thousands of people in northern ireland in the unionist community want only to live their fives in peace <e> <s> do not force them into taking any other action which we could all regret <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully support this bill and i fervently hope that the government will assist it in its passage through this house <e> <s> any attempt to bring about legislation which will dissipate some of the passions and allay some of the fears and suspicions that are in northern ireland is to be welcomed <e> <s> i have vivid memories which have already been referred to by my noble friend lord hampton of pm on th june in the northern ireland commons when the government introduced the prevention of incitement to hatred northern ireland bill <e> <s> within the space of five or six hours it had passed all its stages <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rarely that your lordships house has an opportunity to discuss northern ireland matters in the prime time of this house <e> <s> when i came in this afternoon i was agreeably surprised to see such a large attendance which even included three or four bishops and momentarily i thought that a great new interest was being shown in northern ireland affairs <e> <s> i had forgotten for the moment about the channel tunnel <e> <s> so now we are back again as we have been for many years both in this house and in another place <e> <s> there are a few members of this house and there are a few in the other place who are interested in northern ireland affairs <e> <s> sometimes we have a new recruit sometimes we lose one or two people <e> <s> that has been the case since the introduction of these provisions in <e>", "<cs> that is a suggestion my lords which has been made by the noble lord <e> <s> as an irishman and more particularly as a northern irishman and as a belfast man i cannot see any accused person in northern ireland whether he be republican or loyalist electing to have his case heard in kent cornwall glasgow or liverpool <e> <s> it may be all right for academics to say that this is a possibility but it is something which will not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that it is of the utmost importance that the fullest information should be given so as to allay some of the fears that now exist particularly in the majority community <e> <s> although he has said that the joint statements are issued is he aware that following the three meetings that have already taken place there have been leaks and counter-leaks both from the irish side and from the british side each one of them more explosive and potentially more dangerous than anything we have seen in relation to the leaks concerning the westland affair <e> <s> is he aware that this morning in a local newspaper in belfast there is an alleged leak from the intergovernmental council saying that internment is to be introduced in northern ireland that it is to be done on a selective basis and on a religious head count <e> <s> would the minister not agree that the whole future of the anglo-irish agreement lies in the fact that people are able to understand it both the unionists and the nationalists in northern ireland and if they are not able to understand it and not able to believe the government then both sides will bring it down <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an indication of british insensitivity to the irish situation that we are discussing these orders on st patricks day <e> <s> one would have thought that there could have been a more appropriate time but perhaps there was an emergency situation <e> <s> however serious the first order may be it will be even more insulting that on the next order we shall be discussing the mental health of northern ireland which i think it would be conceded has been seriously affected by the anglo-irish agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say at the outset that i realise that this is a serious debate <e> <s> i am indebted once again to my noble friend lord donaldson <e> <s> the noble lord has talked about the uniqueness of the situation in northern ireland and about the innovations that have been brought out in northern ireland <e> <s> it has ever been so <e> <s> northern ireland is unique <e> <s> innovation after innovation has been tried in northern ireland <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord who is to reply that this is st patricks day <e>", "<cs> my lords let me at the outset reinforce the remarks of the noble lord lord hampton when he draws attention to the incongrous situation in which only one or at the most two representatives from northern ireland took part in the debate on this order in another place <e> <s> as your lordships will know the order makes provision for the financing of almost every facet of life in northern ireland jobs homes and all the social services that are necessary in a modern state <e> <s> yet those elected to represent their constituents were unavailable <e> <s> i understand why they were not there <e> <s> i realise the very real depth of feeling that exists within the unionist community against what they see as a betrayal by the signing of the anglo-irish agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords since the onset of the present ira campaign would the minister not agree that the question of extradition has been the most crucial question that has arisen between the two governments often amid roaring and raging controversy <e> <s> would he also agree that the only two groups of people both in ireland and in britain who can take any solace from this development are the provisional ira and those unionists in the north of ireland who never believed that the irish authorities would co-operate on the question of extradition <e>", "<cs> my lords i first apologise for not having heard the ministers statement as i was urgently engaged otherwise <e> <s> i associate myself with the remarks that were made in relation to the ruc <e> <s> as one who suffered in much the same way as at present the ruc is suffering having for years been stoned and petrol-bombed in my home i fully understand and sympathise with the awful position in which they find themselves <e> <s> throughout my political life i have condemned members of the minority community for attacking and killing members of the ruc and in even more forceful terms i level my criticism at the majority community that is allegedly the loyalist community in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a sad commentary that years after the abolition of stormont in by order of the house of commons we now have the seventh secretary of state five of them have been conservative and two labour coming to the house this afternoon to admit that yet another initiative has failed <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister accept from me as one who has lived through those years in northern ireland that the failure lay not with any single one of those secretaries of state to try to find a solution to the problem <e> <s> the failure lay with the problem of the northern ireland people <e> <s> the nearest that we ever came to success was the initiative of known as sunningdale which was the most hopeful political development that we had had throughout the years but unfortunately it was brought crashing to the ground <e>", "<cs> in advance of the debate this evening i took the opportunity today to sit in the gallery of the house of commons <e> <s> i listened to the speech of the secretary of state and that of the spokesman for the opposition mr archer <e> <s> they were reasonably <e>", "<cs> my lords the debates which my noble friend lord dean would like to see and to have more time allotted to are debates about the everyday lives of people in relation to housing employment and so on <e> <s> however the debates in relation to northern ireland are about the constitutional position in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no one there but what would have happened if all the unionist members had been there this afternoon and all wanted to make speeches <e> <s> would the speaker still have insisted on saying you can have four hours for the debate and after that all the english members will want to go home because it is a thursday night and we cannot allow you interlopers to come over here and take up all the time of the house <e> <s> let us be honest <e> <s> given the fact that northern ireland had a parliament from to then an assembly a convention and then another assembly it quite understandably divorces and isolates northern ireland matters from the minds of members who represent constituencies on the mainland and members of your lordships house <e> <s> that is why i say that i do not think we can go back again to the position when the act of union came about before stormont the irish free state or the parliament in dublin came into being <e> <s> those days are gone and gone for ever <e> <s> i listened to the secretary of state say today that there may be two other options that there may be an independent northern ireland <e> <s> i do not think that is a runner either because an independent northern ireland calls for majority rule and we have seen what majority rule was like under a unionist government for years in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reinforce the concern that has been expressed by my noble friend lord graham and tell him that there are rumours circulating at the moment that the present level of expenditure may be curtailed in the future and that there is no guarantee that european community funds will be available to help in the continuation of this most laudable programme <e> <s> in the event of european community money not being made available will the noble lord give an undertaking on behalf of the government that they will keep funding this programme because co-operation in any sense of the word can only be welcomed in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord blease i had not intended to take any part in this debate but i shall make what will possibly be the briefest intervention i have ever made in speaking to a an appropriation order <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the case of the maguire family and the guildford bombers is unique as regards all the circumstances which attach to it <e> <s> in view of this latest book by robert kee and the degree of doubt that has been expressed by eminent scientists and members of our own judiciary some representatives of which are to be found in this house and the fact that signatures are now appended to an early day motion which has received all-party support in the house of commons and in view of the fact that members of the maguire family have already served their very long prison sentences and are still proclaiming their total innocence of the charges on which they were convicted will the noble lord make representations to the home secretary telling him very clearly that this case is not going to go away however much he may attempt to keep defending the perimeter <e>", "<cs> my lords many members of the house consider that the major piece of legislation that we shall have to deal with in this session will be the criminal justice bill <e> <s> i consider that to be so <e> <s> i therefore think it appropriate once again to put on record my serious objections to what has happened under our criminal law in relation to the maguire family sentenced in and now free after spending many years in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords the home secretary has said that he cannot interfere unless there is new evidence unless there are further considerations of substance and unless there are material new facts <e> <s> it has been proved in previous cases that sometimes it is impossible to get further new facts <e> <s> there were no new facts in respect of rillington place but it was only following the execution of timothy evans that the conscience of the country following the coverage given to the case on radio and television and in newspaper articles forced the home secretary at that time to set up a commission which eventually found that the hanged person was innocent <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rarely that i intervene in debates in this house and on legislation which does not affect my homeland of northern ireland <e> <s> however i feel so strongly on this issue that i am compelled to stand up in the house today and give my full support to this bill and to the way in which it has been introduced by its sponsor the noble earl <e> <s> lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not to support or reject this order indeed in the many years that i sat in another place i found that i had to object to the order for many reasons because as has already so rightly been pointed out by a previous speaker since the creation of the northern ireland state we have always had to live under emergency legislation <e> <s> for many years it was the special powers act and since following the abolition of stormont we have had the emergency provisions and the prevention of terrorism act <e> <s> so under any circumstances i cannot lend my <e>", "<cs> my lords although i had intended to limit my remarks let me make this quite clear <e> <s> given that the state was set up on the basis of protestant and catholic head counts that is two tribes if one pleases one tribe one does not please the other <e>", "<cs> my lords yes for the first time but that is what impartiality means <e> <s> therefore the ruc are caught if they are being impartial to one side they are beating hell out of the other side <e> <s> that is the way it has ever been because of the circumstances in which the northern ireland state came into being <e>", "<cs> my lords let me preface my remarks by drawing the attention of the house to the intervention which has just been made by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> he has said that in the judgment which he then gave and which has been quoted to the house by my noble friend he arrived at that conclusion because of the evidence which he then had before him <e> <s> i repeat what has been said by one of my noble friends on this side of the house lord harris <e> <s> if hanging had been available in the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the anxiety of the leader of the house that we should not prolong this debate to any great extent <e> <s> but what i was saying there was in direct relationship to the memorandum that has been placed in the library <e> <s> guiseppe conlon knew that he was dying <e> <s> he took the oxygen mask off <e>", "<cs> my lords in all the years that i have been a member of either house i have always been struck by how very far in debating or taking decisions on ireland either the republic of ireland the island of ireland or northern ireland from reality we always seem to be <e> <s> i am not too sure how to explain this but i think it takes one to be irish to live in northern ireland to represent a northern irish constituency or to have been born and reared in the irish republic before one can feel all the emotions attached to the problems of the relationship between britain and ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene to ask the minister a question in relation to the uda document <e> <s> however i assure him at the outset that i have absolutely no contact with it except for having had posted to me as have others its document labelled <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lyell in introducing this order at the very outset of his remarks made one of the truest statements in relation to the order to the effect that public order in northern ireland is very different from that in other parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> indeed it is very rarely if ever that a demonstration in england scotland or wales is related to the constitutional position of this country whereas the vast majority of demonstrations which take place in northern ireland are totally related to the constitutional position of northern ireland whether it be on the unionist side or the nationalist side <e>", "<cs> it was the abolition of stormont <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise for only a few minutes to reinforce the objections which have been put forward by my noble friend lord prys-davies <e> <s> i am very unhappy about the way this order has been introduced into this house the fact that it has been brought here before it has been debated in parliament <e>", "<cs> where elected representatives could have expressed an opinion on this most controversial order <e> <s> i reinforce what has been said by my noble friend to the minister <e> <s> he drew attention to the fact that time after time both in this house and in another place ministers come to the dispatch box and tell us that we cannot have the same type of legislation for northern ireland because northern ireland is totally and completely different as a region of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw the order paper in the early days of this week and noticed the rather sinister nomenclature of the sheep and goats removal to northern ireland amendment regulations it brought back many unhappy memories <e> <s> the thought that on the last day and in the dying hours of this parliament the government should try to press through such a controversial order is distressing <e> <s> why was it so necessary to do that on this day <e> <s> there will be many people in northern ireland who will interpret the nomenclature of these regulations and their effect in an entirely different way from the meaning which is contained in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i too associate myself with the words of welcome which have been expressed across the floor of the house to the noble lord lord lyell <e> <s> since taking up his appointment in the northern ireland office i too have found him to be most helpful and courteous in every way <e>", "<cs> my lords this is by far the most important order that we have to debate every year in parliament because without it all the other orders would not be debatable at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise for only a few minutes to reinforce what has been so ably said by my noble friend lord blease <e> <s> my noble friend lord blease lives in northern ireland <e> <s> he is aware of the concern of all sections of those involved in the industry over this order <e> <s> northern ireland electricity has serious reservations <e> <s> all the trade unions involved representing all the manpower employed in the industry have expressed serious reservations <e> <s> the department of economic development has expressed serious reservations <e> <s> four speakers in this house tonight have expressed reservations about the order <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord convey to the prime minister the gratitude of the vast majority of the irish people for the expressions which she made and the words which she used in the aftermath of this terrible disaster on sunday when she spoke outside downing street particularly when she referred to the desecration of the dead those dead who included many thousands of irishmen north and south of the border who gave their lives in the two world wars <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to express my gratitude to the business managers of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that has to be proved by future events <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord atkins in the house <e> <s> i hope that in future debates affecting northern ireland those noble lords who as i say have expressed great concern for northern ireland will be able to join in and show that concern to the people of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had the benefit of seeing the written statement and it will take some time to study all the details <e> <s> i realise that it is meant to be ameliorative to pour oil on troubled waters in ireland <e> <s> i do not think that it will have that effect because nationalist ireland north and south of the border will be satisfied only if ruc men are brought before the court convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment <e> <s> in ireland it is as black and white as that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the awful events which took place in belfast today in my former constituency i decided not to take part in the debate <e> <s> although there are many facts of life that one could discuss within the context of this order i am sure that there are not many people in belfast tonight certainly not in west belfast who are worrying about the discussions taking place in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have known the fury of the ira mobs in northern ireland over many years <e> <s> they invaded my home and had it not been for certain circumstances i should not be here to address your lordships house <e> <s> i express my deepest sympathy over those who have died particularly the two young soldiers who met such a savage death at the hands of my former constituents <e> <s> as i and my wife watched those terrible scenes on television we were vividly reminded of a mob with exactly the same motivation which attacked my home many years ago in <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord prys-davies and i sat through most of the debate in another place when this order was being renewed during the week <e> <s> i am quite certain that he left the chamber feeling as depressed as i was because there did not seem to be any indication whatsoever that there had been any change in the traditional attitudes of the northern ireland representatives that we have seen over many years <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement may have deflected international criticism <e> <s> i believe that it has to a certain extent <e> <s> however that is not in itself a good reason for the promulgation of such an agreement <e> <s> the agreement took away the alienation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want unduly to detain the house but i must say that i found it heartening to listen to the comments of the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> it is obvious that he has been reading into the affairs of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords as we know the belfast shipyard has become a big talking point in northern ireland in recent days <e> <s> it is more than an industrial undertaking it is a whole symbol of industrial life in northern ireland <e> <s> for that very reason there are many people who want to keep it in existence and many people who would like to see it wiped out of existence <e> <s> there are many people in high areas of unemployment throughout northern ireland who will say why should the government pour so much money into harland and wolff and not give us the same sort of financial assistance <e> <s> i have never taken that view <e> <s> i believe that the belfast shipyard has a history in peace and war that we can be proud of <e> <s> i hope that the government will do everything to keep it in existence as a viable shipyard <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the reservations and fears expressed by my noble friend lord stallard <e> <s> i am all too conscious that in such a debate it could be misinterpreted that in seeking to limit the powers of the police one is in some way or other helping terrorism in northern ireland <e> <s> i hope that my record in northern ireland and the support of my noble friend lord stallard will show that in no circumstances is that my intention or the intention of my noble friend lord stallard <e>", "<cs> my lords in the emotional aftermath of every terrible attrocity that takes place in northern ireland and i need only remind the house of a few of them which took place less than a year ago enniskillen the brutal murder of two corporals in belfast in my former constituency the killing of eight soldiers in the bus explosion and numerous other murders which have been committed there is a great upsurge of feeling in this country <e> <s> the vast majority of people in general as well as members of both houses of parliament call on the government to take some action to prevent such outrages <e> <s> yet when the government proposed to take some action all sorts of voices are raised in protest <e> <s> they say dont do this because it may dilute our law it will give the terrorists a propaganda victory it will make them martyrs <e> <s> in other words if they listened to those voices the government would do nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that if the people in northern ireland and throughout the six counties were to see the government benches in this house this evening they would very quickly begin to think of having a devolved government where the real needs of northern ireland could be discussed with open and sincere objectives <e> <s> i sometimes become terribly depressed when we are debating northern ireland in this house <e> <s> i look over at the government benches this evening and wonder how many noble lords would be there if we were discussing rivers or scottish salmon <e>", "<cs> my lords associate myself immediately with the concluding remarks of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich in his criticism of the way in which the order was introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago this year when i fought my first local government election in belfast the first document that was handed to me when i attended at the city hall for my nomination papers was an adjoining one <e> <s> it was a document that professed loyalty to queen elizabeth her heirs and successors <e> <s> that had absolutely nothing to do with local government <e> <s> it was a device used by the unionist government of northern ireland to exclude political opponents or people who were non-unionists <e> <s> before one got a job with the belfast corporation or with the belfast civil service be it as a bus driver bus conductor gravedigger porter or attendant one had to profess this oath of loyalty to the queen <e> <s> incidentally the queen was not the important concern in this oath <e> <s> it was meant to exclude non-unionists from getting employment within the civil service and local authorities in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will be helpful if my irish voice can contribute a little to the debate <e> <s> because this legislation has had over many years and will continue to have in the future a great effect on irish people <e> <s> there is quite a lot that i had intended to say but in view of the awful event which occurred yesterday in belfast where a very brutal and gruesome murder took place and the atmosphere which exists there today it may be inappropriate to mention some of the things which i had intended to say <e> <s> however i hope that before the bill leaves this house i shall avail myself of that opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite right and i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> but i do know that it was read from a document <e> <s> i know the people who constitute that committee and i would not say that the majority of them were non-political <e>", "<cs> it will be recognised by members of the committee that in northern ireland at present those who are opposed to this legislation have already predicted that it will not work and that it will be counter-productive <e> <s> they have produced scores of reasons why the legislation should not be enacted <e> <s> i take the view that it is doubtful whether this legislation will be as effective as i would like it to be <e> <s> but recognising the campaign of violence and those who have been perpetrating that violence i certainly will support any measures in the hope that they will prove to be effective <e>", "<cs> i understand the difficulty of the minister and wish to accept the assurances which he has given <e> <s> i hope i am wrong but he seemed to be saying that knee-capping was not a particularly heinous offence and that it should not be alluded to in the same category as other terrorist offences <e>", "<cs> without the provisions of clause in this bill it will not be worth the paper it is written on <e> <s> clause is what this bill is about <e> <s> without clause one may forget about the effectiveness of this bill <e>", "<cs> my name is attached to the amendment <e> <s> i came to the committee this afternoon determined to go into the lobby <e> <s> i suspect that two of the most unhappy members of the committee are the two former secretaries of state for northern ireland <e> <s> they know exactly the problem of intimidation <e> <s> their presence in the committee will indicate their concern and they have seen what has happened over the past five or minutes <e>", "<cs> i have been a bitter opponent of the ira since it began its latest campaign in <e> <s> all sections of the ira have brought nothing but shame disgrace and terror to ireland and on occasion to this country <e> <s> yesterday afternoon in belfast one of my closest <e>", "<cs> this clause allied as it is to the <e>", "<cs> i should like to know on just how many occasions that happens <e> <s> i am quite certain that in the vast majority of cases the secretary of state when faced with the evidence of the arresting authorities the police would not want to go against their wishes <e> <s> indeed the wording in the amendment is a constable <e> <s> a constable is part of the arresting authority in this case <e>", "<cs> yesterday afternoon in belfast i lost yet another friend <e> <s> a retired police officer was blown to smithereens in his car at oclock <e> <s> i find it very hard to sit here this afternoon having spoken to the family this morning and listen to the concern being expressed about prisoners <e>", "<cs> in the past when we have discussed this legislation the noble lord lord henderson has shown a very reasoned compassionate and sympathetic view to those who would be caught within the ambit of this bill <e> <s> he has done so yet again this afternoon <e> <s> as in the past i totally agree with him that a means could be found to have a closer look in isolation from the other parts of the bill at that part of the bill which causes most concern to civil libertarians and those people really concerned about the liberty of the subject both here and in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord prior in prefacing his remarks said that it was difficult for an englishman to forecast whether any election in northern ireland would be a success or a failure <e> <s> that has been adequately illustrated this evening <e> <s> the noble lord lord prior said that he did not think that the amendment was necessary <e> <s> it would not in any way enhance the provisions of the bill <e> <s> he is a former secretary of state for northern ireland and i listened to him with great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the noble lord lord colnbrook would have been here this evening to add his voice to the objections which he so forcibly expressed on a previous occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords that is too great an onus to put on the back of anyone in northern ireland <e> <s> we cannot merely stand here and say there are very brave people in northern ireland and that we hope they will put themselves at an even greater risk than they have experienced hitherto <e> <s> i think that is very unfair <e> <s> i no longer live in northern ireland <e> <s> i was intimidated out of it <e> <s> i live in england because the ira burnt my home and everything in it <e> <s> that body would have been glad if i had formed part of the contents of my home at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount has just said anyone who has lived in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister and other noble lords will accept the fact that these amendments are not being moved in a frivolous manner <e> <s> terrorism in northern ireland is a deadly serious matter <e> <s> i have associated myself with the amendments with the intention of improving the legislation and of making life more difficult for terrorists <e> <s> during the passage of the bill through another place the impression seemed to be given that it was aimed deliberately at sinn fein to the total exclusion of other paramilitary organisations <e> <s> unfortunately there are several paramilitary organisations and they are all engaged in the same practices of murder maiming threatening and intimidation <e>", "<cs> my lords in any interventions that i have made in relation to the bill it has been my intention to strengthen its provisions <e> <s> however it is with a good deal of regret that i say that the bill is leaving the house grievously flawed because of clause <e> <s> your lordships will recall that during the debate on that clause members on this side of the house and indeed some noble lords from the cross-benches and on the government side attempted to include the name of the attorney-general as one of those persons who could initiate proceedings against anyone who had breached the declaration <e> <s> the government fiercely resisted the <e>", "<cs> my lords normally such regulations would go through on the nod because there does not seem to be anything controversial in relation to political parties in the united kingdom <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister to explain one or two points on which i think i have a little knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just said that they come from the different groupings <e> <s> there is a conservative group a labour group and others including a right-wing group <e> <s> i know that during elections money is paid into a central kitty and dispersed to the various regions <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord prys-davies on the painstaking manner in which he has gone through this appropriation order <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord who will be replying to the debate is adequately supplied with civil servants to advise him on the issues which are liable to be raised <e> <s> my noble friend does not have such assistance either in this house or outside it <e> <s> for someone who does not represent a northern ireland constituency he deserves credit for the effort that he has put into this matter <e> <s> indeed he could not act with any greater diligence if he were to represent a marginal constituency somewhere in northern ireland although i would not wish to inflict that upon him <e>", "<cs> my lords it was rd december <e>", "<cs> my lords over the many years since the onset of the present troubles many people in northern ireland from both sides of the community have said to me that the english do not understand about them <e> <s> the english do not care about us <e> <s> all these atrocities are taking place in northern ireland but the english do not really care <e> <s> i have tried to tell them that that is not true of all the english scottish and welsh people that i know <e> <s> anyone in northern ireland reading the report and the remarks that have been made this evening will be made aware of the genuine concerns and compassion felt by those who have spoken so far in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to congratulate the noble lord lord blease on his presentation of the bill and thank the noble lord lord bonham-carter for his helpful remarks in relation to it <e> <s> although it is only a small bill it will have tremendous effect on the everyday lives of those sections of the community which are sorely in need of all the attention we can give them <e> <s> they are among the most vulnerable groups in our society <e> <s> i refer to the disabled the elderly psychiatric patients and families under stress <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be no great controversy about this order <e> <s> the minister will be aware that when it was debated in another place by elected representatives from northern ireland there was no serious disagreement <e> <s> there was total unaniminity on one aspect namely there was agreement that the legislation to deal with the problem of young offenders was introduced in a piecemeal way <e> <s> i believe that it was stressed by the minister in his reply that the government were intent on introducing further legislation in the next session of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords if we look back over the past years to the major elements of legislation under which northern ireland has been governed it will be seen that quite a number of acts of parliament were promulgated by a labour government <e> <s> in the s the major and acts the prevention of terrorism and emergency provisions and so on were put through both houses with an element of goodwill from the government and the opposition <e> <s> i believe that that is the only way to try to grapple with the very difficult problem of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords the concluding remarks of my noble friend lord graham of edmonton are of great significance because he as a former elected representative will be acutely aware that there is no substitute for being an elected representative and being in almost daily communication with ones constituents <e> <s> one has only to read the reports of the appropriation debate that took place in another place to see that the everyday contact between an elected representative and his constitutents is all important <e> <s> i marvel at and am grateful to my noble friend lord graham of edmonton who does not have a northern ireland constituency <e> <s> it is quite evident that he has gone to a great deal of research to establish and maintain contact with people in that part of the united kingdom <e> <s> i agree almost word for word with the comments he made here this evening <e> <s> many of his remarks have been garnered from areas which he may not know such as the clonard housing association in the heart of the constituency which i formerly represented west belfast <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must rise to support what has been said by the noble lord lord blease <e> <s> i have very vivid recollections of spending hours in committee in debating the original fair employment northern ireland bill <e> <s> it is depressing after years to find that many of the elected representatives still oppose this legislation <e> <s> they do so from a sense of fear <e> <s> they feel that this legislation will in some way operate to the detriment of their religious supporters <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i wish to apologise for not having taken part in the debates on this legislation to the extent that i wished <e> <s> i had a family illness and i was not available to speak on the legislation <e> <s> however i have read the report of the debates with a great deal of interest and concern <e> <s> i was one who took part in the committee stage of the original fair employment legislation when the two clauses which have been referred to this evening were drafted <e> <s> i remember very well particularly in committee that we were all imbued with the belief that some way or other the legislation which we were then proposing would have the effect that we so desired of taking into consideration the awful problem of discrimination that had existed in northern ireland for so long <e> <s> sadly in we find that that legislation will not be as effective as we wish it to be <e> <s> this evening the noble lord lord bonham-carter in moving his amendment brings back vivid memories of the way in which we view legislation concerning northern ireland <e> <s> that legislation is always caught up with problem of security <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think i should give the minister an opportunity to assess and take into account the impact of what he said during the course of his reply <e> <s> he referred to a murder that had taken place in northern ireland yesterday in rather strange circumstances <e> <s> he said and <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout the centuries both houses of parliament the other place and this chamber have tried to legislate for the good government of ireland and recently northern ireland <e> <s> some of their measures have met with success some of them with devasting failure <e> <s> yet as a member of this house at this time and in regard to this legislation i fully accept the governments good intentions <e> <s> i believe that the government are motivated through this legislation to try to erase the awful problem of discrimination which has been self-evident in northern ireland since the creation of the northern ireland state <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will be aware that over many years i and others have expressed great concern about the convictions in the guildford and maguire cases <e> <s> indeed in both houses of parliament i have repeatedly drawn the attention of noble lords in this chamber and the government in another place to what was undoubtedly a very grave miscarriage of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing this measure the minister said that he regarded it as major legislation <e> <s> i can certainly confirm that <e> <s> from my experience in northern ireland i can say that this <e>", "<cs> my lords when discussing an appropriation order of such magnitude i sometimes feel totally inadequate as regards giving it the attention it deserves <e> <s> this house to some extent must be in the same position <e> <s> i received a letter about the order from the minister as i an certain the noble lord lord dunleath did <e> <s> we are discussing an appropriation estimate of million <e> <s> that is a figure of nearly billion <e> <s> the expenditure has to be discussed within one hour or one and a half hours <e> <s> i do not think it is right that such an amount of money should be considered in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords has the leader of the house noticed that many noble lords do not seem to be too anxious about going for dinner <e> <s> they have already taken a quarter of an hour from the time announced by the whip <e> <s> as an important debate on <e>", "<cs> my lords since the passing of the original prevention of terrorism act i have on a number of occasions in both houses opposed many of the draconian provisions that were contained within that piece of legislation <e> <s> i opposed particularly the powers of exclusion that my noble friend lord mishcon referred to <e> <s> however throughout the years that that legislation has existed i have never found myself able to justify exclusion orders <e> <s> i know that there are two sides to this story and that there are differences of opinion <e> <s> however i have desperately tried to find justification for the exclusion of certain people from england scotland and wales to northern ireland in many cases that have been brought to my attention <e> <s> i have referred to northern ireland as being a dumping ground <e> <s> however as the years have gone by i have lived with and seen the effects of terrorism both in northern ireland and latterly in this country <e> <s> i am now of the belief that legislation such as this is necessary <e> <s> in the absence of this legislation the ira and other paramilitary organisations would be able to move about far more freely to carry out activities which would undoubtedly increase the death toll from year to year <e>", "<cs> my lords sitting in your lordships house looking across the floor at the noble viscount lord brookeborough it makes me feel rather ancient because i recall vividly sitting in stormont in the northern ireland parliament and having the same discussion with his grandfather the first viscount brookeborough <e>", "<cs> i had not realised that <e> <s> so it would appear that nothing has changed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always with reluctance that an untrained layman intervenes in a debate about the judiciary or the judges <e> <s> i have noticed that in both houses <e> <s> however i intend to take advantage of the debate in the name of my noble friend lord longford this evening <e> <s> this is the first opportunity that i have had since last monday when i sat in on the sir john may inquiry to address the house on the annie maguire case which i have mentioned before in this house and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for having added my name to the list <e> <s> i have sat in this chamber for longer today than in all the years that i have been here because this is a very serious issue <e> <s> the attendance in the house tonight indicates that this subject is regarded with the seriousness which it deserves <e>", "<cs> my lords i had expected other members of your lordships house to intervene in this debate <e> <s> sitting here this afternoon i cannot help but contrast the atmosphere and the circumstances in which such an appropriation order is debated with the atmosphere in the northern ireland parliament and the assembly of which i was a member for a number of years <e> <s> when an appropriation order was debated there every single member of that parliament or assembly had something to contribute <e> <s> they were aware of all the circumstances that prevailed in their constituencies of the representations that had been made to them and of what they regarded as priorities <e> <s> on many occasions the appropriation debate would spill over from one day to the next because so much interest and enthusiasm was shown by all the elected representatives at the stormont parliament and the assembly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already complemented my noble friend lord prys-davies on the interest which he takes in northern ireland <e> <s> that was reflected in the debate which took place on the planning order which he had obviously studied in such detail that he was able to discern two typing errors <e> <s> i was not able to take part in that debate because i am not aware of all the circumstances which now exist in relation to planning regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords upon the re-enactment of the order each year one is ever hopeful that it will be the last and that after months have elapsed it will be unnecessary to continue with direct rule in northern ireland <e> <s> never was that feeling more strong than last thursday when as my noble friend said some members of your lordships house sat in the public gallery in another place <e> <s> we waited to hear what had been hyped up to be a dramatic announcement by the secretary of state that after years of murder and mayhem in northern ireland at last we were beginning to take the first tentative steps in inching our way towards an agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords it is almost with reluctance that i intervene in this debate <e> <s> it is the first debate on the queens speech in which i have spoken since i entered this house <e> <s> i am reluctant because northern ireland and the problems of ireland do not fit readily into any of the five categories of debate on the queens speech <e> <s> it does not fit into home affairs or into foreign affairs <e>"]
