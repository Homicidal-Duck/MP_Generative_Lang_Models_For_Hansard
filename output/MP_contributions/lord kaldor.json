["<cs> my lords as a loyal supporter of the labour party i cannot say that i welcome the outcome of this election <e> <s> however i can say that i have mixed feelings about it <e> <s> after struggling manfully for years with urgent day-to-day problems and emergencies with accelerating inflation which they inherited from the previous government on account of that governments threshold agreements which had to be honoured with the sudden onset of the oil crisis the world recession the sudden fall in the pound and so on the outgoing government were as time went on progressively less able to formulate a coherent long-term strategy for national survival <e> <s> they certainly did not say how they were going to arrest or reverse the de-industrialisation of this country if they were returned to office <e> <s> it is difficult to say what they would have done if they had been returned with a strong majority <e> <s> in order to formulate and agree upon new policies the party badly needs a period in opposition for recuperation and reflection <e>", "<cs> it may be a distributive industry my lords but that does not seem to make any material difference to the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to appreciate the point the noble earl is making but i shall be glad to correspond with him on the subject <e> <s> whether it is a distributive or productive industry i am saying that it would not have been as efficient as it is and as it is acknowledged to be by technical experts who regard it as the result of long-term overall planning combined with a readiness to sink large sums of money into the industry <e> <s> that readiness has been lacking in the private sector because of the need for the approval of the stock exchange which means that it must make a large profit in a short period to justify itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i began my speech by concentrating on the failures of the last government for not having a strategy for national survival and i do not think i could have made myself plainer than that <e> <s> i said i did not know what they would have done had they been returned to office and whether they would have had any long-term strategy <e> <s> i also said it was their decision to join the common market which had been responsible more than any other factor for the very much speedier decline of british industry and for the de-industrialisation of the s <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to ask a question <e> <s> will he agree that the great difference between the periods in which we did well and the periods in which we did badly related to our net exports <e> <s> that is to say the periods when we did well in the inter-war years and after the war were when our imports were kept down either by high protection or by import controls which the conservative government re-introduced in and which continued until the end of that decade <e> <s> will he also agree that equally the performance of germany and france in relation to us is largely explicable in terms of the differences in the trends of their exports in relation to our output and to world trade and in their declining import penetration when our import penetration had risen beyond all bounds <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of sounding repetitious i too should like to offer my congratulations to the members of the front bench opposite and to wish them success <e> <s> they have been returned in a general election with a decisive majority and they have a clear mandate <e> <s> i should like particularly to congratulate the noble viscount lord trenchard on his appointment <e> <s> i hold his views in high respect even though i mainly disagree with them as will be evident from my remarks today but i am convinced of their sincerity <e> <s> many things may divide us but i do not think we are in different camps as to our ultimate purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall be forgiven if i begin my speech by echoing very much the words of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in two respects <e> <s> first i wish to congratulate the noble lord lord miles upon his extremely charming and at the same time subtle sophisticated maiden speech <e> <s> it was admirable for its brevity and for its wit and i hope that we shall hear more of the noble lord in the future <e> <s> i should also like to associate myself fully with the noble lord in congratulating the noble lord lord cockfield upon his appointment as a front bench treasury minister <e> <s> lord cockfield is aware of course that we have known each other for a long time in varying contexts and at different periods <e> <s> there was a time when he was head of the statistics and intelligence section of the board of inland revenue and i was a member of the royal commission on taxation <e> <s> he wrote an absolutely admirable paper on the taxation of capital gains which was reproduced in full as an annex of the minority report of that commission which set out fully the correct principles of taxing capital gains and which indeed formed the basis of the legislation <e>", "<cs> of course <e> <s> but i am merely contending that it is not true to say that this government reduced taxation <e> <s> any reduction in taxation in this years budget let alone in a full year is apparent and not real <e> <s> the rooker-wise amendment only provides for a per cent <e> <s> increase in prices <e> <s> if one takes account that the increases in prices will be per cent <e> <s> even after deducting per cent <e> <s> vat and after indirect taxes it would still be per cent <e> <s> and the increase in prices more than wiped out the apparent reduction in taxation in money terms <e> <s> the whole of the million to which he referred and he interrupted my noble friend lord bruce in saying this is totally and utterly phoney <e> <s> that is how my figures and those of the chancellor can be reconciled <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me to ask him two questions before he sits down i do not really disagree with the main drift of his argument but would he not agree that a company which borrows money and keeps up its gearing through an inflation gains as much through the depreciation in the value of money as it loses in other ways <e> <s> that is the first question <e> <s> the reason why british industry has suffered and american industry too on account of historical cost accounting is not so much historical cost accounting as the fact that in the anglo-saxon tradition businesses do not borrow are not loaned up and are not geared up as are industries on the continent <e> <s> in germany during great inflation industry benefited enormously because the inflation wiped out all its debts <e> <s> i quite agree with the noble lord that all our ablest people from the universities go into the accountancy profession but is this because it is so necessary to have the best brains for tax fiddling <e> <s> is it not rather which is my suspicion in order to be able to produce figures for the stock exchange and for the financial press showing better and better results year after year six months after six months and quarter after quarter <e> <s> i believe that the tyranny of the accountant is indeed one of the worst features of the way our economy is run <e> <s> i think that the tyranny of the accountants has more to do with the importance of the stock exchange than with tax affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords or anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene this is the second time these figures have been quoted billion and billion a year in income tax <e> <s> surely it makes no sense to quote such figures without taking into account the change in money incomes from which these taxes are taken <e> <s> the national income in money terms is now something like billion and in those days it was billion so if you relate the tax receipts to the incomes on which the taxes were levied you get an entirely different picture <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of his remarks i wonder whether the noble earl will allow me to say something <e> <s> what i said was that two-thirds of average earnings represents a certain position on the income scale <e> <s> i do not know what percentage of the working population is below two-thirds of average earnings <e> <s> under this budget however a man on two-thirds of average earnings pays more tax to the tune of per cent <e> <s> of his pre-tax income than he did last year <e> <s> that takes everything into account <e> <s> it takes into account the fact that personal allowances were raised by per cent <e> <s> not by per cent <e> <s> as they were by mr healey in the april budget <e> <s> it takes into <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as he referred to the cambridge economists at the end of his speech may i be permitted to ask him a question <e> <s> this country had high protection <e>", "<cs> my lords the question i want to ask is this <e> <s> during that time our export share was very much greater than it was before or has been since and our industrial growth was greater <e> <s> i ask the noble lord whether he could have this period studied a little before he expresses dogmatic views on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that despite the fact that enormous profits are already being earned from the north sea by private companies this terrible drastic taxation that the noble lord referred to just now has so far yielded hardly any revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a wide-ranging debate and i would not have suspected that a debate on energy could have given rise to so many different aspects political technological and many others and i do not envy the ministers task in trying to reply to all the various points that have been made <e> <s> i shall confine my remarks to one issue only and even then i cannot guarantee not to repeat something that has already been said <e> <s> i shall deal with the economic consequences of opec in the near- and medium-term <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i was talking about that <e> <s> i was saying that a stronger pound will lower import costs but if the stronger pound is brought about by steadily rising interest rates then those rising interest rates will <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to speak in this debate simply <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i should just like to ask him whether he would not agree that a ratio is a relationship between two magnitudes and if the ratio of public sector expenditure to the gnp goes up it is to be judged quite differently whether the ratio changes on account of the rise in public sector expenditure or as a result of a fall in the gnp <e> <s> i am very much afraid that so far as the projections made by the noble lord lord soames are concerned the increase in the ratio results from a fall on the denominator and not a rise in the numerator <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> are the government so certain that raising the minimum lending rate will cause the money supply to shrink when the money supply is defined as m including interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister whether it is a correct interpretation of the remarks that he has just made that this government regard further restrictive measures as the appropriate response to a deterioration of the economic situation due to external causes or to a fall of exports or a rise in imports or arising from a deterioration of the world situation thus making a larger proportion of our manpower resources and our industrial capacity idle <e> <s> that is certainly the impression that he has given <e> <s> all governments since the war have been actuated by the desire that the public sector should act as a stabiliser of the economy not as a destabiliser <e> <s> acting as a stabiliser means to restrict in time of overdue expansion and to expand in times of overdue restriction <e> <s> but the present government seem to be actuated by the motive that the public sector borrowing requirement must be reduced at all costs even if the cause of a rise of the borrowing requirement is a fall in income and in consequence a fall in tax revenue or a rise in expenditure due to higher unemployment <e> <s> if this is the governments policy the more clearly it can be stated and the sooner it can be brought home to the people of this country the more important it will be from a general point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasant duty to begin by congratulating the maiden speakers of whom we have more today than on any previous occasion i can remember <e> <s> i should like particularly to congratulate my noble friend lord stewart of fulham on an admirably concise speech <e> <s> in my view he put his finger on some of the most important points which we on this side of the house see fundamentally differently from those on the other side <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord harris of high cross who as an economist stands at the very opposite end of the spectrum from myself <e> <s> i think that in future there will be occasions when he will not be so restrained by tradition to be quit <e> <s> so uncontroversial as he was today but will express his views more forcefully and pointedly and will criticise anti-monetarists and keynesians in a more radical manner <e> <s> in any case we welcome him as a member of this house and i am sure we shall gain a great deal in the liveliness of debates by his presence <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not responsible for the previous government at least not after when i resigned as an adviser to that government <e> <s> however i do not believe that they said that our public expenditure is larger than that of other countries <e> <s> i should like chapter and verse to be quoted before i could accept this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord now but so far as personal income taxation is concerned i can assure him that we are by no means the most heavily taxed country <e> <s> there are the three scandinavian countries and holland whose personal income tax is higher than ours <e> <s> but that is not the point nor is it according to the point made in the white paper <e>", "<cs> not according to your own comments in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> he thinks that provided we return to the th century provided government is driven back and the welfare state abolished provided everybody is after himself with the maximum rein given to free competition this country will return to a prosperous condition <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that that period the late victorian period and the period preceding the first world war when there were all the incentives in the world there was no progressive taxation no unemployment benefit nothing were more depressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> he did not mention that the last government brought down the rate of inflation from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> very largely as a result of incomes policy and nothing to do with cuts of government expenditure some of which happened as a result of the initiative of the international monetary fund as he knows <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt about the governments honesty in wishing to fight inflation <e> <s> however i am equally convinced about their total inability to do so due to a complete failure to understand both the causes of inflation and the means necessary to control it <e> <s> as the noble lord lord byers said this per cent <e> <s> addition to the rate of interest is equivalent as stocks are turned over twice a year to a per cent <e> <s> increase in the prime costs of industry <e> <s> therefore it is the same as a per cent <e> <s> increase in vat <e> <s> in what way does the minister think that an increase in costs will reduce inflation if there is nothing to prevent it from being passed on in higher wages <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to apologise for intervening in this debate <e> <s> i did not intend to do so but having listened to a number of extremely able speeches i feel that some aspects of the problem have been strangely neglected except for some allusions by the last speaker the noble lord lord noel-baker who has not however developed them <e> <s> i am speaking now of only one type of reactor the fast breeder reactor <e> <s> one aspect which has not been mentioned is that the future must belong to the fast breeder reactor for one simple reason that any other type of reactor requires uranium ores of such richness that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount and readily defer to him <e> <s> i would not claim to have any sort of technical expertise in that field <e> <s> i have heard various scientists speaking on the subject who urged that we should go into fast breeder reactors despite the very serious danger which they recognise that they create that the plutonium manufactured by these reactors could fall into unauthorised hands and that with that aid a nuclear bomb can be manufactured very easily in a back yard so to speak <e> <s> once these reactors are available it will be almost inevitable as the noble lord lord noel-baker has just said that nuclear weapons can be manufactured by all sorts of governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i must admit that perhaps my attention was wandering or i was not here when he made these remarks <e> <s> i did not know that he covered these points <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that it would be in the interests of british agriculture to make it possible to pay our farmers guaranteed prices that are reasonable in the light of their own costs without at the same time having to pay higher prices for europe as a whole <e> <s> in view of the proposed increases in prices under the common agricultural policy should not higher subsidies be paid to our own farmers when it is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene is it not a fact that since the labour government for good or ill made these very large cuts whether they did it at the behest of the imf or of the civil service or because they thought that the economy was overloaded they have been made and will not have to be made again <e> <s> that does not strengthen the case for the present government it weakens it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first beg the indulgence of the house because i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> i am particularly sorry that i shall not hear the reply of the noble earl <e> <s> i was looking forward to it but <e>", "<cs> my lords by uncanny foresight the noble earl has anticipated exactly what i am going to say <e> <s> the true rationale behind this policy it is not as stupid as i make it appear lies in the belief that it is only through a great deal more unemployment that inflation can be brought to a halt <e> <s> though official doctrine makes inflation solely a matter of money supply or else solely a matter of the borrowing requirement i believe this is only a facade <e> <s> the causal chain in which everybody government members included really believes runs from cost increases of all kinds whether they are due to rises of the oil price or rises of wages to price increases and from price increases to further wage increases <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord thinks that the difference between the productivity at ford and that at british leyland is a matter of one lot of workers trying harder than the other i think he ought to make some further study of the subject <e> <s> i would particularly recommend him to study the ryder report which shows that at british leyland behind each worker there is worth of capital and at fords there is worth of capital <e> <s> that makes a wholly different approach to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> what he has just said is in my opinion the true explanation of why inflation has become an endemic disease in capitalist societies <e> <s> there are two contrary principles <e> <s> an efficient firm for instance the price leader in industry ford this year made a profit of million <e> <s> therefore it can well afford to pay million to million out of those profits in wage increases <e> <s> other firms however do not make that kind of productivity increase <e> <s> on the other hand there is a very strong tendency which is much older than the trade unions towards the comparability of workers in different occupations with the same degrees of skill and doing the same type of work <e> <s> the tendency is that they should get the same wage <e> <s> if one says that in firms which are exceptionally successful the wage earners should get correspondingly high wage increases then it automatically follows that the average wage increase over the economy as a whole will exceed the average productivity increase because the productivity increase of the successful firms is very much greater than the average <e> <s> that is the whole trouble <e> <s> in the competitive conditions of the th century the fords of this world could not afford to pay higher wages because they had to pass on their success in productivity to the consumer in the form of lower prices <e> <s> in the modern system of oligopolies and monopolies this is not the case <e> <s> that is why we have inflation which is endemic <e> <s> but it was not endemic in the th century <e>", "<cs> my lords it is inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount stated that the majority of directors of the board were against the continuation of the experiment <e> <s> can he say whether this majority included any of the workers representatives on the board and will it be possible for members of this house to get more information on the reasons of the directors who voted against the continuation of the experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords in any radical reform of the common agricultural policy will the noble lord agree that farmers should receive guaranteed prices by some means other than by making the food consumer pay as is the case in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way but does being an extreme opponent of nuclear weapons or nuclear warfare make one a marxist <e> <s> my noble friend lord noel-baker made a very passionate speech against nuclear warfare <e> <s> does the noble lord expect him to be classed as a marxist <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not intending to intervene in this debate but some of the speeches i have heard i have found highly stimulating and i should like to refer to one or two aspects of this problem which i do not think have received adequate consideration <e> <s> there is a shortage of skilled labour in this country <e> <s> i believe that the shortage is by no means confined to this country i have heard much the same complaint in other countries of europe despite the fact that in these other countries the systems of vocational training through education were traditionally much more highly developed than they were in this country where we relied mainly on apprenticeship for the training of skilled workers <e> <s> moreover the shortage is not confined to skilled workers <e> <s> there is also a shortage of workers willing to do dirty jobs unpleasant jobs <e> <s> i believe most of these shortages may have a common cause which is not always realised and it is not an easy one to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble earl will appreciate the logical incongruity involved in first arguing that our domestic oil price must be raised to the full extent of every rise in the opec price in order to make the consumers in this country substitute other fuels for oil and then arguing that it is necessary to raise the gas price because it has become too cheap in relation to oil <e> <s> the two arguments are completely contradictory <e> <s> either one wants to encourage substitution or one does not <e> <s> if substitution is too much encouraged there is a perfectly good remedy in reducing the oil price and not in raising the gas price <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble viscount talks about low productivity being the cause of all troubles may i ask whether he has really investigated who and what is responsible for the low productivity <e> <s> the implication is always that it is entirely up to the workers whether productivity is high or low <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble viscount is aware that before the first world war the productivity of the german steel industry was more than twice that of the british steel industry and that according to the best experts this was due to the fact that the german industrialists made far better use of economies of scale and carried out a scheme of compulsory standardisation allowing long runs which it was not possible to do in the case of the british industry <e> <s> that had nothing whatever to do with the workers <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him a simple factual question which arises out of his remarks the answer to which he may or may not be able to give me but which will have a considerable bearing on the subsequent discussion <e> <s> the noble earl made considerable play with the fact that in the case of gas domestic consumers are being specially favourably treated as against industrial consumers <e> <s> does the noble earl know what the figures actually are <e> <s> i am looking at the latest issue of december of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i then ask the noble earl what is the price per therm to the industrial consumer as against the price per therm to the domestic consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> most of the public expenditure cuts represented an increase in charges for services which had already been provided for a long time but provided without charges <e> <s> they imposed charges of all kinds the increase of charges for prescriptions for this that and the other which are not charges <e> <s> you cannot say that this is a reduction in government expenditure planned <e> <s> it is not even a reduction in government expenditure it is a concealed increase in regressive taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin unexpectedly perhaps by paying a tribute to the government of the noble lords opposite <e> <s> they certainly have not lacked courage in introducing a whole host of measures which are bound to have a highly adverse effect on their popularity <e> <s> in fairness one has to admit that they did not shirk such measures even when their main impact was likely to fall on their own supporters as with mortgage rates <e> <s> but no previous measure in the field of taxation or prices or wages or interest rates has given rise to such a universal chorus of criticism from all sides as has the statement of the secretary of state for energy on the future of electricity prices in the coming year and in the following three years <e>", "<cs> they have set about the task of reversing the major historical trends of this century and intend to dismantle the welfare state <e> <s> i very much agree with what my noble friend lord strabolgi said on this point they are only at the beginning of this process <e> <s> the chancellor and other ministers have repeatedly asserted that the cuts which have already been made are only a foretaste of things to come <e> <s> they have set about this task with a verve and determination which stand in sharp contrast to the policies followed by all other industrialised western countries <e> <s> indeed one has to go as far as chile to find a contemporary <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i remind him that i asked him a question at the beginning of the debate and he told me that he would supply the answer at the end of the debate <e> <s> my question concerned the relative prices of gas for industrial and domestic consumers respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords until that happens would not the noble lord wish to have the decision examined as to whether the restriction with regard to earned income at the age of for women and for men should apply equally to those who derive their income from investments <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to make a small correction what i said in the first debate on th november was that public expenditure in the united kingdom is lower than <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in agreement with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is a tradition of this house that the mover of a motion has the right to the last word on condition that he limits himself to two minutes <e> <s> i think that that is an extremely wise restriction which saves one from innumerable temptations such as trying to convert the noble lord lord harris of high cross or even the noble lord lord cockfield to the scottish dissenting theory of inflation which is so much better empirically or econometrically based than the monetarist theory <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the widespread resentment which is felt and not only in this country concerning the disposal of these surpluses and the countries which receive them at very favourable prices would it not be possible for her majestys government to promote a scheme in brussels by which the surpluses could be disposed of in ways that benefit the poor or the unemployed or the people on supplementary benefits who are in the member countries of the eec and not those outside <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords case against exempting the living theatre is that it will be impossible to hold the line there without extending the concession to a wider class of cases <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord is aware that there were some other taxes on the statute book within living memory from which at some stage the live theatre was exempted without thereby opening the floodgates to other exemptions <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to selective employment tax <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord satisfied that it is part of the law of the medes and persians that a revival of the economy and an introduction of increased employment inevitably follow a policy of severe deflationary measures leading to high unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the publication in this years red book of the long-awaited economic plan by the government called medium term economic strategy provides an opportunity to review the competence with which the government conduct their affairs in terms of their own chosen objectives <e> <s> this red book is an extraordinary document <e> <s> it contains bold assertions logical <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend lord jacques agree <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount sits down may i ask whether i heard him correctly when he said that this country suffered a catastrophic decline in the last two decades <e> <s> if that is what he really said i fear that he was in error <e> <s> we may have suffered a catastrophic decline in the last decade the s but in the s our productivity growth was considerably better than it was in the s and in no sense can one describe the s as a decade of catastrophic decline <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that interest costs of traders and manufacturers are passed on in higher prices in very much the same way as labour costs are and to that extent they are inflationary <e> <s> in view of that situation does he not agree that our fight against inflation would be far more effective if this country returned to the system of quantitative credit controls which existed prior to the introduction of competition and credit control in particularly in the light of recent changes in that direction by the federal reserve system <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that movements in the money supply depend on the preferences of the public to a large extent between holding government stock and holding bank deposits that a period of falling interest rates is far more likely to induce institutional savers particularly to convert bank deposits into government stock than a period of rising interest rates and that therefore it would have a beneficial effect on the money supply and if the noble lord is to be believed for that reason on inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the london stock exchange we possess a very efficient secondary market in gilt-edged securities and it is perfectly possible for the government to fund the public sector borrowing requirement by issuing reasonably short-term or medium-term securities and leave the secondary market to satisfy the need of the insurance companies for long-dated maturities <e> <s> my second question in this connection is that since the noble lord and his colleagues in the treasury regard the role of inflationary expectations as so important in the process of inflation itself how can he think there is no link between inflationary expectations and the maturing dates of the wholly artificial coupon stocks which are issued <e> <s> they are bound to be counter-productive from the point of view of inflationary expectations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the figures which he has given to the house include our contribution to the specialised agencies of the united nations or only to the united nations itself <e>", "<cs> my lords as a number of speakers have already pointed out the transaction we are discussing this afternoon can be looked at from a number of different aspects <e> <s> in my view there are really two main aspects and i want to speak on each that of ethics and that of economics <e> <s> so far the discussion except for lord baloghs speech has concentrated far more on the ethical aspect and less on the economic but in the long run from the national point of view the economic aspect is far more important <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me i shall develop this theme at some length and he will see that my use of the word social is rather different from what he has in mind <e> <s> the social effects i think that the noble lord lord robbins will bear me out he was a student of the works of professor pigou and earlier of alfred marshall who invented this distinction are those which you obtain if you take into account not only the direct profits but the indirect benefits that accrue to other businesses and to the economy as a whole <e> <s> that is a different meaning of the word social <e> <s> the important consideration is the additional loss which may amount to thousands of millions and not hundreds of millions in terms of lost national output which will follow in the long run from the disappearance of a large part of the steel industry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount will permit me to interrupt him it may be usual in america to value an important executive at million dollars or more a year but what is meant by that is that he is being paid that sum for his own benefit <e> <s> can the noble viscount assure us that mr macgregors own benefit will be limited to something very much less <e> <s> if it is so limited does he regard it as a sensible and reasonable arrangement that mr macgregor should get so little out of it and that the bulk of the money should be paid to a somewhat disreputable new york bank <e> <s> which makes extraordinary lucrative take-over deals according to the description in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the bill before us needs to be examined from two different angles <e> <s> the first and it is one upon which the debate so far has largely concentrated is whether it is likely to make a positive and a beneficial contribution to our industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that assurance <e> <s> the present bill contains some good features and i think the noble earl lord gowrie gave an admirable exposition in their favour <e> <s> he made out a far better case than i thought it was possible to do and showed that there are features of the bill which i personally would support if they could command a consensus and if they were enforceable <e> <s> those two things are largely coterminous and if i do not support them it is for these two reasons <e> <s> but apart from these the bill contains many features which would cause resentment and annoyance and appear to have no justification other than a kind of nastiness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that information <e> <s> but the very fact that he gave it shows that there was some point in what i said <e> <s> however i think more important aspects are the restrictions placed on picketing and secondary actions which are so strongly welcomed by several noble lords on the other side of the house and which we think are likely to prove a boon to lawyers because they open wide avenues to cascades of litigation <e> <s> the wording and complexity of clauses and provide a paradise for lawyers in interlocutory proceedings to obtain injunctions of which we have seen quite a number recently some of which were upheld by the house of lords although some were not <e> <s> such actions will be even more numerous as a result of these restrictions placed on secondary action and on offside picketing if i may use that expression which as my noble friend lord mccarthy remarked although illegal were not enforceable under the act while that act was in force <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me surely that was the case as regards the miners their rules provided for secret ballots <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> if what is intended in clause is what the noble earl just said all it needs to clarify it is to add the words <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether the principles applied in settling the terms of compensation were any different from those applied in earlier cases of nationalisation or did the difference arise only because that happened to be a period of low stock exchange prices <e> <s> if the second point is the case can the noble viscount also tell the house in what way this is different from the case of burmah oil in regard to which shares of bp were taken over by the bank of england at a time when the share price was at the very bottom <e> <s> would not that case be analogous to the case which the noble lord lord monson raised <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to explain to the house the mechanism by which the control of the money supply brings down the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords as greece will become a member of the eec in the middle of an academic year cannot the government split the difference and charge a proportion of the eec fees and the other fees <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to be able to follow the noble lord lord thorneycroft and to say how much i agreed with him in what he said at the beginning about the speech of my noble friend lord lever of manchester <e> <s> it was an admirable speech and one that we do not hear very often <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i do not follow the rest of his speech but i think on reflection <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not consider that to regard the money supply as the cause and not the consequence of inflation is really analogous to treating the symptoms and not the causes of a disease <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question which i directed to him earlier but which he has not answered <e> <s> how does the noble lord explain the growing negative yield gap associated with a growing volume absolutely and proportionately of funding if at the same time he claims that the government must offer higher and higher interest rates in order to attract private individuals to take up new issues <e> <s> in fact the new issues are taken up at per cent <e> <s> below the official lending rate <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord any information on the nature of the commodity schemes on which agreement has been reached on what kind of commodities are in contemplation for inclusion in such agreements and on how they would operate <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord said that higher pay settlements mean more unemployment did he mean to imply that they do not mean higher inflation or is it his view that they do both <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that in their recent appointment of the chairman of bsc the government have given evidence of being prepared to go to quite extraordinary lengths in order to reward the necessary skilled labour <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is only fair that those who are invited to subscribe risk capital for these enterprises should he properly warned that if these enterprises are transferred to private ownership or any share of them without agreement of the position if a labour government were returned steps would be taken to restore the state interest to what it was before these acts of de-nationalisation took place <e> <s> i am not saying that this means de-nationalisation without any compensation but it means that the total private interest will be no larger than it would have been had the de-nationalisation not taken place so the issue is state shares <e>", "<cs> my lords if you sell off those parts of british railways that make a profit and i find it difficult to believe you can sell off those that make a loss then the loss on the remainder is bound to become larger and not smaller <e> <s> it is a great mistake to say that you are trying to save loss-making enterprises like the railways by selling off the profitable bits <e> <s> if the unprofitable bits are sold off who on earth would buy them except for asset-stripping purposes <e> <s> that is for the physical assets <e> <s> i feel that selling capital assets in order to meet revenue losses is the economics of the madhouse <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to speak again as i gave my views on this bill on second reading <e> <s> if i speak now it is not so much about the bill or its merits but because i feel that i have listened to a really notable and exciting debate which was conducted at a very high level on both sides and i should like to add my congratulations for the admirable way in which the noble earl lord gowrie conducted it for the government side and my noble friends lord mccarthy and lord wedderburn displayed expert knowledge of a very high order <e> <s> i think in some ways it brought out the best in this house as a chamber in which issues can be discussed less in the heat of party controversy and more on their merits with this expert knowledge <e> <s> that is the justification if there is one for the house of lords and i fear that the government have not done this house justice by pushing through this bill without allowing a single comma to be changed without allowing any amendment even on those issues where amendments have no other purpose but to clarify the express intentions of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the very important remark made by the noble lord was that if we as he called it went soft on nuclear weapons the chances of an agreement on nuclear disarmament with the russians would be sensibly diminished <e> <s> i think that is possibly the only argument for having strategic nuclear weapons of this kind which we would all agree we could never use without committing collective suicide <e> <s> is the noble lord really satisfied in the present international situation that the importance of our possession of these weapons really does make an important difference to the chances of reaching an agreement between the russians and the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words on this amendment <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord lord bellwin did not state the case properly when he mentioned the equity argument in connection with the option mortgages <e> <s> the option mortgage scheme was introduced simply because the mortgage relief was not only anomalous but was regressive in its incidence <e> <s> the richer you are the greater the benefit you receive <e> <s> if the noble lord consulted his colleague the noble lord lord cockfield who was the author of the tax credit plan which was very much in the spirit of this amendment he would put him right on the true nature of the equity aspects involved <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord regard the question of what the unions objection is as something for which he requires prior notice because of the fact that the reasons are not obvious to him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he and the secretary of state for energy are familiar with the law of comparative advantage in international trade according to which if a country is fortunate enough to be able to produce gas much more cheaply than other countries then it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may make it clear in economics the common term subsidy and i am sure the noble lord lord robbins will confirm this means selling things below their cost of production <e> <s> it is not a subsidy if you sell gas at a price which is very much greater than the cost as has just been shown and involves the gas industry having quite an inordinate profit <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in interpreting the noble lords first answer to the noble lord lord beswick as saying that the government or the bank of england or the treasury were confronted with the choice either of allowing the minimum lending rate to rise further or supplying the additional resources necessary to prevent it from rising further and thereby adding to the money supply <e> <s> in other words that they subordinate their money supply target to their idea of what is a desired interest rate <e>", "<cs> my lords it would have raised the rate of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak again on this matter the noble lord is saying that minimum lending rate must always be the main control of the money supply <e> <s> is he not aware of the fact that for years in this country and still in the majority of european countries the money supply has been controlled not by the short-term rate of interest but by quantitative controls on bank lending <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for giving way <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to begin by congratulating our two maiden speakers i regret that neither of them is here at the moment <e> <s> one of them the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln is by long tradition the visitor of my college his speech today in its intellectual quality and sentiment was such that i feel proud of that long tradition and i am sure that goes for all other members of my college <e> <s> in lord weinstock we have one of our few really successful industrialists <e> <s> i regret that the traditions of this house do not allow a noble lord to make a maiden speech on a controversial matter and this restricted him to speaking on such wholly uncontroversial subjects as inflation cost accounting and corporation tax and prevented him from giving any constructive suggestions on how we could improve the performance of the british industry <e> <s> i hope he will do better next time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wished to make one simple point <e> <s> i mentioned per cent <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> pay limit was put forward by the government two weeks ago for the public service <e> <s> i wanted to say that if you start from per cent <e> <s> make it general not just for the public sector and i would go along with it provided it is coupled with a guarantee of an even bigger fall in prices <e> <s> but learning from the same experience to which the noble lord referred the winter of discontent we all agree now that per cent <e> <s> was a mistake and if they had made it per cent <e> <s> the story and the events might have been very different <e> <s> that is why i mentioned it again <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord forgive me for a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter spoke about the weakness of the weimar rgime which led to the nazis <e> <s> i want to say that dr brning was very far from weak <e> <s> he was every <e>", "<cs> my lords can i remind the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a government dominated by his party coming into power at the end of completely reversed the policy of the previous government reduced interest rates to per cent <e> <s> converted war loan from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and started the biggest housing boom in british history <e> <s> that was a complete reversal of previous financial policies and did not lead to the kind of disasters the noble lord mentioned just now <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord lord taylor aright his question was that if real wages fall by per cent <e> <s> because prices go up by per cent <e> <s> and wages by only per cent <e> <s> would that not have unfavourable repercussions on consumption hence demand and hence employment especially local employment <e> <s> that was his question <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that for the first nine months of this financial year the public sector borrowing requirement is billion higher than in the last financial year and that that part of it which is financed by domestic credit expansion or by printing money as it is sometimes called is per cent <e> <s> higher than the year before would not the noble lord agree that this government are pursuing an increasingly inflationary policy which far exceeds on their own criteria any degree of inflation brought about by the previous government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord attribute the welcome reduction of inflation which he mentioned to a reduction in the growth of money supply in the last year of the labour government which is only just two years ago or if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i draw his attention to a point following his remark that other european countries such as france germany and sweden have extended capital investment programmes in spite of the recession <e> <s> would it not be more accurate to say that they have done it because of the recession rather than in spite of it because in all those countries the governments are conscious of the real side as distinct from the financial side and wish to be sure of being able to make use of unutilised resources when they are available <e> <s> further is the noble lord <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl not agree in contrast to what was asserted by the noble lord lord orr-ewing that britain has by no means the largest public sector in western european countries <e> <s> i can think of two countries austria and italy whose public sectors are a considerably larger proportion of the total and that may be true also of france <e> <s> secondly would he not agree that the advantages or otherwise of having publicly-owned basic industries cannot be decided on such absolutely facile or almost facetious aspects as whether or not their investment is part of the public sector borrowing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl confirm that it is still the governments intention to increase the prices of gas and electricity by per cent <e> <s> in excess of the going rate of inflation for the next three years <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that despite appearances this country has one of the cheapest health services in the world and that the national expenditure on health as a proportion of the national income is lower here than in most other developed industrial countries <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that it would be a mistake to impose more rigorous conditions in permitting japanese firms to establish subsidiaries here than we require from for example american firms <e> <s> particularly in some of the engineering industries such as the motor industry the japanese are now much ahead of the americans and indeed the american industry is very severely threatened by japanese competition in america itself <e> <s> it is clearly very much in this countrys interest that we should have efficient japanese-owned enterprises here <e> <s> there will be a fall-out effect from that which can only have a good effect on british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to associate myself fully with what other noble lords have said about the late lord amory <e> <s> i participated in numerous debates which he initiated or in which he took a prominent part and i learned to appreciate not only his intellectual qualities but his exceptional honesty and seriousness of purpose and his search after truth and after the common ground <e> <s> after many of the debates i had a feeling that our points of view moved closer together and were nearer to each other at the end of the debate than they were at the beginning <e> <s> i think this is the first economic debate in which i have participated in this house at which lord amory is not present and i think that we on this side of the house too will miss him for a long time to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be far more ready to follow the thoughts of the noble earl were it not for the fact that all these shortcomings i have been talking about were more prominent in the late victorian era and the edwardian era when the fiscal disincentives that he mentioned were completely inoperative than in the years since the second world war or even in the period between the two wars <e> <s> the real period of britains poor performance relatively to other countries was from to <e> <s> it has never been worse than that either before or since <e> <s> that was not a period in which fiscal disincentives could possibly have played a role <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that it clearly follows from his remarks that the lower the level of economic activity and the less the profits that are earned both in the public and the private sectors the more the enterprises which will be run at a loss and that if more enterprises are run at a loss the necessary consequence will be that the state will have to take over more enterprises <e> <s> instead of re-privatisation there will be the very opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords that is right <e>", "<cs> conservative governments also my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him what were the last industries that were nationalised by a labour government for reasons of nationalisation <e> <s> so far as i know the only cases of nationalisation were those done by the conservative government under mr heath which nationalised rolls-royce aero-engines and i believe also upper clyde shipbuilders <e> <s> there was also british leyland <e> <s> they were all cases of nationalisation because the companies were bankrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord explain how we managed for over a century to peg our exchange rate on the gold standard and after the war under the bretton woods agreement <e> <s> if his general statement were right it would be impossible at least for oil-producing countries to run fixed exchanges <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that taken individually every university knows perfectly well on nd november the number of overseas students who were registered the previous day <e> <s> the university could also inform the department of education as to the percentage change in numbers compared with the previous year <e> <s> from what i gather the experience varies very greatly between different universities in some cases it is small and in some cases it is large <e> <s> if the noble baroness does not yet have the figures something is wrong with the department of education <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to ask the noble viscount for clarification of the meaning of his words on a single but very important point <e> <s> it concerns the meaning of the terms first strike and second strike <e> <s> in the first part of his speech he referred to the fact that the soviets have a considerable superiority in conventional weapons so that our own defence could be ensured only by countering a soviet attack using conventional weapons with nuclear weapons <e> <s> that is my understanding of what he said concerning the importance of a second centre of decision-making <e> <s> in the second part of his speech he said very emphatically that neither this country nor <e>", "<cs> that it is getting better <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that the british national government in is a better example than roosevelt in america <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble viscount lord rochdale that this has been a most remarkable debate <e> <s> it is remarkable chiefly in the extent to which there is a recognition now on all sides of the house of the magnitude of the disaster that has befallen this country <e> <s> even so it is important to underline the position a little more by putting it in a historical context <e>", "<cs> well <e>", "<cs> the previous prime minister would never have said that he was against reflation <e> <s> i do not think for a moment that he would have said that but i agree that the previous chancellor of the exchequer who was my chief at one stage fell a victim to seductive influences coming from thread-needle street and was persuaded to decap the pound <e> <s> there is no doubt about that and that is the source of a lot of present evil <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> the concession to value stocks at market value when it is below cost does not really ultimately involve any arbitrary judgment <e> <s> it allows a trader to anticipate losses without compelling him to anticipate gains <e> <s> that is to say if the market value fell below the cost he could substitute market value <e> <s> but when he finally disposes of the stock then all this is brought back into the accounts and the element of judgment disappears <e> <s> however once you enter this inflation cost accounting business you are in entirely different territory <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble baroness lady trumpington will forgive me if i do not take up her rather contentious points <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord swann for his eloquent and witty maiden speech it had all the qualities we have come to expect from him <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lady david for having brought this motion in terms that make it legitimate to discuss this problem from all kinds of different aspects <e> <s> the main question i wish to discuss is whether there is any case for cuts in public expenditure on education or indeed on anything else at this time of deep economic recession <e> <s> having discussed that i will then discuss the further question of what priorities should be from a national point of view <e>", "<cs> anthropomorphics <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the traditional method for regulating exchange rates throughout the th century and indeed this century has been through variations in interest rates <e> <s> if the government really wish to bring down the exchange rate the normal method is to bring down very substantially the interest rate which makes the country a less good place to lend in and a better place to borrow from <e> <s> is the noble earl also aware that there is nothing whatever in the governments argument that a higher public sector borrowing requirement requires higher interest rates because that is offset by higher private sector lending requirements which bring down interest rates <e> <s> all the historical evidence tends to suggest that the times when the nations borrowing requirements were highest as for example during the second world war were the times when interest rates were particularly low and when medium and long-term borrowing took place at very low rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to begin by congratulating our maiden speaker lord thomas of swynnerton whom i have known for a number of years as an academic colleague and as a friend not a noble friend but a friend and who i am sure will add a great deal to the intellectual resources of this house as far as history and historical analogies are concerned <e> <s> i do not expect that i shall agree with him very often not so long as he sits on the other side of the house but that will not in any way diminish my respect for him <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer is the same as the noble lords <e> <s> neither will but that does not mean that one side can make itself defenceless in conventional warfare when the other side is not defenceless <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> if you want security nato must be able to match the russians both in the nuclear field and in the conventional field and not use the one kind of weapon to offset inferiority in the other <e>", "<cs> i am not lord balogh <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may be permitted to clarify the meaning of some of my remarks which he evidently misunderstood <e> <s> maybe they were somewhat convoluted <e> <s> i did not mean to say that nato was a failure as such <e> <s> i said it followed from the views of the secretary of state for defence and his speech that we must infer that nato had been a failure because he tried to represent nato as so inferior both in conventional weapons and in nuclear weapons <e> <s> obviously that is not the case because if it were the case then what was said that nato defended the freedom of all these countries from the russians would not have happened <e> <s> so i was criticising the <e>", "<cs> am i allowed to put a question <e>", "<cs> the question i want to put is are you prepared to think of nuclear weapons to be used to counteract an aggression or a war or fighting with conventional weapons <e> <s> in other words are you prepared to use nuclear weapons as a first strike and not as a deterrent against a nuclear attack on yourself <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask for one point of clarification <e> <s> would he extend the strictures which he made concerning unilateral nuclear disarmament also to the renunciation of the first use of nuclear weapons not the possession of nuclear weapons but the first use <e> <s> because i think that is a very important distinction and it is important to know where people stand on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the most important conclusion that emerges from his answer is that we must as soon as possible get rid of our inferiority in conventional weapons <e> <s> and are the government taking all steps with their allies to ensure that the russian superiority in conventional weapons which threatens us with annihilation because of the consequences of nuclear war is a most urgent task to which all members of the nato alliance should give their consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the figures given recently by mr brezhnev in an interview given to a german periodical are completely at variance with those given by her majestys government or relevant ministers and in view of that fact would the government be prepared to make some comments on mr brezhnevs figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord mind giving way for a moment <e> <s> the percentages which he has quoted are rather worse than the average <e> <s> it very much

business abilities <e> <s> also to the noble noble lord lord marsh who will add to the distinguished ranks of those who graduated to business from politics <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that if the government tried to increase the gross national product instead of doing everything to reduce it this would be the best way of reducing taxation as a percentage of the gnp <e>", "<cs> my lords why have the noble lords government reduced the gross national product by per cent <e> <s> since they came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree if i suggested to him that so far from our productivity in manufacturing industry being at record levels it is still per cent <e> <s> lower than it was in the second quarter of <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible that the noble viscount confuses output per man in manufacturing industry with output per man-hour <e> <s> it is true to say that in output per man-hour productivity according to the latest figures is per cent <e> <s> higher than in but that is only because man-hours worked per week are more than per cent <e> <s> lower <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> i am sure

economist i cannot agree with many of the things <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to take part in this debate and my only reason for doing so is because i feel that to many noble lords on both sides it almost appears that joining the ems is one of those very rare acts for which there is everything to be said with nothing to be said against it <e> <s> i feel i ought to introduce a slight note of discord into this almost universal harmony and say that we ought to consider what possible disadvantages this may bring which may also be very important and not just the advantages <e>", "<cs>

purchasing power of the rouble is in general taken to be somewhat less than the united states dollar how do the figures that he has given us reconcile with the repeated statements from british nato and united states sources that the warsaw pact possesses a great superiority both in conventional and in nuclear armament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask the noble viscount whether regarding estimates of the annual production of armaments both of the conventional and of the nuclear kind by warsaw pact countries he could not construct with the help of some of the government economists an armaments dollar that would enable us to make a quantitative comparison of the total military expenditure of the warsaw pact and nato countries <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that

<e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a danger that any claim made against the argentines for their aggression might hasten the collapse of the international banking system <e>", "<cs> my lords going back to the noble earls original answer may i ask is he aware that a widespread and intellectually highly respectable case can be made out for the view that the obligation to pay fair wages far from having adverse effects on the economy has very favourable effects on efficiency <e> <s> therefore it is quite possible that the abolition of the obligation to pay fair wages will encourage the survival of inefficient enterprises and will therefore act to lower our national wellbeing and not to raise it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that at the beginning of their term the government announced it as their policy to increase gas prices by per cent <e> <s> more each year than the prevailing rate of inflation and that this was done in the face of the strongest opposition by the board of the british gas corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord this <e> <s> some of us are not quite clear about it from his remarks <e> <s> is this one of the matters on which the government would normally wish to consult <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some universities offer terms for early retirement that are so generous that it is very difficult to see how the university saves any money by taking that course as compared with the alternative of those people continuing to function until the time of their retirement <e> <s> if so what advantage is there to the nation to induce people to retire years before their mental powers have deteriorated if it does not even save any money from the point of view of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one point if the noble earl has already explained this it has escaped my understanding <e> <s> what is the meaning of tendering in this connection <e> <s> the normal commercial meaning is that you tender for the whole lot and the thing goes to the highest bidder in other words you tender for all the shares at the highest price per share <e> <s> normally we would expect there to be various consortia of financial interests who would tender against each other <e> <s> is that the procedure which is to be adopted <e> <s> because in that case the ownership of the shares is bound to remain within a very narrow circle of financiers or others who participate in the consortia <e> <s> perhaps i have misunderstood what the noble earl has meant by tendering <e>", "<cs> my lords you must tender for the whole lot in one go <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord tell us how the striking price is arrived at <e> <s> if the minister responsible has examined all the applications from every point of view including the nationality of the applicant and all other things i cannot see any simple procedure by which <e>", "<cs> my lords my question is how the striking price is arrived at <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finish <e> <s> would it not save a lot of time if the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down permit me <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say that conservative governments in this country were always against protectionism as i think he said <e> <s> would he not agree that between and certainly conservative policy was almost invariably in favour of protectionism and it was as a result of conservative policies that protectionism was generally introduced into this country in with phenomenal results <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to begin by congratulating most warmly the noble lord lord gormley on his wonderful maiden speech <e> <s> i am sorry that he is not here at the moment <e> <s> it was one of the <e>", "<cs> sir kenneth goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords not the part which i quoted that was left out <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord kilmarnock i wish to begin by congratulating our maiden speaker the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour who made an extremely able and erudite contribution <e> <s> she comes from a country where in my view education is much more sensible and well directed than in the rest of the british isles and therefore she is able to speak with special authority about the numerous ways in which we can improve <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question of which i have given private notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure all noble lords will be grateful to the noble lord for giving us his answer to the private notice question which i asked earlier <e> <s> nevertheless i should be grateful if the noble lord would supplement that answer in at least two respects <e> <s> the first is whether he would agree that as the current exchange rate is still very much higher in terms of relative cost per unit of output between british and foreign manufacturers than it was in the s or in any earlier period any downward movement of the exchange rate should have a helpful effect on industrial recovery even though it may delay the pace of reduction in the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord for a simple interpretation of his remarks whether he interprets the term market forces so narrowly as to rule out any intervention in the foreign exchange market by the bank of england or the exchange equalisation account <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl for clarification of his original remarks on one point <e> <s> if i understood him rightly he said that while the new figures are compiled on a different basis and generally give somewhat lower figures absolutely than the old figures their movements will be very much the same <e> <s> in other words the new figures will reflect an increased or decreased incidence in unemployment in much the same way as the old figures <e> <s> is this consistent with the statement that the basis of the new figures is the receipt of unemployment benefit <e> <s> is it not true that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord able to give the house any indication when the audibility of bbc shortwave broadcasts will be strengthened to make them comparable to those of the soviet union germany or a number of other countries which always seem to crowd out the voice of the bbc making it difficult to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in the s when these highly desirable events took place the bank rate was per cent <e> <s> and that the government converted the largest long term war loan from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> they brought down the whole structure of long term interest rates <e> <s> would the noble earl agree that the reduction of interest rates may be the most efficacious method of increasing desirable capital investment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow and his committee are to be congratulated on producing a lively and highly informative report on what the common market means in terms of free trade and unhindered competition in manufactured goods inside the community <e> <s> we are also grateful to him for arranging this debate today and for giving us a brief account of what has happened in the four or five months since his report was published <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would allow me is he referring to trade in the eec or trade overall with the world <e>", "<cs> trade with the eec is given at table ii on page xxiii <e> <s> the trouble is that that table begins in and we entered the community in <e> <s> if you went back a few more years you would find that before we entered the community we did not have an adverse balance of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt for a moment if the noble lord looks at my speech he will see that most of my examples of points were taken from lord greenhills report <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lords case is that the government wish to privatise industry because private industry is so much more efficient may i ask this how does he justify the imposition of discriminatory taxation against public industry if private industry is in any case in a more favourable and efficient position than public industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must answer the question <e> <s> it was non-discriminatory <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that a reduction of the public sector borrowing requirement is only of economic benefit if it represents a reduction of the taxation out of income current expenditure or capital expenditure <e> <s> it is of no benefit whatever if it simply represents capital transfers and then the money is used in substitution for taxes which do have an effect on effective demand <e>", "<cs> my lords at the same time as the minister is making inquiries as regards the noble viscounts first supplementary question will he inquire as to whether a fine imposed on a person on supplementary benefit will affect the disregards which are habitually given in calculating the benefits <e>", "<cs> am i to understand from what the minister has just said that the quotas given under the agreement are quotas to the community as a whole or are they for each of the members of the community separately that is to say does each member country guarantee a separate quota <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with what the noble lord lord tordoff has just said <e> <s> i consider that the secretary of states <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> if i may finish the sentence i shall then proceed to my question <e> <s> it is generally known that the effect of such takeover bids by financial investment companies is wholly adverse to most industrial relations and to the dynamic and expert management and development of industry <e> <s> this is a case in question <e> <s> is there any reason why a south african multinational conglomerate whose main interests are in gold and diamonds should acquire an industrial engineering company in scotland <e> <s> i do not see that the case has been made out <e> <s> there is every possible argument to the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords do the existing arrangements requiring a joint decision for the use of american missiles on british bases refer to every single missile being launched or would agreement in a particular emergency relate to whatever happens as a result of that emergency <e> <s> in other words can this be so operated that consent of her majestys government would be required before any one missile is launched or would the understanding relate to a particular emergency as such <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain <e> <s> he says that arrangements have worked perfectly satisfactorily for the past years <e> <s> have they ever been tested <e> <s> has there ever been an occasion when these arrangements could have been shown to have worked satisfactorily in a positive sense as distinct from the sense that no difficulty has arisen because there was no occasion for any difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> if he believes that the case for a proposed change is as strong as he tried to make out with various references to the serpell report and others why is he opposed to the new advisory board for ordnance survey being consulted and being asked for an opinion <e> <s> surely the advisory board if it examines the case is bound to come to very much the same conclusion as the noble lord and with the support of the advisory board much of the opposition might be assuaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak about the military strategy of nato and not about disarmament multilateral or unilateral <e> <s> the most important things that i wanted to say have already been said far more eloquently and with greater authority by the noble and gallant lord lord carver and also by the noble lord lord gladwyn <e> <s> nevertheless i have some additional aspects to add <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord carrington is not here <e> <s> i should have liked to ask him the question does he think that if the nuclear bomb had never been invented we should now all be satellites of russia in the same position as poland or czechoslovakia <e> <s> of course not <e> <s> he would say that in that case we should have defended ourselves and would have prevented the russians from occupying us <e>", "<cs> my lords failing an international agreement on the lowering of interest rates which i personally do not regard as really hopeful in present circumstances will her majestys government explore the possibility of securing credit for british industry for the purpose of the reconstruction and renewal of industrial equipment at concessionary rates of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us are grateful to the noble lord lord soames for having brought forward this motion <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i make no attempt to follow his arguments in detail <e> <s> owing to the shortness of time i should like to confine my remarks to only one aspect of his motion namely the international currency situation <e> <s> since the breakdown of the bretton woods system two things have happened <e> <s> industrial growth among the western countries has greatly slowed down or even turned into a decline and there has been a greatly accelerated inflation worldwide in scope and accompanied by a very rapid growth in non-resident bank deposits a great deal of which were held by non-resident subsidiaries of the major banks in the world in the so-called euro-currency markets <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house how much of the per cent <e> <s> inflation which he mentioned between and was the automatic consequence of the threshold agreements which were embodied in legislation by the previous government and how much was due to the per cent <e> <s> rise in the price of oil between those two dates <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that it was due to market forces that within or hours of the building societies raising their mortgage rates the big commercial banks proceeded to do the same <e> <s> why did they not do so before <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord attribute to market forces the desire of the commercial banks to take away business from building societies <e> <s> that is a new phenomenon <e> <s> does he agree that the building societies move was forced on them by the policies of the commercial banks and that the commercial banks in turn responded so as to neutralise the effect on them of the building societies action <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i regret not being able to continue in this cosy vein of bashing the unions and talking about the awfulness of the british working man <e> <s> i am not even going to say that i disagree with everything that has just been said <e> <s> what amazes me is how it is that some people suddenly come to see the light <e> <s> they were blind for most of their lives they were blind when they were members of the labour party blind when they were members of a labour cabinet and then suddenly a revelation comes to them <e>", "<cs> my lords learning from experience is essentially a method over time <e> <s> it is not something that one can do overnight <e> <s> if the noble lord can produce some evidence of how he slowly and gradually came to his present views and how he expresses them i think that we should all be interested <e> <s> i wish temporarily to change things round so that instead of criticising the british labour party or the unions i will criticise her majestys government and mrs thatchers policies <e> <s> however before i do so i should like to say just because my speech will be so critical of mrs thatcher that in one respect i consider that she had a happy thought in elevating one of my ex-countrymen the noble lord lord bauer to your lordships house thereby laying once and for all the slur that all ex-hungarians are left-wing intellectuals although she may not have succeeded quite in her parallel desire to show that not all hungarians are controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak <e> <s> i had thought that the debate would be concerned with the administration and organisation of research which is outside my sphere of competence <e> <s> however as the debate has broadened out into a much wider field it is one of the best debates i have had the privilege of hearing in this house i should like to take up a few minutes of your lordships time to fill out some of the statements already made concerning the ominous prospect of the decline of our manufacturing industry <e> <s> this was emphasised in the speech of my noble friends lord gregson and lord mcintosh and received even stronger emphasis in the admirable speech of the noble lord lord zuckerman not to speak of others <e>", "<cs> my lords i began my remarks by saying that i did not wish to speak to this motion precisely because i do not feel competent to speak to the subject set out in it <e> <s> but in fact the debate was broadened by many noble lords including the noble earl who preceded me far beyond the terms of the motion to the general economic consequences relating to the lack of development of new products and the lack of expansion of science-based industries <e> <s> it is the latter factor to which the international monetary fund has attributed our comparatively very poor performance since the war <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter whether he assumes that in a place where the provision of a service such as a call box is far more expensive than in some other place say in a village rather than in a town that service should be provided only if a correspondingly higher charge is made for calls from expensive call boxes than is made for calls from less expensive call boxes <e> <s> otherwise it is not a question of whether people can or cannot afford to pay <e> <s> it is simply a question of whether the new telecommunications service under private ownership should provide services which are necessarily loss-making because the cost to them is so much greater than the average cost of providing such services over the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> i am merely suggesting that the addition of the word needs is consequential upon the earlier amendment which the committee adopted <e>", "<cs> may i say that this has two aspects namely the directory inquiry service concerning the united kingdom and the service concerning foreign countries <e> <s> at present the telephone system provides both services <e> <s> providing the service of finding the numbers of people in overseas countries whether in europe or elsewhere is from a national point of view a very important matter <e> <s> i hope we may have an assurance that the words directory services cover both aspects national and international <e>", "<cs> are we to understand from the noble lord lord lyell that directory services have not been included among the services particularised in clause <e>", "<cs> since reference has been made to subsection <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would not object if some such clause were inserted in the bill that would limit the rate of profit that the privatised telecommunication company is allowed to earn similar to the legislation concerning the public utilities in the united states <e> <s> the noble lord has a point that if wages rise in the telecommunications services out of line with all other wages one cannot expect that a private company will provide the service even though it makes a loss <e> <s> however at the same time being a monopoly surely there must be some restraint that it would not exploit the public and that that restraint can perfectly well take the form where a licensee or whoever it is is obliged to reduce prices whenever the rate of return on the capital invested exceeds <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord explain what he means by competition <e> <s> what is the meaning of competition in telephone services <e> <s> will there be a large number of telephone companies offering alternaative systems to the subscriber <e> <s> what does it mean competition <e>", "<cs> how can you assure that one subscriber who uses a telephone from company a can have access through his telephone to some other subscriber in another system <e> <s> if you have a parallel system of telephones it will lead to the most terrible chaos <e> <s> the telephone is a natural monopoly because all the lines have to go through some centre in order to be able to connect any person on any terminus with any other terminus <e>", "<cs> that is why i asked the noble lord though i did not get any satisfaction what the government themselves mean by the word competition <e> <s> i know perfectly well what competition means and i know that with a natural monopoly there cannot be competition <e> <s> if you maintain that there can be we have every right to have explained to us what it is and how it works <e>", "<cs> if all these horrors to which the noble <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the question i want to ask is pertinent to the amendment <e> <s> is there any chance of our going over to the system which exists in other countries by which the code number of a single locality is the same wherever that particular locality is telephoned from <e> <s> in england apart from larger towns the code number varies according to whether you are ringing from london or cambridge or oxford or various other places <e> <s> it would be a great simplification if each town or locality had one code number for the whole country <e>", "<cs> i do not want to hold up the proceedings but this is not my experience except for the code numbers for major towns which are printed in the little book which gives the trunk dialling numbers <e> <s> if what the noble lord says is correct why it it that a different small book is produced as regards telephone numbers from each locality <e> <s> i have one in cambridge and it is quite different from the one issued in london <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that students from some of the french ex-colonies receive far more favourable treatment in respect of fees than students from british ex-colonies and that this is a consequence of the fact that we extend concessions to members of the common market which we do not extend to members of the commonwealth <e> <s> does the noble baroness regard this as an equitable arrangement in view of the fact that some commonwealth countries particularly india have habitually received a high level of education of their political and social leaders from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm the point which i made in my first question namely that students from some of the french ex-colonies receive more favourable treatment as regards fees in british universities than students from british ex-colonies <e> <s> if that is so will the noble baroness say whether she would regard the situation as anomalous <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the noble baroness is hardly answerable for the action or rather inaction of the french government <e> <s> nevertheless i should be very interested in her views as to whether a similar situation could arise in this country <e> <s> i should have thought that if british lorry drivers blocked the queens highway the police would come and forcefully remove the drivers then move the lorries and that they would not tolerate a situation where the roads are blocked for days by a limited number of lorry drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first read the motion put forward by the noble earl lord lauderdale i thought that it was thoroughly misguided <e> <s> however when i listened to the noble earl today he did not seem to speak very much to his motion and what he said if i understood him correctly and i am sorry that he is not in his place at the moment concerned the replacement of obsolete plant in the electricity and various other industries such as steel and shipbuilding with new plant <e> <s> he did not talk about the transfer of resources from the heavy industries to unspecified other industries where continuing employment opportunities are to be found <e> <s> i was in danger of my prepared remarks being taken as fighting windmills meaning criticising views which nobody put forward <e> <s> but luckily the noble lord lord cockfield came to my rescue and said all the things which i am going to criticise and thereby he has justified the speech i am about to make <e>", "<cs> the minister referred earlier to the law of supply and demand and said that just because a property has been acquired by a disabled person it is thereby withdrawn so to speak from the available houses for disabled people whereas it is perfectly possible for the house to be sold to another disabled person <e> <s> that is possible but it is also possible that the house will be bought by a non-disabled person <e> <s> that is unless the noble lord assumes that disabled people by their very nature have more purchasing power than non-disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must repeat what most other speakers have said <e> <s> we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury and his colleagues <e> <s> they deserve our thanks as well as our congratulations for the work which they have put into this report including the painstaking examination of numerous witnesses <e> <s> the report discusses in some detail the rapid and uncontrolled growth of expenditure resulting from the common agricultural policy and the inequities which follow from that particularly for this country <e> <s> as a result as the report says our net contribution to the community comes to about a year per head of the population although our real income is below the community average <e> <s> denmark the richest member of the community receives a net benefit of a head <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the noble lord is talking about <e> <s> i wish to say merely that prior to our entry into the common market our manufacturing production increased quite substantially <e> <s> in fact the years before were years of the highest rate of growth of manufacturing production in the whole of british history and since that time our output has stagnated <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the correction <e> <s> i do not think that we can pursue this point at the moment but i should be glad to hear precisely what kind of legislation the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i just ask him one question <e> <s> i am sure he is quite right in what he says about america speaking about americans in a generic term but unfortunately the president of the united states has made statements perhaps quite some time ago to the effect that america can conduct and win a nuclear war <e> <s> on another occasion he said that it can and will win a nuclear war in europe in other words without affecting the united states <e> <s> given the fact that the president of the united states is a responsible official <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord agree that dangerous developments do not arise simply as a result of the efforts of those who want nuclear disarmament but by irresponsible statements of people like the american president <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a special pleasure for me to be able to participate in a debate initiated by my noble and distinguished friend lord wilson of rievaulx whose governments have done so much to uphold the policy objective of full employment <e> <s> for years after the war this was an objective to which both of the great political parties were equally committed <e> <s> it was in pursuance of a solemn commitment of the coalition government headed by winston churchill in that high and stable employment should henceforth be reckoned as one of the governments chief objectives and responsibilities <e> <s> this commitment was abandoned in the s under the influence of monetarist doctrines whose real purpose was to change the power relationship between capital and labour and to use mass unemployment to drive down wages <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords there is some difference between a figure of million unemployed which existed when mrs thatcher came to office and a figure of million which she has managed to achieve after two years <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord really mean that unnecessarily high <e> <s> what in his opinion would be the right amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i think that i pointed out in my speech that if we are net exporters of oil it is inevitable that we should be net importers of manufactured goods <e> <s> our customers could not pay us in anything else in real terms except by having a surplus in their net exports of manufactures <e> <s> but now it makes all the difference from a british point of view whether this net export is attained in the way it was attained by destroying some of our industries <e> <s> a few weeks ago the chancellor referred to the fact that it caused the exchange rate to rise to the point where so many of our exports became unprofitable and so much of our home consumption went on imports instead of on british goods that this balance of imports over exports was attained <e> <s> but it could have also been attained without any detriment to our industry <e>", "<cs> that is the point i wanted to make <e> <s> it could have been attained by our using additional imports for investment <e> <s> then we need not have <e>", "<cs> of course the surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government give any consideration to using the family earnings or salary to construct a special cost of living index applicable to pensioners <e> <s> the answer may turn out to be to the governments advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords have her majestys government given any consideration to the possibly unlikely eventuality that in a stress of excitement which might occur these weapons are fired off without waiting for explicit agreement of the british prime minister <e> <s> what is to happen then <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the noble lords reply <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say how many airlines of other countries which were in public ownership have been subsequently privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords

zealanders and australians still have to pay times as much as people coming from greece <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the reason why british leyland came into public ownership in the first place was because it went bust under private ownership and the government had to step in to bail it out <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl give an assurance that the coalition white paper on employment policy issued in is still regarded by the present government as applying to them or is it to be considered as something which is no longer government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider adopting the system of post codes prevailing in all other countries <e> <s> this is a decimal system consisting of numbers only where successive numbers serve to indicate area a district of an area a region within a district etc <e> <s> so that anybody on reading the number can more or less fix the location of the place <e> <s> is not our system which consists partly of letters and partly of numbers very difficult to remember and absolutely meaningless to anybody <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say something in the unusual role of a constitutional lawyer <e> <s> i fear that in this debate the main issue between the two sides one wanting elections and the other passionately wishing to avoid elections does not come to the surface <e> <s> but supposing that in those elections the large majority of people elected were those who approve the changes proposed in the coming bill abolishing the metropolitan county councils and the greater london council i suggest that noble lords opposite would have no objection <e> <s> similarly i do not think that noble lords on this side would be so keen on pressing for elections if they thought that those elections would provide a mandate for the government to proceed with these reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords as compared with the peak reached in the first quarter of manufacturing output is still down about to per cent <e> <s> and manufacturing investment despite the per cent <e> <s> rise that has been mentioned i believe for the past year is still more than per cent <e> <s> lower than it was before the present government came in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that britains share in world trade in manufactured goods which showed a slowly rising trend in the s has fallen by per cent <e> <s> since and is now barely over per cent <e> <s> will he also confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too consider it a very great privilege to be among the first speakers to congratulate the noble earl lord stockton on his brilliant maiden speech <e> <s> the speech both in its wisdom and in its wit was one of the best i have ever heard <e> <s> the noble earl has been one of the leading statesmen of my lifetime a statesman in the grand tradition of parliamentary democracy and of a tory party which strove to consolidate social progress through the maximum degree of consensus and tolerance for alternative points of view as well as through respect for the views

unemployment can be substantially dealt with merely by returning to the same techniques of demand management which maintained full employment for years after the war or with some of the previous speakers like the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble earl for a second <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not asking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not asking a question <e> <s> i am merely asking that the noble earl should deposit the evidence in the library for his assertion that this government have recently succeeded in fundamentally reversing the decline in market share <e> <s> i have seen no evidence for that <e> <s> i am not asking for evidence now but it should be made accessible to members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that just as north sea oil <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the fact that north sea oil came on stream at the very time when the new conservative government brought in restrictionist measures most of them in the monetary and fiscal field made it very difficult for our partners in the european community to pay for oil except by driving up the value of the pound to a point which was very detrimental to british industry <e> <s> if instead they had expanded the economy in that time it would have been possible for us to use the north sea oil money to build up our manufacturing structure infrastructure and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add this as a footnote <e> <s> and the noble earl lord gowrie may also be interested in it <e> <s> i recently came across a report by a team from ford of britain which was sent to japan to examine the methods of producing motor cars in the factory of a firm called toyo

britain but of that of ford of america <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the lateness of the hour i shall restrict myself to one point that is the causes and consequences of the recent spectacular fall in the exchange value of the pound <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships if you detect that i say something that has already been said by one of the previous speakers <e> <s> i shall try to avoid that <e>", "<cs> my lords did her majestys government disagree with what is evidently the french view that trade questions and trade agreements cannot be considered in isolation from currency and monetary matters and exchange rates <e> <s> evidently any concession made in the field of tariffs could be offset by changes in relative exchange rates <e> <s> therefore to follow the american attitude which demands far-reaching agreements concerning trade and at the same time be quite unwilling to consider a new system of exchange rates is illogical <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether it is against the principles of the bill to have one authority for waste disposal for a county instead of for each borough separately <e> <s> is that in accordance with the principles of the bill if it is done separately for transport for waste disposal and for the police <e> <s> if they are joint county authorities which have already been approved by the committee and it is suggested that we have one authority dealing with all three subjects that would be against the principles of the bill <e> <s> why is it against the principles <e> <s> if anything is against the principles of the bill it is to have any joint authority on anything <e> <s> that is not against the principles of the bill because the bill contains all kinds of exceptions to the general principle that boroughs and borough councils should be responsible for everything <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that money received by the government from the sale of capital assets is not the same as money received from taxation that is to say it is not available as a counterpart to finance government expenditure <e> <s> therefore the billion that the government are taking in is not a substitute for billion of taxation <e>", "<cs> if it were the whole financial balance would be impaired <e> <s> it is really a substitute for billion borrowed is it not <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord confirm that the money paid by the boroughs to the glc was earmarked for these special purposes <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord inform the house that the new sources of funds at the disposal of the designated council for the financing of museums and art galleries will not include the imposition of fees or charges for visitors to museums <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the maximum rate of inflation which is consistent with the universities not getting a smaller allocation in real terms in the future than they are getting now <e> <s> i ask that question because at one point the noble baroness said that whether there is a real expansion and how much will depend on future inflation <e>", "<cs> is town and country planning best entrusted to boroughs <e> <s> the situation might arise where we have resources to demolish large slums in london and rebuild on an entirely new plan <e> <s> this may cut across numbers of boroughs <e> <s> when we think of town and country planning surely the basic planning authority must be on a basis much wider than envisaged in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to speak to a motion introduced by the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> he is one of our great national assets although thankfully he is not for sale <e> <s> he is a statesman who formed his views about how to regain full employment in the s simultaneously with keynes <e> <s> he was an early advocate of the kind of policies which postwar governments both labour and conservative followed in the first two decades after the war and which as the noble earl remarked earlier made the post-second world war period so different from the post-first world war period <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the noble lords predictions are any different except perhaps in more sophisticated expression and language from the forecasts of the luddites in <e> <s> they thought that they would all lose their jobs as a result of the introduction of factory methods <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to add my congratulations upon the maiden speech of the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that water is an absolutely prime essential commodity for life and that secondly from the point of view of each particular consumer the supply is naturally a monopoly <e> <s> one cannot imagine that a particular house or home should be tapped so to speak by rival water supply companies taps from which one could choose <e> <s> does it not follow that potentially enormous profits are to be made from the private supply of water if the water supplying companies are allowed to charge what they like because people would pay everything they possibly can even more than for eating rather than go without water <e>", "<cs> my lords somewhat to my surprise i find myself far more in agreement than i had anticipated with almost all previous speakers on both sides of the house <e> <s> in some ways this is a very happy circumstance <e> <s> in other ways it means that many of the remarks that i have prepared for the debate could sound rather repetitious <e> <s> i must try to avoid that happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not worked it out but i think it is possible that that is the numerical implication of what i said <e> <s> i must have some notice of that question <e> <s> on existing estimates of economies concerning the elasticity of exports and imports with respect to relative prices that would be the kind of price reduction we would need in order to have a surplus in manufactured exports with a reasonably full employment level of output <e> <s> of course it is always possible to obtain a surplus at a sufficiently low level of output <e> <s> by creating sufficient unemployment and by diminishing domestic consumption we would reduce our propensity to import and in that way we could obtain an export surplus <e> <s> however that is not what i had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords it did not occur only in this country but in this country it went very much further <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the figures in my head but nowhere was there a fall of per cent <e> <s> or anything like it in manufacturing output in a matter of two years <e>", "<cs> my lords it occurred in the seven lean years between and the end of <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords i think i shall finish my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord compare this figure with what happened in other countries <e> <s> it is true that our inflation has come down a lot but it has come down everywhere <e> <s> we were not so to speak all alone in this <e>", "<cs> we are importing <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord aright originally the government wanted to give some more time for other people other bidders to come forward so as to find out whether there may be other bidders prepared to buy the company on more favourable terms <e> <s> now the government announce that they are going back on this that the time which they originally themselves proposed to allow other bidders to come forward is no longer there and that the matter is now to be closed <e> <s> can he explain to us why they changed their mind <e> <s> if they considered it right and proper to allow time for other bidders to come forward what is it that has made them now say no we will not give any more time for the bidders to come forward <e> <s> what happened <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a misleading way of putting a question <e> <s> i am amazed that the noble lords civil service advisers allowed him to pass it <e> <s> if he says <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is this <e> <s> is the increase in unemployment a proper test of the size of the problem <e> <s> on that method of reckoning is it not true that a country which had per cent <e> <s> unemployment for the base period and which ended up with per cent <e> <s> unemployment is in the worst category and not in the best category <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter support amendment no <e> <s> if there were inserted after the words <e>"]
