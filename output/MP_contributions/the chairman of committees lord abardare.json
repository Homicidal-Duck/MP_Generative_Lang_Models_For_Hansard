["<cs> my lords i am grateful to the chief whip for now giving me the opportunity of making very few remarks on this bill <e> <s> i thought it would be useful if i said a few words on the procedure connected with the bill as it is a private bill and not a public bill and in particular to remind your lordships that there is a distinct difference between giving a second reading to a public bill and to a private bill <e> <s> in giving a second reading to of a public bill your lordships are in fact approving of the principles underlying the bill <e> <s> but in the case of a private bill this is not so and all that your lordships will be doing if you give this bill a second reading which i hope you will is agreeing that it should go to the appropriate committees <e>"]
