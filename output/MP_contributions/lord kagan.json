["<cs> my lords at this late hour i will endeavour not to detain you too long <e> <s> i should like to make a few observations which have already been better made by the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> we have heard about the desirability of improving the penal reform system and the prison system and on all sides it is assumed that largely because of lack of resources it cannot be done <e> <s> but more resources desirable though they are are not the key issue <e> <s> it is a completely new concept as the noble lord lord hunt has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one point the probation service needs people of the very highest calibre because the result of their work depends on the respect that they command in the prison service <e> <s> as was said before on occasions in the prison service they are not quite sure whether the probation service is a necessary or unnecessary intrusion <e> <s> surely the question of pay should be looked at in a different way <e> <s> if one had a smaller number of probation officers but of a much higher calibre they would co-opt from society suitable people to help them as is happening experimentally now at maidstone prison <e> <s> these are people who would be chosen because of their background <e> <s> i have in mind retired school teachers retired bank managers and people from the churches <e> <s> indeed the best training for the probation service is for someone to have been a parent because most of us have gone through that period <e> <s> the fact is that these people would not add to the financial burden <e> <s> as far as i understand it all they receive are just expenses for going <e> <s> the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs said that the probation service has a responsibility <e> <s> in my opinion that responsibility should start not when a person leaves prison but when he enters it and a relationship should be built up that is continuous a link with society <e>", "<cs> my lords the case has been put so compellingly so competently and so exhaustively by the noble lord lord donaldson by the noble earl lord longford and the noble lord lord foot that i really feel that i should not be justified in taking up your lordships time <e> <s> i thank your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion i rise with some passion and some anxiety <e> <s> when ribbentrop and molotov concluded their pact and handed over lithuania to stalin they introduced their rgime <e> <s> one of their first tasks was to remove any potential opposition or leadership to the dictatorship <e> <s> i well remember the senior nkvd man who was sent in to organise the deportation of people <e> <s> he was going to operate through the existing bureaucracy <e> <s> when one of the officials asked him how he would go about arresting and deporting to the gulag a man who was on their list he said give me a name and i shall find something to pin on him <e> <s> so much for the security and justice which a citizen behind the iron <e>", "<cs> my lords on nd march the noble lord the minister stated that the home office had commissioned a thorough review of penal administration in holland <e> <s> may we ask whether this review has been completed whether there is a report who is conducting the review and if it is not ready then when will it be ready <e> <s> we are still looking for a solution to the problem we are now debating in terms of more prisons being built <e> <s> twenty years ago holland decided that it would take a hard look at its prison system <e> <s> holland came to the conclusion that prison as a deterrent or as a means of re-education had no effect <e> <s> it therefore decided to turn to other means of preventing crime and to other deterrents <e> <s> within seven years holland reduced its prison population from the same proportion we have now to one quarter of it <e> <s> in other words in proportion to holland if we had done the same we would now have a prison population of instead of <e> <s> this would represent a saving of million a year even if we assume that the average cost per prisoner to be a total of million a day <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour to be very brief and i shall not detain your lordships more than is necessary <e> <s> i shall certainly endeavour not to repeat anything that has already been said and better said <e> <s> may i draw attention to one aspect the relationship between prison officers and probation officers <e> <s> i come back to the dutch example <e> <s> when a dutchman applies for a job in the prison service he has to pass an exam which will qualify him almost totally for the probation service <e> <s> if he does not qualify for that they will not accept him in the prison service <e> <s> in other words in holland a prison officer is potentially a probation officer <e> <s> in our prison system they are segregated by the rules and a prison officer is in breach of the rules if he establishes a relationship with a prisoner <e> <s> the prison officer is purely a disciplinary officer <e> <s> i know that in a small number of establishments an experiment has started to change that <e> <s> but if we took an example from the dutch and in the training of a prison officer introduced the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall as usual try to be as brief as possible <e> <s> my noble friend lord houghton mentioned that the government speak in two voices <e> <s> the department of trade and industry encourages small businesses to start and to build up and once they are doing that the tax authorities and the revenue under the rules under which they have to operate act as a brake and very often not only intervene but slow the process down <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief at this late hour <e> <s> if prison is a stick parole is the carrot in the judicial system <e> <s> as in so many other fields to leave the stick and take away the carrot produces very undesirable consequences <e> <s> parole gives the prisoner choice and choice gives hope <e> <s> after all in most cases particularly with young people the time a man spends in prison is rather less than the time we hope he will spend in society afterwards so that preparation for the future should take precedence over what one does for him during his stay in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble lords will agree i think on all sides of the house on the desirability of enhancing the prison service to enable it to be successful in reformative education <e> <s> but the question is whether it is possible <e> <s> i am a little puzzled because the prison service if it chose to use them has unrivalled resources <e> <s> the expense we all know is way in excess of what is available to the headmasters of the most expensive schools but in addition to that there is absolute control over the inmates which the headmaster and the teaching service do not have <e> <s> i think the reason for it is as the noble earl lord longford said that the prison officers are not equipped for and not even allowed to carry out this function though they want to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise to the noble lord lord houghton for not having been here at the beginning of his speech <e> <s> it was due to the train arriving late from yorkshire <e> <s> i am speaking with diffidence but as one who was not born in this country and has witnessed and observed parliamentary systems of the weimar republic and the soviet union may i say that every european who has lived through the trauma of hitler and the war is conscious that hitler came to power absolutely constitutionally in a one-chamber parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with diffidence after listening to such important representatives of industry and finance <e> <s> surely the value of a currency is the thermometer of a nations wellbeing <e> <s> the british economy and i speak from the smaller end of the economy from yorkshire has been in the intensive care unit for over years <e> <s> the patient has been kept alive by spending the earnings of the past and latterly by selling some of its capital assets <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ezra pointed out the fortuitous bonanza of oil was the infusion which gave the pound sterling its tubercular rosy glow <e> <s> the underlying malaise is still there and is accelerating <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the premise upon which this debate is based is correct <e> <s> a budget under one administration may produce a slight tail-wind and under another a light uphill rise in front of the economy but a budgets influence on and indeed relevance to employment is marginal and peripheral <e> <s> generating employment depends on industrial attitudes backed by incentive policies <e> <s> it depends on efficiency on innovation on investment on entrepreneurial skills and above all on the harmony between management and labour <e> <s> it depends on identifying and pursuing joint and agreed objectives <e> <s> we have seen it succeed in germany and in japan <e> <s> this is where we fail and this is where we have to seek the solution <e>", "<cs> my lords bureaucracy is common to all administrations democracies and dictatorships <e> <s> but to a democracy it is a handicap and a yoke <e> <s> that is not the case as regards a dictatorship <e> <s> after all a dictatorships primary object is the retention of power and exacting of obedience and bureaucracy is a helpful tool by which to achieve that <e> <s> in fact a dictatorship thrives with the help of bureaucracy <e> <s> it helps to control it relies on coercion <e> <s> in short everything is forbidden that is not allowed <e> <s> law and regulation control every activity and every aspect of life <e> <s> the wider the net the more effective the control <e> <s> i recall a statement by a very powerful bureaucrat who said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have lived in russia in stalins russia for three years and <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very much indebted for the initiative taken in this debate on <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the foreign secretarys speech has been misrepresented <e> <s> one cannot read into it that he is presuming to advise the <e>", "<cs> my lords anybody who has visited israel is fully aware that israel not only wants peace but desperately needs it but it does not know how to achieve it <e> <s> a third of its national budget goes on military expenditure at a tremendous cost to the standard of living to employment and to all the aspiration of the israeli people <e> <s> this is not being done voluntarily and when the world exhorts israel to rely on internationally binding guarantees every israeli schoolchild will refer you to the fate of czechoslovakia it did <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not in time to add my name to the list of speakers published <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord jacques called for a budget and an analysis <e> <s> it is a timely call and we do require a fundamental analysis but it is also a fact that the number of jobs that we are seeking for full employment are not there and that they are not going to be there <e> <s> in britain still had million manual workers <e> <s> in the number in manufacturing industry had been reduced to million workers in it was million and in it was million <e> <s> yet this declining number of people produced approximately the same quantity of goods right through those years <e> <s> in fact in with a labour force which was per cent <e> <s> less we produced per cent <e> <s> more in quantity than we did in <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to avoid repeating what the noble earl lord longford and the noble lords lord hooson and lord hunt said except to emphasise that the extension of voluntary help to the probation service is the answer particularly in the case of young people who get sent to prison <e> <s> we must accept that before going to prison for the first time most young people lack parental control and reject school control <e> <s> they grow up finding their own way surviving and making their own decisions <e> <s> but within minutes of going into prison they are deprived of all possibilities of making any decisions <e> <s> every decision is made for them and they are then in a complete moral vacuum <e> <s> once they have served their sentence and are allowed out they are in exactly the same position as a man coming up from the deep-sea to the surface without a decompression chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords before we judge america or the prime minister can we imagine what the position would be if libya had the atomic bomb <e> <s> would it not be right to assume that america is conscious of the fact that within the next years more than countries will be capable of making an atomic bomb albeit a small and dirty one <e> <s> from the low-key and almost ritual response of the soviet union which was informed step-by-step by the united states of what it was about to do it was quite apparent that the soviet union did not entirely disagree with what was happening <e> <s> the whole thing was not at all about libya <e> <s> it was a warning shot to iran to syria and to other potential centres of danger that the americans and the russians have decided not to subject the fate of the planet to the whims of one man or one sect or one fundamentalist movement <e> <s> that is what it was about <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard and read about the academics being commissioned to study this matter and about various other study groups <e> <s> may i give evidence from what is actually happening <e> <s> in yorkshire we have per cent <e> <s> unemployment <e> <s> but we cannot get any skilled workers <e> <s> our local newspapers are absolutely full to the brim with advertisements from employers for skilled machinists for skilled cutters and even for skilled weavers <e> <s> the jobcentres are very well organised and communicate with each other by computer but if you ring them to ask them for one solitary skilled worker they cannot help <e> <s> in fact a large part of the administrative time in my company is taken up by trying to obtain staff <e> <s> the whole industry now depends on a dwindling force of skilled workers for whom the various factories compete <e> <s> these are the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to avoid repetition of what has been said so well and so much better than i could say it but i should like to draw attention to one aspect <e> <s> the potential adversary is the soviet union <e> <s> a new leadership is emerging in the soviet union and a new leader who is not burdened by or feels tainted by stalinist dogma <e> <s> he does not have to make u-turns to change policies <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lord longford for tabling his unstarred question <e> <s> when he asked me whether or not i would support him i readily agreed <e> <s> i do not want to take up your lordships time at this late hour by repeating what has already very ably been said <e>", "<cs> my lords two years ago on rd april the noble lord lord home of the hirsel rose to call attention to the desire of britain to seek better relations with the soviet union and to call attention to the obstacles which stood in the way of obtaining that objective <e> <s> at that point mr gorbachev had already appeared on the political stage and a new dawn seemed to be rising <e> <s> change was in the air and change was and is taking place at an accelerating rate for very good and compelling historical reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i well remember the speech of the noble viscount lord buckmaster on nd may <e> <s> at that time there was very severe criticism of israel with blame for what had happened in the lebanese camps <e> <s> at that time it was implied that there was lack of goodwill on the part of the israelis <e> <s> sadly we have now seen that no one could put order into lebanon and the description of humpty dumpty was absolutely justified <e> <s> i feel that israel has received an unfair amount of blame <e>", "<cs> my lords wide publicity has been given in the european press and much less so in the british press to chancellor helmut kohls revolutionary proposal to create a joint franco-german fighting force which could and he hoped would become the embryo for the eventual creation of a european army <e> <s> the idea is not new <e> <s> kohls predecessor helmut schmidt when chancellor proposed an integrated command under french leadership for all german and french forces <e> <s> mitterrand supported it giscard destaing supported it <e> <s> interestingly enough there has been a continuous public opinion poll which recently showed that per cent <e> <s> of the french population were in favour of that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will forgive me for speaking without entering my name on the list of speakers but i shall keep you for only a few minutes <e> <s> even on the assumption that we can absolutely trust mr gorbachevs intentions as i do can we or indeed he trust his political future <e> <s> is he in a position to commit any potential successors <e> <s> that is something to keep in mind <e> <s> what mr gorbachev is trying to do is what moses did <e> <s> the right reverend prelate will be able to corroborate this <e> <s> moses led the jews out of egypt after three centuries of slavery <e> <s> but he stopped in the desert for years <e> <s> he decided that those generations had to die before the people entered the promised land <e> <s> moses promised it to the children of israel not to the people of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord beloff pointed out we do not loom as large in the minds of the american public as america does in ours <e> <s> the question was asked is america able to stop the slide of the dollar <e> <s> that question should be rephrased does america really want to or need to stop the slide of the dollar <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not repeat what other speakers have said so much better but i should <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be brief and avoid repeating points already so well made by other noble lords particularly the noble lords lord glenamara and lord paget <e> <s> i should like to ask just one question are we not looking too narrowly at what is happening at the moment in israel <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree absolutely with what the noble lord lord renton has just said <e> <s> i saw the film airbase as an ordinary viewer <e> <s> i did not believe what i saw and i chose to see it a second time <e> <s> i did not believe that the bbc could commission or screen such a so-called drama but it did <e> <s> not since the days of hitlers media controller goebbels have i seen such a vicious tendentious misrepresentation of a group of people in this case american airmen <e> <s> perhaps i may be forgiven for feeling rather strongly because i survived the last war not least because of the intervention of the americans without whom europe would not have kept its freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out to the house that although my name was originally on the speakers list it has since been withdrawn at my request <e> <s> i decided not to speak because everything that i wished to say had in fact already been said <e> <s> i can only apologise for any misunderstanding that may have arisen as a result of my withdrawal <e>", "<cs> my lords just as gorbachev established <e>", "<cs> my lords the tidal wave of change sweeping through the east has delighted us all <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord callaghan is right to tell us that unification is a fact and that its formalisation is only a question of time but also that at the end of the day we may see a napoleonic solution in the soviet union <e> <s> mr gorbachevs stated aim is a common european home <e> <s> we are now seeing the development of a german-led german-russian alliance <e> <s> that is the only way in which russia can survive as a european power <e>", "<cs> my lords education and training in skills and knowledge are not enough <e> <s> we need to look at the way our educational system teaches attitudes <e> <s> after all it is not only what we know but what we do with what we know that counts in the end <e> <s> the tragedy of was that we mistook the military victory for the end of the battle <e> <s> the contest continued the battlefield was merely transferred from the military to the economic field <e> <s> the germans and the japanese won that battle not because they had more resources they did not not because they had more know-how or research they did not <e> <s> they won because of the way they were prepared to fight for their country to work for it <e> <s> their secret weapon was and is attitudes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise that because of a previous engagement i might have to leave before the debate finishes <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will accept my apologies <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to material help the baltic states need western guidance on how to proceed because insistence on too rapid change can jeopardise the very objective of attaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand before your lordships today as one of the few survivors of the nazi extermination programme in lithuania where the alleged crimes took place <e> <s> on june st the wehrmacht the german army occupied kaunas the then lithuanian capital <e> <s> the german army issued two edicts <e> <s> one customary in time of war was that looting was forbidden and would be punished summarily <e> <s> the other was an appeal for volunteers to identify and eliminate enemies of the reich with the promise of a reward <e> <s> the reward would be that anyone who handed over or killed an enemy of the reich would be entitled to all the possessions that that man and his family had <e> <s> of course the jews were by definition enemies of the reich <e> <s> it was a blatant appeal to the basest criminal elements a few of which unhappily can be found in any society <e> <s> in addition to that they opened the prisons and released all the criminals <e>"]
