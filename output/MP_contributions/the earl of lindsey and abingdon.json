["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord kimberley for putting down this unstarted question on londons third airport <e> <s> what prompted me to speak tonight was a recollection of a debate we had in your lordships house in december <e> <s> of the -odd speakers in that debate i think i am right in saying that the only speaker tonight other than myself who also took part in that debate was my noble friend lord trefgarne who will be answering this debate for the government <e> <s> this if i may say so may turn out to be appropriate as reading through some of the speeches made on that occasion the noble lords voice was anyhow from these benches a lone cry in the wilderness to have the third london airport situated at stansted <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i think he slightly misrepresented the case regarding this clause <e> <s> he said that clause or clause as it was at the time of the wharncliffe meeting was put to the membership of lloyds <e> <s> at that meeting the bill was submitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking for clarification <e> <s> that issue was put to the membership of lloyds as a general acceptance of the bill and not as an acceptance of the immunities clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by congratulating the noble lord lord strathalmond on his excellent and informative maiden speech <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to hear noble lords with inside knowledge of a subject such as we are discussing this afternoon <e> <s> i hope that we shall see him again in this house contributing as he did this afternoon <e> <s> may i add that when i made my maiden speech i too suffered from an interruption just as i was getting to my feet so i sympathise with the noble lord <e> <s> i know what the feeling is like <e> <s> but i hope that it will not deter the noble lord from coming again to this house <e> <s> may i also add my congratulations to the noble lord lord windlesham for the excellent way in which he has put forward the case for the promoters of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> i trust that my noble friend on the front bench will take note of the various points raised by the noble lord as i for one have a certain amount of sympathy for what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> i should just like to reiterate that i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for introducing this debate at this very opportune moment <e> <s> i should begin by pointing out to noble lords that i was born in south africa and lived there for years of my early life <e> <s> i feel that i can contribute a slight variation to this debate in putting forward what i trust your lordships will consider to be a moderate point of view from one not looking into a situation from without but looking out from within <e> <s> having said that i should also state that i now have no private or commercial interests in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to all the speeches this afternoon i feel that i am following noble lords with far more experience on the subject before us now <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil for initiating this debate and would echo his remark that this is only a forerunner to future debates on civil aviation policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend the minister for initiating this debate this afternoon and i should also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the noble lord lord chapple on his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to congratulate the two noble lords who have made maiden speeches this afternoon and wish them well <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear them on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord st john of bletso for putting down this very interesting question <e> <s> perhaps i should begin by declaring an interest inasmuch as i was born in south africa and lived there for years as well as in southern rhodesia before returning to this country during the war in <e> <s> i therefore did not experience life under the first post-war nationalist party government who were elected in and who have been in office ever since though petty apartheid was very evident as mentioned by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords being possibly one of the few members of your lordships house who was born and lived in south africa for the first thirteen years of my life prior to the present nationalist party coming to power in it has remained one of my interests in life to follow the historical political and economic development of that country <e> <s> as has been put forward by far more experienced members of your lordships house than me this afternoon the past history of south africa reflects very much of what is happening today in that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i did not take part in the earlier stages of this bill i have to declare an interest as an underwriting member of lloyds and an agent <e> <s> i wish to point out to the noble lord lord williams that as far as i see it i should think that most people in the lloyds market see it this way a name at lloyds is not an investor as such <e> <s> he is an underwriter in his own individual right and accepts insurance risks as an individual collects the premiums and pays the claims <e> <s> therefore i submit that in those circumstances a name at lloyds is not to be bracketed with this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord kimball for asking this question <e> <s> my noble friend and i share a concern for the countryside as well as an interest in a well-known financial institution in the city of london <e> <s> until now i had not thought that i would be drawn to his side on the issue of county boundaries <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may turn briefly to my other namesake the town of abingdon where as high steward and therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief in view of the other business before y our lordships house <e> <s> i wish to support my noble friend lord goold on this second reading debate of the clyde port authority bill <e> <s> i also wish to extend my congratulations to the noble lord lord cavendish of furness on his recent appointment <e> <s> i look forward to hearing his maiden speech <e>"]
