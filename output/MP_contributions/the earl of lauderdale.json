["<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he help us about his very interesting report which reached the library only this afternoon <e> <s> he has mentioned numbers and has invited us to refute them if we can <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us whether he was able to check the figure of detainees which he mentions on page and the three-quarters of a million people forcibly removed to protected villages which the noble lord mentions on page <e>", "<cs> my lords on page there is a reference to the three-quarters of a million people <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the house may i say that the last sentence of paragraph on page states that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the catholic peace and justice commisison to which he refers told me that they

courteous and has a marvellously good temper as have so many on his side when i interrupt them <e> <s> when he says that the guerrillas are doing so to say gods work in trying to overthrow the rebel government what does he call it when they fight each other which is what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he asked whether the noble viscount lord boyd who is not here saw the detainees <e> <s> i think i can say that my noble friend lord crawford saw detainees at bulawayo when he had been told that there were <e> <s> no doubt he will make his own speech in his own time but he was not in the chamber when i interrupted the noble lord who i knew would want an answer to his question <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i join in paying a tribute to the noble lord lord carver on his limpid lucidity his beautiful logic and his marvelously balanced judgment to further instalments of all three of which we shall look forward as time proceeds <e> <s> we shall do so with pleasurable anticipation <e> <s> again like other noble lords i must join my good wishes to a great personal favourite of this house the noble lord lord carrington on elevation to his present office <e> <s> i do not think he will take it amiss from me when he reads it in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to assure the house that private interests and partial affections will not be allowed to obstruct the will of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to the marriage enabling bill <e> <s> any bill that has the patronage and advocacy of the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger immediately commands the affectionate and sympathetic attention of the house because she is a figure whom we all love and regard as a friend <e> <s> the fact that this bill has already had a second reading in the last parliament of course gives it a certain piquancy on this occasion <e> <s> however the noble baroness will be well aware that no parliament can bind its successor <e> <s> in any case the composition of this house is continually changing <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the right reverend prelate the lord bishop of london

also accept that there is nothing in the bill about a <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for one moment far more marriages yes but divorces and re-marriages <e> <s> if that is an improvement in society we should like to know why <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that a select committee of this house chaired by the noble lord lord roberthall made a series of important studies in this matter and made recommendations <e> <s> these were published about six months ago <e> <s> have the government paid due attention to them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply and for a more informative reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend further for what he has said <e> <s> without wishing to anticipate the letting loose of wildcats tomorrow will he not agree that much damage has been caused in the industry by the staged approvals programme <e> <s> is it not high time that the industry was given clear indications of the terms on which a royalty might be remitted in the case of marginal fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply but i should like to ask whether the government could bear in mind in their review that the bnoc was given a completely contradictory role <e> <s> it was meant to be a thoroughly commercial company on the one hand and yet it had access to government secrets as government adviser on the other hand <e> <s> should not that contradiction be examined very closely especially in view of the presence on the bnoc board of two members of the staff of the department of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most other countries which have a national oil company take great care to ensure that it cannot possibly influence the governments regulatory role in giving licences <e> <s> can he comment on the suggestion made by the noble lord lord strabolgi that bnoc is whiter than white in this matter inasmuch as it must assume that those civil servants on the board of bnoc live in a kind of purdah and do not know what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply but is he aware that he has not answered the question <e> <s> is he aware that the question was about wildcat wells being drilled now not about the number of exploration rigs <e> <s> can he address himself to the question which i asked which is how many wildcat wells are being drilled now <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to torment my noble friend who after all is not in the department of energy and has therefore to take his briefing at second hand is he aware that at present four wildcat wells are being drilled <e> <s> further is he aware that that compares with three already being drilled in the dutch area two in the norwegian area and one in the irish area <e> <s> is he aware that that is the lowest rate of activity for six years and that this is nothing to he happy or complacent about <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the scale of the effort that is needed <e>

say that i listened with particular interest to the noble and learned lord lord kilbrandon <e> <s> he gave us a sober and moving speech this afternoon and i regret that throughout the committee stage we did not have his counsel available to us although it had long been available in three thick volumes for all of us to study beforehand <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey was true to form <e> <s> he came out of his corner fighting hard <e> <s> he reminded me as usual of the irishman who said i always think a general and a bit of shooting make you forget your troubles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for obtaining that reply from the department of energy of which he is not a minister <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the better prospects from now on appear likely to be in the deeper waters north of the th parallel and off the shelf down the slope <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that further informative reply may i ask him whether he is aware that some of the oil companies who recently had contact with the department of energy have found that the ministers appear to be more interested in downstream distribution problems than in long-term strategic problems of exploration <e> <s> could he perhaps convey that thought to his colleague with whom he shares collective responsibility in the department of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord chitnis sits down perhaps he can help me as regards one matter <e> <s> he can be quite sure that i shall not be nasty to him i am never nasty to anyone my own front bench excepted <e> <s> however if i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he would agree that a lower domestic price for natural gas has been a disincentive to exploration for it and likewise constitutes a disincentive for the development of those marginal fields of which the production of gas could form a part <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he has any confirmation of the report that something like per cent <e> <s> of the known recoverable reserves of north sea gas have already been used up <e> <s> if so would he not regard that as rather a profligate use of a scarce natural resource which could be countered by adjustments in the price <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging and informative reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that from the first round to the fourth round inclusive blocks were offered at the rate of more than a year in round it was -odd and in round i think it was only <e> <s> therefore will he ask his right honourable friend to bear in mind the desirability of raising the number of blocks issued and also the frequency of the offerings <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend ask his right honourable friend to bear in mind that inasmuch as oil discovered is an appreciating asset there is no necessary contradiction between the need for conservation policies on the one hand and the widest possible exploration on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that up to about a month ago some oil companies were complaining that in their negotiations to settle the exploration terms the bnoc was still insisting <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his last reply gives great solace and comfort <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the last minutes have not been wasted <e> <s> i cannot help thinking that the happy mood which has spread through the house following my intervention means that noble lords on all sides have taken as their tag <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that it is necessary to export some of our premium oil because it is unsuited to our needs in this country which have to be met by importing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the seven sisters now have a gigantic ugly sister in the shape of bnoc which conducts many of our export operations <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm to the house whether or not it is true that the figure given for the remaining recoverable reserves of the forties field is about per cent <e> <s> of what there was when it was first found <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord lord avebury and his complaint that there might not be time to answer a question is it not the case that the prime minister has promised a statement on immigration before the house rises <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that reply which appears to confirm the previous governments policy would he not agree that the effect of the staged approvals procedure is to raise uncertainty about the future of the field which in turn raises the cost of finance and in turn amounts ultimately to a production disincentive <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that while he has said there is no shortage of availability of funds the point in my question was the cost of funds which rises with the degree of uncertainty <e> <s> on the question of depletion will he not also accept that the companies themselves have a strong incentive not to let the oilfields rip in view of the continually rising price of oil in real terms so that depletion as raised by the noble lord opposite is not really quite as urgent a question as he thinks <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to pick up the point about the cost which rises with the rise of uncertainty in the individual field <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all greatly indebted to the noble lord lord sherfield for introducing this debate and piloting the production of these three reports <e> <s> as his predecessor as chairman of sub-committee f which has produced them i should like to congratulate him and i am sorry that the noble lord is not in his place to hear this on the very effective way astringent and incisive that he now handles our discussions which although given a rather jolly cosy leadership in my day were of course nothing like so effective as they are at the present time <e> <s> in the same way we are greatly indebted to the noble lord lord lovell-davis for his chairmanship of the working party that produced the report on conservation bearing in mind that they had to work on a mass of woolly generalities and have produced out of them something greatly to our advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords not innocent of anything <e>", "<cs> my lords just to defend the committee these reports one assumes are read in the light of earlier reports <e> <s> we have of course criticised the commissions methodology a good deal in the past and therefore do not want every time to repeat what we have said before <e> <s> i think that that is fair to my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again but this is important because it relates to this parliaments relationship with the community <e> <s> the fact is that as sub-committee f and the others have grown in stature confidence and competence we have found that commissioners get on the telephone to us jolly quickly and the first copies if not more of all our reports are immediately ordered from brussels <e> <s> so i think that our word does carry <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend consider that since the house of lords now is much more active than it was or years ago and has many more active members now than before whereas the house of commons has remained static in that respect there is a case for recovery from the house of commons of such territory as the pugin room which was ceded to them in a period of lords weakness and commons bombastry <e>", "<cs> my lords on the issue of accommodation will the noble lord take this further point into consideration <e> <s> at present the lobby are excluded from the princes chamber whereas they have access to the members lobby at the other end of the corridor <e> <s> possibly if the lobby correspondents were given access to the princes chamber that might have a considerably ameliorating effect until proper accommodation can be found <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for the assurance that no decision has yet been made regarding future licences may i ask whether he would agree that any disincentive to profit is in turn a disincentive to production and in turn to exploration and therefore any disincentive to profit would be counter to the purposes of her majestys governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not accept that all over the world the wellhead price is the normal practice in determining royalties and that here the landed price is the exceptional practice for which the last government were responsible and which has really done damage not good <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord clarify one thing he said <e> <s> he mentioned that this operation is based on the great progress <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the steps already taken with regard to bnoc particularly to restrict their first option on farm-ins and assignments have already helped to create new confidence in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that all propaganda consists in selection and that that was a highly selective extract <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure for me at any rate to listen to the noble lord lord wigg because in a house which is apt to be somnolent he brings us to life we had minutes of good-hearted stuff from an old soldier and surprisingly to myself i found myself in agreement with him on one matter which he touched on and i hope i understood him right <e> <s> it was his reference to the need for air power in supporting the proposed british presence but i will come back to that shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way just for a second <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that rather obscure reply may i ask him whether he is aware that many people observing the energy industry applaud the governments decision to stop the flaring of gas in the north sea <e> <s> but would he not agree that the artificially low price the british gas corporation have been charging in recent years has led to the threat of a very serious shortage both because of increased unnatural and excessive demand on the one hand and because of disincentives to explore and develop in the southern area on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend could add to what he has just said which has <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that there is a certain reason why this house should interest itself in the constitution of the other place inasmuch as the sole remaining veto power relates to our capacity to block any attempt to tamper with the quinquennial act <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl explain why there has been this decline <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to tell the house whether or not it is the case that sir ian gilmour has met the plo <e> <s> and are we to understand from his earlier reply that assurances given by a terrorist organisation are in fact to be believed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to answer my supplementary question are we to understand that the assurances given by a terrorist organisation whose industry is murder and therefore cheating are to be believed <e>", "<cs> my lords just to reassure us on one point will the governor have his mind particularly directed to the possible intimidation of the electors as the election campaign gets under way by terrorists bandits or whatever they are who are still free in the bush <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that the sale of council houses in so far as it will increase the number of privately owned houses will work towards reciprocity with germany and other countries which have a greater private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl clarify two points that he made <e> <s> first are we to understand that the higher gas prices are now to be related to the higher cost of gas from the northern north sea <e> <s> therefore they will be notionally related to what might be the notional replacement cost <e> <s> secondly are we to understand that he is calling in aid for the case to raise gas prices the recommendation of the price commission which i think was set up by the previous government <e>", "<cs> my lords like others who have spoken i must join in congratulating the noble lord lord strauss on his maiden speech which was distinguished in many respects and not least in the respect that it was scarcely uncontroversial <e> <s> but he will always be welcome as he knows and any former colleague of his in the house of commons as i was for a while will rejoice in his presence <e> <s> following the right reverend prelate the bishop of london i ask myself whether there is anything else to be said <e> <s> the only case for continuing the debate and for mounting speech after speech saying very much the same things on the one side of the argument is to impress the government which have to make up their minds that there is a strong body of opinion which is affronted by certain aspects of this report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> perhaps i did not express myself very clearly <e> <s> i did not say there was no moral content i gave it delta double minus for content but what i said was that the committee did not really tackle the moral issue or words to that effect and i stand by that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way and i know that he did not want to be snide <e> <s> but surely we all have a right to say that what ends up by cor <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first occasion when i have had the pleasure of hearing the noble lord lord underhill speak <e> <s> i was looking forward to his speech with anticipation and that anticipation was not disappointed <e> <s> he has of course been exposed to much honourable mention of late but the subject of that honourable mention is not the subject of our debate today <e> <s> he asked a number of questions which i think one can summarise in this way why these swingeing savage massive increases in gas pricing while the bgc earns such a surplus and anyway why should any of that surplus go back to the psbr <e> <s> these are matters to which i shall return <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness will probably share the recollection of a mutual friend of hers and mine who sits on her benches who once said in my hearing that all women are mini-chancellors of the exchequer <e> <s> they all know that at the end of the week sixpence does not go quite as far as it did on monday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised that the noble lord lord tanlaw who is learned in these matters drew attention to that omission which was deliberate <e> <s> the fact is that i have no really reliable facts about it and i always find and i must confess this that when i read of so many trillion cubic feet i can never remember how many noughts there are in a trillion or whether we are talking about american or british billions <e> <s> i wanted to say something about morecambe bay but i thought it safer not to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to interrupt him <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord assure me that the word boondoggling is not an achronym <e>", "<cs> what my lords about the unemployed <e>", "<cs> oh dear <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the supplementary question from the front bench opposite represents a considerable feeling in this country that it might well be to our advantage to break the post offices monopoly

performed a considerable service <e> <s> it has elicited a useful debate and i think the proposals put forward by the noble lord lord wells-pestell are particularly worthy of study <e> <s> yet the real sanction is the right to withdraw children <e> <s> that is already the sanction in regard to religious education <e> <s> there are humanists who will not expose their children to the stories of

"<cs> my lords i was saying that i thought the subsidy for insulation was a pretty small scheme anyway <e> <s> since it was not very greatly taken up the saving is even smaller i was not advocating subsidy as such but i am advocating investment in general in energy conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but is my noble friend suggesting that heat pumps cannot be bought in this country <e> <s> if so he is misinformed <e> <s> in fact the electricity council is pushing heat pumps very hard <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord gowrie for giving us minutes of interesting information some <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from my noble friends reply that the marshall report has in principle been accepted by the government and that the government will now seek to identify a suitable site for a pilot scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend add this further point to the matters he has answered <e> <s> will the government consider inviting local authorities when they prepare their structure plans to consider the possibilities of chp as a suitable ingredient if you like as a suitable input in their studies for structure planning <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join with other noble lords in saying how much we are in debt to the noble lord lord sherfield for his urbane and discriminating leadership of this committee which is now operating at higher gear and to better purpose than it has ever done <e> <s> on the subject matter of our debate i must confess to getting a certain feeling of <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what else was talked about or were the talks only about fishing <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that he cannot give us any idea whatever of the subjects even the heads of discussion <e> <s> he has said that the talks were cordial and frank and so on <e> <s> can he give us any idea of what it was all about <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend tell us what is the new international order referred to and whether it is one in which the opec countries have deepened the damage done by inflation to the whole of the industrial world and deepened still more the poverty of the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend may i ask whether he would not agree that this tenfold increase achieved within a year of the new administration taking office is greatly to the governments credit <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his answers will give great satisfaction and will provide information about a dark <e>", "<cs> my lords to me it is always agreeable it does not often happen to have the opportunity of congratulating my government on doing the right thing <e> <s> i wish that i could say things of this kind more often <e> <s> we have

tell us whether there is any evidence yet that the notorious stand of the plo has been modified or is in the process of being modified to conform with the purposes and spirit of the councils resolution <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that he expected the state to set an example of human behaviour <e> <s> i simply cannot understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that in view of the several statements in this house that nothing final can happen without conscious deliberate decision by governments questions of this sort are themselves of a false alarmist nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper and in so doing may i draw attention to a misprint <e> <s> the second time the word published appears in the question it should read publicised <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that rather evasive reply to my question may i ask whether he would not agree that the attitude of the coal board and indeed of the government as represented by his reply is of a somewhat defeatist character and quite out of line with the bold declaration of venice to which the prime minister adhered only the other day <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that in fact last year productivity was up very significantly thanks in part to the tory tax cuts that output was up higher in the mining industry than in any other industry in the country and that it is time to be bold to pursue a bold coal export policy instead of one which is rather apologetic and negative <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the governments intention to assist the coal industry to the extent of million in real terms each year for the next three years is not only a great encouragement to the industry but should mean that its target to the end of the century could be raised to million tonnes from million tonnes <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that at present natural gas is heavily oversold and there is a shortage of it <e> <s> can he tell us whether the governments answer is a once-and-for-all answer ignoring the possibility of the development of

point of view so cogently <e> <s> i want to raise a few general points from the supply angle <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> as nye bevan once said in the long run we are all dead <e> <s> but the long-range marginal cost was a term used by these two commissions and i take it to mean within the foreseeable future <e> <s> whether that means years or years i do not know

whether the interim report is going to be made available to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether he can refer to scottish participation since the question referred to both british and scottish sources respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords

about three years time which it is too late to prevent <e> <s> would he further agree that for the same reason it is now urgent to encourage more exploration and development through tax incentives

lords will my noble friend consider whether the usual channels could not examine the possibility of a debate on this matter <e> <s> there are those who hold the view that our preoccupation with the continent of europe has tended to divert our thinking from maritime police the importance of which is vital to a united europe and even to continental russia which is now embarking on a maritime

his answers to the agr can he assure the house that the government will not allow agr technology to die <e>", "<cs> my lords as this road leads to scotland should not the bonus be higher still <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the researches so far conducted in norway and elsewhere have reconciled the problems of something light enough to operate in summer water and waves and strong enough to stand up to winter water and waves to say nothing of the problem of storage <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that common to both wind and wave generation is the problem of storage when the wind dies down or when the waves calm <e>", "<cs> my lords as the last back-bencher to speak before the heavyweights of the establishment pronounce it would be churlish not

examples not only of such a case but where a back-benchers motion was proposed all the speakers backed it and then people trooped in to vote it down <e> <s> this happens <e> <s> but the point is that in this house on a matter of most general interest the decision of the voting normally does reflect who won the argument <e> <s> that is where this place differs greatly in my view from that down the corridor <e>", "<cs> my lords as joint founder with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran of the parliamentary group for energy studies perhaps i may be permitted to comment on the meeting with frau steeg director general of iea to which he referred <e> <s> she pointed out quite clearly and publicly that no country was seeking preparing to seek or proposed to seek intervention in the free oil market and no country thought that was worthwhile or profitable while prices were falling <e> <s> when the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran with his great exposure to energy problems talked in a rather glib and i might even say liberal way about ec energy policy he has perhaps yet to realise that that is grounded on the wide opposition of interest between countries that produce energy and

development stage <e> <s> does that mean that they will be negotiated at the time of the annexe b applications or when theannexe b is granted or are they quite separate from that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that these figures so far as they go on the whole are encouraging rather than discouraging in that the curve for new jobs is rising and the curve for new people coming into

working life <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to measures to reduce unemployment does my noble friend the minister not agree that the government are to be congratulated on resisting pressure for sanctions against southern africa which would increase unemployment here as well as in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that as against the allegation of concealed unemployment there is also considerable concealed employment in the black economy <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the constant reiteration of this question in various forms by

<e> <s> but he also used an argument which i also heard and was surprised to hear from the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale that because the second reading was a vote for total deregulation therefore there was no merit in discussing any amendment which amounted to any degree of regulation <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend because it will give me greater heart

my noble friend say whether the researchers will have their attention drawn to the satisfaction in scotland at the continued use of the note which causes english people to take their money to scotland

scotland <e> <s> of course many of the companies overseas are led by scotsmen they are our most priceless export <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the most encouraging trends has been the rise in the gross national product which over the past few years has been of the order of per cent <e> <s> per annum <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend can help me on several points in the statement which leaves me blinded by science <e> <s> first is it not the case that if the grid is to maintain the existing highly successful merit order in which stations are brought into supply under conditions of competition the generators will all need to have surplus capacity to compete which in turn must surely raise rather than lower prices <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm whether the white paper refers to the provision of new capacity needed by the end of the century <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mason of barnsley i once represented a mining constituency and i have much sympathy with all that he said about coal <e> <s> i should like to underline his particular reference to the fact that this is an extractive industry and that therefore sooner or later mines have to close <e> <s> the problem is how to make the best use of what will remain and how best to turn coal to the best economic advantage <e> <s> it is perhaps worth mentioning that the recent redundancies have been accomplished voluntarily which warrants tribute to the common sense of both sides of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords only once in seven years does

also been complaints in romania about catholics being bullied into reunion with the orthodox church contrary to their convictions and freedom of choice <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the practice of this house is that noble lords who put down a question <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend lord caithness opened this debate he referred to the strength of our economic base <e> <s> hardly any noble lords on either side of the house in the or so speeches since have referred to a critical component in industrial costs particularly in capital intensive industries namely the price of energy to which the gracious speech made a rather sidelong <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene to clarify this <e> <s> he was good enough to refer to some remarks of mine from this bench the other night <e> <s> would he not agree that in fact the officially admitted shortfall in capacity by the end of the century is gigawatts which is considerably more than is likely to come from the severn tidal barrage even if it was being built now <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has just listened to a maiden speech of quite outstanding merit if i as someone who hardly got a degree may use the word merit in referring to that which we have just heard <e> <s> it was a speech of intellectual clarity bearing on energy strategy and policy in the round as the context for our

friend say what is the ideal distance between two cars travelling on a motorway at miles per hour <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the greatest hope for the restoration of tranquility and stability within the church of england would lie in the restoration of the original balance in the choice of candidates between the high low and middle or evangelical catholic and middle stump and that the imbalance of the recent past should now be corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister not agree that the establishment of the new community charge is welcomed by all ratepayers who see their burden reduced and properly shared among the community <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i received a booklet of paying slips and have found

congratulating my noble friend the minister who opened the debate with such clarity and with all the grace we have come to expect from her <e> <s> we look forward to collaboration with her in improving this bill as it goes along and we hope that what is said today will not in the words of the noble lord lord williams seem too brutal <e> <s> but i think she knows that there are some relatively unpalatable things on the way <e>", "<cs> my lords the point which i should like to raise is that the power will be pulled in on a half-hourly basis but it will be pulled in on the basis of price rather than of cost <e> <s> surely the price has to take account of shareholders remuneration and so on and is bound to be more than cost <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that a

licence <e> <s> that has conditions not <e> <s> the electricity transmission licence has conditions <e> <s> so i have <e>", "<cs> my instinct is to support my noble friend lord peyton in this amendment because the regulation of the electricity supply <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord moving the two amendments and can we discuss them both <e>", "<cs> security of supply is an absolutely key issue <e> <s> when we read in the bill that that is to be limited by the word reasonable goodness knows how that word could be interpreted <e> <s> there may be a case where thanks to the follies of this bill we are short of generating capacity it is expensive to import from france and in a hot summer a paternal government invites people to turn off their air conditioning because it is unreasonable despite the heat of the summer to overload the system <e> <s> that is what we should avoid <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my reasonable noble friend to be not unreasonable <e>", "<cs> i do not join in this debate as an expert in research or with any comprehension of science <e> <s> however we are faced with a long-term proposition <e> <s> the first effects of this bill if it becomes an act as i am afraid it will will probably not be noticed by the public for five years or perhaps longer <e> <s> in the meantime those who are responsible and those whose heads should be on the block will <e>", "<cs> my noble friend referred to oil companies and i should declare an interest in that i am a director of a french oil company elf aquitaine <e> <s> we spend a lot of money on research

on <e> <s> we have spent a lot of money <e> <s> it is not research for or years ahead <e> <s> i believe that we are talking about the very long-term research into such things as fast reactors which is fairly short term speaking relatively and fusion <e> <s> that is quite different <e> <s> there is no analogy between what the oil company is doing in the north sea and what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to trouble my noble friend <e> <s> the secretary of state has a duty to co-ordinate <e> <s> what about the funding <e> <s> we have read recently that the funding of the fast reactor research will be slashed and that of future research even more so <e> <s> the secretary of state may have the duty but how does he exercise it <e> <s> we are worried about the money and the provision for or years ahead <e>", "<cs> one point has occurred to me in listening to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> she said that everything is all right and issued a communiqu assuring us that everything will be all right <e> <s> the fact is as the noble viscount lord hanworth said that there is growing anxiety within the public reasonable or unreasonable is of no matter about accidents relating to energy of all sorts <e> <s> the piper alpha affair is the most recent case which aroused horror and stirred everyones imagination <e>", "<cs> before the committee leaves this point my noble friend has just said that very often the outsider who is a sufficiently competent man has a better view and a better capacity to tackle a completely new subject than has someone who has been immersed in that subject for a great part of his life <e> <s> she will be the first to admit that this bill comes from a team of ministers not one of whom had any experience of electricity before <e> <s> no doubt that fact speaks for itself <e>", "<cs> may i just add one small point <e> <s> are we taking from what my noble friend said about it being a full-time job full time is full time is full time that the director general will also divest himself or exclude himself from any investment in the electricity industry when it is privatised <e> <s> can we take that for granted <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord ezra whether this has any bearing on houses or groups of houses which have combined heat and power systems or has that no relevance at all <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend can tell me one thing <e> <s> are we to infer from what he has said that the meaning of the words due and undue will ultimately be decided by the director general <e>", "<cs> can we have the list announced slowly so that we can tick them off <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend enlarge upon what he first said and tell the house whether the government through english heritage or any other channel are now willing to give support to the preservation of ecclesiastical buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend can clarify one further point <e> <s> are we right to understand that it is the governments policy in general not to resist proposals for support for churches if they need repair <e> <s> further do his remarks refer to scotland as well as to england <e>", "<cs> has my noble friend adjusted her mind to the fact that the argument we have just heard is academic and abstract <e> <s> it comes down to the proposition that because chp heat is not primary energy it cannot be included in the bill <e> <s> that is a theoretical distinction of the governments own making <e> <s> the real question is whether we want some extra energy for virtually nothing after the capital has been paid off <e> <s> if we do if we want cheaper energy for the country the government seem to put up energy prices like anything anyway why turn our backs on a scheme that works elsewhere <e> <s> it is being pursued elsewhere <e> <s> it is a scheme to which there are no environmental objections and which in the end amounts to a saving of fuel <e> <s> the objection is purely abstract <e>", "<cs> the clause as it stands gives protection to french exports of electricity to britain however they are generated <e> <s> that is protectionism <e> <s> i use the word as a shorthand for the developments that will follow from that date <e> <s> however when the developments of are running full blast as it were and there is a free interchange of energy across the community this kind of protection will not be possible <e> <s> this measure must fly in the face of the plans for <e> <s> i do not begin to understand the purpose of giving the french nuclear industry or indeed other industry a particular preference over the industry in this country <e> <s> i shall be very interested to hear my noble friends reply <e> <s> there may be a very good reason for that <e> <s> i hope that we shall receive a substantial reply <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord opposite for putting into more academic and intelligent language than i could the point i tried to make <e> <s> the net result is to give a special advantage to french exports of electricity <e> <s> i call that protectionism <e> <s> it may be the wrong term and i may be very stupid but that is how i understand it <e>", "<cs> it is time to protest at one aspect of this debate <e> <s> just now my noble friend lady gardner traduced the motives of at least one noble lord if not two in supporting this amendment <e> <s> she did the same thing the other day <e> <s> as i understand parliamentary custom one may suggest that a noble lord opposite or on your own side or a right honourable gentleman is crazy and stupid misinformed and misled but one never traduces his motives <e> <s> i hope that the committee will accept that what my noble friend said was not intended to be quite as offensive as i believe it seemed <e>", "<cs> in view of what my noble friend has said i withdraw my remarks <e> <s> i apologise without qualification but that is how i understood what she was saying <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is grateful to my noble friend for the recitation that she has just given us which was of great interest but of great complexity <e> <s> i must tell the committee although it already knows that i am pretty slow on the uptake <e> <s> i am absolutely baffled by all this and am reminded of a former minister of state at the department of energy lord balogh who is now alas departed <e> <s>

mind <e> <s> no said the student im just as confused as before but at a higher intellectural level <e> <s> i am afraid that that is how i feel <e>", "<cs> before we leave this matter i must apologise for being called away from the chamber on some urgent business <e> <s> this point may have been covered while i was out of the chamber it relates to distinguishing between the taxpayer and the consumer <e> <s> my noble friend just used the phrase to which she is becoming accustomed the balance of interest <e> <s> everything must be in the balance of interest <e> <s> we must get the balance

constructive and if i may say so as a layman done with great pastoral gentleness for those of us who are rather stupid and slow in the uptake <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that she will

debates <e> <s> it will have occurred to my noble friends on the front bench that i am not greatly enamoured of it anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend make one matter clear <e> <s> he has referred to german occupied territory <e> <s> does the report take account of the fact that the italians occupied territory first in italy and secondly in dalmatia under german tutelage <e> <s> does the report deal with events that may have happened in those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask my noble friend to clarify one point <e> <s> i do not think that we want to turn knives in wounds at this stage <e> <s> with regard to the provision of money that has to be increased we understand that that is a matter for the other place <e> <s> but since much wider issues apart from the provision of money arise can the minister assure us that there will be an opportunity to debate the matter in this house <e> <s> if she is not herself a usual channel perhaps she will communicate the view that this house must have a good look at the subject in the autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords that point was raised yesterday <e> <s> the noble baroness said that there will also be an opportunity to debate the matter in this house later <e>", "<cs> my lords having interrupted the noble lord lord tordoff i beg the leave of the house to say a few words more <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord williams of elvel made a series of very cogent points <e> <s> i frankly agreed with them <e> <s> but when it comes to deciding whether we should further delay the bill delay the dogs breakfast further i do not

noble friend inform his right honourable friend the secretary of state that as the government have already agreed to take back into the public sector magnox reactors they may as well take back the

family life and its stability and coherence <e> <s> nor does it disprove the respect for the traditional values with which society has endowed family life down the centuries irrespective of christianity <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e> <s> whatever our position in terms of religion science philosophy or agnosticism the family is a natural unit and it is in all our interests to develop and protect it <e> <s> that is the context in which i ask the committee to study this matter <e>", "<cs> the only discrimination in which i shall indulge is as regards not responding to the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> i have long since learnt that that is a very dangerous thing to do as we then continue all night <e> <s> therefore i shall discriminate against my taste to reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has invited us to tackle the bill in relevant ways within seconds of telling us that there are a million and a half fatherless children in this country <e> <s> if that is not relevant to the bill i do not know what is <e> <s> he has told us as has the noble lord lord ennals that it is preposterous that we should try in a bill to interfere with private judgment on private matters <e> <s> but what do we do as legislators every day of the week <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment and to try to correct something that my noble friend the minister said from the front bench <e> <s> she talked about not confining it to certain kinds of people <e> <s> the hard fact is and there will be very few members on either side of this committee who will not agree with what i am going to say that whenever the government appoint a so-called neutral committee many of us find that it is always biased in a particular way <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend on what basis the measure goes beyond the warnock report and the white paper <e>", "<cs> we have been told not once but half a dozen times in committee earlier this week and several times today that the argument for such and such is that it was either in the warnock report or in the white paper <e> <s> i am asking the government on what basis they are adding extras that were not in either of those documents <e> <s> i am only asking for the information <e>", "<cs> that is not the white paper or the warnock report <e>", "<cs> they may have been in use for some considerable time under the interim licensing authority <e> <s> we are referring to a statutory body <e> <s> we have been told over and over again on tuesday and more than once today that a measure in the bill is justified because there was reference in the warnock report or the white paper <e> <s> there may have been guidelines by the interim licensing authority but the issue was not in the white paper or the warnock report <e>", "<cs> we had arguments earlier about the slippery slope <e> <s> we have had arguments about this or that matter being authorised now and the authority then going a little further <e> <s> we have here an issue that was in neither the white paper nor the warnock report <e> <s> i hope that we shall be given an answer as to why it has been added <e>", "<cs> what one wants to know is that the activities arising from this authority will not expand by a degree here and there and end up in activities that are only marginally implicit in our legislation and may not even be authorised by it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is high time that the heating system in this building was overhauled <e> <s> it is either too hot or too cold <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong this general debate too much but i am a little worried <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor speaks of children born by this treatment <e> <s> it is not children born by this treatment that worries us some of us are worried about children who are born by this treatment through aid <e> <s> that is the distinction that concerns us <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord saying that in those cases where a child is born from a donor there should simply be a blank about the name of his father <e> <s> in that case it would suggest that they should go and ask the authority <e> <s> if that is what he means it might be acceptable but if he is saying that there is to be no indication to researchers that a particular birth has a peculiarity to put it like that for the moment i do not think that is satisfactory <e>", "<cs> we alluded to this subject earlier this afternoon <e> <s> my noble and learned friend pointed out that existing birth certificates sometimes give information which is not historically accurate <e> <s> parents may conceal the fact that the father was someone else <e> <s> that is sometimes innocently done <e> <s> it might happen that a father does not know that <e>", "<cs> surely the medical argument is important <e> <s> we have all been examined by a doctor at some time or other and the question has been asked is there any madness in your family <e> <s> i have been asked that question many times <e> <s> there is plenty now <e> <s> medical treatment may require knowledge of antecedents and if those antecedents are not known or are wrongly stated the treatment can be wrong as well <e> <s> so from he childs point of view or that of the grandchild surely the medical case is a very important one <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure how a child or indeed an adult if he has reached the age of would know that he could apply to the authority or have any reason to do so if his mother had not told him that there was a donation <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the remarks made by the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> he touched upon a completely new aspect namely the state having information about a persons identity and refusing to disclose it <e> <s> it may seem a strange comparison but in recent months we have witnessed extraordinary changes on the face of europe not least the revolution in romania <e> <s> this is a terribly dangerous power to leave in the hands of the state <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the russians have a gigantic navy and particularly in respect of submarines <e> <s> does he further agree that it is by no means certain given the instability within russia that the present regime there will stay in power <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in an event of this sort an ordinary constituent would be wise to go to his or her member of parliament who could raise the matter on the floor <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that where a school cannot find a teacher of religious education there is always a parson in the area who would be very glad and indeed delighted to undertake the task <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend refer to the question asked by the noble lord lord hylton from the cross-benches <e> <s> this is not surely a matter of temperature it is a matter of principle <e> <s> many of us are anxious that the government should be prepared to look at the whole matter not simply in terms of a cold winter or a colder winter but of getting the homeless resettled and under control <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure us that in looking at the problem the government will also consider its causes which must surely include the instability of marriage the instability of so-called stable relationships and the fashion for single-parent homes <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend says that more capacity will be available will that capacity generate more waste paper or consume it <e> <s> would he agree that a reduction in legislation might go some way towards helping to solve our problems <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand that noble lords opposite have now been converted to privatisation and want it to be hurried on as fast as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in this debate and others there has been one rather alarming ambiguity <e> <s> i refer to the reference to counselling <e> <s> counselling is sometimes given the adjective proper <e> <s> that begs many questions <e> <s> so also does the use of the term private life <e> <s> it is said that parliament should not interfere with peoples private lives but it is doing so all the time from morning to night <e> <s> we are told oh no private life is private life and people can do what they like <e> <s> we are told <e>", "<cs> my lords how will the clinic counsel without asking questions <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that there are subtleties in this matter which do not easily respond to definition <e> <s> for example is he aware that on several occasions recently a leading politician was described as being obsessed with something when perhaps the word preoccupation would have been better <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to take up the time of the house i should like to support what has been said by my noble friend lady <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend the duke of norfolk <e> <s> at the end of the day the truth is more important than fiction <e> <s> surely we as a state have a duty to respect and honour the truth <e> <s> that is all i should like to say in support of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords one person to whom gratitude has not been expressed this afternoon but who has played a considerable part in keeping us informed on this delicate and difficult matter is my noble friend lord jellicoe <e> <s> i do not agree with him and have not done so since the moment he used a description of the embryo a mere dot <e> <s> however he went to considerable trouble to make sure that anyone interested could visit one of the schemes of in vitro fertilisation <e> <s> i took advantage of that invitation and i was much instructed <e> <s> i came away deeply impressed with the sincerity moderation and sense of responsibility of all who are engaged in that research <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the other north sea riparian states are yet satisfied with the methodology employed by the riparian states of the rhine and the elbe in ascertaining and controlling pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards -year inheritances does not my noble friend agree that we inherited a national debt which is now being reduced year by year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the directive is for or against red rouge for a bull <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that there is never a mean point of equilibrium in energy prices <e> <s> they move up and down like the moving stairways on the underground <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend go a little further and distinguish between investment for production of oil and investment for production of gas inasmuch as the last brown book figures showed a decline in oil investment of to per cent <e> <s> but a rise in gas investment of about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend been advised about when sunday collections will start in london <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say first whether the figures to which she referred apply only to england and wales or whether they cover the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> in the event that they do not cover scotland perhaps someone could write to me on the matter <e> <s> secondly as she indicated that there are geographical variations can she at this stage give a hint as to the areas which are shall we say less well-behaved in this respect <e>", "<cs> i believe that the effect of the amendment is to strengthen the hands of the commission and as such it should be welcomed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a point about having respect <e> <s> have not so-called or apparently religious programmes sometimes carried a hostile and snide undercurrent <e> <s> the requirement of respect would rule that out <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that a threat to a small country is a threat to us all <e> <s> referring to the question asked by the noble lord lord hatch that is why we are there <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree with regard to a comparison with germany that the germans work jolly hard <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will answer a question <e> <s> is he aware that on the oclock news on bbc television last night there was an item about todays debate three-quarters of which gave publicity to a letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not recognise that the scope for renewables is widely exaggerated <e> <s> wind power requires an enormous amount of space geo-thermal power has only two or three sites available and wave power is still a long way off <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that there is a distinction to be drawn between nuclear power which is capable of providing <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the question raises a wider issue the gradual diminution of ministers of state from our noble and notable front bench <e> <s> some of us are very anxious about the lack of a minister of state for energy <e>"]
