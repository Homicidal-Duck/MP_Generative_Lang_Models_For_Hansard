["<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies may i be allowed to ask the noble lord lord jacques if he has the permission of the house to elucidate one point <e> <s> he and to some <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> but if it is to be funded from funds which parliament will later vote surely if parliament elected not to vote those funds the funds would be available for other purposes would they not <e>", "<cs> i agree with the right reverend prelate the bishop of derby that one may be attracted initially by the proposal put forward by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham but the fact is that it seeks merely to alter a name and does not alter the position in any way at all <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that we were adding prescription <e> <s> surely when one asks people to have regard to something one is not prescribing anything but merely reminding them of something they should do <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the view which has just been expressed by the noble viscount <e> <s> i think it would be very unfortunate not to have representation of the parish council if it can possibly be arranged <e>", "<cs> the minister said something about taking things away from the local authorities <e> <s> it is not clear how this amendment takes anything away from the local authorities <e>", "<cs> are we not making rather heavy weather of this <e> <s> i agree very much with the noble earl lord swinton who called attention to the cost of this proposal <e> <s> apart from that i was wondering who would write these brief biographies <e> <s> i suppose it would be the people themselves <e> <s> if they are as has been suggested party hacks i do not think they will write that in their biographies <e>", "<cs> we should like from these benches to support this amendment <e> <s> i am not sure that i have understood it correctly <e> <s> is amendment no <e> <s> an alternative amendment to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they seem to be covering the same ground <e> <s> i am not clear whether one is an alternative <e> <s> we are on amendment no <e> <s> but i think the noble baroness spoke to amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> if i may also speak to amendment no <e> <s> may i ask whether there is a misprint in the last line but one <e> <s> surely it means initial training for not less than five hours per year <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord clarify one point on sub-paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness lady young a question arising from what the noble lord lord hunt said <e> <s> i am not quite clear about the point at which somebody is deciding that a child should go to one of these schools with an assisted place <e> <s> the noble baroness said it was the receiving school that vetted whether he or she was fitted to go there but who starts the process <e> <s> presumably the child is at another school now <e> <s> is it the school which the child is attending at present which says to the secretary of state we have a very bright child here <e> <s> we think he or she ought to go through this scheme <e> <s> who makes the initial move <e>", "<cs> we on these benches entirely agree with the views expressed by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham in his splendid speech that this scheme is deplorable and we would wish to join with him and his colleagues in seeking to get clause removed from the bill <e> <s> before i come to the merits i would rather say the demerits of the clause i will as briefly as i can go back to the little dispute i have had with the noble baroness lady young about the financing of the scheme because some loose ends have been left which we should try to tie up <e>", "<cs> i am sure i did not say that <e> <s> i asked a rhetorical question what proportion of scholars would be found to have come out right at the top <e> <s> i think the proportion would be pretty small <e> <s> i said i did not know the answer <e>", "<cs> after the speech of the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden those of us who believe that this clause should be eliminated from the bill have very little left that we need say <e> <s> but i want to refer to one or two points <e> <s> i listened with great care to the noble baroness lady young and i want to mention some matters briefly <e> <s> when she introduced the second reading the noble baroness said that the bill did not radically change any of the main principles of the act <e> <s> i should have thought that the provision of free transport was very much a main principle of the act <e> <s> the noble lord lord butler made this point clear <e> <s> he put it in his usual very fair way when he said it was not an integral part of the settlement but it was a vital part <e> <s> i am not quite sure what the difference is but anyway it is clearly a basic principle of the act <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young has made a good point <e> <s> my reaction to that is let us remove the walking limits and pay for everybody <e> <s> the point has already been mentioned and it has been brought to my notice that the administrative costs of what is proposed in this clause are like to be very considerable <e> <s> i have had information from two counties both of which suggest very substantial increases in cost <e> <s> i am sure this has been taken into account by the noble baroness but i think it is a point that your lordships should bear in mind in voting on this issue <e>", "<cs> i am sure we shall return to this subject <e> <s> the noble baroness lady young asks me to give her some particulars <e> <s> i am not going to quote figures <e> <s> i have not got any figures and if i had them i should need to check them <e> <s> i have not had time to do that <e> <s> if she wants to know the two counties whose problems have been brought to my notice i will tell her that one is kent and the other is cumbria but i have no reason to suppose that they are unique in that respect <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord because of what he was saying extend it in his mind to local authorities having discretion to break a promise that had been given by the government <e>", "<cs> before i move this amendment is it in order to ask the government what they propose to do about clause <e>", "<cs> some of us share the fear of my noble friend lady seear that the act of turning a duty into a power will have a psychological effect on this movement <e> <s> would it not be possible to defeat that effect by leaving the position as it was namely by accepting this amendment and then postponing its operation which the secretary of state can do <e> <s> he can bring it into operation at any time he likes <e> <s> it would mean that at some time this will be a duty <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord bellwin before he replies explain further what he said about non-educational records not being the property of the local education authority <e> <s> the records are <e>", "<cs> i just want to say at this stage that the object of the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon is the same as the object of some amendments which are down in the name of my noble friend lady seear which we shall be moving later <e> <s> it is a little difficult to see how these two sets of amendments will work together and we do not want to cause trouble to the committee <e> <s> so far as i can see the only substantial difference between the intentions of the noble lord lord mishcon and of my noble friends is that he wants further education as well as primary and secondary education to have a right to cross borders but in each case provided that the originating authority agrees while we want to have border crossing whether the originating authority agrees or not <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
