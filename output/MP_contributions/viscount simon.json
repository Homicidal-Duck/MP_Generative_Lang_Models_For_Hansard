["<cs> my lords hope the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton will forgive me if i do not follow the very interesting points he has raised in his powerful speech <e> <s> there are two main reasons why i do not attempt to do so the first is that i do not know nearly enough about the subject and the second is that of course the governments proposals for company law reform are not before us and we do not know what it is that the government will do <e> <s> i am sure that when their proposals come here we shall find there are many noble lords in this house who will be able to contribute to a serious debate on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the question of the neb i should like to raise one small point <e> <s> he said that the proposals were to restrict the powers of the national enterprise board <e> <s> that seems to me a little different from what is said in the gracious speech namely to restrict the activities of the neb <e> <s> i wonder whether there is any difference in meaning <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches may i also offer a warm welcome to the noble lord lord bellwin and congratulate him on his first appearance at the dispatch box <e> <s> the circumstances in which he has had to make the statement s give us all much cause for concern <e> <s> we must all hope that the further discussions that will take place this evening will lead or show the way towards a settlement <e> <s> i am sure that the parties to the dispute as well as the government will bear in mind that there are still three days between thursday and monday <e> <s> if unhappily an agreement cannot be reached tonight i hope that further efforts will still be made to avoid what would be a terrible inconvenience to half a million people indeed more than half a million people who are not connected in any way with the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first came to your lordships house we used to have quite frequent debates on the shipping industry many of them initiated by the noble lord lord winster whom older members of your lordships house may remember as being very keen on anything concerned with our merchant navy <e> <s> recently we have not had the opportunity to discuss these matters even though the position of our shipping industry is very much graver today than it was years ago and so we are all most grateful to the noble viscount for having both tabled the motion and introduced it to us with so full-ranging a speech <e> <s> i am also very grateful to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts for what he has said particularly regarding the international situation <e> <s> it makes it almost unnecessary for me to say anything about the report which is referred to in the motion before us <e>", "<cs> my lords the word crisis is perhaps one of the most overused words in our vocabulary but i feel that in the matter which has been raised for us by the noble lord lord strabolgi it is an appropriate one <e> <s> in fact i find myself differing only slightly from his motion in that i should have thought that what we face now is not so much the threat of a fuel crisis as the promise of a fuel crisis <e> <s> it is obviously uncertain at what point in history the crisis will be reached but i am sure that it is not far off <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing this bill this afternoon under some little difficulty as the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies mentioned on the business motion <e> <s> the bill came to us only a few hours ago and up to the time this debate started no <e>", "<cs> from these benches we support this amendment <e> <s> it may be true as the noble baroness has said that when these proposals were put forward they were put forward because there was compulsion in the act <e> <s> but once the proposals had been put forward everybody was looking ahead to their being implemented <e> <s> it seems to me that even if there were people who at that time might have preferred the proposals not to go forward there may be at this time those who are anxious to see them go forward <e> <s> i feel that it is desirable that there should be consultation before the elected council makes its decision to ensure and so to inform the secretary of state that there has been consultation and what the response to that consultation has been <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will perhaps be prepared to think again on this very important amendment <e>", "<cs> when the noble baroness asks us to vote against this clause she asks us to vote against the whole bill except the title and the fact that it does not apply to scotland and northern ireland <e> <s> when she does that she must blame herself if we seem to be having another second reading debate <e> <s> from these benches while we oppose the bill as i said at second reading we do not think it is in accordance with general practice in this house to reject a clause which would completely eliminate the bill which has been passed by the elected house <e> <s> that was the advice that we were constantly given by the labour government when they were in power <e> <s> they said that we should not reject something which had been passed by the other house <e> <s> we should amend but not reject <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge said i am only amending the bill <e> <s> however let us see what is left clause says <e>", "<cs> noble lords on my left think we can do so <e> <s> i think that we cannot and i shall advise my noble friends to abstain <e> <s> we shall not vote for the clause as we do not like it <e>", "<cs> i sympathise very much with the intention of the new clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one point to what i said earlier <e> <s> i would have been happier if the noble baroness had been prepared to withdraw the amendment but i should be inclined to support her for this reason <e> <s> i was a little concerned about what the noble baroness lady young said about it being the duty of the education authorities to distribute their resources in order to meet the needs of the aptitude and ability of the pupils <e> <s> i accept as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley points out that local education authorities are the authorities involved and that we should not interfere with them too much but i am a little worried about authorities whose very ethos suggests that those in the secondary modern schools are of lesser aptitude and ability and therefore do not need so much education <e> <s> this seems to me to be the dangerous aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i added my name to this amendment because i felt that it went a long way towards meeting the objections which were made by the noble baroness lady young to the amendment which was put down at the committee stage by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> as i understood it those objections were based on her feeling that as originally proposed the amendment was upsetting what she described as the delicate balance between the duties of the local education authority and central government <e> <s> it was my noble friend if i may call him so lord beaumont of whitley who suggested during the committee stage that the case might be met by a declaratory clause of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now a good many hours since the noble lord lord thorneycroft rose to invite us to debate this motion which as has already been remarked covers a very wide field <e> <s> in the interests of brevity i want to make only a few observations as a result of which your lordships may find my remarks a little disjointed but i hope i shall be forgiven for that <e> <s> i want to take up a point made by the noble lord lord vernon <e> <s> he is of course a supporter of the government but he very rightly said that he hoped that their policies would succeed <e> <s> i am not a supporter of the government but i also hope that their policies will succeed and i hope that many noble lords on this side of the house think the same way because whether we like it or not they are the government the responsibility is theirs and we must earnestly hope that they will succeed because the penalty of failure would be so serious for all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that in the earlier days i felt that mr <e> <s> prior was being much more what shall i say <e> <s> not flexible but at any rate agreeable to the trades unions but that he had become rather sterile <e> <s> the noble earl says that this is simply because the trade unions turned him down flat and i can understand that <e> <s> it is an annoying thing to happen <e> <s> at any rate the point i want to make in conclusion is that i believe that the secret of successful democracy is not forcing measures through with the aid of a majority in parliament but really trying before the measures are prepared to get as near a consensus as is possible even between two parties which take different views <e> <s> if the government felt that that was something they could move towards then i certainly hope that the labour party and i am fairly sure that the liberal party would be prepared to move also would be prepared to try to find a consensus on these things <e> <s> that has the added advantage that once you have your legislation if it is with a reasonable consensus then you have a reasonable hope that it will not be turned out next time there is a change of government <e>", "<cs> before we agree the schedule i should like the noble earl to give us some information about the significance of the word living in line <e> <s> the sentence runs as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to thank the noble viscount for explaining so clearly to us this small but important bill <e> <s> i think that any one of your lordships who has been following the fortunes or perhaps i should say the misfortunes of our shipping industry through recent years would not be surprised that the government have had to put some more money into the industry <e> <s> the noble viscount made the point that the bill does not add to the aid offered by the government <e> <s> i did not completely follow his point it does not add to the aid that the government said they were going to give but it does in fact add to the aid that would be available without the bill <e> <s> it is certainly no surprise that this is necessary but whether it will be enough to carry through british shipbuilders for two years remains to be seen <e> <s> i am no financial expert and clearly we in your lordships house cannot examine that matter in detail without having a great deal more information <e> <s> i will accept it from the government that they hope that it will do so and no doubt they have chosen the figure accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount would give way <e> <s> are we not getting a little confused over the tonnages which we are speaking about <e> <s> these large tankers are tonne deadweight carriers <e> <s> the target of is the gross registered tonnage which would be quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should also like to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> i was very glad to have it confirmed at the opening of the statement that it is the governments policy to encourage the increased involvement of employees in decisions affecting their interests <e> <s> in those conditions it seems to me to be a thousand pities to abolish this experiment before anything else has been put in its place <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount whether or not it would be possible to continue the present arrangements and the nomination of the directors until such time as appropriate and adequate arrangements can be agreed between the board and the trade unions <e>", "<cs> for my part my lords i should like to stick to the amendment if the noble earl does not object too much but perhaps he does <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for his motion <e> <s> we have heard two most interesting speeches from him and the noble lord lord brown <e> <s> i have to confess that both noble lords are very much closer to this problem than i am <e> <s> any suggestions that i can make will be only of a minor nature <e> <s> it is particularly disappointing to me that my noble friend baroness seear is unable to be present because as your lordships know she has taken a tremendous interest in this subject over the years <e> <s> i am also sorry that we are not having a contribution in this debate from the noble lord lord bowden <e> <s> i do not know how many of your lordships will remember the spendid maiden speech that he made on the occasion of the second reading of the industrial training bill in about <e> <s> i am sure he will not mind my saying this in his absence it was not an ideal maiden speech <e> <s> it had quite a bit of controversy in it and it lasted for minutes <e> <s> but it was a really spendid speech <e> <s> t recalled it and refreshed my memory by reading it again last night <e> <s> i recommend it to anybody who wants to read about that <e>", "<cs> to whom do the police have to justify the delay in notification <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the whole house is grateful to the noble baroness lady young for the manner in which she introduced this bill <e> <s> however i am afraid she will find that there is a good deal of opposition to it from many quarters including these benches <e> <s> the noble baroness will not be surprised to learn that we find some of the clauses quite unacceptable while there are others to which we can give only a rather qualified welcome <e> <s> before i outline our objections i want as one should do on a second reading debate to try to get down to the principle of the bill <e> <s> this i have found rather difficult to assess <e> <s> the noble baroness did not give us much idea of the guiding principle which led the government to introduce the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i will accept that but when people have had this for free for some time when they have to pay even if not the whole cost of it it is difficult to persuade them that somehow there has not been a cut <e> <s> anyway we shall no doubt have an opportunity to discuss that later <e> <s> there are many other proposals in the bill which we would wish to see altered and we shall no doubt discuss these in committee <e> <s> i hope on some of the main issues and for instance on school transport the combined efforts of the official opposition and my noble friends will gain support not only from the cross-benches but also from noble lords who ordinarily support the government and who might perhaps he persuaded to follow the example of some of their honourable friends in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the money that was going to be saved on that could be recovered by the simple means of withdrawing clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i for clarification ask the noble lord this <e> <s> when we speak about members of the european parliament do we mean only united kingdom members <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies may i be allowed to ask the noble lord lord jacques if he has the permission of the house to elucidate one point <e> <s> he and to some <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> but if it is to be funded from funds which parliament will later vote surely if parliament elected not to vote those funds the funds would be available for other purposes would they not <e>", "<cs> i agree with the right reverend prelate the bishop of derby that one may be attracted initially by the proposal put forward by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham but the fact is that it seeks merely to alter a name and does not alter the position in any way at all <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that we were adding prescription <e> <s> surely when one asks people to have regard to something one is not prescribing anything but merely reminding them of something they should do <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the view which has just been expressed by the noble viscount <e> <s> i think it would be very unfortunate not to have representation of the parish council if it can possibly be arranged <e>", "<cs> the minister said something about taking things away from the local authorities <e> <s> it is not clear how this amendment takes anything away from the local authorities <e>", "<cs> are we not making rather heavy weather of this <e> <s> i agree very much with the noble earl lord swinton who called attention to the cost of this proposal <e> <s> apart from that i was wondering who would write these brief biographies <e> <s> i suppose it would be the people themselves <e> <s> if they are as has been suggested party hacks i do not think they will write that in their biographies <e>", "<cs> we should like from these benches to support this amendment <e> <s> i am not sure that i have understood it correctly <e> <s> is amendment no <e> <s> an alternative amendment to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they seem to be covering the same ground <e> <s> i am not clear whether one is an alternative <e> <s> we are on amendment no <e> <s> but i think the noble baroness spoke to amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> if i may also speak to amendment no <e> <s> may i ask whether there is a misprint in the last line but one <e> <s> surely it means initial training for not less than five hours per year <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord clarify one point on sub-paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness lady young a question arising from what the noble lord lord hunt said <e> <s> i am not quite clear about the point at which somebody is deciding that a child should go to one of these schools with an assisted place <e> <s> the noble baroness said it was the receiving school that vetted whether he or she was fitted to go there but who starts the process <e> <s> presumably the child is at another school now <e> <s> is it the school which the child is attending at present which says to the secretary of state we have a very bright child here <e> <s> we think he or she ought to go through this scheme <e> <s> who makes the initial move <e>", "<cs> we on these benches entirely agree with the views expressed by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham in his splendid speech that this scheme is deplorable and we would wish to join with him and his colleagues in seeking to get clause removed from the bill <e> <s> before i come to the merits i would rather say the demerits of the clause i will as briefly as i can go back to the little dispute i have had with the noble baroness lady young about the financing of the scheme because some loose ends have been left which we should try to tie up <e>", "<cs> i am sure i did not say that <e> <s> i asked a rhetorical question what proportion of scholars would be found to have come out right at the top <e> <s> i think the proportion would be pretty small <e> <s> i said i did not know the answer <e>", "<cs> after the speech of the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden those of us who believe that this clause should be eliminated from the bill have very little left that we need say <e> <s> but i want to refer to one or two points <e> <s> i listened with great care to the noble baroness lady young and i want to mention some matters briefly <e> <s> when she introduced the second reading the noble baroness said that the bill did not radically change any of the main principles of the act <e> <s> i should have thought that the provision of free transport was very much a main principle of the act <e> <s> the noble lord lord butler made this point clear <e> <s> he put it in his usual very fair way when he said it was not an integral part of the settlement but it was a vital part <e> <s> i am not quite sure what the difference is but anyway it is clearly a basic principle of the act <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young has made a good point <e> <s> my reaction to that is let us remove the walking limits and pay for everybody <e> <s> the point has already been mentioned and it has been brought to my notice that the administrative costs of what is proposed in this clause are like to be very considerable <e> <s> i have had information from two counties both of which suggest very substantial increases in cost <e> <s> i am sure this has been taken into account by the noble baroness but i think it is a point that your lordships should bear in mind in voting on this issue <e>", "<cs> i am sure we shall return to this subject <e> <s> the noble baroness lady young asks me to give her some particulars <e> <s> i am not going to quote figures <e> <s> i have not got any figures and if i had them i should need to check them <e> <s> i have not had time to do that <e> <s> if she wants to know the two counties whose problems have been brought to my notice i will tell her that one is kent and the other is cumbria but i have no reason to suppose that they are unique in that respect <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord because of what he was saying extend it in his mind to local authorities having discretion to break a promise that had been given by the government <e>", "<cs> before i move this amendment is it in order to ask the government what they propose to do about clause <e>", "<cs> some of us share the fear of my noble friend lady seear that the act of turning a duty into a power will have a psychological effect on this movement <e> <s> would it not be possible to defeat that effect by leaving the position as it was namely by accepting this amendment and then postponing its operation which the secretary of state can do <e> <s> he can bring it into operation at any time he likes <e> <s> it would mean that at some time this will be a duty <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord bellwin before he replies explain further what he said about non-educational records not being the property of the local education authority <e> <s> the records are <e>", "<cs> i just want to say at this stage that the object of the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon is the same as the object of some amendments which are down in the name of my noble friend lady seear which we shall be moving later <e> <s> it is a little difficult to see how these two sets of amendments will work together and we do not want to cause trouble to the committee <e> <s> so far as i can see the only substantial difference between the intentions of the noble lord lord mishcon and of my noble friends is that he wants further education as well as primary and secondary education to have a right to cross borders but in each case provided that the originating authority agrees while we want to have border crossing whether the originating authority agrees or not <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the whole house will be grateful that the government have reached this decision not to try to overturn a decision that was reached in committee last week one that my noble friends and i feel much more correctly reflects opinion in the country than did the decision of another place when they sent the bill to us with clauses and included in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not find the ministers reply altogether satisfactory <e> <s> i think at committee stage he said the same thing about the minimum prescription but if i may say so there is no prescription in this clause <e> <s> it may be a useless clause but it is a clause to remind those who are appointing governing bodies of certain things that they should keep in mind <e> <s> of course there are many other things that one might remind them of but my noble friend thought that these three were very important and so do i i cannot see that any harm is done by reminding local authorities of this <e> <s> when the noble lord lord robbins said that any sensible appointing authority would already do this i fully agreed with him but the fact is that one finds schools where the appointing body has not done this and to give them that additional reminder seems to me to be worth doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the indications seem to be that the government will dig in their heels about this though i hope that they will not <e> <s> if that is what they intend to do is there any possibility of the noble lord or his colleagues saying that they will include some advice on these lines in a circular to local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house might i ask the noble lord whether he can answer the suggestion i made as to whether the point could be included in a circular <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all happy about the answer which the noble baroness has given <e> <s> there is one point in this amendment which has not been mentioned <e> <s> when the noble lord lord belstead was speaking to a similar amendment during the committee stage he said at one point and i could understand what he was getting at <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are as deeply opposed to the assisted places scheme as the other noble lords whom the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> i propose to take the view on this and the following amendments that we should accept the decision of the house to let this scheme go through just as the government have accepted the decision of the house about transport charges <e>", "<cs> my lords before the question is put may i ask the noble baroness to tell us what she has in mind as to how the scheme will work in these sort of circumstances <e> <s> suppose a school is chosen as the noble viscount lord eccles said because there is a very brilliant young mathematician and this is a school with very good mathematics teaching <e> <s> but suppose the head mathematics teacher who is the boss of the whole thing leaves that school <e> <s> it may be difficult to find an equally good teacher to take his place <e> <s> what then is the position in relation to the child who is at that school <e> <s> my second question is the reverse of that coin what happens to the pupil who has been sent to one of these schools and who half way through his course is found by the school not to be keeping up to the mark <e> <s> will he be removed from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the noble lord lord mishcon but i do not follow his logic at all <e> <s> i would understand it if he had said that the local education authority should have a veto on the child being chosen for a selected place <e> <s> but he did not suggest that and i do not think that we would have agreed with him had he done so <e> <s> when the local education authority has expressed disagreement with the fact that the secretary of state proposes and the childs parents agree that the child should accept an assisted place i see no logic in asking the selected school then to pay something <e> <s> that does not appear to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord vaizey whether he could tell us if the schools that he has in mind are teaching general subjects as well as music drama and dance or are they entirely specialist schools <e> <s> so far as dance is concerned of course children normally start learning dancing long before they have completed their normal formal education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i wish <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody knows it except me <e> <s> all i can say is that i do not know that acts of parliament ought to be drafted in shakespearian language <e> <s> the fact that this is taken from the act i can understand <e> <s> i came across a similar case once before when i found something

contemporary english in our acts of parliament <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am to take it that the speech of the noble earl covered england and wales as well as scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> i have listened to the reply from the government <e> <s> strangely enough my noble friend lord banks who has such great expertise in this matter had anticipated that we might be told that there were great administrative difficulties in giving effect to his suggestion <e> <s> he has studied the matter and he thinks that these administrative difficulties are not as great as they are made out to be <e> <s> in a little note he sent me he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not follow the logic of the noble lords argument <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may continue what i was saying and this is the first time that i have spoken on this amendment <e> <s> it is rather hard to say that we cannot speak after the noble lord has expressed the governments view as we do not know what the governments view is until we hear it <e> <s> on this occasion i merely wanted to say that i did not follow the logic of his argument <e> <s> in paragraph i it is provided that these particulars about the directors remuneration will be made known and then there follows a clause which says that they need not be made known if his work is principally abroad <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord lyell said that this had nothing to do with remuneration but is that not exactly the case <e>", "<cs> my lords at the second reading of this bill i ventured to describe it from the point of view of my noble friends on these benches as a deplorable bill <e> <s> now we come to say farewell to it it is less deplorable thanks to the decision of the committee to throw out the transport charges to which the noble baroness lady david has already referred <e> <s> the noble baroness in charge of the bill was

agree that the wording of the amendment is rather curious <e> <s> i suggest that it could be met by an amendment at the next stage to delete the words on the public so that it reads <e>", "<cs> i thought the minister gave an adequate reply and with respect to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal paragraph <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord mishcon would agree because it seems to me this would bridge the gap between the two views that you should add the words at the end of the subsection <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question on clause <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand subsection l a in particular <e> <s> i am wondering whether the noble lord who is in charge of the bill can explain what lies behind it <e> <s> this clause provides that if there is an application for

whether my recollection is at fault but i can remember that not so long ago there was a tragic accident somewhere in yorkshire in just such a case where a party of old age pensioners were being taken

on the face of it all that the order will do is to say the st january shall be the appointed day <e> <s> it will not say anything else <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord mishcon to help me again <e> <s> it seems to me that the way in which people will assess the value of these shares or whatever it is that are sold is a complicated matter but surely when buying shares in a company which owes million and buying shares in a company which does not the amount to be paid for the shares will take that into account will it not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is more confident than i am about inflation being caught <e> <s> i am not sure that i would not prefer to receive million in cash as a result of the difference in the price rather than get million paid over a period from the loan to the company <e>", "<cs> we can turn this into a discussion between the noble lord lord mishcon and myself but i think he has made my point <e> <s> if in fact the company has to repay the loan at once it will have to recover the cash and where would it recover the cash from except by selling the shares <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord bellwin can tell us what will happen to the staff of the national freight corporation who have been engaged in these research activities <e>", "<cs> as we cannot get any further on this at the moment can the noble lord give us an assurance or obtain an assurance before the next stage of the bill that in the interim period after the appointed day when the shares are vested in the minister but before he has disposed of them he will undertake not to dismantle the organisation that does research and development and indeed the organisation that looks after the industrial relations <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy not with the principles of nationalisation as the noble lord lord mishcon knows but for some provision by which the interest of the state could be in some way preserved simply because they have the responsibility of having built up through this organisation this very considerable business with as the noble lord said a large number of employees <e> <s> i think he gave the number but i do not remember what it was <e>", "<cs> it is not at all unusual i think when an ordinary companies act company to which the noble lord lord bellwin referred takes over another company that some guarantee is given as to the employment of the staff of the company <e> <s> i am just wondering whether there is any provision by which this can be safeguarded when the appointed day comes <e> <s> the difficulty as i see it and i speak entirely subject to correction because i do not know the intricacies of the law is that they will presumably be offered employment by a new company but as it is a new company they will have to start all over again their period of service before they are entitled to redundancy payments if they are put off <e> <s> is there some arrangement i have not <e>", "<cs> with great respect there is no question of selling something to the successor company <e> <s> the successor company is created and then shares in the successor company are offered for sale <e> <s> the object of lord mishcons amendment is simply that they are offered for sale as they stand as shares in the company and not as shares in subsidiaries held by the company <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord is looking at this matter again as he says he will will he pay particular attention to amendment a and the word of in the last line <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee but this is an area in which at one time i had considerable <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness responds i wonder whether she could help us when she speaks over one thing <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell read a statement made by the secretary of state in another place which certainly seemed to suggest that the government did not intend to introduce regulations right away but would wait and see how things developed <e> <s> the noble baroness rather gave me the impression that the government were quite ready to produce regulations and she gave an outline of certain things that would be included in them <e> <s> i suspect that there is a procedural difficulty in introducing the regulations before the bill is passed and i thought that the noble lord lord wells-pestell was perhaps asking for too much in asking for regulations now <e> <s> could the noble baroness tell us whether the government intend to introduce these regulations as soon as the bill becomes law <e>", "<cs> my lords before we give this bill a second reading there are two matters arising under it to which i think i should draw your lordships attention <e> <s> i shall be as brief as i can and in the course of my remarks i will seek to explain the instruction which stands in my name on the order paper <e> <s> in that case i shall be able with your lordships permission to move the instruction at the appropriate time formally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg formally to move the instruction standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords when i read this amendment i wondered what was meant by a national transport operation <e> <s> i understand from what the noble lord has said that this is distinguishing from an international transport operation <e> <s> but it is a rather curious phrase <e> <s> is it defined anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to an answer the noble lord gave in which he said that parliament could not be consulted until the council of ministers had reached a unanimous conclusion may i ask whether it would not be right for parliament to be consulted when the proposals of the european parliament committee are available and before the minister on behalf of our government either agrees or disagrees with them <e>", "<cs> probably i have not fully understood the clause <e> <s> the minister said that the option is available for people who are unable straight away to proceed with the purchase <e> <s> but is it not likely that people will say i am sorry but i cannot take up the purchase at once simply because there would be an enormous advantage in buying the house two years hence at a price which is now current <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of my noble friends also thank the noble lord for repeating this statement <e> <s> i think certainly it would be very rash of me with my small knowledge of these matters to comment on the terms which the government outline in this statement but i feel that it is of the utmost <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness can help me about one thing <e> <s> she spoke of her unwillingness and i understand this to commit the government to expenditure when they do not know whether they will be able to afford it when the time comes <e> <s> but is there not a great mass of expenditure already provided under social security on exactly those terms <e> <s> they are committed to that <e> <s> this is a very small <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> in the interesting figures he gave us he appeared to be assuming that it would be fair and reasonable that rent should increase along with inflation <e> <s> but is that right <e> <s> surely only a part of the rent is required by the landlord for current expenditure <e> <s> a large part of it is amortisation of his original capital and that does not have to go up with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has given an estimate of the saving may i ask whether that is a gross figure or whether it takes account of the taxation <e>", "<cs> this is an obvious improvement on the drafting because notices are served on people and not to people but through a misunderstanding in the previous amendment which i know we cannot go back on nowthe same trouble is going to arise <e> <s> perhaps on the previous amendment there is a word to which ought to be on <e> <s> if the noble lord will look at it later he will find that is correct <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not make myself clear and i am probably out of order but on amendment no <e> <s> we altered send to serve <e> <s> the passage read send to the tenant and obviously it ought to be serve on the tenant <e> <s> the to should be altered to on <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to ask two questions of the noble lord although i believe he may have answered one of them already in his statement which i shall read with care <e> <s> the first question i want to ask relates to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill has kindly allowed me to intervene for a few moments since i failed to catch the eye of the noble earl before he sat down in order to ask him one simple question and that is all that i now wish to do <e> <s> when he replies to the debate can he tell us whether the experiments that were carried out involved depressions as well as humps <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord misstated it by accident <e> <s> it is the hour after sunset and the hour before sunrise is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that from all parts of the house there will be a welcome for the intention behind these regulations and i thank the noble lord lord lyell for presenting them so clearly <e> <s> but i am bound to say that while i am very strongly in favour of what the government are trying to do i am not entirely happy about the way in which the regulations have been drafted <e> <s> i am sure that we are not going to seek to annul them but perhaps it will be in order for me to outline briefly some of my worries and the noble lord may have comments to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene merely because something which the noble lord said made me think that i must have expressed myself very badly <e> <s> he seemed to think that i was worried about there being discussions with employees <e> <s> i was worried about there not being discussions with employees <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should also like to thank the noble viscount for repeating this statement <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bruce of donington said it is rather difficult to make intelligent comments on it when one has had so little time to look at the report <e> <s> none of us can have been surprised at the difficulties which british shipbuilders have had in keeping within their cash limits <e> <s> this is one of the great difficulties about the cash limits system <e> <s> a figure is arranged i suppose before the beginning of the year and long before the year ends any figures that may have been forecast are bound to be wrong because of inflation and other matters of that kind quite apart from the special difficulty that arose over the steel strike <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble baroness for that reply though it does not take us quite so far as i had hoped it might <e> <s> may i ask her to say whether my information is correct namely that the parties concerned that is the union and the representatives of the employers agreed on terms some two and a half months ago and that those were within the governments pay limits <e> <s> if so why has it taken so long to get to the next stage of the discussions and why cannot the government accept what has been agreed within the pay limits without further discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider carefully in the course of these negotiations which we hope will reach a satisfactory conclusion very shortly that in no circumstances should the university teachers be put in a worse position than the teachers of higher and further education in the local government sector <e>", "<cs> since my noble friend lord avebury has added his name to this amendment i should like to say a few words from these benches <e> <s> everything in support of the amendment has been said and we all want to get on with the business <e> <s> my only disagreement with the noble lord lord davies of leek is that i myself would not think it a good idea to keep pigs on an allotment and i believe that the holders of neighbouring allotments also would not think it a good idea <e>", "<cs> i find myself in great agreement with what the noble lord lord underhill said but i was rather surprised that he broke off when he did <e> <s> it seems to me that the most essential one of all is section <e> <s> if there is to be effective co-operation between neighbouring fire brigades it is surely essential that there should be a common standard of training and of equipment <e> <s> if you do not do that there is a great danger that cooperation will not be effective <e> <s> i should have thought that there is a strong case for retaining the powers of the secretary of state to impose common standards of training and common standards of equipment <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord lord sandford can clarify one point <e> <s> he is anxious not to have the statutory code <e> <s> if the voluntary code is not complied with then the secretary of state can require it <e> <s> that seems indistinguishable from a statutory code <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord explain what happens if the circumstances arise that are described at the end of subsection <e> <s> once months have expired it will cease to be lawful for the maintenance agreement to be carried out <e> <s> what happens to the contractor who is under contract to do something <e> <s> no doubt he has purchased plant and engaged <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble viscount lord colville of culross this amendment no <e> <s> c in head ii reads <e>", "<cs> in reply to an amendment by my noble friend lord evans of claughton the noble lord said that the department were actively considering alternative methods <e> <s> would it not be better to defer this change until those discussions have gone further <e> <s> they might produce a system which could come in permanently rather than a system which will in any case have to be changed within a year or two <e>", "<cs> since we spent so much time on the education act can the noble lord tell us which particular section we are taking the power to delete <e>", "<cs> may i put one very small question <e> <s> i realise that england may be dealt with differently and separately from wales but is there any hidden implication in the wording at the beginning where the provision says <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government make these estimates for their own purposes would it not be right in this age of open government for such estimates to be made available to the public <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware i am sure that he is that if one is unhappy enough to live in a national park one has to obtain planning permission for the smallest alteration to a house <e> <s> people i know who wanted to put up a small porch on their door which was probably not going to cost as much as have had to pay to get planning permission <e>", "<cs> i am really astonished at what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i agree of course that there are some statutory undertakers which are public bodies <e> <s> there are also some statutory undertakers which as was said in <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the next amendment meets the point that i am trying to make <e> <s> in the circum <e>", "<cs> i have withdrawn my amendment as the committee knows but i do not think that this amendment covers the point i was trying to make although i am perfectly happy to support it <e> <s> i go back to my standard example that i know was of such great interest to noble lords opposite the felixstowe dock and railway company <e> <s> it is not ancillary it is wholly a statutory undertaker <e> <s> it is not a question of the statutory undertaking being an ancillary business it is the whole business of the felixstowe dock and railway company which is a private company <e> <s> i am really surprised that the noble earl has said that the government cannot take this out of the schedule <e> <s> i must discuss that later on and see what we can do at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i accept that the governments policy is to give the secretary of state the right and indeed the responsibility to decide that this or that piece of land ought to be disposed of and that it would be inappropriate to ask the lands tribunal to be a court of appeal so to speak on that but surely on the terms and conditions it would be reasonable to have some court of appeal <e> <s> right at the end of his remarks the noble earl said that market values would usually rate <e> <s> one difficulty about that is that it is extremely difficult to establish a market value for large pieces of land where in all probability there is only one probable purchaser <e>", "<cs> surely this is very difficult <e> <s> the disposal cannot be made without the consent of the secretary of state <e> <s> when he gives the consent that is the opportunity to find time to discuss the matter with the corporation <e> <s> i do not see how it can possibly be that he cannot have time to consult <e>", "<cs> before we divide i should like to say from these benches that i have listened carefully to this discussion and i am bound to say that i would advise my noble friends to follow the governments line on this occasion <e> <s> i consider that the argument put forward by the noble lord lord sandys is the stronger of the two arguments <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord comes to reply i wonder whether he could clear up one point <e> <s> subsection b of amendment no <e> <s> a says <e>", "<cs> i think the analogy with the new towns act is not appropriate <e> <s> when a new town is set up it does not take over something already being done <e> <s> i hope the minister might be able to say that when the order comes forward for the setting up of the udc that order will contain the necessary provisions to protect the interests of people losing their jobs thereby <e> <s> that would be the place to bring it in in the order introducing the udc <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee and it may be that i have ill advised myself but i do not understand at what stage we are going to discuss generally the principle of enterprise zones about which we on these benches have considerable reservations <e> <s> this clause assumes that we are agreed about enterprise zones but it only introduces the schedule which describes the machinery by which these zones are to be set up <e>", "<cs> may i intervene just for a moment because we on these benches are supporting this amendment with which we are associated <e> <s> the noble lord lord beswick said that he visualised this director having a sort of two-way traffic bringing to the board the views of the workforce and taking the views of the board to the workforce <e> <s> is there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said quite rightly that some countries are more fortunate than others in their sources of supplies for the production of energy so may i ask him whether we are not the most fortunate of all the european countries <e>", "<cs> if i may say just a few words before the noble earl speaks i should like to support what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth said <e> <s> it would be a pity to lose the bill but as the noble lord rightly pointed out for some reason the bill took about months to get to us here and i cannot feel that it is of very great importance <e> <s> this is a matter which has been in the experimental stage for years and i do not believe that many accidents will be avoided by this measure <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down i wonder whether he could explain a little further what he was saying about depressions <e> <s> he said that the highway authorities would not construct depressions until they had been tested and found to be satisfactory <e> <s> that is not what the bill says <e> <s> there is no provision in the bill that says they must be satisfactorily tested and if in fact nothing is going to be done until they have been satisfactorily tested and until there have been extensive consultations and regulations brought forward this would appear to be yet another reason why there is no great hurry to get the bill on to the statute hook <e> <s> they will not be ready to do anything for another six months by which time the bill could be properly amended <e>", "<cs> it helps a little <e>", "<cs> just for the record i think that the noble earl by mistake said that these regulations would be subject to the approval of both houses of parliament <e> <s> they are in fact negative resolutions <e>", "<cs> there is a complication here which the noble earl may have momentarily overlooked <e> <s> since subsection repeals section of the road traffic act that section can be repealed only when the whole act comes into force <e> <s> you cannot bring the act into force in pieces because at what stage is section of the road traffic act repealed <e> <s> it was stated earlier that while the regulations were being considered and consultation was going on section could still be operating and new experimental sites could be worked <e> <s> so it seems to me with great respect that the act must be brought into force at one time <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should also like to thank the noble lord for making this statement <e> <s> it would be difficult to the point of impossibility to speak intelligently about the decisions of the secretary of state without having studied the arguments which were placed before the civil aviation authority in the first place and the secretary of state on appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene for just a very few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to raise a question that has been going through my mind ever since i heard the opening speech of the noble lord in charge of the bill namely if as he says the government are completely committed to the interests of the new towns why does he object to the words which he wants to remove <e> <s> it seems to me that he has said almost in other <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble baroness lady david has said in moving this amendment but i feel some difficulty about this and it may be that when she comes to wind up she will be able to help me <e> <s> it seems to me that as the government have succeeded in carrying amendment no <e> <s> a it is very difficult to remove the power of the new towns to sell property if it is necessary for them to do so in order to meet a demand which regrettably parliament has now placed upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether there is a mistake in the second line of subsection which refers to a code of practice as to consultation of the relevant local authorities <e> <s> should it not be with <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to rely on the code of practice my lords <e> <s> there was only one point on which i was not sure being nothing like so well informed on these subjects as my noble friend lord evans of claughton and that was whether the street works authority was necessarily the local authority within the meaning of the consultation <e>", "<cs> i do indeed my lords and i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i think it can be assumed that the code of practice will cover relationships not only with local authorities but with other authorities possibly even with public utilities and the like <e> <s> i am sure the code of practice could be extended to cover this case and as my noble friend would no doubt be happy with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for what the minister said <e> <s> obviously it would be rather ridiculous if a local authority had a number of professional services at its disposal just across the way and a udc should then have to set up professional services of its own to deal with such matters as drainage inspection or anything of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord which it is their or there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble earl for his explanation <e> <s> i shall of course report back to my noble friend lord avebury who will also perhaps read it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord for that <e> <s> i shall of course read carefully what he has said and bring it to the notice of my noble friend and the merseyside county council <e> <s> if they feel that anything further should be done we will try to do it at third reading <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and before the noble lord sits down i should like to point out that it seems to me that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords before we decide whether this bill should be read a third time this afternoon i feel that the attention of the house should be called to what happened last week <e> <s> on wednesday of last week the bill was on the order paper for third reading on friday <e> <s> on thursday the day before it was due to be debated it was discovered that it had been postponed until today <e> <s> i say it was discovered because there was no discussion so far as i am aware with the noble lords who had been interested in the bill <e> <s> there was not even any advance intimation to noble lords who were interested <e> <s> i am quite sure that the noble earl lord kinnoull had no intention of being disrespectful to your lordships but i think that we are entitled to know why this change was made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the difficulty about voting on amendments is to have hanging over your head the knowledge that if you vote for an amendment you are voting to lose the bill <e> <s> i think that certainly influenced the noble lord lord underhill and possibly others of his noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to this discussion and i must say at once that i am unmoved <e> <s> a good deal of attention was given to the question of parliamentary time the noble lord lord auckland spoke about pressure of time and the noble earl lord avon of course implied the same thing when he spoke <e> <s> all i can say is that we hope i trust that everybody in your lordships house hopes that in the next session we are not going to have such pressure on parliamentary time as we have had this session <e> <s> therefore to provide for an occasional affirmative resolution does not seem to be an impossible thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to speak on that point so perhaps we should hear what the noble earl the deputy leader of the house has to say first <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a small point on the amend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy indeed to follow the noble lord lord zuckerman whose authority in these matters is recognised by us all <e> <s> i believe that everyone in this house will agree with the noble earl lord cathcart about the importance of maintaining full defence capability but the question is in what manner are we to do this what means are we to use to secure our defence <e> <s> i am no expert and i intend to speak only shortly i hope about the use of the nuclear deterrent in this context because as the noble lord lord zuckerman has so aptly said the nuclear deterrent strategic nuclear weapon cannot be a weapon of defence at all it can only be a weapon to threaten somebody as to what will happen if he does not pipe down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that the noble lord agrees with me because my answer was certainly no <e> <s> i hope that there are many other noble lords who would say no <e> <s> yet if we say <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friends who have a much greater knowledge of this industry than i have it falls to me to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> it seems to me that the statement envisages a major reorganisation of this important industry and i would suggest that it needs a full-scale debate in the near future of this proposal <e> <s> i hope that that debate might take place before the government have completed

should it be possible for motor-cars manufactured abroad to come here when they do not comply with our rules <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should also like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for his explanation of this bill in his usual clear way <e> <s> i confess that i am still considerably confused about part ii of the bill <e> <s> i hope that as the bill proceeds through the house i shall have a little more light thrown upon that subject <e> <s> as the noble lord said and as is obvious the bill deals with a number of quite separate matters of varying importance <e> <s> as there are a great many names on the list of speakers and we have other business to follow i do not propose to deal with all the matters and i shall only speak about some which seem to me to be of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will give way for a moment i do not think there is any such thing as the british ports authority in the bill <e> <s> there is however the associated british ports <e>", "<cs> may i from these benches say that we do not object to the principle of the railways board disposing on suitable terms of subsidiaries or interests in subsidiaries but i would feel much happier about this part of the bill if it was not for the introduction of first subsection which says that the board cannot do these things except with the consent of the <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord bellwin i should not have thought that this was an issue on which there was a great basic difference between the two sides of the committee

mentioned already in which they evidently do but there is nothing to prevent them having more than per cent <e> <s> i would of course agree that this is a matter for the board of british rail to decide but it might perhaps be a good idea to protect them from themselves by reminding them that if they get less than per cent <e> <s> they will find themselves locked in with no say whatever <e>",

abandoned effective control <e> <s> why should it be thought that it has effective control if it has disposed of more than per cent <e> <s> of the shareholding <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord threw something like a red herring across the trail by referring to outside bodies which are making advances to a company with a government guarantee <e> <s> but once british rail has disposed of more than per cent <e> <s> of its shareholding that subsidiary will not have a guarantee any more <e> <s> therefore why should it be part of the public sector <e>", "<cs> i feel about this amendment as i did about the previous amendment and lean towards the views that have been expressed by the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> i would lean more firmly towards the noble lords views if it was made quite clear that the decision to sell an asset or an investment was one made by the british railways board which would take into account all the things that have been mentioned <e> <s> the one point that i keep coming back to in my mind is this wretched clause which states that the secretary of state can instruct the british railways board to sell this that or the other and the terms on which such a sale is made <e> <s> if we could get rid of that then i would <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i be permitted to ask one more question of the noble lord lord bellwin <e>

board and not to any subsidiary and the board can already dispose of them because apparently it may have done so then how do they come into this bill at all <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this

begins <e>", "<cs> before we agree clause i should like to go back to the problem of how the proceeds of any sale get through to british rail and what they can do with them <e> <s> the minister put it very succinctly during his winding-up speech on second reading <e> <s> i will read his words if i may which are at column of <e>", "<cs> i support entirely what the noble lord lord underhill has said <e> <s> i think he has been very modest in asking only for the removal of paragraph <e>", "<cs> may i suggest a slightly different approach from that of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> would it not be possible to include in this clause something to the effect that if there is disagreement between the secretary of state and the board the matter should be the subject of an inquiry or the subject of arbitration some opportunity should then be provided for the matter to be discussed impartially if there is a disagreement between the board and the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i was rather shocked to hear the noble earls remarks on this issue <e> <s> i am no lawyer and the noble lord lord mishcon will correct me but i thought that if a company had a pension fund the employees of

course in a lot of other cases they are not supplied on anything like a monopoly basis particularly as regards storage <e> <s> there are many independent companies offering storage <e> <s> is it only the port authorities whose charges are to be subject to appeal <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw to your lordships attention a very small point on paragraph of schedule which appears on page of the bill and which states <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i think i am fairly happy with the schedule but this objection was brought to my notice by the british ports association who know much more about it than i do and they are not happy <e> <s> but i shall have to leave it there <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down would it be possible for him to explain to a layman what is meant by exceptional hardship <e>", "<cs> on the last remark that the noble and learned lord made i was given to understand the other day that a car knocked in a parking places does not come under the law at all because it is not on a public road <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord could help me on one point <e> <s> is it only that he is trespassing if he is on this persons property <e> <s> what would happen if for example the person had gone to his sons house or to his daughters house <e> <s> would not the constable also be trespassing if he went into that house <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies to that i should like to add one other point <e> <s> it seems to me that in the further consultations which the noble lord is going to have with the interests concerned it is important to bear in mind particularly if he is following the voluntary path that one reaches a stage where a large number of motor-cyclists have these facilities and use them and the more there are the more dangerous are the few who do not <e> <s> that is a point which should be borne in mind in these consultations <e>", "<cs> i strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like from these benches to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for repeating the statement <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord underhill in that i find it disappointing <e> <s> perhaps the most surprising aspect in the statement appeared quite early on when the secretary of state through the minister was telling us that he had had discussions with the management and unions and was having another meeting later today <e> <s> i would have thought that in those circumstances it would have been very helpful to us if we had had the statement after he had attended that meeting and seen how much progress had been made otherwise we do not know what the situation is <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill reminded us in the joint statement prepared previously the unions had committed themselves to help in bringing this development into operation <e> <s> i should have thought it is a great pity that we have to take a statement now <e>", "<cs> my lords to keep the record straight would the noble viscount agree that there were also a very large number of people from what is now the republic of ireland who were killed in the battle of the somme fighting on our side <e>", "<cs> my lords before we agree to this motion i wonder whether i may say this <e> <s> i listened with care through the second reading of this bill and it did not seem to me that the noble lord lord belstead who spoke for the government made out a case at all for the urgency of the bill <e> <s> that question was put by several speakers from this side of the house and i thought that when he came to wind up he would deal with that matter but unless my memory has failed me i do not think he did deal with it <e> <s> he certainly did not leave it in my mind that he had dealt with it <e> <s> it seems to me extremely important that this house should not pass a motion of this kind which of course the government of the day can carry through if they wish unless we are really satisfied that there is a reason for this urgency <e> <s> it was agreed on all sides of the house that this was a difficult bill and that it was a bill with considerable constitutional implications <e> <s> i must say that i do not myself remember whether at the time the bill was introduced there was any indication that it was going to be pushed through in this way <e> <s> i just wonder whether it is right for us to pass this bill without hearing from the government what is the real urgency for passing it in one day <e>", "<cs> towards the end of his speech the noble lord spoke about the scottish position and if i understood aright he said that the returning officer could refuse a nomination if the person was disqualified from standing <e> <s> that is begging the question is it not <e> <s> he cannot refuse a nomination because the person is disqualified from sitting <e> <s> the bill will require the returning officer to refuse a nomination because it is to disqualify the man from standing if he would be disqualified from sitting <e> <s> i think that that is the point that the noble lord lord underhill was <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said if a person was disqualified but disqualified from what <e> <s> is he disqualified from standing or from sitting <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support these amendments but before doing so may i humbly suggest to the noble lord lord underhill that he made a slip of the tongue <e> <s> he spoke about the powers of the railways board but i believe it is the duties of the board which we are concerned with <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that we shall really want to discuss the broad matter on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i wanted to ask one question <e> <s> he did say that the directions given by the minister would be subject to parliament but with respect that does not appear to be in the bill he merely gives the direction <e> <s> i admit of course that members of parliament can then ask the minister why he has done it but the directions are not subject to parliamentary control <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not particularly like doing it <e> <s> i appreciate it is part of the scheme which the government have thought out and as the bill has been given a second reading we must try and help it to work <e> <s> but i really feel that the power given to the secretary of state to interfere in these matters of detail not merely to tell the board what to do but to tell them how to do it to tell them to dispose of things even what price they are to get for them and so on really involves the minister in far too much interference <e> <s> the noble lord says and i cannot challenge it because i do not carry these things in my head that other nationalised industries have similar powers for the minister <e> <s> i know they do in some cases <e> <s> i would have thought that the party opposite were on the whole rather opposed to that and preferred to think of the nationalised industries as being run by a competent board of management and that provided they kept within the act which established them they should not be interfered with <e> <s> certainly there are always a great many complaints when ministers issue instructions to the nationalised industries to do this that or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords because of what the noble lord the minister has said i do not think that i want to make strictures of that sort <e> <s> the minister made a very sensible speech from his own point of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> he mentioned teignmouth and curiously enough i think that teignmouth is one of the ports which i am advised is concerned about the position i beg your lordships pardon it is not teignmouth but falmouth <e> <s> anyway i am very satisfied with what the minister has said <e> <s> the assurance that he has given will i hope because i cannot speak for them be acceptable to the british ports association <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will appreciate the object of the amendment <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill and his noble friends have certainly gone some way to meet the objection which i ventured to raise to the amendment they proposed before by confining this to ports where there was a monopoly in the provision of cargo handling <e> <s> i still think there is a substantial difference between this and the dues <e> <s> it was indeed very well explained by the noble lord the minister on the last occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister referred to my comments perhaps i should inform him that i am afraid he did not correctly understand what i was trying to get at which was no doubt my fault <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that no noble lord in any part of the house wants to drive a coach and horses through the drink and driving laws as was suggested by the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> i humbly suggest to the noble lord that he did not really take the point of my noble friend about public acceptance <e> <s> it is quite true that the noble lord was good enough to arrange a demonstration <e> <s> unfortunately i was <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord who moved this amendment could help me in one respect <e> <s> he spoke as though if you left out the driver you would be dealing only with the front seat passenger <e> <s> but the clause does not say any <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies to that from time to time we have been castigated for having drafted our amendments badly <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord can tell us what is the definition of local rounds <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the question of the maximum fine be left until the regulations are drafted <e>", "<cs> i should like to say from these benches after consulting my colleagues who are more directly concerned with this bill than i that i would merely recall that on the english bill we opposed this scheme <e> <s> we think it is a bad scheme and we shall certainly support the noble lord lord ross in voting that this clause do not stand part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether we are completely in order but if we are discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and together there is one point which i should like to put to the minister before he replies <e> <s> he mentioned in his anticipatory statement about no <e> <s> that it would put councils to a great deal of trouble to have to work out these detailed figures <e> <s> but surely they have to work out these detailed figures in order to fulfil their obligation not to charge more than the cost do they not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord for the very full reply lie has given <e> <s> i cannot say that i find it entirely satisfactory but there it is <e> <s> in the early part of his reply i think when answering the noble lord lord mottistone the noble lord said that of course he could not say what would happen in another place that it was up to them <e> <s> if we do not pass the amendment there is no possi <e>", "<cs> with great respect i do not think that the noble lord has got it right <e> <s> they can read what we say and it may affect their thinking but there is no means by which the other place can introduce into a bill which has already been through that place an amendment which they have not got <e>", "<cs> apart from that once again the noble lord gave us a very full explanation of the governments view <e> <s> part of it was similar to the letter which he wrote to me <e> <s> i invited the noble lord to tell us whether he understood that curious sentence which i read out when i moved the amendment and which i could not understand <e> <s> he read it out again but he did not make any comment upon that reference to the likelihood of a conflict of interest on the part of a ships agent employed by the port authority <e> <s> i do not know how it has got into the text it has nothing to do with what we are considering <e> <s> again i am afraid it suggests to me i have the greatest sympathy for the noble lord who is clearly having to speak on information given to him by another department that the point has not really been understood <e> <s> nevertheless i do not feel that this is a matter of such enormous importance that we should delay the house any longer or go to a division <e> <s> in all the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a few words from these benches in congratulating the noble lord lord bellwin and his colleagues for what they have done although i have not always agreed with it <e> <s> i am left with two worries on this bill <e> <s> one is clause <e> <s> we are told that there are plenty of precedents for the secretary of state having powers to override in this case the british railways board <e> <s> i feel that clause will only be a success to the extent that it is never used <e> <s> if it is used to any great extent or even only a few times we shall find it difficult to get the best people to serve on nationalised industry boards and if they are there we shall find it difficult to keep them there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord lord trefgarne one brief question <e> <s> he reaffirmed that there was no definition of a british national <e> <s> he appealed to imply that british nationality was something that was understood <e> <s> i do not understand how there can be anything called british nationality unless there are people who enjoy it <e> <s> however let us suppose that the noble lord lord geddes were to come back on third reading with the same amendment except that instead of saying in the last line <e>", "<cs> my lords when a situation such as this arises as has sometimes happened in the past is it not possible to consider moving a motion analogous to the motion which the noble lord the chairman of committees will shortly be moving on the private cumbria bill which will enable consideration of that bill to be carried on in the next session <e> <s> i have never understood why it is not possible to do that when a situation such as this arises at the tail-end of a session <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all of us in your lordships house will be grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for asking this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the two other noble lords who have commented on this order <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede i too have been advised that british shipowners are seriously concerned about the possible repercussions of this order <e> <s> as has already been pointed out it provides for the pilotage commission to made schemes under which payments may in certain circumstances be made by the commission to compensate pilots and their assistants for loss of employment or reduced earnings <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord lyell made clear the commission has no funds and no power to raise funds for this purpose so these schemes if they are to provide for payment will i presume have to provide for payment by somebody else <e> <s> the question is who should that somebody else be <e> <s> the right answer to that question seems to be different in each of the three sets of circumstances suggested in the order <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the noble lords reply to the noble lord lord brockway he said that he had been asked what we would do here <e> <s> surely the question of the noble baroness is what proposals we shall make to the assembly <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord has overlooked the last part of subsection <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree that this very awkward name should be got rid of but i have doubts about either of the other two names suggested <e> <s> as the noble lord lord reigate said the heritage is a comparatively new idea it certainly includes many things besides ancient monuments and historic buildings it includes pictures and things which belong to the state or are associated with the state <e> <s> i would have thought heritage is really too wide a term to use in the description of this body which is being set up <e>", "<cs> my lords when the aircraft and shipbuilding industry act was going through your lordships house a little over six years ago we on these benches opposed it <e> <s> we did so not because we had an ideological objection to nationalisation but because we believed that in a mixed economy which we are there should be a proper balance between the resources in the public and private sectors and we felt at that time that there was already too high a proportion in the public sector <e> <s> that being so we objected to the nationalisation of the shipbuilding industry <e>", "<cs> i should like warmly to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> as he rightly said in different parts of the committee we take different views as to how best to promote employee involvement in decision-making <e> <s> he used the phrase which has now become popular industrial democracy which as i think i have said in your lordships house before is a phrase which i do not like because i think it gives rise to a misunderstanding of what we are getting at <e>", "<cs> the noble lord suggests that this will in any case be done by british shipbuilders by virtue of the provisions of the companies act <e> <s> but british shipbuilders is not a companies act company is it <e>", "<cs> before we agree clause i have two questions i wanted to ask the noble lord the minister <e> <s> as this is a rather long clause perhaps it would be convenient if i mentioned the page and line references <e> <s> the first question relates to page lines <e> <s> your lordships will see a reference to activities that have fallen to be carried on under the ultimate control of the corporation <e> <s> i was wondering whether before the next stage of the bill the minister would care to consult with the draftsman because it seems to me that the words fallen to be carried on are not very apposite <e> <s> since under the bill british shipbuilders will have no duties to perform because those are all being eliminated it seems to me that the activities they carry on must be the result of positive decisions by the board acting within their powers <e> <s> can these really be said to fall to be undertaken <e> <s> the word fall suggests to me an inevitability that is not there <e> <s> i suggest that there must be another word which would be more appropriate <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down can he explain this point to me <e> <s> the amendment is proposing that the land has to be let in order to be included in the sale <e> <s> the bill says that the land must have been used by the tenant <e> <s> what is the position supposing that the tenant and two other householders have common use of a drive which is used by the tenant <e> <s> can that drive be part of the sale <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell the committee whether there is any precedent for an obligation placed on a corporate body being equally placed on all the employees of the corporate body <e>", "<cs> my lords in bringing the house back to the consideration of the shipbuilding bill i <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point may i ask him whether he is saying that this enormously important issue cannot be discussed in government time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer the question put by the noble lord lord ennals as to when the present agreement runs out <e> <s> the noble earl said that it would be renewed when it ran out <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i was wondering whether the minister could explain whether the use of the word full is meant to imply that a proper assessment should be made of the proportion of overheads such as rent rates salaries of the principals and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt a noble lord who knows so much more about the other place than i can ever hope to know but surely when the bill goes back to another place they can only consider the amendments we have made <e> <s> they cannot introduce any new developments <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he care to comment on one factor which has no political content at all in it and i think does not affect very much which way this amendment goes <e> <s> would it not be the fact without any of these arrangements that because the voting is on a council basis each with an equal vote the smaller councils could have a majority and require something to be paid and the one large council which i think there is in nearly all these metropolitan counties would have to pay even though it was opposed to it <e>", "<cs> my lords because i am in this position on the list of speakers some noble lords may think that i am speaking on behalf of my colleagues who usually sit on these benches but that is not the case <e> <s> as a matter of fact i have not had an opportunity of discussing the problem with them i only hope that the few observations i want to make will not be violently disagreed with by any of them or by my noble allies in front of me <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very interesting discussion on this bill <e> <s> it has lasted longer than i thought it would <e> <s> a great many important points have been made mostly points of detail <e> <s> i think that the best comment i can make on them is to say that each of them is a marker for discussion in committee or later and i shall not refer to any of the suggestions unless they come up against what i wish to say on the general issues raised by this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only two comments to make when we reach amendment no <e> <s> but i assume from what has been said by the minister that that will be moved in due course by him and we can deal with that matter when we come to it <e> <s> in that case on amendment no <e> <s> i want to thank the minister for having accepted the point to extend some of these provisions to cover people who are both pilots and otherwise employed as well <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood the argument of the minister he objects to the suggestion that there should be an automatic renewal <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord underhill would be prepared to modify the amendment to withdraw that proposal <e> <s> there would then be a period of one year with no obligation to renew <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very warmly to support the spirit behind the amendment of the noble lord lord strathcona but i am bound to say that i do not think it works <e> <s> the amendment begins with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i am not surprised that he has brought forward an amendment as he undertook to do <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord who has just spoken i was rather surprised that the noble lord lord mottistone put this forward <e> <s> after all of all the places in the united kingdom the house of lords is a place where we have an immense amount of expertise on all sorts of subjects and provided people declare an interest we welcome their taking part in discussions and bringing that expertise to bear <e>", "<cs> the noble lord tells me that he did not say that <e> <s> i thought he said that such a pilot was not to take part in the discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we should vote against the amendment but i am surprised and i wonder whether the noble lord when he winds up will give a little more explanation of what is in his mind <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i wanted to raise on this amendment arises on subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like also to express my firm approval for the amendment of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be able to support an amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> he is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords looking again at the wording the amendment seems to me to leave a rather ungrammatical sentence <e> <s> it leaves out three months and says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has put forward what is admittedly rather a compromise but it is a compromise which i should have thought was well justified <e> <s> i do not know the facts in detail but i have been given to understand that quite a considerable number of people who have district licences particularly in the river thames also have a deep sea licence of which they make use very seldom <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very warmly to support the amendment so clearly proposed by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the whole of clause has always puzzled me <e> <s> it appears to be offering on the one hand and taking away with the other <e> <s> i am reminded of a personal experience some years ago when i was visiting the post of odessa <e> <s> i was at that time interested in port management <e> <s> i was very kindly invited to tour the port <e> <s> it was a very hot day <e> <s> at the outset the interpreter asked whether i should like to travel by water or by land <e> <s> in view of the weather i said that i should like to go by water <e> <s> there was the briefest pause and the interpreter said we shall go by land <e> <s> quite clearly i had made the wrong choice <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should like to clarify one point in relation to the matter which we were discussing earlier <e> <s> it still appears to me that the offer in subsection allowing the pilots to express an opinion as to whether they should be directly employed or self-employed people offering their services is negated when it is then for the harbour authority to decide what it will do <e> <s> what is the point of giving the pilots that choice <e> <s> there is no provision for a poll to be taken among the pilots <e> <s> the matter is just on the table there is no provision that it should be accepted or considered <e> <s> let us suppose that they wanted to be self-employed and the harbour authority says that it wants to employ them under a contract of employment <e> <s> is that the end of the story <e> <s> what is the point of giving them the choice <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house if instead the pilots say that they wish to be directly employed would it be possible for the authority to say no it wants them to be self-employed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may make one comment on what the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased indeed to follow the noble lord lord layton because he has brought home with his great experience the effect of this increase in light dues on the trade of this country which to my mind is what really matters <e> <s> i have spent most of my working life with the shipping industry and i am sure that shipowners feel very bitterly about it because the costs come straight at them <e> <s> but it is really the effect on trade that is more important than the effect on the shipping industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to hold up the house for only a few minutes to discuss matters arising out of one proposition in the gracious speech that is <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first heard that the government were proposing to introduce a merchant shipping bill this session i hoped that it might provide an opportunity to give some real <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask one question to clarify my mind <e> <s> i find the clause difficult to follow <e> <s> under clause we see that among the persons who can be owners of british ships are <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble lord lord murray has just said <e> <s> we need to recognise the different responsibilities of the owner or manager on the one hand and the master on the other <e> <s> i do not go as far as the noble lord lord mottistone because the master has to carry a very heavy responsibility hours a day <e> <s> it is no good saying that it is all up to the owners <e>", "<cs> before we pass this motion i should like to say something about clause <e> <s> during second reading i said that i thought clause and the following two clauses needed careful consideration <e> <s> they have had it in the form of examining various details as we went through but to my mind the wording of this clause is quite inadequate <e> <s> perhaps inadequate is not the right word <e> <s> i shall come to the point <e>", "<cs> i think it would be a pity to let this eminently sensible suggestion go by simply because of the difficulties on definition <e> <s> surely that can be overcome in one way or another <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord underhill made a very good case here <e> <s> it seems rather unreasonable that a man is found not guilty by a court and then the employer is going to discipline him <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i do not quite understand how one can have regulations which apply only to regular services <e> <s> surely the regulations must apply to any passenger-carrying ro-ro vessel even if it comes here only once in its life <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove for the amendment <e> <s> i know that the minister has given considerable thought to the matter <e> <s> he wrote to me concerning it and i believe that a copy of the letter was sent to the noble lords sitting to my left <e> <s> i accept that there will be difficulties <e> <s> however i believe that taking such a ship to sea should be the offence rather than simply being in port <e> <s> ships in port may be under repair or as the noble lord lord carmichael has said doing other business that must be done in a port <e> <s> i shall listen carefully to what the minister has to say when he answers <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord underhill eventually answers this short debate i wonder whether he or the minister will help me on one matter which i raised in committee but to which i have received no reply <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to find myself in a minority of one but there is a great deal to be said for having some kind of overall figure after all the drafting might not be perfect <e> <s> i shall give an obvious example <e> <s> subsection a refers to the condition of the ships hull its machinery or its equipment <e> <s> does that include the absence of equipment that should be there <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might raise a small point on this rather long and complicated clause <e> <s> when i first read it i was rather defeated over how it is brought in within the long title of the bill <e> <s> there is a reference to the safety of shipping in the long title but then the secretary of states powers under this clause do not seem to be particularly related to the safety of shipping <e> <s> they may be related to environmental matters or all sorts of things of that kind i should have thought <e> <s> there is no reference to safety of shipping in the clause <e>", "<cs> i know that my noble friend did not intend to press the amendment and i am sure that he will read with interest what the minister has said <e> <s> he reserves his position to raise the matter again if necessary <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion i think i was in a minority of one in supporting the government over this matter <e> <s> i think that what is now produced as a suggestion is very sensible and i hope that the government will consider it favourably <e>", "<cs> it is suggested that the school caretaker has more caretaking than cleaning to do and that the cleaning should therefore be done by the contractors <e> <s> is it recognised that the school caretaker will have to be there because the cleaners will be unable to get into the school without the caretaker opening
