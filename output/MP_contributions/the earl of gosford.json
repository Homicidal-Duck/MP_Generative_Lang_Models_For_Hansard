company trespassed on public land in the dead of night with heavy plant in order to destroy the mural <e> <s> this mural had taken people two years to complete and the only people to be arrested were the artist and six local residents who ventured on to the site later in the day <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of correction if i may make one the plant did not come from the morgan site <e> <s> it came across public land because there is a ft <e> <s> drop on the other side of the morgan site <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to thank the noble baroness lady seear for giving us the chance to speak on this subject and secondly apologise to her for not having been here at the very beginning of her speech <e> <s> secondly i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord flowers on

made my maiden speech in an arts debate two or three years ago and i was very interested to hear of his involvement in these thorny matters <e> <s> interestingly enough more or less all the protagonists in that debate are here this evening <e> <s> i should also like to thank lord vaizey for asking this question and for extending it from his original question which was going to be restricted to the performing arts <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord the minister for that kind offer of writing to me and may i take up his offer of receiving a copy of the letter he sends to the noble lord lord vaizey <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that age concern have recently noted cases of suicide among elderly people of both sexes directly concerned with shoplifting offences <e> <s> is he further aware that many such cases occur when this kind of attention-seeking is involved at times of bereavement <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether the minister in another place is thinking in terms of this library continuing at the victoria and albert or going to another museum or being taken over by private enterprise <e> <s> we are talking in terms of half a million slides worth something like a quarter of a million pounds <e> <s> if the slide collection is going to another museum why sack eight people from the v and a and take on eight people at another museum <e> <s> if it goes to private enterprise and there is a charge to be made for taking slides out and the charge becomes too much and the company then fails can the ministry guarantee that this valuable asset will be kept and returned perhaps to the museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl lord cranbrook for giving your lordships house a chance to discuss this important subject <e> <s> i am grateful to him for covering the ground so scrupulously in his speech <e> <s> i must also say that i share the emphasis which the noble lord lord hale has expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in fact referring to the battersea area not lambeth <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl lord gowrie for answering that question <e> <s> i did not really make it clear but the question in fact was not on the morgan site <e> <s> however i am pleased that he has been able to answer that <e> <s> the question was on the report of from the department of employment concerning the and years in the future that lagging was going to be taken away from places like hospitals schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i

and amazement that the united kingdom should be contemplating the destruction of flaxmans house <e> <s> would not the minister press his right honourable friend in another place that a museum in flaxmans house would be a tribute and an example to others of an artist who through his work with wedgwood has provided income for this country and jobs for workers until the present day <e>", "<cs>

report of they have been aware that the act of is unable to cope with the increasing technology <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add very quickly that men and women and children are also difficult to replace and really there is quite an urgency to see that these old materials are now replaced by more modern methods <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for being so conscientious in answering that silent question <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that with such a disproportionate amount of the arts council budget going to large organisations it would be better for these large organisations to receive some kind of direct grant which would leave the arts council free to encourage regional arts associations to stimulate local authorities to look after small groups such as individual artists and small troupes in their own areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to say what proportion of the figures he gave went to visual artists <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like

is saying that as regards third readings of non-controversial bills in the house of lords the proceedings are usually brief i <e>", "<cs> my lords it was with that signing that the might and ways of the invader was unleashed on the goodwill and lands rich with resources of the aboriginal people <e> <s> why when that signing was done in the name of our crown in order to protect just those things <e> <s> while the indians could immediately and directly consult with their people on the spot our negotiators came with a prepared position had to write up reports later and send them overseas for confirmation <e> <s> all this is well documented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to make the point which f started my third reading speech describing <e>", "<cs> my lords on many occasions i have seen people reading from their notes and i shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what noble lords opposite have said and i quite understand their position <e> <s> we are shortly to have a long debate on pornography and there are many speakers down on the list <e> <s> but as i said at the beginning of this speech many indians have come to this country to petition us <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that this

to the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead for bringing this debate at last to the floor of this house <e> <s> i want to make only one or two remarks and to underline a few points some of which have already been submitted by the british copyright council and seek clarification on one or two items in the green paper <e> <s> i must declare an interest as a visual artist and also as the artists unions joint representative on the british copyright council <e> <s> the council brings together bodies and the number has increased by four since the noble lord lord willis spoke a few minutes ago representing the owners of copyrights under part i of the act that is to say authors and creators in the broader sense literary musical dramatic and visual as well as publishers <e> <s> in this respect i believe that the british copyright council is unique in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am pleased as i am sure the house is to learn that august is now the date set <e> <s> on the point of moral rights the noble lord quoted from the green paper which i have also read <e> <s> that needs more clarification <e> <s> if these things come into courts of law artists are going to need certain kinds of protection <e> <s> i am thinking also in the censorship field and fields where artists works are cut up and sold in <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful my lords <e> <s> on the question of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been asked by my noble friend lord jenkins to apologise for his being unable to be present this evening <e> <s> he would like me to give your lordships house one brief message <e> <s> he believes that the report is so admirable that he hopes that her majestys government will now give the money to carry out its recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my solidarity with the writers and briefly congratulate them on reaching this point <e> <s> i certainly have enjoyed books in the library and i hope that at some time as libraries are increasingly lending pictures to the public the writers may support us in the future too <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not put down my name to speak tonight but as a couple of speakers have dropped out i am tempted to tell in a very brief manner a very short story which is dear to my heart as an artist and a member of the artists union <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord rhodes for giving me this opportunity <e> <s> he said that he knows little of chinese matters but leading four delegations to china is certainly four times more than i have been to china <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting both the previous questioners may i ask her majestys government whether they really wish to see one of our greatest treasure-houses so run down that in fact its wares are not able to be sent to the provinces adequately <e> <s> secondly are her majestys government aware that tomorrow the v and a will be publishing a report which sir roy strong feels will make peoples hair stand on end <e>", "<cs> my lords i too apologise to the house for not putting my name down to speak <e> <s> i rise now to make a brief point simply because of the strength of the argument that i have heard tonight especially from the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i identify with the young girl jessica and it is on this one point that i should like to make an appeal to the noble lord lord elton this evening <e> <s> my family also broke up at about the same time as this childs family <e> <s> we must bear this in mind when a parent leaves a family a child is stunned by that event <e> <s> this childs father has already left <e> <s> now the child has to face the departure of her mother <e>"]
