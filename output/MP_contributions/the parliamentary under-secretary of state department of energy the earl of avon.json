have received representations on this from about local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been delayed by a number of things during the passage of this bill through the house but i thought today

has not been very political but i think that i have to withdraw my words <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord kirkhill for his opening remarks and for suggesting this debate today <e> <s> i was widely in agreement with the main thrust of his speech <e> <s> i have only one criticism of this debate and that is we have covered such wide ground that it is almost impossible for me to do justice to all the various topics that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my earlier reply on the amendment during the committee stage has failed to satisfy both the noble lords lord tanlaw and lord ezra <e> <s> in that reply i explained the main reason for exempting the cegb from clause <e> <s> it is that there is little point in asking the cegb to fix a purchase tariff which is unlikely to be used <e> <s> virtually every private generator will be dealing with an area board <e> <s> selling direct to the cegb would be a specific case and the terms would need to be individually negotiated and at one stage the noble lord lord ezra himself used the term centrally negotiated <e> <s> if i were to give an example i would refer to tidal power or something of that kind which would need a very specific and a negotiated settlement outside the tariffs that we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will know it is not the practice to discuss in detail our security arrangements and on reflection i hope he will agree that it would not be in the public interest to disclose the number of known members of the communist party who are non-industrial civil servants serving in the ministry of defence <e> <s> i can say that the number is very small <e> <s> while their political views are of course their own concern steps are taken to ensure that known communists or communist sympathisers serving in the ministry of defence do not have access to sensitive information <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered

lady burton for raising this matter tonight <e> <s> having listened to the various speeches i think that it is very timely that the government should put on record how they stand at the moment <e> <s>

financial targets for the gas and electricity supply industries are defined in terms of a return on net assets <e> <s> the targets naturally take account of all revenue expenditure including that of

might help if i set the question in the context of the present statutory requirements and the measures taken by the electricity supply industry to protect the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to

million cubic metres per day compared with million cubic metres per day in while oil production from the united kingdom continental shelf has increased in this time by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to open by saying that the motion which we have been debating today touches upon one of the major issues facing the united kingdom at the present time <e> <s> in fact i think having listened to the debate i could say that one speaker or another has touched on virtually every issue that faces our country today <e> <s> i believe that if there were any gaps the last speaker the

are no plans to replace the wessex helicopters <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the level of drug abuse among united states air force personnel is very substantially below the quite inaccurate figure which the noble lord cites <e> <s> the small number of people involved at raf greenham common were all in non-sensitive clerical posts and were in no way associated with the missiles themselves

<e>", "<cs> my lords the government consider that the national interest is best served if nationalised industries are run on sound economic and commercial lines <e> <s> it is not government policy to use profitable nationalised industries as a means of raising indirect taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords the eventual decline in oil production from the united kingdom continental shelf makes it more important than ever that all economic sources of energy in the united kingdom are exploited supplied and used as efficiently as possible <e> <s> in particular the government are seeking through their policies towards offshore oil development to maximise future economic production <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat in the form of a statement a reply now being

were directly employed offshore and onshore in the extraction of mineral oil and natural gas in the united kingdom <e> <s> indirect employment arising from north sea orders and expenditure is considerably greater but figures are not available for the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> however the industry department for scotland has estimated that a total of around jobs in scotland both offshore and onshore have arisen from north sea oil activity the figure for the country as a whole will obviously be considerably in excess of that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat in the form of a statement a reply now being given by my honourable friend the under-secretary of state for energy to a private notice question being asked in another place on the current coal mining dispute <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords my department spent about million on renewable energy research and development in and expects to spend about million in <e> <s> the renewable sources which offer the best prospects are wind energy geothermal energy and some aspects of biomass <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of national coal board pits closed since the

from april to march a total of pits closed an average of per year <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy made a statement in another place on th january concerning the united kingdoms participation in collaboration on fast reactors on a european basis <e> <s> a memorandum of understanding has been signed by five countries as an expression of government intent to establish long-term co-operation on fast reactor development <e> <s> it is envisaged that one or more commercial demonstration reactors will be built as part of the collaboration

will let me know <e> <s> the noble lord has moved amendment no <e> <s> and that is obviously the amendment to which we shall refer at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make it clear that so far as current proposed closures are concerned there will be no compulsory redundancies <e> <s> any miner wishing to continue working as a miner will be able to do so <e> <s> therefore typically in a

whole house in expressing gratitude to the noble lord lord ezra for initiating this debate <e> <s> i have it down in the margin here to say how succinct was his speech but the trouble is that as i am speaking last the noble lord lord winstanley has already taken that remark from my lips <e> <s> it certainly took us to the broad issues in a very brief space of time <e> <s> i find the problem in these debates is that we have talks on energy renewables talks on oil and talks on nuclear power talks on chp and talks on the diesel engine all of which i should very much like to take up as a whole

all at what the noble lord wants but i should like to explain the difference that we have with him and why we do not want to put this into the bill as he has stated it <e> <s> as the house is aware we

coal board have agreed to set up a company provisionally to be called ncb enterprises limited to support work in the coalfields in easing any problems that might be caused where men choose to accept

the ncb to plan its extraction of those reserves <e> <s> in doing so the board will obviously take into consideration all relevant factors including in particular the expected costs of production
