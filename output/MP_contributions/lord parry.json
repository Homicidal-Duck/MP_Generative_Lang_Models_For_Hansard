["<cs> i apologise to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my noble friend and i once shared the glories of responding to the loyal address <e> <s> i believe both of us express similar loyalty to national wellbeing this afternoon <e> <s> in this connection perhaps i might return to herman kahn <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be as grateful as i am to the noble <e>", "<cs> this afternoon and this

times by individual members of the committee at what is the incorrect constitutional point to make them <e> <s> it has been a frustration as a welshman to have heard other people talking and not to have had time to talk myself <e> <s> it has been a frustration as a teacher with years of service actually in the classroom at various levels both teaching children and teaching teachers <e> <s> it has been a frustration too as one who believes that it is essential to select bright children and to give them particular attention so there need not have been any contradiction in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept while making allowance for the addison rules that cardiff wales airport has spare capacity and would accept traffic as a result of any difficulties that might arise <e> <s> may i offer the government that information and the invitation to consider that airport when considering the report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i now offer a further invitation to the noble lord to travel with me to wales on the motorway or the british rail system which is the fastest and most effective in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us are grateful that the noble baroness is able to monitor the behaviour of british airways in respect of these matters and in view of the statement which was made since this house last dealt with a question on this issue is he prepared to tell us at this stage whether the government plan to make an early statement on the alternative uses of regional airports in view of the massive strain on public utilities such as the one raised in the question because of the pressures on heathrow and other airports <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness is about to sit down may i <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the real truth the fact that the original question was below the level of the intelligence of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extraordinarily grateful to the noble lords lord spens and lord abinger for allowing me to take precedence over them in this debate only in the matter of time and not in any other sense <e> <s> the reason will become clear in a moment <e> <s> i rise handicapped for an englishman to lose his voice is a trial for a welshman it is a tragedy <e> <s> it will not surprise noble lords that i intend to say something about the national airport of wales at cardiff but i see it in context <e> <s> the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> exactly my lords <e> <s> i do not wish to take anything away from the noble lord all credit is due <e> <s> i was about to say that since i am the chairman of the welsh tourist board and a member of the british tourist authority i must plead the addison rules because i speak for myself this evening and not for either of those bodies <e> <s> but the promotion of the airport committee in canada this week is supported by the british tourist authority and the welsh tourist board <e> <s> i shall myself be flying to north america for the british tourist authority tomorrow afternoon <e> <s> we all realise that an increase in traffic to cardiff wales airport raising it to its designed level of one million passengers would bring considerable benefits to tourism <e> <s> in fact cardiff wales airport could handle three million passengers a year without further investment in runways or aprons it would merely require modest spending on passenger-handling facilities and in extending car-parking spaces <e> <s> the assurances repeated and perhaps even strengthened by the noble lord lord trefgarne this <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs>

other speakers have done on the work which he modestly claims is making little more than a start <e> <s> i think that we believe it has done much more than that <e> <s> this report gives us the basis for some really hard thinking about an alternative economic development which is essential <e> <s> i put that in parenthesis at the beginning because there are some points i should like to isolate from the report as needing some further thought <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that there is a strange logic in assuming that young athletes who go to a country in order to compete in games alone give support to the rgime while selling guns to another country does not <e>", "<cs> the noble baronesss tone was so conciliatory at the beginning of her remarks that it seemed we were very close to having an agreement that was quite fundamental to the bill that follows <e> <s> her quotation from the secretary of state in another place seemed to me to strengthen the argument that has been put forward from these benches for a change in the status and the provision of a governing rather than a management body for primary schools <e> <s> a great deal of evidence in this behalf has been put forward by the national union of teachers which is the major union representing teachers in primary schools <e> <s> it seemed to me that we had reached a point where the introduction of a governing body at the primary school level would be wholly helpful to the minister whatever the party in government at the time <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> she is very forbearing and very kind <e> <s> may i make the point that the reorganisation of local government has brought about a severing a distancing of the control of local government by the people <e> <s> this is generally felt in the whole of the country <e> <s> will the noble baroness accept that she is not historically quite accurate when she tells us that this is the first time that this proposal is coming forward <e> <s> it is perfectly true that it is the first time that there has been a management structure in certain of the schools because they were grouped <e> <s> but prior to the reorganisation of local government and t do not mean the reorganisation in the most immediate past but that which occurred under the education act when i was myself in college there was a board school structure which provided an immediate and closely governed visitation to the local primary school to the point where the management actually went in every week to talk over matters of school attendance and day-to-day administration <e> <s> over the last or years under several acts of parliament local government has moved further away from the people and i am arguing for a closer relationship in one area where the minister has already admitted that it is vital <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stewart of fulham does not need me to defend him but surely it is recognised that in introducing this amendment he is not simply going in for semantics <e> <s> foundation governors are like foundation garments they exist to keep the shape of the body perhaps long after that shape has changed beyond recognition <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself immediately in support of the amendment as president of the spastic society in wales and the society for the mentally handicapped there <e> <s> i know of the concern of parents and indeed of the societies although i do not commit them to my views <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that it be understood that if the parent of the normal child and i use my words carefully has a contribution to make in the government of the school then a parent of a handicapped family handicapped by having special difficulties that arise out of the birth of handicapped children has a specific contribution to make <e> <s> i not only support this myself but urge my own front bench to give support to this amendment <e>", "<cs> as the amendment is being withdrawn may i be allowed to say that there is a real danger that the noble baroness the minister was arguing on both sides of the equation in support of her own position in this case since you cannot argue that you should not introduce legislation without discussing it with interested bodies and then introduce legislation that effectively excludes them <e> <s> you should also have discussions with them if they are to be excluded <e> <s> i think the minister will understand my concern when i say that there is a real worry among bodies interested in special schools that they might find themselves excluded from the educational provisions and put under a social service arrangement which has already been done with some aspects of the special education service at adult level <e> <s> if we can have some assurance at this stage that the government do not presage anything of that nature in their proposed legislation it will be helpful <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will accept that i was simply picking up her defence that she defended herself by saying that she could not introduce legislation without having had discussions <e>", "<cs> i thought the noble baroness was making the point that she had in fact had those discussions <e>", "<cs> the beauty of the amendment seems to me to be its appeal to the governments well advertised magnanimity in this debate <e> <s> they have the opportunity here to accept a view <e> <s> the most serious criticism of the amendment is that it is a statement of intent a direction rather than something which the government have thought to put in themselves <e> <s> there is an opportunity for the minister to accept this in view of the support that comes for the amendment from around the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin picked up a phrase of my noble friend as an example as he thought of tautology <e> <s> i was interested that it coincided more with ezra pounds version of logopoeia which was in fact a play on the meaning of words the shade of the context <e> <s> from the noble lord we expect far more than the use of a word we expect the context as well <e> <s> from the government we have the right to expect here far more than a play on words and the simple acceptance that the committee think that it is a good idea to have this amendment <e>", "<cs> to prevent the noble baroness having to speak twice could i make two points <e> <s> we are not talking about curriculum content at all <e> <s> curriculum content is a very different subject and one which will occupy us considerably in the course of this debate <e> <s> we arc talking about involvement within the community and the representation of the school a point which the noble baroness gladly accepted earlier this afternoon in respect of the primary schools <e> <s> having made that point it is essential that it should he pointed out that amendment no <e> <s> does not bear any relationship whatever to this amendment <e> <s> the amendment as stated deals with community orientation <e> <s> in making those two corrective points i do not want to lose the ministers sympathy <e> <s> i want to bind it tight with this amendment <e> <s> it would be a pity if in seeking to find a reason for what is quite clearly an intention she were to lose touch with the real feeling of the committee on all sides that we should make a statement within the act which will lead to a better representation on the community base of the school <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord eccles offered some while ago what seemed to be a perfectly acceptable solution <e> <s> the minister agrees with us and has said so and the only support she quotes in disagreement is from the noble lord lord bellwin who sits beside her <e> <s> the feeling of the house is totally with her and surely we should accept the former minister of educations suggestion that the government look at the wording <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene and i am encouraged only by the sudden reappearane among us of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls who promised us a great deal of attention on amendments nos <e> <s> and before he disappeared so perhaps noble lords will forgive me if i say that it might be helpful to the committee in its present mood of family interest in what is after all a family subject namely education whatever our backgrounds to note that my noble friend lord heycock is a man who has put a lifetime into the service of education in wales and is greatly honoured among my countrymen for the service he has rendered <e> <s> when he speaks he speaks on <e>", "<cs> to ask a question of the noble lord lord james of rusholme even through the front bench of the opposite side of the committee is a little like treading on the feet of gamaliel instead of sitting at them <e> <s> nevertheless i think it important to ask him whether he believes that his view of the lack of importance of the governing body in the context of a school such as manchester grammar school is in fact the governments view in putting forward this legislation <e> <s> i get the impression that the government believe the governing bodies of schools to be vastly more important than the noble lord lord james does <e> <s> one can understand the attitude of a successful headmaster of a great school being slightly patronising towards his governing body but that surely is not the mood of a government putting forward legislation <e>", "<cs> i withdraw the word <e>", "<cs> i would wish to associate myself enthusiastically and entirely uncharacteristically formally <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> she is very kind <e> <s> in fact what she says is not the case <e> <s> the argument that is being put is that they should be treated exactly alike <e> <s> if the noble baroness is saying that there should not be a handicapped person on the governing body of an ordinary school then she has a point <e> <s> but what we are saying is that as the fit and the healthy are put on the governing bodies of schools attended by the fit and the healthy so it is correct that someone with knowledge of not being fit and healthy should be on the governing body of the school for such children <e>", "<cs> i thought it was greek logic <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that my noble friend is about to withdraw his amendment it is occasionally nice to point out that there is not a monolithic structure on this side of the committee either <e> <s> i believe that the committee feels that if it could get the size of schools down to as a maximum and as a positive effective step then perhaps some of the problems of government of the schools might resolve themselves <e>", "<cs> the noble lord on the front bench made a valuable qualification towards the end of his speech much of which i totally agree with <e> <s> it goes without <e>", "<cs> would the minister not agree that the theme running through our discussions yesterday emphasised the fact that local government has moved so much further away from the people in great britain that handholding exercises become necessary from time to time <e> <s> i do not believe that any of us are confident that the new system of local government is close enough to the people to give the type of detailed knowledge that the amendment suggests to the far away men in far away places who control the destinies of the schools <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord simon illustrates beautifully the nature of the dilemma facing the government <e> <s> it used to be the case that a biographical note was not necessary because the candidate was knownhe was met in the street by those electing him to office <e> <s> we now have an attenuated system of local government which forces on us the very complexities which noble lords are now considering <e> <s> it seems to me vital that the children of our schools should be entrusted with governing bodies comprised of people whose identity is clearly known and in the system we now have that is not the case <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord who has just spoken was absent from the chamber when from the front bench my noble friend lord stewart of fulham made what was an excellent speech in which he made perfectly clear that it was understood that selective processes are not at issue <e> <s> it is quite clear that age aptitude and ability arc matters which will govern the distribution of pupils throughout schools <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to make absolutely certain and i thought that was the governments intention until a few moments ago that in doing that we provide a machinery within each district which will see that the children in that area have access to education according to their age aptitude and ability <e>", "<cs> shy introverted and reticent though we are as a people it would be wrong if i did not on behalf of my colleagues who will join with me without committing the others accept the invitation and hope that we have more across-the-floor exchanges <e>", "<cs> the point should be made and i think it is very important <e> <s> a distinguished educational figure the noble viscount who has just spoken has drawn attention to it but from the wrong side of the argument <e> <s> teachers are deeply concerned and have been for a very long time under successive ministers that their role in teaching is one which has been diminished rather than strengthened <e> <s> they have argued for a long time that parity of esteem among schools is essential <e> <s> under various governments and ministers every single piece of reporting on the education process we are speaking here about education not about the mechanics that has been published has had one central point of agreement that the biggest single factor influencing the education of a child is the attitude of the parent to the school in which that child is taught <e>", "<cs> if i may ask one factual question the situation may have changed since my day does capitation allowance have anything to do with the building in which it is allocated <e>", "<cs> that is as understood it and therefore it would not be confusing to a parent to know the capitation allowance because the site of the school was spread out as the minister indicated <e>", "<cs> nothing in itself is good or had but there is no more abominable word in the english language than the word but used as it was constantly by the last speaker throughout his speech <e> <s> to interpose that preposition after the careful preparation of his case as though he were accepting exactly what the noble baronesses were saying and what lord vaizey had put before the committee and then to come in with the but and at the same time to seek to convince himself before the committee because it was very evident that he was seeking for arguments to support a contention is unworthy of him and of his record in education <e>", "<cs> would the minister agree that the significant difference here which hinges on all the points made by earlier speakers is the size of the funding involved and the transfer at this particular time of a capital sum which i have seen estimated at between million and million in total in addition to the sum of million or so which is at present spent on the funding of places in the system <e> <s> that amount of money transferred at a time when there are cuts taking place in the public sector would o affect the disposition of places in the <e>", "<cs> it is fair to say that i put the last part of my question badly if the minister misunderstood it to that extent <e> <s> what i was saying was that if there is a significant change in the distribution of funds and if one is enriched at the expense of the other even though they have for a long time existed side by side then the ability of a sixth form in a school which has been able to compete in the past might be adversely affected in the future <e>", "<cs> if the students were of high ability which is the aim of the legislation they would then be enriching the sixth form of the school at the expense of the school in the area from which they were recruited <e> <s> there is enrichment in human ability as well as in finance <e>", "<cs> i accept that the noble baroness has taken my point of the million and has come hack to agreement with me <e>", "<cs> i never thought that <e>", "<cs> we can take the noble lord to many schools in the country where children of infant and primary school age are being taught in three classes in one school dining room for part of the morning because the table has yet to come <e> <s> there should be no need of simplistic questions as to whether we believe that the bright children should be aided to reach their full potential <e> <s> this is surely below the level of the debate <e>", "<cs> what we are talking about here is the transfer of resources <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister a question because when i asked a factual question earlier it turned out to be the right question and i finally got the right answer <e> <s> is it true that in the local authorities spent a sum of some million on buying places anyway in grant aided schools <e> <s> is the sum of money we are now talking about million in addition to that million <e>", "<cs> nor do i what i said was that an earlier intervention which implied that we were not concerned with the education of bright children was below the standard of debate <e> <s> i was not referring to any point made by lord james <e>", "<cs> since the noble viscount lord simon has been interrupted i should like to ask him whether he would not agree or to ask the noble baroness lady young whether she would not agree that one substantial difference between the conurbations and the rural areas is that though the service may be expensive it exists <e> <s> in many rural areas there is no alternative to get a child to school <e>", "<cs> the minister has been interrupted and one appreciates the fact that over supper she has had to adjust to the result of the division <e> <s> i have in my hand a letter which i received from a nursery school organization <e>", "<cs> very well i shall seek to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords just as everybody who goes to church is not expected to be a christian i would point out that everybody who goes to school is not a scholar nor is everybody who goes to school necessarily able to contribute to an important extent at a different level <e> <s> it is clear that there are people with special knowledge of educational matters who have a special contribution to make and who should be recruited in a particular area <e> <s> although the original provisions in the bill do not specifically exclude them i believe that it is thought helpful in this amendment specifically to include them <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships have debated many education bills more often than i have done so <e> <s> but in every education debate in which i have taken part since becoming a member of your lordships house someone from either side of the house has made the point strongly and i must say that noble lords who are now on the opposite side of the house have made the point most strongly of all that one of the weaknesses of the british education system is that it appears to be geared to the detriment of industry and the manufacturing side of our industry <e> <s> we have had long debates in this house in which many noble lords have urged that point <e> <s> it seems to me that they are now in a position to prove that they mean it <e> <s> without giving way to any great degree on the philosophy of the bill contained in this little clause to which there is tabled this amendment they can now show that this government todays government recognise that it is essential that in a period when our basic industry is in decline and i have made that point before there would be on the governing body of each of our schools someone who is able to contribute something by way of informing the school and helping the school to develop a direction towards interesting its pupils and its staff in industry <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case by leave of the house although i do not believe that i have spoken twice it seems to me that the powerful case made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is unanswerable in this particular context <e> <s> but it also presupposes two other things <e> <s> in the first place it presupposes that someone who is inarticulate and therefore unable to present a case would also find the access to a lawyer formidable and difficult <e> <s> for example many of us find the noble and learned lords who are lawyers formidable though not difficult <e> <s> in this context could it also he possible for someone to be represented by a friend at such an appeal only to find that the authority is represented by a qc <e> <s> as has been the case in certain tribunals that have taken place in other contexts quite often an authority not an educational <e>", "<cs> my lords the case has been well put <e> <s> there is no need for me to elaborate except to set into the context of the discussion the particular situation of the welsh language nursery school classes which are seen to be such an important part of the education set-up in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords before that happens and before the minister sits down would he not accept from me the suggestion that the written analyses to the county development plans have been basic to development both in education <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier in the debate i made the point that it ought to be unnecessary at any stage for anyone on either side of the house to assume that his side of the house had a prerogative in wanting to see the education system work and in wanting to see the children of this country have an even brighter future <e> <s> it is surely unnecessary to introduce that remark or invitation at this stage <e> <s> a report stage is always difficult because it leads people to make second reading speeches about matters which are really concerned with the clauses to be inserted <e> <s> as regards this clause that gives me an opportunity to ask the noble baroness lady young whether she is now able to answer in the context of this clause the question that i put to her on the redistribution of the amount of money available for the provision of education in this country from the public to the private or semi-private sector and whether she can tell me if the million of which we have spoken or indeed the million for the one year of which we have spoken is in addition to the million-plus already being devoted from the public purse to the support of private education <e>", "<cs> my lords during the second reading debate the noble baroness promised that she would give me an answer to the specific question which i have again asked today <e> <s> yet again she seems not to have answered it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the house will forgive me for reminding the noble baroness of the specific question i asked <e> <s> it was whether the overall cost however assessed as has been said the assessment has varied but the most constant figure is million or if you like the related cost of million in the first year of operation is additional to the sum of money which both she and i know is at present rightly and properly spent within the constitution on assisted places <e>", "<cs> my lords as a current member of the council of the open university and having only this morning attended their meeting in london i would wish to support this amendment and add a few words <e> <s> the council itself and the whole structure of the open university are conscious of the need to conduct their own affairs according to the stringent financial conditions of our time <e> <s> they are treating this very soberly and making their own internal adjustments <e> <s> there will be pressure on recruitment on student courses and on graduates within the university <e> <s> i support the amendment because it is essential that the spirit of the open university should be kept up <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept that my welsh border collie instructed me this morning that he is more interested in the tree replanting bill which is to follow than in the question which has just been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the real point that the more dangerous the world situation politically the more essential it is that this country should <e>", "<cs> i was speaking to all of them <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that helpful and forthcoming response and subject to the agreement of my co-sponsors and the committee i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not agree that of the many dangers threatening democracy probably the worst would be a disillusioned teaching profession <e> <s> does she accept that even with the incidental increments that teachers might receive and after arbitration the salaries in general will be modest enough <e> <s> in comparison with salaries paid elsewhere they would probably be less than a just reward for the work that is done by the best of our teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that there is con <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has been so forthcoming will he further agree that there is an honourable point in this that the british fishing industry has always honourably observed the regulations <e> <s> will he agree that it cannot be proved that that has always been the case in regard to other countries <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies could she assure us that there will not be competition with existing large charity organisations which fund such activities as those of the spastics society and other bodies and that we shall not see competition on a fairly grand scale for such funds as might be available <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord is about to sit down despite the fact that his full reply was very full may i remind him that he did not give an assurance that the government had considered the efforts of major fund-raising sources which are already making contributions to the health service <e> <s> i am sure that the reply he has given has assured my noble friend lord wallace that his fate will not become a fate worse than death <e> <s> i should appreciate an answer to my question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is as sensitive to this occasion as one earlier speaker was insensitive <e> <s> there is no need for him to apologise to the committee of this house for speaking in the way he did at this moment because there is a sense in which we are talking not about welsh affairs but <e>", "<cs> the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> since the noble earl has been interrupted perhaps i may make a point <e> <s> will he accept that the general advisory council of the independent broadcasting authority at national level in the case of the individual nations within britain and at british level in the case of the general advisory council does not simply monitor complaints but sees programmes in advance quarter by quarter and is able to keep a running check on what goes on <e> <s> it also has debates continually with production staff and generally monitors the progress of the programmes <e>", "<cs> that is a different point a <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone is far too optimistic nothing is ever so bad that the ingenuity of man cannot make it worse <e> <s> the question that i should like to ask and it really is a question and i have given the noble lord the minister the opportunity to see a letter that i have received arises from a council that is concerned that there is a retrospective element that is punitive and it is also concerned that arrangements might have been arrived at that are now to its detriment <e> <s> it asked me to ask whether it is true that four concessions have been <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord at the same time as he is writing to the others also write to me <e> <s> perhaps he would include in that letter the answer to my earlier question which under the pressure he forgot to answer <e> <s> he is <e>", "<cs> i had intended to speak to a later clause but as there is a general debate and as regional airports have been specifically mentioned i now intend to ask your lordships committee to hear the submissions that i should like to make <e> <s> it is necessary to cite the addison rules <e> <s> the committee will know that i am <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the emphasis on semantics and the small <e>", "<cs> my lords this house occasionally breaks through the traditional lines on which it is drawn and it often compliments itself on doing that <e> <s> it would seem to me that the modesty of this amendment would have provided an occasion when it might have done so <e> <s> it is always difficult to take up an argument when the protagonists against it are in fact so distinguished and when their record is one which is so much to be admired <e> <s> nevertheless i think that it is important that we should not only examine the last years that we should not simply take into account the arguments that have been so well put about the failing influence of the old imperial structures but that at this point in our discussions we should also take into account the fact that institutions which informed educated and even entertained within great britain itself have gone into decline <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord also accept that that is true of the churches themselves my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept that her argument is tenable only if there is also a will to increase the housing stock <e> <s> if she is putting the view that it unites the nation to allow people to own their own houses within a council housing estate that presupposes that one has to go on and create more houses in order that people who are denied the opportunity of enjoying a council house are also included in the unifying process <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reassuring nature of the noble baronesss last reply will she accept that for many people the complicated issues of humanity in a geographically-orientated world are not as important these days as the kind of human teaching that begins at home <e> <s> will the noble baroness not accept that in our multi-national society development education begins not only at the primary level but also in the immediate locality of the school <e> <s> is not the noble baroness as concerned as are some of us in the in-service teaching field that the cut-back in curriculum study in locally-based teacher centres is having an adverse effect regarding the knowledge and importance of a broadly-based curriculum within the educational service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that despite all the advice on the curriculum and all the curriculum study carried out in schools and colleges a great many teachers are concerned about those alienated products of our schools the children for whom the curriculum has little meaning and who roam the streets of our cities and towns as truants in the first place and as malcontents later <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not accept that while democracy is vested in the law the ultimate sanction is with the voter in the area and if this propaganda was issued prior to an election and the voters voted for the party which issued it then it would seem to carry the sanction of democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is required that i apologise to the house because my name was not included on the list of speakers <e> <s> i had intended to speak in this debate and i take the opportunity now with permission of the house <e> <s> in a sense the noble baroness who did us the favour of introducing this debate illustrated one of the problems of this comfortable place <e> <s> in speaking she to pick up the theme of the noble lord lord soper lacked the means of communication in the early stages of her introduction of the debate <e> <s> she found difficulties in communication she found the vocabulary but not the means for a while of expressing as clearly she would have wished those things that she felt <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that some of us draw from these figures the conclusion that considerable savings in lives and injuries have been made since the introduction of compulsory seat belt wearing elsewhere and that the time must come when some government in great britain must grasp the nettle of the introduction of the compulsory wearing of seat belts in order to achieve similar savings in this country <e>", "<cs> whether or not we speak to a false prospectus whether or not we deal in half truths whether or not we seek to mislead this house in the opinion of some noble lords it should surely be understood

to two fears which are held in education about this particular section <e> <s> it is clear that if the noble lord the minister has not yet made up his mind and if his principal has not yet made up his mind about who will have access to the information contained in records the committee should be aware that a major change has taken place in our accounting system in education and that change is absolutely relevant to the discussions of the committee at this stage <e>", "<cs> i must apologise because i should have made it clear to your lordships committee that i understand that this falls within the area of special educational needs <e> <s> it is an area of particular interest to me and an area in which i myself serve and therefore my intervention came in that context <e>", "<cs>

increasingly augmented by a recording and assessment system it is absolutely vital that we should not introduce doubt into the minds of your <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister admit that the welsh deep sea fishing industry was a classic example in that it was a classic case of over-fishing by foreign rivals with lower net mesh sizes which cleared the hake away from the traditional welsh fishing grounds and led to the demise of the industry there <e>", "<cs> my lords is anyone prepared to accept applications for the noble lords kidneys <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord admit on the question of time that in this house time is <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe the noble lord lord kilmarnock and the house an apology which i have already made to my own front bench leaders and the noble

that apology my thanks to the noble lord lord kilmarnock and my congratulations to the noble viscount lord chandos <e> <s> it is a great delight to hear a young voice speaking authoritatively in this chamber of the older members of parliament and although it might be a surprise to find him sitting where he does it is a delight to hear him speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily accept that

time to develop it is not that we move into a hedonist leisure-enjoined society but that service as it always has been becomes recognised as a tool and service by the human individual is probably the

alternative entrance to and egress from the principality still consider the severn bridge to be a splendid highway and that visitors and commerce entering by that bridge are welcomed by the people of wales all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that many of us on these benches have followed his convoluted calculations with admiration and amusement and would he now admit that if he took away the number he first thought of it might substan-tially alter the result <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that important though my noble friends question was it is slightly more important that visitors travelling to areas of the country are able to find their way in than that prisoners should be tantalised by signs pointing the way out <e> <s> would he not accept in fact that one of our basic growth industries is suffering very badly from the confusion of short and long term directional signs and that it is a frustration to those who are entrepreneurs in the tourism business <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that germane to this question is the fact that it is the greater responsibility of the government to settle the basic issues underlying and causing this vicious and divisive strike <e> <s> rather than to be looking for vindictive legislation further to aggravate it <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord say dynamite <e>",

tonight in this chamber people who firmly believe that they have been expressing themselves in a way that is helpful to the debate and not realising that in fact the same speeches have been made on the opposite side of the issue in slightly more strident tones <e>", "<cs> my lords may i perhaps be helpful and draw the ministers attention to the milford haven conservancy board act and the provision it contains whereby the designating authority is also the statutory authority having responsibility for clearing up spillages of any obnoxious substances most likely in the milford haven

compulsion to insure by a likely polluter <e> <s> would not someone having to bear a heavy premium in respect of insurance make certain that his undertaking was much more carefully run than he might otherwise do <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount has given way perhaps he would not mind sitting down for a moment longer while i ask him this question <e> <s> how many bombs fell on napton on the day he was on duty <e>", "<cs> my lords were any other bombs falling on britain on that day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am here now <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble minister have a mind to mention the celtic sea under the general heading of this question <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord also include the welsh and the fishing industry there <e>", "<cs> my lords regardless of politics and

noble lords speaking from their own expertise <e> <s> they have totally underestimated and under-stated the revolution that is already taking place and the reconstruction that is already happening in

understanding of the importance of this subject than perhaps any other body <e> <s> he has been chairman of that campaign which has focused attention on waste disposal matters and he knows a very great deal about the subject <e> <s> surely the point he was making was not a matter of the technology of this debate but that we here could consolidate the very real progress that has been made among all the bodies concerned with cleaning <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept from me that the hope of higher education for their children remains possibly the main hope of many parents throughout this country <e> <s> it is the one hope that encourages them to believe that their children can rise above the difficulties of the shrinking economic face of britain and the difficulties that this nation has to face <e> <s> will the noble baroness in that case reassure this house now because the divisions that have been opened by this statement cut across party lines the reaction to them is of course predictable that we can have a debate on this subject <e> <s> the frustrations of asking questions trying to observe that we do not tread across the protocol are so great that we

when decisions have to be taken for internal reasons by a board the government then monitor the changes in the community and have discussions with community leaders as to how the blow can be absorbed

shrinking of the heavy industrial base <e> <s> would he accept that since it is a limited experiment some of us are deeply concerned that in the first two years of a zone being established there is quite often very little progress at all <e> <s> would it be helpful to the house if a report were given to it which showed what progress in job creation has been made within the development zones in their initial years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i come back and ask whether a -year period of generation does not require a very early start indeed in order to be certain that long-term jobs are created

country from the party opposite once say that democracy was the least efficient of all forms of government until one tried some other <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that there is a certain heavy irony in the fact that while as a house we are so deeply and rightly concerned to set up a proper ecological policy in relation to the falklands our own indigenous fishing industry has been destroyed by our failure to do so in relation to neighbouring european countries <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that tomorrows meeting of the general advisory council of the bbc in london will probably reflect all the concerns on all sides of the political issues expressed in this house and that he is quite right to say that this is a matter for the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness seems to be in need of assistance she may like to know that as chairman of the british cleaning council and president of the british institute of cleaning science i have received in this house today entirely unsolicited a bottle of cockroach killing mixture and i shall glady hand it to her <e>", "<cs> my lords in making his representations will the noble lord the minister quote the statistics for the decline in the deep sea fishing industry around the whole coast of britain <e> <s> over-fishing has all but wiped out the welsh deep sea fishing industry over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords in a sense and inevitably this chamber has this afternoon been haunted by the ghosts of our own youth <e> <s> each one in our turn has taken down the faded pictures of what

come to fulfil their youthful bright hopes <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords i am so glad that there was and i withdraw my comment <e> <s> it does not detract from the seriousness of the point i am hoping to make <e> <s> the agencies which we represent and for which we speak in this place were the formative agencies of those very emotions that rise in us the ambitions that some of us had between the wars some of us during the wars and some of us afterwards <e> <s> those agencies the church the schools the groups which we joined in our small communities and in our larger cities our colleges and universities were at that time in what seems now to have been an innocent world consenting to some broad ideals as to the direction in which society should move <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am

prelate came between mine and that of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible that the noble viscount the minister read too much into the welsh sentence with which my noble friend began his address <e> <s> he did not in fact welcome the statement he commented on it and indeed specifically remarked that there was no welcome for it in

not entering into a debate <e> <s> what i am saying here and saying it with a welsh accent speaking for wales for a moment is that i want it to be understood that there is this considerable discrepancy <e> <s> the statement says in regard to wales that at least partial reorganisation of its rateable base can take place within three years under an administration that does not have three years to run <e> <s> the minister then says in answer to my noble friend that he wants us to go away and consider it for six months <e> <s> thus six months of those three years are taken up <e> <s>

carefully in subsequent reports to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in the late s in another place when a labour chancellor of the exchequer had spoken at some length on the problems that he was facing

mutter there but for the grace of god goes god <e> <s> had he been in the chamber this afternoon he could only have said there but for the grace of god goes the kingdom of god or the tory party at prayers because everybody who has spoken so far from the government benches in this debate has left the chamber and the noble earl lord lauderdale has apologised because he is to leave shortly having made a robust defence of his government and having made a straightforward lobbying speech on behalf of the oil industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the emphasis of the think british campaign on the careful analysis of what is available before choice is made is a discipline upon british industry to raise its standards and that under the leadership of the chairman now mr david jacob that positive contribution to our thinking has been very important indeed <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the contention put forward by the noble lord the former prime minister

but ours the schools that we were taught in and the teachers by whom we were taught and for me too the years that i taught in schools when i was committed deeply to my own politics but despised anyone who would attempt to teach his or mine in the classrooms in which i taught <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl not reconsider what he has just said and would he add weight to the fact that we know that there are very many men of good will and women of good will who are teaching and that there are very few but very active people who teach party politics in schools <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that extensive quotation from an article that i have not read <e> <s> i am grateful in particular for the emphasis at the end of it which describes our schools as a battleground because that is what the

discourage those who would defeat the constitution which had been so dearly won <e>", "<cs> since i have been asked there were at least two greater law givers hywel dda who coded the welsh legislation

the chamber to get on with the business and should we not take it in the normal way <e>", "<cs> we can clearly see the dangerous ground on which we are standing and we can also see the straining of the relationship that has existed during the debate at times and the relationship where we share common anxieties <e> <s> sir fred clarke writing some words which were a part of an analysis of british education and which were important to some of us at the time said that the teacher standing in the place of the parent accepted some of the duties of the parent and that among those duties since the parent obviously had the right to determine the direction in which society developed the teacher one supposed had similar rights <e> <s> so it has ensured in our education system that every teacher who is doing an adequate job <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will allow me one question <e> <s> does he not admit that the real difference between his teaching of the pupils at eton and my teaching of the pupils at the secondary school at haverfordwest is most likely to be that his school and his pupils are secure in the society that they believe they can readily affect whereas those that i taught might be more likely to be feeling the difficulties and divisions of society and therefore be more affected by people who might canvass against that society <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not merely mandatory but courteous to say that this house owes a debt to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for introducing this debate at this time <e> <s> it is in fact a favour that he does the house a favour that the minister failed to do on the last occasion we debated a motion in terms similar to that put forward by the noble lord today <e> <s> in introducing that debate i

labour from others that do <e>", "<cs> my lords the politics of the situation apart i should like to support the noble lord lord campbell of croy and ask whether the minister honestly believes that an international oil price of dollars or less a barrel would make the british coal industry able to support our needs or to continue with its present plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that qualification hopefully <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness rises to answer the question does the house accept that we should surely be concentrating on the fact that it appears that a major human tragedy has taken place and that we should be addressing our feelings to that and not to the politics of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord the secretary of state for employment correctly one of the few substantive points that he made in his speech was not only that government policy did not affect the community but that it should not <e> <s> i found that

expressed by members of both houses that such schemes will be established and invested with real powers <e> <s> moreover will he press sros speedily to take up the opportunity offered by the act <e>",

in-service education rather than in-service training is the noble baroness in a position to tell the house whether there are any authorities in great britain which no longer have in-service education facilities and whether that is a result of educational policies within authorities which have been affected by cuts in the education budget <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house becomes too enthusiastic about the implications of that supplementary question and its answer would it not be true to say that the real poverty in british education today results from the fact that far too many teachers are leaving the profession teachers who are good and who are leaving at years of age and the education service is the poorer for their exit <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble lords original question is it not a fact that public behaviour at the moment flows through naturally from the greater antagonisms that have been created by confrontation politics <e> <s> while we deplore the fact that people are shouted down is it not a dangerous assumption that all the voices raised at cardiff university were necessarily welsh voices <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble baroness has given the house a great deal of detail relating to incentive awards i should like to ask her whether she will caution her right honourable friend the secretary of state not to be too optimistic that incentive awards will create the sort of peace within the classrooms on which he is determined and which we applaud he should seek <e> <s> incentive awards are divisive <e> <s> the basic qualifications of people entering teaching in the past have varied greatly as the noble baroness will appreciate <e> <s> it is not always possible to equate high standards of academic attainment desirable though they may be with good teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister ever considered siting these telephones not in isolated boxes but in public utility buildings which are paid for already by the taxpayers and accessible to them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord colwyn sits down after his extremely helpful speech may i ask one question <e> <s> would it not be possible for practitioners and surgeons whether in dentistry or general physiology to sample the blood of patients after each operation so that a bank of information about the presence of the virus is built up <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the house is free to ask questions in a debate of this order <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe will take the courtesies and my respect for him for granted and perhaps even the noble lord lord elliott will accept that i understand and appreciate what he was saying in the contribution he made to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords

matter into proper proportion <e>", "<cs> will the <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down could he tell us the membership of the professional association of teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will accept and it has already been established that there is at this stage no difference on either side of the house in the attitude to the terrible things that took place <e> <s> such things should never happen in a civilised society <e> <s> the answers that have been given to the house are so far short of real information that surely it would be intelligent for an inquiry to be held <e> <s> no one has asked for a public inquiry <e> <s> we have asked for an inquiry so that answers to all these speculations could be absolute <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is a persuasive advocate <e> <s> it is strange that she wishes to get back immediately to the negotiating panel and that she wishes to do so with haste but i understand that her amendment which has won my support is not to be put to the vote this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i have always maintained that the matter of money gets far more prominence in this place than it does in the staff rooms of the country because it is conditions and their general feeling of commitment to education that mostly attracts <e>", "<cs> am i wrong in thinking that the secretary of state for scotland did not find it necessary to dismantle the negotiating machinery <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will understand that i was making the point that i should like to be in the same position as the people of scotland <e>", "<cs> does not the wording also suggest that in addition to having the secretary of state with direct and total authority we shall have a committee which at each point as regards the noble lords amendment seems to be given a quite cavalier approach to those with whom it will have consultations <e> <s> it is only when it appears to the committee that people have a direct involvement that they will be consulted <e>", "<cs> it is especially so when that is attached to the question that i asked which has not been answered inadvertently about the fact that the committee itself can decide whether or not the people have an interest as in each of the three paragraphs of the ministers own amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall return just once more to the question to which the noble baroness has addressed herself and has answered to a degree <e> <s> the debate which is taking place will continue for some time <e> <s> however immediate the changes that will take place assuming that the bill is carried the whole issue of education may become central to the escalating noises and voices in an approach to a general election <e> <s> how can we be assured this is a genuine concern that a committee so set up given its wide-ranging right to choose among options about whom to interview might not be affected by the political noises of the day <e> <s> how can we be certain that the criteria of independence can be valid

"<cs> the intervention by the noble lord lord elton shows the difficulty of coming to grips with the situation that over a very long time has caused <e>", "<cs> the concession made by the minister is far more important in the context of his and the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness accept that a great deal of work is being done on this problem on all the beaches of great britain by the keep britain tidy organisation and its local organisations and that a great deal of research has gone into the causes of pollution of beaches <e> <s> would she say a word of encouragement to those voluntary organisations which are already committed to clearing up the beaches of great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also ask a serious question <e> <s> is it not mildly ironic that the noble lord who has just added to the question put down by the ministers noble friend should ask a question about political propaganda on the rates when in fact four minutes of his previous speech were devoted to party political propaganda on that <e>", "<cs> my lords as often happens in this house a motion that appears to be mechanical and concerned with the mechanisms of statistics and the way in which they are presented has turned out to be a humanistic question and has occupied the house at that level <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl accept that you do not have to be only a works manager in order to have to face that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord greenway has been sailing as he pointed out a lonely sea <e> <s> his voyage has been almost single-handed in nature and almost transatlantic in time and distance <e> <s> as he is such a nice fellow and a friend of mine i think that i should give the noble lord some encouragement <e> <s> there has been no criticism here of the elder bretheren of trinity house <e> <s> i have heard no noble lord refer either to their service or to them in any derogatory way <e> <s> all we have said is that changing technology may sometimes place changing responsibilities on them and perhaps we should look for means of payment other than the simple surcharge against the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell me how he can reconcile that with the surcharge on the small fishing fleet <e>", "<cs> my lords since training schemes for young people are so important and basic to the questions being discussed since it is understood by the secretary of state as much as by anyone else perhaps more that there are unsatisfactory aspects of the schemes that are causing blockages and the inability of young people to move into positions of real training and since also a great many young people will never get a job despite the fact that they are on these training programmes is it not time for him to introduce a debate in this house on that aspect of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the minister told the house on one occasion that he was born in <e> <s> will he join with me in saying that the pleasures of the question this afternoon have been the tribute paid to lord dowding and being able to hear the voices of the last of the few in this house <e> <s> can i as president of the british cleaning industry suggest that since he was unprepared to make as he said a sweeping contribution to the cleansing of the statue if it is erected the british cleaning industry itself might be prepared to sponsor the cleansing and maintenance of it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just point out to the house because it is a point of interest and i must do so that my presidency is an unpaid position and i have no financial interest whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount accept that so much depends on the integrity of the leader of the services <e> <s> during the time that the noble viscount the leader of the house was the distinguished home secretary of this country he established inquiries many times about difficulties arising within police forces in this country <e> <s> that did not signify that he was questioning the integrity of the chief constables of those forces <e> <s> a chief constable would make initial inquiries and then an independent chief constable or his representative would be brought in to examine the charges <e> <s> is there not a complete analogy with that case <e>", "<cs> the amendment is directed basically towards offshore rigs and vessels of that sort <e> <s> the final line of the amendment which specifies that such vessels should have a general and substantial connection with the united kingdom is one that appeals to me and one to which i shall be referring later in the context of the fishing industry off the welsh coast <e> <s> therefore i seek support in the committee for that general contention <e>", "<cs> obviously i should much prefer to have on my side the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> we have always been on the same side during debates on issues with regard to the fishing industry ever since i joined him in this chamber some years ago <e> <s> it goes without saying that to speak against an amendment that he has proposed is not an attractive proposition because of his formidable reputation and wide knowledge <e> <s> however there are one or two weaknesses in the argument that he has put forward which is not to say that there is not also a major weakness in the argument put forward in the committees whole consideration of the bill as it affects fishing <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say in response that the noble lord lord mottistone is quite right <e> <s> i totally applaud that degree of protection for the british fishing industry <e> <s> i totally applaud too the emphasis on allowing the minister discretion to decide <e> <s> it is the limitation of that within this amendment to which i object <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to debate the other issue in relation to my own amendment when it comes before the committee after this amendment is disposed of <e>", "<cs> the committee and the minister have been very kind <e> <s> many nice words have been said although my amendment has not attracted much support <e> <s> i shall return to it when i have the opportunity <e>", "<cs> not the late my lords the former prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords it used to be a maxim that in parliament one never apologised nor explained <e> <s> i reject the maxim and apologise to the house that i missed the speech of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and that of my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> that was unavoidable but i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the house will accept that my compliments to my noble friend lady nicol and to the two maiden speakers the noble lord lord jenkin of roding and the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley are as warm as they are short <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down simply on his final point on denial of access and what it constitutes would he not agree with me that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor indicated that he was aware and the house seemed to be aware at second reading that access to the law is denied both on price and on fear of access to a great many people on the country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to be associated with this motion for a humble address <e> <s> it will not surprise the house given the nature and purpose of the first fleet that there were two parrys aboard <e> <s> the first was classified as a felon and his wife sarah parry was given an older profession <e> <s> i sometimes think that she probably founded the tourism business in australia which is based on visiting friends and relations <e>", "<cs> my lords in a disciplined response to the motion on the humble address i took a moment or two of the time of the house to speak of at least one famous london welshman who had made a major contribution to the history of australia <e> <s> i do not propose to repeat tonight the words that i used then but i believe it would be fairly apt if the somewhat badly named m that leads to wales were to become new south wales way since it would link old south wales and through london new south wales <e> <s> i believe that is at least as good a suggestion as one that was made to me that the inns of court should be named kangaroo court <e>", "<cs> my lords happily today we are free of some of the restraints and i think there is time to develop a theme <e> <s> here is australia confidently taking its place as the leader of south-east asia <e> <s> in my own particular spheres of interest the growth and development of international tourism and all that that means australia has placed itself firmly in the forefront and the developments that are taking place there are exciting in the extreme <e> <s> all down the coasts of australia there have been developments which will make it the sunshine coast for the world and we rejoice in that <e>", "<cs> having listened very carefully to the progress of this amendment i understood the noble lord lord dean of beswick to say that we were very carefully considering the balance between public and private contracting and making certain that those elements of the public service that were in competition were able to compete properly for the services <e> <s> there is no intention on this side to question the concept of competition in order to ensure that people in a local area get the very best service <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a joy to follow the noble and learned lord lord denning to hear him expound upon cases and to know that he is slightly older than i i rise to speak in the debate because as one ages it is easy to concentrate one s mind on the disagreeable <e> <s> there is a great deal of change and all change hurts someone even when it is change from good to better <e> <s> the great and enduring help that one receives from society at the present time is the recognition of the definition of charity which is perhaps even older than that which we are discussing this evening charity being love <e>", "<cs> my lords that being so will the minister tell us whether the review will be wide enough detailed enough and swift enough to bring some hope to those farmers in west wales and on the peripheral areas of agriculture whose livelihood has been threatened by recent changes including the failure of the milk quota system to give any help to the milk industry of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that in the experience of many of us a note lasts five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord ezra and congratulate my noble countryman lord rees on his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> i would have paid a glowing tribute to the noble baroness lady elles on her determination in europe if she had not taken two minutes of my time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness lady hooper also accept that part of the difficulty of organising an act of corporate worship where the whole school wishes it lies in the fact that some schools are now so large that it is impossible to gather the whole community together in a single act of worship <e> <s> furthermore is she aware that there has been very real concern among people in schools that the act of worship had failed and had become merely an assembly at which some prayers were read <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord then convey to his right honourable friend the real urgency expressed by the noble lord lord crickhowell in asking this question and convey to him the fact that all sectors of the economy in wales see the rapid beginning of this project as essential to that economy <e> <s> will he please see that there is no slippage <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister accept that there is evidence of an increasing use of local railway stations <e> <s> people still use and are increasingly using trains <e> <s> those of us who use those services would be extremely reluctant to see any change in service brought about by the removal of the sale of tickets to private sources scattered around the area <e> <s> does not the minister accept that the low level of staffing of railways stations may cause queues and that those jobs in the railway stations are vital to small communities <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may draw the attention of the committee very quickly to the fact that all the relevant research over the past years into our educational system has proved that something like per cent <e> <s> of the children coming out of our schools are not in a position to take advantage of the very schemes which are put forward <e> <s> they are already disadvantaged many of them are alienated from society and the words which my noble friend lord pitt read out to the committee are therefore extremely relevant <e> <s> there is a very large section of society which will fall below the provision anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness rises to answer that question will she please accept that the lads who can read the notice board and the notice of jobs available are themselves higher up the echelon than the people i am talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us are at a disadvantage <e> <s> we do not speak neanderthal <e> <s> is it possible to have a translation service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry could the noble baroness repeat that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have the floor <e> <s> i was so amazed at the speech made in the context of this debate that i failed to understand it <e> <s> my remark was not intended to be offensive but to be mildly humorous after the rather insulting nature of the speech to which the house had to listen <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the underground system in london is much used by tourists and is an economic lifeline <e> <s> does he accept that the government should make absolutely certain that the high standards of safety which have been advertised in the past are maintained in the present and the future <e>", "<cs> my lords does the house accept that the anger that has been expressed this afternoon in the house will be reiterated in the general advisory council of the bbc which meets monthly and which has a very broad representation <e> <s> fears that the bbc might be pressurised too much and fears that it might not be pressurised enough are put forward there month by month in the interests of all the people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that there is already a very large body of evidence available taken over the past years to the effect that the more deprived the environment in which the child is born the more need there is for nursery education and the less likely there is to be demand <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that it sounds to the house as though he is hiding behind a traditional excuse <e>", "<cs> my lords more than six hours ago at the very beginning of her speech of introduction the noble baroness referred to the fact that inevitably a great deal of history would be introduced into this debate and sought to stem its tide <e> <s> she also said that the contribution of teachers is crucial to the developments that will follow from the implementation of this act if it is so implemented <e> <s> i thank her for that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to underline what has been said <e> <s> as regards services provided to the handicapped in schools it is essential that it is seen <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the issue of comparative funding raised by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding will the noble lord accept that that is something which even though it is accidental we appreciate very much when there is some benefit to wales and scotland as distinct from the english regions <e> <s> does he appreciate that there is a very serious reason behind this that the fundamental basis of the economies in those countries of wales and scotland has been so badly eroded that some difference in funding is only to be expected <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the minister that i shall be in my place <e>", "<cs> until fairly recently for years i was chairman of the spastics society in wales <e> <s> for much longer my wife was in charge of a unit for the mentally and physically handicapped <e> <s> our daughter has just now left the school in which she teaches which is dedicated to the severely mentally and physically handicapped <e> <s> it is therefore a pleasure for me to support this amendment and to appeal to the government in an area where i know they care <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur is known to me as a caring family man and i am sure that he is as moved as the rest of us by the plight of the people who whatever the niceties of judgment will never make any contribution to the economy of this country because they are prevented from doing so by the bodies in which they live and the minds that motivate them <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord does me an injustice <e> <s> i carefully explained my association and my own experience <e> <s> there is no way in which i would detract from the massive effort that is being made at every level nor indeed would i detract from the efforts that those people are making themselves to take their place in the community <e> <s> please do not attribute to me any suggestion that i am criticising them <e> <s> i am asking the government to follow their own best intentions <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord tonypandy is not in his place because he has to be in wales <e> <s> it may be appropriate if i contribute one word or two <e> <s> as a welshman it will probably be more than one <e> <s> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> what is not often <e>", "<cs> will the minister accept that his statement about docking p from the volunteer worker to give him a lesson in democracy sits very ill with the lesson that we are seeking to teach that we should encourage the people who are volunteers <e> <s> they give of their lives in the service of others <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord has considered that this part of the bill might lead to grave embarrassment for the government or future governments <e> <s> it is not unknown within our system for people so to object to the payment of certain charges that they face the difficulties even of imprisonment in order to drive home their aims <e> <s> if the bill is passed in this form a great many politically motivated people might deliberately choose to refuse to pay in order to achieve political embarrassment of the government of the day simply by clogging the prison system <e>", "<cs> my lords it is also necessary to lift the reference to social and environmental studies out of the slightly specious political joke that was made about it <e> <s> social and environmental studies have been for years a very important part of the curriculum of all schools private and public <e> <s> where the environment is poor and where the society is limited it is even more essential that enrichment of the curriculum should take place <e> <s> it is in that sense that social and environmental studies are in the curriculum of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords most of us have less problem with the teaching of christianity as the basis of religious education in schools than with the logistics of carrying through that fine intention <e> <s> it must be or years since this house discussed a motion on the training and supply of teachers of religious education <e> <s> it was one of the early debates in this house in which i took part <e> <s> one of the difficulties of the amendment is that it says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very gracious <e> <s> i thank him <e> <s> they would be qualified as christians <e> <s> they would not be qualified as teachers one would imagine <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the house will give me the right to speak <e> <s> although it is report stage i have every right to do what i am doing but i shall be guided otherwise <e> <s> the point i am making is that the secretary of state insists that teachers in schools should be qualified <e> <s> if lay readers who are qualified in teaching are available they will be welcomed in the schools otherwise they would be illegally in that office <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is right to give credit to the government for the distance that they have come on this issue <e> <s> a point which is not always made in debates on languages and in particular on the protection of the indigenous languages of great britain is that bilingualism is a very important matter <e> <s> the acquisition of language by children may well be the key to the whole learning process <e> <s> we need teachers in bilingual education and the disciplines acquired in wales over the past to years as concern has grown for the welsh language are very important <e> <s> i shall not go into that matter at this hour of the night <e> <s> however i lay down a marker for future discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one simple point that has not been made since i have been in the chamber <e> <s> if it was made during my absence i apologise to the house <e> <s> the whole basis of the education reform bill and the emphasis of the national debate that led to it the opposition to it and the support for it have been engendered by the criticism that this countrys education system has been failing and falling behind what the country has been expecting of it over the past or years <e> <s> if that is true it means that there is a young adult <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us who supported the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale at other stages of the bill will have received a number of letters many of them heart rending which talk of the real difficulties that people face <e> <s> it is a privilege to support the amendment moved in such a logical way and in such realistic terms by the noble lord <e> <s> i do so gladly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i therefore put in a request on behalf of john the baptist <e>", "<cs> my lords would not a splendid initiative be for the government to invite the teacher unions to meet the secretary of state to discuss the concept anew in view of the history of the matter and also of the fact that most teachers whatever the institute in which they were trained are conscious that their basic training is insufficient for the demands of the present day <e> <s> they have been trying by way of in-service education and postgraduate courses through the open university to improve their lot as teachers so as to be able to cope <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give the house information about the governments attitude to landfill projects <e> <s> in light of the fact that in many states in the usa landfill projects are banned what effect will that have on the waste disposal industry in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that certain states in the usa have already banned landfill projects <e> <s> as a result great ships are touring the seas of the world looking for places to dump american rubbish <e> <s> it is the effect of that rubbish on the water table which gives the greatest cause for concern <e>", "<cs> the noble earl caught so many of us by surprise despite the nationwide concern that has been shown over this issue for months <e> <s> did he tell us that the electoral reform society would be paid to carry out this work <e> <s> by whom will it be paid what are the funding arrangements and how much will it all cost <e>", "<cs> a few moments ago when i gave way to the right reverend prelate i heard him say that he was confused and could not understand aspects of the matter <e> <s> we have also heard a former prime minister speak most movingly about the people in his former constituency <e> <s> i have been approached by several councils in the rural areas of wales who are equally concerned <e> <s> it seems most astonishing in view of the amount of information being given to us that we should all be so surprised <e> <s> i even gained the impression that the minister was thinking on his feet when responding to the questions raised <e> <s> if that is the case surely the people living in council houses who are approached during various elections by many people at a time when the appearance of someone at your front door is not something you take lightly will be confused and bothered <e>", "<cs> on the matter of precedent-i am sorry i obey my noble friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords can the house assume that the minister is familiar with the welsh education statistics bulletin no <e> <s> the primary school staffing survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that honest answer from the minister <e> <s> i appreciate what he is saying <e> <s> however the house will expect me to explain why i asked the question <e> <s> i ask a further question of the minister <e> <s> is he aware that the survey shows that of primary schools in wales almost half have gaps in their curricula because of staff shortages or lack of expertise <e> <s> is he further aware that the survey which has been published in advance of a long awaited survey of english schools and which is to find out the similar patterns that exist means that per cent <e> <s> of schools cannot teach as full a range of subjects as they would like <e>

for noble lords opposite but the facts are deadly important for the country <e>", "<cs> my lords respectful as i am of the welsh office and my noble leader sitting before me was once secretary of state for wales will the noble viscount accept that it is the responsibility of her majestys government and the secretary of state for education to reply when the education system of this country is under question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that a great many people in the teaching profession who are well qualified are conscious of the fact that their qualifications are dated and that they themselves do not believe that the education system and there is some qualification of that in recent research is adequate to the task they are carrying out <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us a little more about two points in his statement <e> <s> what was the level of response to the request for submissions for which a very short space of time was allowed after the paper was issued <e> <s> how will the minister determine whether the qualified people are qualified <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the house cannot accept that kind of casual dismissal <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that it is a weakness that some of us recognise in the economic system that when assessments are made of the value of a company emphasis is always placed on <e>", "<cs> my lords it is his shyness <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i shall begin with a wholly positive comment by welcoming the assurance given in regard to sianel pedwar cymru the welsh channel <e> <s> i do so not in any nationalistic or jingoistic sense but because of its importance to the whole of

of speaking this afternoon <e> <s> i had not then heard the statement <e> <s> i had no means of knowing its significance <e> <s> i believe that the noble viscount is old enough to remember the post- era in education in this country <e> <s> it was the period when the bipartisan development of an education scheme for the country had produced a wholly new mood in education <e> <s> we went into our classrooms those of us who were in education with joy and with a commitment because the country had borne the expense not a very great expense either in relative terms of our education <e> <s> we were being given the opportunity to pass it on to others <e> <s> some of us for all our lives thereafter in the classroom tried to improve that education <e> <s> it was a positive bipartisan approach to the education of the children of this nation <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and to the committee for the work that it has done under his guidance

asked him a question about the results of the primary school staffing survey reported in the welsh office pamphlet <e> <s> i did not congratulate him that day because i did not know it was his first appearance on the front bench <e> <s> i congratulate him now and i also congratulate my noble friend who has taken over front bench responsibility on the subject for this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to he able to thank my noble friend lord ponsonby of shulbrede for giving us the opportunity in the dying hours of this parliament to discuss the most important

in the tourist board <e> <s> i welcome also the technical men for example the noble lord lord mountevans <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that remark <e> <s> he is kind and considerate <e> <s> that outstanding performance over the past years is an endorsement of the effort of the british tourist industry to win new overseas markets <e> <s> over a slightly longer period from we increased our world market share from about per cent <e> <s> of the total amount spent on tourism to per cent <e> <s> i have said this twice <e> <s> that is a very considerable achievement when we

little more information about a very important aspect of the statement which talked about the governments intention to see how they could co-operate with humanitarian agencies in relieving the immediate pressures <e> <s> will he accept that quite often in these situations it is what one is able to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should raise the level of the debate not lower it <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely ask the noble lord and the house to keep the debate at the level that it has reached and not to lower it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house or write to any person who might be interested about the organisation cadw which was set up by the welsh office and which has responsibilities in association with the welsh tourist board for preserving all national memorials within wales <e> <s> further do the rules of that body also apply to the cathedrals <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell members of the committee how many people were so qualified last year

the house has enjoyed this acid exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of one of the answers given by the minister does he not accept that it has left some disquiet and not only on this side of the house <e> <s> i am referring to the answer that he gave that school organisation and financing will be pupil-led and his estimation that people would choose a school that was successful <e> <s> does the minister not agree that he is leaving a very large area of the country with a great many schools that have no competition in the sense that in rural districts they exist only within those areas <e> <s> does he not further agree that first there is no competence that people can look to for management because there is no training in that regard <e> <s> secondly does he not agree that there is no alternative for a school that is the only one in a rural district <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> can he now tell the house whether there is any arrangement for the curriculum of the training colleges and universities to include managerial competence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff who has allowed me to speak before him <e> <s> i wish to declare an interest as the chairman of the milford docks company from which role i draw a profit <e> <s> the house will be aware that some time ago i warned that there was a danger that the government would find themselves in a position of illegality in regard to the general law of the ec over this exclusivity issue <e> <s> i do not rise tonight to say i told you so and nor do i dissent from some of the difficulties faced by my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that the tourist industry will be grateful to him for that answer <e> <s> however i respect the problem that was raised from a personal point of view by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> does the minister further accept that coincidentally with the european year of tourism it is also the tidy britain year and the beginning of the decade for britain of the clean nineties <e> <s> the amenities of the country will benefit from a general effort which is largely paid for out of revenues received from tourism <e> <s> those revenues augment britains income <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house whether the possibilities of full implementation of the national curriculum are already affected by the levels of shortages within the subjects which he has indicated <e> <s> can he also give some guidance as to whether it will be possible to teach the welsh language in the schools of wales without sufficient teachers being available and qualified to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am already waiting for two replies from him and i shall be anxiously scanning the mail <e> <s> does he accept as has been indicated that in the schools and i wish to put this matter very strongly there is a very real sense of disappointment and disillusionment and that the sooner that is removed the better the chances will be of our children being properly taught <e>", "<cs> my lords my warm congratulations go to the noble lord lord layton who in his hirsute glory and confident speech looked less like a maiden than anyone i have ever seen <e> <s> it is a pleasure to welcome him to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords if the

poses for the whole house as well as for her a dilemma regarding the british education system at present <e> <s> does she accept that the general standard of education which has been criticised for a long time is so low in the mainstream schools that the only hope for children in separate education is the maintenance of the schools where they are presently taught <e> <s> does the policy not threaten to put back into schools which are under-equipped to deal with their present responsibilities the quite impossible task of looking after mentally and physically handicapped children <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will probably accept that i tried to make an apolitical point <e> <s> in doing so will she accept that when the concept of returning mentally and physically handicapped and socially deprived children into the mainstream of education was developed in scandinavia it presupposed that the schools were prepared to take the children and preparations were made accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept that when the great debate on education was <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to my noble friend lord williams of elvel for launching the debate and for the quality of his contribution <e> <s> i should also like to thank the house for the standard of the debate up to this point to which the maiden speaker contributed as substantially as anyone <e> <s> i wish immediately to take up a point which was made at some length by the previous speaker the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> it should be noted in this house even in the context of this excellent debate that the only occasions in our history over the past hundred years when we have enjoyed a balance of payments surplus have always been

attention of the house to the fact that the bbc general advisory council which spans the broadest possible range of opinion in this country exists to receive a report of objections from the public to particular programmes and that each time it meets there is a lively debate on the issue <e> <s> no producer therefore goes uninformed as to any mistakes that he might have made <e>", "<cs> my lords what further arrangements have been made for the provision of in-service education to meet the needs of the management studies that must be made available if those now being appointed to management

probably years since i was in hungary as part of a parliamentary delegation <e> <s> since then i have been to czechoslovakia east germany and yugoslavia <e> <s> but i know very little of any of those countries except as a tourist in what were for me underprivileged lands <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government accept that the old county of pembrokeshire has had a long and close association with the ministry of defence and is as faithful to the concept of the defence of the country as any minister in this house or in another place <e> <s> will they further accept that the concerns expressed by the local people perhaps out of lack of knowledge have not necessarily been magnified by the local press <e> <s> indeed as a regular reader of it over the past years i happen to believe that the local press has truly reflected concerns in the district <e> <s> those concerns may be met by the ministers visit certainly his visit is welcome but the house would be ill advised to assume that the people of pembrokeshire are concerned for no reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble earl lord shannon on introducing his appeal for a national environmental waste policy so robustly <e>

we are all so busy that sometimes we miss our opportunities <e> <s> i thank the house for giving me an opportunity now <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> when he reads his speech tomorrow the noble lord may find that the adjectives therein give the impression that it is much more likely that one would find a local authority dodging its obligations rather than a polluter <e> <s> is he prepared to make some correction to that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister rises will he accept that the house especially noble <e>", "<cs> the government and the committee will accept that many noble lords have worked for many years with mary holland and have listened to the noble lord lord allen speak of ten about the detail of these problems that he faces <e> <s> we appreciate the ministers embarrassment just as we appreciate the right to privacy in his reply <e> <s> however we are bound to say that the careful research done into these figures from the mencap side is much more convincing than what we have been told today or earlier from the government side <e> <s> that is said with no disrespect to the noble lord lord henley <e> <s> i wish merely to point out that this complicated problem is further complicated by the fact that other initiatives in the field are taking away the support that these physically and mentally handicapped people currently have within institutions such as the specialised schools <e> <s> the government propose to put those handicapped pupils back into mainstream education <e> <s> it was precisely for those reasons that many members came to the committee today to support the amendment of the noble lord lord allen we hope that he will persist with it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that despite the quality of his answer the house is concerned by what is known as the alien footprint on our culture and that the previous questioner has laid his finger on the point <e> <s> what control do the government intend to exercise over influences on our culture that come from outside despite ownership of those services <e>", "<cs> i hope that my question will not be blocked out by the minister answering at this stage <e>", "<cs> in terms of the average age of the committee the minister is quite young <e> <s> if he were not he would have a sense of <e>", "<cs> the minister will understand that i lived with this question when uncles of mine were asked to agree to allowing their lungs to be submitted for examination after they died so that the reason for death could be proved <e> <s> it is in that context that i have been dealing with this individual case <e> <s> while he is correct to argue that the widows of these men can raise an appeal he must realise that many of them are unlikely to be able to deal with the processes of appeal <e> <s> they are likely to be at a grave disadvantage when it comes to dealing with any department to obtain rights which fall due to them <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord admit that in a town with a population of from which two citizens both of them now dead are tested the figures seem to indicate that there must be a higher average than usual <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords while not wishing in any sense to cut across the question asked by my noble friend baroness nicol perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> is the minister aware that years ago the welsh tourist board undertook a survey of the ports and harbours of wales in order to identify those which most suitably and with the agreement of their communities would provide marina facilities to the advantage of the nation and its economy <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that a number of those developments have been carried out satisfactorily <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right in pointing out the danger if matters are left to the whim of the developer <e> <s> if control slips from the developing authority we can have a situation in this country where there are too many marinas which are badly controlled <e> <s> at the moment the development is successful but we have to take care <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be reasonably simple for the government to publish the addresses and names of the chairmen of the generating companies so that we could all return our junk mail directly to them <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful to the committee to remind ourselves at this stage of the addison rules <e> <s> two points are made in those rules regarding the setting up of public bodies and the possibility of surrender of the ministers authority to such a body if parliament is not careful which should be mentioned in the debate at this point <e> <s> it is clear that if an executive body were set up and the addision rules were followed when questions affecting public bodies arise in parliament the government are alone responsible to parliament <e> <s> that is the practice not just the concept <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord onslow would not expect me to agree too readily with the points that he made <e> <s> he might expect some sympathy and i offer it to him <e> <s> he could not think of a welsh town whose name he could pronounce <e> <s> the only river that he could pronounce was the single syllabled river usk <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i guide the committee regarding what happened in wales some years ago when i was chairman of the wales council of keep britain tidy <e> <s> i was introduced to a system which very much involved local government <e> <s> all local councils in wales were participants and leaders in the clean-up of wales attempted at that time <e>", "<cs> the ministers faith in the market-led economy and its mechanics is understandable coming from his side of the house <e> <s> does he agree that the collection and recycling of glass has been made more difficult because in wales no plant can deal with the recycling of glass <e> <s> therefore the value of the glass to the authorities which are collecting it falls below the cost of that collection as the market-led economy rises and falls <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may ask whether or not there are already sufficient data available to show the costs incurred over the years by local authorities in the acquisition of hollows and wasteland for the creation of infill tipping <e> <s> is not the cost per tonne also included in the records of the various authorities <e> <s> far from being a hypothetical issue as described by the noble lord lord renton it is a practical one for which all records are kept <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that the tidy britain group which was formerly known as keep britain tidy was the creation of the womens institute after a resolution passed during its annual conference some years ago <e> <s> the womens institute expressed concern at the fact that britain was becoming more and more untidy <e> <s> they wanted a government funded agency which was supported by the public to tackle the problem <e>", "<cs> the minister must accept that his defence against the amendment somewhat weakens his statement of intent in our earlier debates <e> <s> a great deal of litter is thrown from private property on to private property and in the public view <e> <s> it is easy to identify who the propagators are <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister and the committee to bear with me for a moment while i give another personal example <e> <s> i know of a private property which is a public house if that is not a contradiction in terms which keeps its immediate environment beautiful but throws much of its rubbish on to british rails privately owned property in a public place <e> <s> i could take a picture to show that <e> <s> everyone would know who had thrown out the mattresses and it would be easy to say that that <e>", "<cs> perhaps the committee will allow me to say that the company to which the noble lord refers kentucky fried chicken realising that its products are thrown away by people who do not care for a tidy britain has helped the tidy britain group with a substantial grant <e>", "<cs> since we are now clear on the procedure perhaps i may move the discussion back to living creatures and the droppings that emanate from them in public places <e> <s> anyone who has spent any time in brunnen switzerland

down if i understood the noble earl lord balfour correctly he objected to the principle of fixed fines on the grounds that such matters are better dealt with by the courts <e> <s> if that is so i make the point that at <e>", "<cs> will the minister withdraw the phrase at the drop of a hat because in the context of the sentence in which he used it that might be constituted as an encouragement to drop litter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not admit that the decision of an independent nation is for that nation alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether the minister might not admit that the decision of an independent nation is for that nation alone <e>", "<cs> perhaps i too may intervene at this stage in the committee <e> <s> one talks of htv <e> <s> there is probably no company in britain more closely in touch with the area in which it is based than that company <e> <s> it is sensitive to the nuances of both the welsh nation and the area which it covers around bristol <e> <s>

put forward this amendment <e> <s> our country is a country in its own right as other noble lords have said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that one of the causes for concern over the use of statistics is that even when they are not suspect the time lag in their production after research has been carried out means that they are published at a time when they conflict with what is happening on the ground <e> <s> for example with regard to tourism conditions are reported which existed nine months earlier <e> <s> it might be in the interests of that trade for such figures to be published three or four months earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the amendment so ably put before us it is necessary for me to state that while i am chairman of the tidy britain group and am anxiously involved in a number of other environmental organisations what i have to say does not necessarily represent that group although it probably does <e> <s> i enthusiastically support the amendment because i believe it is necessary for the government at this early stage to indicate now that they are prepared to listen to voices that place greater importance on certain aspects of what they propose than they seem to do themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will accept that it was his noble friend not my noble friend who inadvertently used the word supernatural when describing ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that those who are simple and naive such as i am find it difficult to understand why petrol bought at barrel prices which were considerably lower before the crisis began should be sold at prices that have been set after the crisis began <e> <s> those people are unable to understand why they are now paying prices for oil that may be down at barrel price when it is eventually delivered to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will explain to the house why prices do not go down as quickly as they go up <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment moved by my noble friend and already supported by the noble lord lord bonham-carter on two specific grounds <e> <s> it is important that it
