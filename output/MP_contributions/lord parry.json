["<cs> my lords as chairman of the wales tourist board and a member of the british <e> <s> tourist authority it is essential for me to make the usual disclaimer in terms of the addison rules and a bow in the direction of the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood who has just spoken <e> <s> it is also a very great pleasure and not a duty to congratulate the noble lord lord sandford and his committee as other speakers have done on the work which he modestly claims is making little more than a start <e> <s> i think that we believe it has done much more than that <e> <s> this report gives us the basis for some really hard thinking about an alternative economic development which is essential <e> <s> i put that in parenthesis at the beginning because there are some points i should like to isolate from the report as needing some further thought <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that there is a strange logic in assuming that young athletes who go to a country in order to compete in games alone give support to the rgime while selling guns to another country does not <e>", "<cs> the noble baronesss tone was so conciliatory at the beginning of her remarks that it seemed we were very close to having an agreement that was quite fundamental to the bill that follows <e> <s> her quotation from the secretary of state in another place seemed to me to strengthen the argument that has been put forward from these benches for a change in the status and the provision of a governing rather than a management body for primary schools <e> <s> a great deal of evidence in this behalf has been put forward by the national union of teachers which is the major union representing teachers in primary schools <e> <s> it seemed to me that we had reached a point where the introduction of a governing body at the primary school level would be wholly helpful to the minister whatever the party in government at the time <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> she is very forbearing and very kind <e> <s> may i make the point that the reorganisation of local government has brought about a severing a distancing of the control of local government by the people <e> <s> this is generally felt in the whole of the country <e> <s> will the noble baroness accept that she is not historically quite accurate when she tells us that this is the first time that this proposal is coming forward <e> <s> it is perfectly true that it is the first time that there has been a management structure in certain of the schools because they were grouped <e> <s> but prior to the reorganisation of local government and t do not mean the reorganisation in the most immediate past but that which occurred under the education act when i was myself in college there was a board school structure which provided an immediate and closely governed visitation to the local primary school to the point where the management actually went in every week to talk over matters of school attendance and day-to-day administration <e> <s> over the last or years under several acts of parliament local government has moved further away from the people and i am arguing for a closer relationship in one area where the minister has already admitted that it is vital <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stewart of fulham does not need me to defend him but surely it is recognised that in introducing this amendment he is not simply going in for semantics <e> <s> foundation governors are like foundation garments they exist to keep the shape of the body perhaps long after that shape has changed beyond recognition <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself immediately in support of the amendment as president of the spastic society in wales and the society for the mentally handicapped there <e> <s> i know of the concern of parents and indeed of the societies although i do not commit them to my views <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that it be understood that if the parent of the normal child and i use my words carefully has a contribution to make in the government of the school then a parent of a handicapped family handicapped by having special difficulties that arise out of the birth of handicapped children has a specific contribution to make <e> <s> i not only support this myself but urge my own front bench to give support to this amendment <e>", "<cs> as the amendment is being withdrawn may i be allowed to say that there is a real danger that the noble baroness the minister was arguing on both sides of the equation in support of her own position in this case since you cannot argue that you should not introduce legislation without discussing it with interested bodies and then introduce legislation that effectively excludes them <e> <s> you should also have discussions with them if they are to be excluded <e> <s> i think the minister will understand my concern when i say that there is a real worry among bodies interested in special schools that they might find themselves excluded from the educational provisions and put under a social service arrangement which has already been done with some aspects of the special education service at adult level <e> <s> if we can have some assurance at this stage that the government do not presage anything of that nature in their proposed legislation it will be helpful <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will accept that i was simply picking up her defence that she defended herself by saying that she could not introduce legislation without having had discussions <e>", "<cs> i thought the noble baroness was making the point that she had in fact had those discussions <e>", "<cs> the beauty of the amendment seems to me to be its appeal to the governments well advertised magnanimity in this debate <e> <s> they have the opportunity here to accept a view <e> <s> the most serious criticism of the amendment is that it is a statement of intent a direction rather than something which the government have thought to put in themselves <e> <s> there is an opportunity for the minister to accept this in view of the support that comes for the amendment from around the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin picked up a phrase of my noble friend as an example as he thought of tautology <e> <s> i was interested that it coincided more with ezra pounds version of logopoeia which was in fact a play on the meaning of words the shade of the context <e> <s> from the noble lord we expect far more than the use of a word we expect the context as well <e> <s> from the government we have the right to expect here far more than a play on words and the simple acceptance that the committee think that it is a good idea to have this amendment <e>", "<cs> to prevent the noble baroness having to speak twice could i make two points <e> <s> we are not talking about curriculum content at all <e> <s> curriculum content is a very different subject and one which will occupy us considerably in the course of this debate <e> <s> we arc talking about involvement within the community and the representation of the school a point which the noble baroness gladly accepted earlier this afternoon in respect of the primary schools <e> <s> having made that point it is essential that it should he pointed out that amendment no <e> <s> does not bear any relationship whatever to this amendment <e> <s> the amendment as stated deals with community orientation <e> <s> in making those two corrective points i do not want to lose the ministers sympathy <e> <s> i want to bind it tight with this amendment <e> <s> it would be a pity if in seeking to find a reason for what is quite clearly an intention she were to lose touch with the real feeling of the committee on all sides that we should make a statement within the act which will lead to a better representation on the community base of the school <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord eccles offered some while ago what seemed to be a perfectly acceptable solution <e> <s> the minister agrees with us and has said so and the only support she quotes in disagreement is from the noble lord lord bellwin who sits beside her <e> <s> the feeling of the house is totally with her and surely we should accept the former minister of educations suggestion that the government look at the wording <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene and i am encouraged only by the sudden reappearane among us of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls who promised us a great deal of attention on amendments nos <e> <s> and before he disappeared so perhaps noble lords will forgive me if i say that it might be helpful to the committee in its present mood of family interest in what is after all a family subject namely education whatever our backgrounds to note that my noble friend lord heycock is a man who has put a lifetime into the service of education in wales and is greatly honoured among my countrymen for the service he has rendered <e> <s> when he speaks he speaks on <e>", "<cs> to ask a question of the noble lord lord james of rusholme even through the front bench of the opposite side of the committee is a little like treading on the feet of gamaliel instead of sitting at them <e> <s> nevertheless i think it important to ask him whether he believes that his view of the lack of importance of the governing body in the context of a school such as manchester grammar school is in fact the governments view in putting forward this legislation <e> <s> i get the impression that the government believe the governing bodies of schools to be vastly more important than the noble lord lord james does <e> <s> one can understand the attitude of a successful headmaster of a great school being slightly patronising towards his governing body but that surely is not the mood of a government putting forward legislation <e>", "<cs> i withdraw the word <e>", "<cs> i would wish to associate myself enthusiastically and entirely uncharacteristically formally <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> she is very kind <e> <s> in fact what she says is not the case <e> <s> the argument that is being put is that they should be treated exactly alike <e> <s> if the noble baroness is saying that there should not be a handicapped person on the governing body of an ordinary school then she has a point <e> <s> but what we are saying is that as the fit and the healthy are put on the governing bodies of schools attended by the fit and the healthy so it is correct that someone with knowledge of not being fit and healthy should be on the governing body of the school for such children <e>", "<cs> i thought it was greek logic <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that my noble friend is about to withdraw his amendment it is occasionally nice to point out that there is not a monolithic structure on this side of the committee either <e> <s> i believe that the committee feels that if it could get the size of schools down to as a maximum and as a positive effective step then perhaps some of the problems of government of the schools might resolve themselves <e>", "<cs> the noble lord on the front bench made a valuable qualification towards the end of his speech much of which i totally agree with <e> <s> it goes without <e>", "<cs> would the minister not agree that the theme running through our discussions yesterday emphasised the fact that local government has moved so much further away from the people in great britain that handholding exercises become necessary from time to time <e> <s> i do not believe that any of us are confident that the new system of local government is close enough to the people to give the type of detailed knowledge that the amendment suggests to the far away men in far away places who control the destinies of the schools <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord simon illustrates beautifully the nature of the dilemma facing the government <e> <s> it used to be the case that a biographical note was not necessary because the candidate was knownhe was met in the street by those electing him to office <e> <s> we now have an attenuated system of local government which forces on us the very complexities which noble lords are now considering <e> <s> it seems to me vital that the children of our schools should be entrusted with governing bodies comprised of people whose identity is clearly known and in the system we now have that is not the case <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord who has just spoken was absent from the chamber when from the front bench my noble friend lord stewart of fulham made what was an excellent speech in which he made perfectly clear that it was understood that selective processes are not at issue <e> <s> it is quite clear that age aptitude and ability arc matters which will govern the distribution of pupils throughout schools <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to make absolutely certain and i thought that was the governments intention until a few moments ago that in doing that we provide a machinery within each district which will see that the children in that area have access to education according to their age aptitude and ability <e>", "<cs> shy introverted and reticent though we are as a people it would be wrong if i did not on behalf of my colleagues who will join with me without committing the others accept the invitation and hope that we have more across-the-floor exchanges <e>", "<cs> the point should be made and i think it is very important <e> <s> a distinguished educational figure the noble viscount who has just spoken has drawn attention to it but from the wrong side of the argument <e> <s> teachers are deeply concerned and have been for a very long time under successive ministers that their role in teaching is one which has been diminished rather than strengthened <e> <s> they have argued for a long time that parity of esteem among schools is essential <e> <s> under various governments and ministers every single piece of reporting on the education process we are speaking here about education not about the mechanics that has been published has had one central point of agreement that the biggest single factor influencing the education of a child is the attitude of the parent to the school in which that child is taught <e>", "<cs> if i may ask one factual question the situation may have changed since my day does capitation allowance have anything to do with the building in which it is allocated <e>", "<cs> that is as understood it and therefore it would not be confusing to a parent to know the capitation allowance because the site of the school was spread out as the minister indicated <e>", "<cs> nothing in itself is good or had but there is no more abominable word in the english language than the word but used as it was constantly by the last speaker throughout his speech <e> <s> to interpose that preposition after the careful preparation of his case as though he were accepting exactly what the noble baronesses were saying and what lord vaizey had put before the committee and then to come in with the but and at the same time to seek to convince himself before the committee because it was very evident that he was seeking for arguments to support a contention is unworthy of him and of his record in education <e>", "<cs> would the minister agree that the significant difference here which hinges on all the points made by earlier speakers is the size of the funding involved and the transfer at this particular time of a capital sum which i have seen estimated at between million and million in total in addition to the sum of million or so which is at present spent on the funding of places in the system <e> <s> that amount of money transferred at a time when there are cuts taking place in the public sector would o affect the disposition of places in the <e>", "<cs> it is fair to say that i put the last part of my question badly if the minister misunderstood it to that extent <e> <s> what i was saying was that if there is a significant change in the distribution of funds and if one is enriched at the expense of the other even though they have for a long time existed side by side then the ability of a sixth form in a school which has been able to compete in the past might be adversely affected in the future <e>", "<cs> if the students were of high ability which is the aim of the legislation they would then be enriching the sixth form of the school at the expense of the school in the area from which they were recruited <e> <s> there is enrichment in human ability as well as in finance <e>", "<cs> i accept that the noble baroness has taken my point of the million and has come hack to agreement with me <e>", "<cs> i never thought that <e>", "<cs> we can take the noble lord to many schools in the country where children of infant and primary school age are being taught in three classes in one school dining room for part of the morning because the table has yet to come <e> <s> there should be no need of simplistic questions as to whether we believe that the bright children should be aided to reach their full potential <e> <s> this is surely below the level of the debate <e>", "<cs> what we are talking about here is the transfer of resources <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister a question because when i asked a factual question earlier it turned out to be the right question and i finally got the right answer <e> <s> is it true that in the local authorities spent a sum of some million on buying places anyway in grant aided schools <e> <s> is the sum of money we are now talking about million in addition to that million <e>", "<cs> nor do i what i said was that an earlier intervention which implied that we were not concerned with the education of bright children was below the standard of debate <e> <s> i was not referring to any point made by lord james <e>", "<cs> since the noble viscount lord simon has been interrupted i should like to ask him whether he would not agree or to ask the noble baroness lady young whether she would not agree that one substantial difference between the conurbations and the rural areas is that though the service may be expensive it exists <e> <s> in many rural areas there is no alternative to get a child to school <e>", "<cs> the minister has been interrupted and one appreciates the fact that over supper she has had to adjust to the result of the division <e> <s> i have in my hand a letter which i received from a nursery school organization <e>", "<cs> very well i shall seek to do so <e>"]
