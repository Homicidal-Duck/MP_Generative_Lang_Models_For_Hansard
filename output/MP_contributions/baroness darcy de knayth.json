["<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for initiating this debate and for giving us the opportunity to hear two maiden speakers whom i should like to congratulate most warmly on extremely interesting speeches <e> <s> i should also like to express my admiration for the work done by the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw <e> <s> i have no intention of likening the noble lord lord winstanley to the mafia but having been involved in the sit-in last week at stoke mandeville when ex-patients occupied two wards at that hospital i really did feel that in presenting us this week with an opportunity to take part in this debate he was making an offer that i could not refuse <e>", "<cs> may i also support my noble friend <e> <s> as he has already said these schools are totally unlike other independent schools <e> <s> the important point is that the education of almost all the children attending these schools is paid for by the local authorities <e> <s> they are as the warnock report says part of the national system of educational provision in a way that independent schools are not <e> <s> surely these schools <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words to my noble friends amendment <e> <s> we covered the arguments fairly fully in the previous amendment about the advantages of representations on governing bodies of people with day-to-day experience of disabled people <e> <s> the noble baronesss usual argument about waiting for warnock surely is not applicaable here <e> <s> maintained schools are already referred to in subsection <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will feel that she can accept this mild and sensible amendment <e> <s> it is a glorious opportunity for her to show willing by accepting this amendment <e> <s> i warmly support it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friends amendment very warmly indeed <e> <s> i am going to go into this matter in some detail <e>", "<cs> may i point out that we are not only talking about the choice between one special school and another but between special schools and the ordinary schools to which in many cases the less severely disabled may be able to go <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i ask the minister whether she agrees that if section of the act had been implemented something for which we have been waiting for years already <e>", "<cs> i am not quite so convinced as the noble lord lord vaizey <e> <s> i am full of misgivings <e> <s> i would take issue with the noble baroness first of all about section of the act <e> <s> i suggest that it was not brought in in the circumstances which she suggested and i think the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge will bear me out <e> <s> it was a government amendment at report <e> <s> the noble baroness lady phillips brought in an amendment at committee and the <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak very briefly and ask the noble baroness two questions <e> <s> when the new bill dealing with special education is introduced can she assure us that section will be implemented <e> <s> i have not given the noble baroness notice of my second question but i should be extremely grateful if she can find out the answer and perhaps write to me before the report stage <e> <s> it is something which also cropped up at the same time in the education act <e> <s> it is about amending the standards for school premises regulations and the further education regulations because during the report stage of the act i withdrew an amendment which tried to ensure that school buildings would be made accessible for the handicapped <e> <s> this was in order to try to close the loophole which exists in section of the chronically sick and disabled persons act <e> <s> i withdrew the amendment because the noble baroness lady stedman gave me an undertaking that these two regulations would be amended and that design guidance would be issued <e> <s> although it is perfectly true that design guidance has indeed been issued and it is a very good booklet as far as i can discover the regulations have not been amended <e> <s> if they have not i wonder why not and if <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my thanks to those expressed by other noble lords to the noble baroness lady young who has put in so much work on this and also back up what the noble lord lord renton has said about the complication of this clause <e> <s> i had hoped for very much more <e> <s> i had hoped for an inclusion in clauses and and also at least in the whole of clause whereas now we have only this slightly emasculated subsection <e> <s> as the noble lord lord renton has said we have just got to have faith and trust <e> <s> we do not know what we will be given but i should like to thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that at least it represents a glimmer of hope for the parents of handicapped children that one day they may achieve parity with the parents of non-handicapped children <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank my noble friend for giving us the opportunity to discuss the international year of disabled people and also the opportunity to hear the maiden speech of the noble viscount lord mersey <e> <s> for me he has given an added poignancy to the song of flanders and swann on the armadillo but also it was a fascinating and informative speech and i hope we shall hear him again very often <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord wilson said clause as it stands is really no more than we have at the moment <e> <s> his amendment no <e> <s> is gloriously simple as indeed is amendment no <e> <s> but i am not certain whether complying with the aforesaid sections of the said act actually strengthens it because those sections contain the proviso where practicable and reasonable <e> <s> if i am wrong and by implication the onus is placed on the developer to prove that proper provision is unreasonable and impracticable i should be very happy to support that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words in support of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i think it would be helpful to have a known person to whom all general inquiries on access could be channelled <e> <s> i should like to underline what my noble friend said about the access action groups which cover many types of disability and not just the wheelchair but the blind and the ambulant disabled <e> <s> they are necessary to keep a watchful eye open and to improve access at the grass roots <e> <s> these groups cannot operate in isolation <e> <s> they must co-operate with the local authorities <e> <s> therefore this access liaison officer would be an essential and valuable member of any access action group <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposed new clause by the government seems to cover all the points made in lord campbell of croys amendment and i should like to thank the minister for all the work that he has done on it and the scottish office in general who have been very courteous and most helpful <e> <s> i am delighted to learn that they are going to make similar provision in the disabled persons no <e> <s> bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief but i should just like to say how glad i am that the planning circular will make it clear how essential it is to have an access officer for a local authority because although we know there are only two local authorities in scotland who have not designated one i think it is important to have it in black and white <e> <s> as the noble lord lord winstanley said at report stage surely it is the business of parliament as a whole to make sure that if something is necessary it is done everywhere <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i should like to point out that i read the second reading debate which included the worries of the blind and the ambulant disabled <e> <s> at the back of the code of practice there is listed the people on the drafting committee <e> <s> the blind the ambulant disabled and many forms of the disabled were all represented on this drafting committee <e> <s> presumably they approved the specification for the ramping of kerbs <e> <s> i know that the code of practice was sent out in draft form for approval by many other organisations for the disabled <e> <s> that answers that point <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank the noble baroness very much for the honesty of her reply <e> <s> she has not given me a great deal of hope but i am most grateful to her for being so honest <e> <s> while i would welcome a circular i feel that as we are dealing only with new crossings it is not really very much to ask to put it down in black and white <e> <s> i am in fact a little surprised that she cannot accept it <e> <s> i will read carefully what she has said but i am slightly at a loss to understand her argument about the width or the narrowness of pavements <e> <s> i understood her first to say that it was unacceptable because certain pavements would be too narrow to be ramped because that would take all the pavement away <e> <s> presumably if you know how narrow is too narrow you would know how wide is wide enough to be able to do it <e> <s> therefore i cannot see why you could not specify for example that all pavements above a certain width on new crossings could have this kerb which apparently the noble baroness thought would not be possible <e> <s> however as she has undertaken to see what can be done we will hear what she has to say at report stage and perhaps if i am not happy i might bring back something on third reading <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i could just take issue with my noble friend on the question of the rear badge <e> <s> i do not think there is any way you can ban it because <e>", "<cs> i am very worried about this amendment <e> <s> i can understand the reason for having the design note but i am concerned about not having the code of practice <e> <s> the noble baroness has said that it is geared to the needs of pupils for example in a primary school you have children of small stature <e> <s> but what about the disabled teacher in a primary school or visiting disabled parents <e> <s> their needs will not then be catered for <e> <s> i think that it is very important to have disabled teachers in education when we have integrated education <e>", "<cs> may i just come back to the noble baroness <e> <s> i accept what she says that the design note may in many cases be more appropriate but would she not agree that if you were constructing a new primary school and you followed the design notes whereby the handrails the loo everything was suitable for a disabled child of that age you would not be catering for the needs of say the wheelchair disabled teacher or the ambulant disabled parent visiting the school <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i must say that i have all along seen some difficulties <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister does deal with the matter in a circular but i felt that it would be better to have something in black and white <e> <s> perhaps my wording could be amended so as to appear in a less strong form such as <e>", "<cs> i agree that there are circulars and circulars and i hope that some firm advice will be given in relation to this matter <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to extend a very warm welcome to the clause as a whole but i should like to say even more strongly than did my noble friend that i am very concerned about the inclusion of subsection which treats schools and university buildings differently <e> <s> i concede that the design note is excellent but we need the code of practice as well <e> <s> i hope that we will be having consultations over this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by congratulating the noble baroness lady lane-fox on her very interesting maiden speech <e> <s> it is particularly appropriate that it should be made on this bill because she has experience of being disabled as a child <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i by leave ask her whether she can at least indicate whether the circular as in the scottish bill might make the question of access around buildings a material consideration for granting planning consent because access outside the building as well as inside the building is equally important <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness very much and i have pleasure in asking leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> it does seem eminently reasonable as it allows time to decide who the bodies will be and merely ensures that there will be independent judges <e>", "<cs> my lords i can be extremely brief <e> <s> i think we have achieved a great deal in this bill in relation to access <e> <s> it is extremely welcome and i should like to thank the minister for her additions to the bill <e> <s> i am only disappointed that educational buildings have been treated differently <e> <s> others have spoken already about this but i should like to underline what my noble friend lady masham said about the code of practice not relating to educational buildings and just put on record the dismay of organisations concerned with the disabled at this omission <e> <s> however i feel that very much can be done if the proposed circular is a really strong one <e>", "<cs> i should first like to thank the minister for her reply but i am inclined to agree with the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i too am not totally convinced by what she said <e> <s> i should very much welcome it if we could have further correspondence on this subject and see whether we can clear up the incongruity of the wording of this clause in relation to the purely physically handicapped <e> <s> i should like to thank noble lords for their great support for this amendment particularly the noble lord lord alexander <e> <s> it is a rather complicated amendment and it deals slightly in semantics which is why i did not speak to it at the same time as amendment no <e> <s> which is an extremely clear cut amendment <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for her reply but i am not really convinced by it <e> <s> she is right in saying that in a sense this amendment was trying to put right what was wrong with the other one but as i said earlier it can very well stand on its own <e>", "<cs> i too would like to support the amendment <e> <s> i do not in the least mind if amendments nos <e> <s> and cannot be called because if this amendment is carried the points will <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i am not sure that i agree with her <e> <s> i perhaps did not make it clear when i was explaining the amendment that i really did not think that the choice for the ordinary child and the choice for the disabled child were anything like the same <e> <s> although the act and this bill use the same words about resources and education we are choosing in the case of the ordinary child between two schools within the same school system and for the disabled child whether it is forced into a special school where it might be educated in an ordinary school or whether it can go to the ordinary neighbourhood school <e>", "<cs> i can appreciate that the whole difficulty of this bill is that we are embracing such a vastly differing lot of children <e> <s> but the noble baroness would agree that with the failure of my amendment no <e> <s> if a purely disabled child happened to live in a local education authority area where there was not a suitable school that would be a child who would have a statement and would thus be treated in this different way in the judging of resources as to where it goes <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for her reply and think i shall have to be guided by the noble baroness lady david in this matter as the amendment is also in her name <e> <s> she hoped we would be able to get it through with a reasonable amount of support but i wonder whether she agrees with me that that may not be the case and that in any event the benches are not very full <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too should like to give this amendment my strong support <e> <s> it is essential for ensuring integration <e> <s> we have talked about the importance of the review <e> <s> a five-year plan is even more important <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept it <e> <s> it will be helpful to them <e> <s> you need a systematic plan particularly where resources are at a premium <e> <s> no one would argue that integration can be achieved satisfactorily over night <e> <s> it is important to encourage the leas to plan for what they hope to accomplish over a reasonable time <e> <s> without a planned approach integration is unlikely to work satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> she had thought hard about it and i appreciate that but she has not convinced me that her proposed amendment will go all the way to what i want <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord renton said that he thinks that the amendment that i moved is in the right place and then i was given great confidence and enthusiasm by the noble lord lord winstanley who talking as a doctor gave his support <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley got the <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak very much in favour of this amendment because it is crucially important and this ought to be done by regulations <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> could she say whether when a copy is served on you it is when it is delivered or when it is posted <e>", "<cs> i am delighted because the noble baroness lady david took the words out of my mouth <e> <s> i was going to suggest that the minister offered to compromise and come down to days <e> <s> i am not nit-picking when i ask whether serve means delivered or posted because if the post takes seven days it is half the period of days whereas with days it would give us a little leeway <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for saying that she will look into the matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a very few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> this is an important question <e> <s> i believe that many organisations concerned with disabled people consider it wrong that the appeals committees are given only advisory powers <e> <s> i would back up what the noble baroness lady david said namely that we must also leave the right of appeal to the secretary of state as an extra safeguard <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness the minister has not really satisfied me <e> <s> there is quite a lot of support for this amendment but i will take it away and have a look at it <e> <s> too much power is in the hands of the local authority <e> <s> i am wondering whether or not a little less could be struck out so that the local education authority would not be the judge <e> <s> perhaps the words in their opinion and they are satisfied that could be struck out <e> <s> however i will think about it <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton for suggesting that we have a general discussion <e> <s> i wish to stress straight away that i am delighted that the government have tabled an amendment following the assurance in another place to try to do something on these lines <e> <s> i had intended to say that i would be bold enough to suggest that amendment no <e> <s> perhaps did a little more than either the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord renton or the governments amendment but after lord rentons splendid speech i hardly need say anything in favour of it <e>", "<cs> i should like to say one or two words on the amendment because i presume that if it is accepted amendment no <e> <s> cannot be called <e>", "<cs> i hope it will be in order if i say a few words at this stage <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister does not feel that she can withdraw the amendment for the time being for consideration and then try to come back with a more effective and more acceptable proposal <e> <s> as i said earlier i very much appreciate that the government have brought forward the amendment <e> <s> i think the minister will recall that when we had the meeting that she very kindly arranged i had not seen the amendment <e> <s> it was only later the same evening that i studied the amendment and realised what i believe to be its implications <e> <s> can the minister say whether there will be the broadest possible interpretation of the childs special education needs as i asked earlier <e>", "<cs> may i say a few brief words in favour of this amendment <e> <s> all the voluntary organisations and also the advisory centre for education are very much in favour of leaving out this subsection because they feel that it is discriminatory <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether she does not feel that we ought to move forward from the act which was drawn up at a time when the policy was that if you were handicapped you should go to a special school where possible and only to an ordinary school where that was not possible <e> <s> now the whole process is reversed <e>", "<cs> may i say a couple of words <e> <s> i am not in favour of abolishing corporal punishment within the ordinary school system for children with special educational needs only although i am in favour of abolishing it generally <e> <s> but i wonder whether the minister could indicate how she would look on an amendment applying to pupils in special schools only or perhaps she might wish to think about how she might feel about it <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i have now grasped the significance of the word may <e> <s> i thank her for putting me right <e> <s> i am still not happy about the element of compulsion but i do not see much point in having a division at this hour of the day <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of this amendment too <e> <s> while i am in favour of leaving out this whole sub-paragraph i notice that during the committee stage of the education scotland bill the noble earl lord mansfield speaking to an amendment similar to this one said in col <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness says that there are cases where it might be reasonable not to comply would it not be best to write into the bill the words fails without reasonable excuse <e>", "<cs> while thanking the noble baroness for her reply may i ask her this <e> <s> when we are talking about keeping and disclosure of statements are we only referring to the statement and not the documents that lie behind the statement <e>", "<cs> then could i ask the minister what is going to happen to the records and reports because there is absolutely no provision as to what is going to happen to them <e> <s> these are the things i am concerned about <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to come back again but i am not very conversant with the act <e> <s> is there anything about destruction or does it refer only to keeping and disclosure in the act <e>", "<cs> so there would be nothing on the destruction of these records and reports <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for her reply but i cannot say that i am at all cheerful about it <e> <s> i would like to read what she has said and think about the whole matter and perhaps have some correspondence with her if she is willing <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few comments on this amendment because noble lords will see that i have tabled amendment no <e> <s> a which is an attempt at a compromise after the minister agreeing on the first day of the committee stage to look at the possibility of allowing days in which a parent could make representations when he is served with a copy of the proposed statement under clause <e>", "<cs> i am happy to say that for once i am delighted with the noble baronesss reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add a few brief words in support of this amendment <e> <s> we have all said that there is a great deal of worry about monitoring <e> <s> it is interesting that professor ed martin who was responsible for the united states education of all handicapped children act said at a conference on special educational needs in southampton a few weeks ago that some resistance had been encountered after the first year or two of that act which had not been anticipated <e> <s> they had spent so much time talking beforehand that they had rather neglected selling the act afterwards <e> <s> i believe this amendment would help us to see how things progress <e> <s> the noble baroness the minister said that she was willing to consider any amendments which would improve this bill and i am sure that this amendment would do that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like first to thank the minister for the number of replies she has made <e> <s> i am sorry she has had to go into the matter so often <e> <s> i should like also to express my gratitude to the noble baroness lady david for her comments <e> <s> i do not think the amendment asks much but it does look at the childs special educational needs <e> <s> i realise it is singling out one particular aspect but i had tried to prove that it is really an aspect which is singled out in its essence <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like extremely briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems absolutely fundamental for making the bill work <e> <s> the minister said on second reading at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give the noble lord lord renton my fullest support <e> <s> indeed noble lords will observe that i have added my name to his amendment <e> <s> in fact i much prefer it to my own <e> <s> not only is his simpler but it is also much stronger because it goes all the way in demanding total access to all information <e> <s> the noble lord has already referred to the united states of america where under the family education rights and privacy act which is public law to all parents have the right to inspect and review all official records files and data directly related to their children <e> <s> i should like to stress that these specifically include psychological tests health data family background information and verified reports of serious and recurrent behaviour patterns <e> <s> so the extreme cases which are the argument against the case for total access in this country are not excluded there <e> <s> i think that there is much truth in the view that once one allows any exceptions the case is lost <e> <s> the only <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend the minister <e> <s> she said that she felt that this amendment met some but not all the objections that were raised at committee <e> <s> it overcomes nearly all of them <e> <s> she says that with regard to subsection the parents would know the name of the professional who refused information <e> <s> but they would still be given the right to discuss this information with the professsional <e> <s> if one does not reveal the name we are not gaining anything because they will all hide behind the cloak of anonymity and refuse to reveal information <e> <s> she said that parents often would not understand the reports anyway but i would point out that parents do not have to see the reports <e> <s> they only see them if they ask and want to see them <e> <s> she also felt it was not necessary to have anything in the bill about controlling the circulation of reports <e> <s> there are genuine worries about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble baroness a question since i was puzzled about the wording of the governments amendment <e> <s> under subsection a parent can have a meeting with an officer of the authority if he disagrees with any part of the proposed statement <e> <s> but under subsection a he may ask for one or more meetings with the appropriate person or persons if he disagrees with any part of the assessment in question <e> <s> surely the term assessment covers not only the examination at which the parent can of course be present but also the conclusions drawn by the professionals from the examination and consequently the reports that they make <e> <s> if the parent cannot see the report how is he to know whether he disagrees with any part of the assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give my fullest support to lord renton <e> <s> i think that in the end the main reason why i withdrew my compromise amendment no <e> <s> to clause last night was because i became convinced that there can be no half-measures <e> <s> and as the noble lord lord winstanley said in committee when we first debated this subject at col <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i really had hoped that we could in one aspect at least have the whole loaf for the child with special educational needs <e> <s> i am very grateful to all noble lords who have spoken and i think it does show how strongly they feel how much better our amendment is <e> <s> however i am perfectly sure that the speeches here and the support expressed is not indicative of what the voting would be <e> <s> i do not propose to divide the house but i will allow the amendment to be negatived <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for her reply but i am extremely disappointed in it it is exactly what i had feared <e> <s> i only asked about the first circumstance in which a statement would be discontinued if a child moved to another area <e> <s> the noble baroness has given me the same explanation of those circumstances as she did in committee <e> <s> it appears to me that the special educational provisions existing in ordinary schools in the area is the determining factor as regards what will be the special educational provision for the child <e> <s> it is very gloomy because it only goes to show how necessary were all our amendments on planning ensuring access special educational provision in ordinary schools and reporting on progress <e> <s> having probed and found what i think is lacking in the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for initiating this debate <e> <s> after what the noble lord lord wilson of langside said i shall try to make my thanks sound genuine <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell and congratulate him on his pretty broad portrayal of the scene although he said that he had left out several aspects <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a brief but none the less wholehearted word of support on my noble friends amendment <e> <s> the ground has already been very eloquently covered by the three noble baronesses and so i shall not paint any more pictures of the state of things <e> <s> the amendment is not really asking for much <e> <s> it is asking only for the secretary of state to have power to provide for central funding of certain hospitals <e> <s> as my noble friend said it is very important to maintain the standards <e> <s> perhaps the minister will say that the power already exists i do not know <e> <s> but if he does say so i shall be delighted though i think that the power should be written into the bill and should be used <e>", "<cs> the minister talks a lot about having regard to a persons needs but i do not think he has yet answered my question on disregard which i hope he will because it is very important <e> <s> he said in answer to my noble friend lord ingleby that mobility allowance could be disregarded <e> <s> what about all the other benefits designed to offset the extra cost of disabled life such as supplementary benefits dependants allowance <e>", "<cs> do i gather from the ministers reply that if it is left open to local authorities some local authorities may disregard those essential allowances and others will not and that there will be disparity between them <e>", "<cs> before we go any further with these amendments <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister two questions because i was all for supporting the leaving out of clause <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that we are talking only about the deliberate abandonment of assets because i was going to ask the minister how he felt about this matter <e> <s> first in the case of proving deliberate abandonment of assets would the onus be on the local authority to prove the deliberate abandonment of assets <e> <s> secondly i think that the minister said that one of these amendments limited the matter to the deliberate abandonment of assets but from reading the amendments i cannot see which it is <e> <s> i do not know whether i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> if i did not misunderstand him would it not be much better to put something into the bill saying that it is limited to the case where a person knowingly and with the express intention of avoiding payment disposes of these assets <e> <s> it is very unclear and i do not know whether i have misunderstood the position <e>", "<cs> but nowhere does it actually say that does it <e>", "<cs> has the minister been able to put his finger on the part of the bill which says that we are only talking about deliberate avoidance <e> <s> is the phrase deliberate avoidance in the national assistance act <e> <s> i am afraid that i have left my copy outside the chamber <e>", "<cs> but does this also refer to deliberate avoidance <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lady masham said i was about to speak i had better speak now <e> <s> the minister has been saying that the clue lies in section of the national assistance act and having been through all eight subsections of that provision i can find nothing about deliberate dodging as the noble lord lord wallace put it <e> <s> subsection refers to schedule which being four pages long i have not had an opportunity to digest but i see no mention of deliberate avoidance <e> <s> i appreciate that it may to a certain extent answer the point raised by lady masham but as the provisions refers to ten shillings and six pence it may be rather obsolete anyway <e> <s> if the minister has a better grasp of section and schedule than i have perhaps he would be prepared to explain it a little more thoroughly <e>", "<cs> i think he was answering my noble friend <e> <s> i asked twice about deliberate avoidance <e> <s> i did not ask about assets <e> <s> the minister told me at that stage that he had already answered my question three times by reference to section <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i am wrong and i will read <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that it is particularly essential for facilities for further education to be integrated for the physically handicapped along with their able-bodied peers at a time when they are beginning to enter into the adult able-bodied world <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank noble lords for their support particularly the noble baroness lady lockwood <e> <s> her experience is very valuable <e> <s> i should like to reiterate what the noble lord lord ennals has said in reply to my noble friend lady masham of ilton that there are provisions in clauses and where the concept of reasonable and unreasonable is written in <e> <s> the point is that it is unlawful to discriminate <e> <s> if conduct is reasonable <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words in favour of this clause <e> <s> i was extremely disappointed to hear the minister but delighted that the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead gave us the benefit of his experience <e> <s> we are extremely lucky to have both the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> i did not like the existing paragraph from the moment i saw it <e> <s> first i find it very difficult to understand and in the second part it really did seem to be unacceptable because i did not see why the able-bodied person should not benefit from some schemes which would benefit the disabled less <e> <s> one could probably argue that precisely because of their disability disabled people are always going to benefit slightly less to some extent from any scheme which is not specifically designed to benefit the disabled <e>", "<cs> i feel quite strongly that this clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> it is very important that the able-bodied also come into it as section of the sex discrimination act applied to men so this would make the act apply to the non-disabled <e> <s> it would also i think apply to families of disabled people <e> <s> say an able-bodied family with a handicapped child was refused accommodation on the grounds of that childs handicap it would be the able-bodied parents who would need this section <e> <s> a person who is at risk from an inherited disease but who has not actually manifested any of the signs of that disease might be discriminated against on those grounds although he would not qualify as disabled at that time <e> <s> i know nobody else is really with me on this matter but i feel strongly that the clause should stand part <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly in support of the amendment of the noble lord lord kilmarnock as it reads at present <e> <s> but i wonder whether otherwise there might possibly be a compromise <e> <s> i think that in the chronically sick and disabled persons act when dealing with the representation of disabled people on committees mention is made of the desirability of having members who are themselves disabled <e> <s> i wonder how the noble lord lord campbell of croy would look upon that <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of croy for his full reply and i totally appreciate his point about not wanting to limit the choice of chairman to someone who should be full-time because the best person may not he able to give his service full-time <e> <s> i am glad he agrees that we can have one more full-time person and i think his suggestion of putting down an amendment of and one other on report is a very good one <e> <s> i have no hesitation in withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear the noble lords words because although it is a very small amendment it is really quite important and i think it strengthens this bill a great deal <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words here because i totally support my noble friend on the principle <e> <s> i think it is necessary to define discrimination and to embody the concept of unreasonableness <e> <s> however i am not sure whether she would cover all the aspects of discrimination <e> <s> indeed i do not think that she would cover the instance she gave earlier where the disabled person was discriminated against when applying for a job <e> <s> i do not think it covers the circumstance where a disabled person is treated less favourably than an able-bodied one would be in identical circumstances <e> <s> therefore i hope that she might reconsider the wording of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not completely happy with the amendment mainly because it allows the idea of reasonable discrimination but i know that as the noble earl lord longford has said at committee stage a great many people were very worried including as the noble earl mentioned my noble friend lady masham who i am afraid cannot be here today because she has a very important meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very worried when i first saw this amendment and then i realised that the noble earl lord longford was probably trying to meet the noble lord lord renton who had been worried about the question of the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill being represented on the commission <e> <s> actually i think that it is perhaps a bit much to ask that half of the total number on the commission should themselves be disabled <e> <s> i think that that half should be composed of at least two disabled people and some qualified to represent them <e> <s> i have a suggestion as to a provision which if perhaps i may read it out the noble earl will consider whether it would be a good idea to bring it forward at third reading <e> <s> it would read <e>", "<cs> my lords i had already spoken to amendment no <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the question was put and it was agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he can predict the annual rate of transfer of children with special educational needs from special schools to ordinary schools and if he can what the predicted rate is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to have succeeded admirably in meeting both the fears of the noble lord lord renton about the representation of the mentally handicapped and the mentally sick in the commission and also the requirements of the noble lord lord ennals that a substantial number of the members of the commission should be themselves disabled <e> <s> i certainly think the noble earl has the balance just about right now and i am very happy to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a few brief words of support for the bill <e> <s> i think that the bill is necessary <e> <s> we have i believe improved it and i hope that it is more acceptable now that it relates only to unreasonable discrimination <e> <s> it had to a certain extent been misunderstood previously <e> <s> now that it relates to unreasonable discrimination against i should have thought it would be more palatable to the noble baroness lady macleod and to the noble lady lady saltoun <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment because i think it is important to have people who are themselves disabled on the commission <e> <s> with a number of not less than two disabled people on a commission of between eight and people we have achieved rather more than proportional representation <e> <s> however that is quite right as the commission is dealing specifically with the problems of disablement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment because i think that it is an improvement upon the amendment that my noble friend moved at the committee stage and then withdrew <e> <s> this amendment is more comprehensive <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord campbell that the manuscript amendment is an improvement upon the amendment on the marshalled list because even if the english is still not breathtaking it is at least much more comprehensible <e> <s> so i am very happy to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not congratulate the noble lord lord campbell of croy on his handling of the bill or wish it a safe passage because when i did that to the noble earl lord longford last week the whole thing promptly sank like the titanic <e> <s> i will just thank the noble lord lord campbell of croy for accepting so many amendments and in many cases improving upon them <e> <s> i think that it is a better and tidier bill <e> <s> i made no secret of the fact that i preferred the noble earls bill because i do believe that making discrimination unlawful would speed the educative process and assist the commission to do its job <e> <s> it is interesting that corads last recommendation in chapter paragraphs to was that until anti-discrimination through legislation is introduced an office should be set up to investigate individual cases of alleged discrimination <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i had not intended to speak but i was so amazed by the words of the noble lords lord mottistone and lord peyton that i think there is a lack of understanding of the problem <e> <s> we are not in any way asking for sympathy <e> <s> we are not in any way asking for good intentions <e> <s> that would be the last thing that we should seek to embody in the bill <e> <s> we are asking that someone on this corporation should have an informed opinion and full appreciation of the specific problems of the disabled with regard to transport <e>", "<cs> i should like just very briefly to support this amendment because i think it is very important that those who are not too severely disabled to use public transport should be enabled to do so <e> <s> noble lords and i think particularly the noble baroness lady lane-fox have been so eloquent in the case they have made that i can be extremely brief <e> <s> but as you have heard radar and the federation of the london dial-a-ride schemes and the joint committee on mobility for the disabled of which i am a member all feel it necessary to write this duty into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few brief words to support what has already been stated <e> <s> there is in fact little that i can say <e> <s> to be realistic i believe like the noble lord lord banks that the government amendment gives us as much as we can possibly expect from public transport <e> <s> i was delighted to hear the explanation of the noble earl lord avon <e> <s> i welcome it most warmly and thank him for producing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i have put my name to it because i feel it is essential that something about special transport services should be clearly stated in the bill despite the noble earls assurances <e> <s> my noble friend lady masham of ilion who cannot be here today says that she feels the same <e> <s> i should like to make two points <e> <s> the first is from the noble lord lord bancroft who has had to leave the chamber <e> <s> he very much wants to have assurances about the future of the taxis of the new accessible design when in two years time they start to come into operation <e> <s> he seeks only the simple government assurance that the london regional transport authority will use its powers to subsidise disabled peoples journeys by taxi <e> <s> he makes the point that this would give london the best most flexible and in public expenditure terms the cheapest system of public transport for disabled <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a brief word of support because i do not think i am going to get a word in otherwise because i have got into a slight muddle with this general discussion that we have had <e> <s> the two amendments i was supporting were the two in the name of the noble lord <e> <s> lord stallard so i did not get in on the general discussion at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak to amendment no <e> <s> may i query that decision <e> <s> is it not possible to have amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> could we not have the cut-off age at but a little extra for those in schools and in youth training schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord henderson of brompton for his advice <e> <s> this amendment was originally moved in committee by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton and i have put it down again as a probing amendment to enable the minister to repeat to the house some of the very full and detailed explanations he gave about the severe disablement allowance during a very useful meeting that we had last week <e> <s> a lot of what the minister said will probably emerge when he replies to amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord <e> <s> lord ennals <e> <s> so i will confine myself to the question of the young disabled who if they claim severe disablement allowance before the age of have only to prove their incapacity for work whereas after the age of they will have to prove that they are per cent <e> <s> disabled as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for the very full answer that he has given <e> <s> it has helped to clarify a lot of things and in some cases it may have allayed peoples fears <e> <s> i am glad to hear that the ncip provisions will broadly be followed by the sda <e> <s> i hope that they will err on the side of leniency when deciding which courses do equate with incapacity to work <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief but i should wholeheartedly like to support the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> i do so because the more i have wrestled with the questions on my previous amendment no <e> <s> about staking claims and about which courses equate with work and which do not etc <e> <s> the more i have become convinced that the raising of the age limit across the board is the simplest and most satisfactory method of dealing with the situation and i mean that quite sincerely <e> <s> it has been a long slow process and i am convinced <e> <s> courses change the status of courses change and the noble lord the minister said of my amendment no <e> <s> when it was in the name of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton at the committee stage at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief but firm in my support <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes made a very good case for her amendment <e> <s> it seems discriminatory and very unfair when you think of the cost in financial and human terms to the carer <e> <s> one must consider the great saving to the state by keeping disabled people looked after by carers at home <e> <s> it must cost far more keeping them in hospital or in homes <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate whether the code of practice might be suitable for being made the subject of legislative enforcement <e> <s> can the minister confirm that the employment interests of the disabled will require legislative protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord annan for enabling us to debate a subject which is so important to us all <e> <s> realising what expert knowledge many of your lordships have of writing publishing of education and of economics i was initially very hesitant in taking part today <e> <s> but it is precisely because books are important for everyone that i felt that i should give the view of the ordinary consumer <e> <s> books are for people of all ages and it seems to me that the imposition of vat on books would adversely affect people at every stage of their lives and particularly those least able to bear the extra cost which the noble lord lord weidenfeld has already touched on <e> <s> where children are concerned any book which encourages them to read is a good thing and we would be doing anything but increasing the standards of literacy by raising the price of books which are already having to compete as the noble lord lord beloff has said for childrens interests with television and with the computer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord kilmarnock for enabling us to debate an issue which has caused concern right down the line <e> <s> i should also like to apologise to him for not being in the chamber to hear what he said but i look forward to reading it tomorrow <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> i shall be extremely brief as i speak as a total layman <e> <s> it seems to me to be unnecessary to make the first review a duty rather than an option and to provide for further reviews when the inner london education authority has been the subject of several external reviews in the last few years as well as having set up three independent reviews of its own position <e> <s> the uncertainty created by the possibility of breakup or transfer in functions cannot make long-term planning easy as the right reverend prelate the bishop of london said so eloquently when moving the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i speak with far more trepidation than the noble lord lord bancroft <e> <s> anyway he is much too modest and underestimates his debating powers <e> <s> he spoke with an immense amount of expertise and authority <e> <s> however thanks to the noble lord the minister i shall carry on <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the disabled persons loo was happily very well equipped with a tap labelled drinking water but that the label has been removed in the last few days <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to support these amendments because i feel that it is essential to ensure that grant-making schemes are set up particularly in the metropolitan counties and a duty must be written into the bill to ensure that those voluntary organisations whose activities are county-wide or which extend beyond the areas of any particular constituent council continue to be funded <e> <s> you really could have serious problems <e> <s> greater manchester has voluntary schemes and of these only four are confined to single districts which means that schemes will be in jeopardy if there is no grant-making scheme <e> <s> it is perfectly possible though i know the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls feels differently that there will be no scheme if there is no duty to establish one <e> <s> i hesitate to take issue with the noble lord lord renton over his interpretation of amendment no <e> <s> c but i think that in fact the words and each refer to the metropolitan counties <e> <s> they merely ensure that each metropolitan county has the scheme and not that every i see the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that they would not be able to apply for funds outside the area in which they were which is defined in one of the subsections but surely they will be entitled to apply for funds <e> <s> that does not necessarily mean as i had understood the noble lord to say that they would actually get the funds <e> <s> the series of amendments of the noble baroness and amendment no <e> <s> d which is in my name complement each other but both can perfectly well stand on their own <e> <s> i will say nothing more about mine now <e> <s> i just wanted to support most heartily the series of amendments of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have supported this amendment and those who put their names to it and also the noble lord lord campbell of alloway who said that it can only do good and cannot conceivably do any harm <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the minister <e> <s> i agree with what he said about the collective view of the constituent councils <e> <s> the noble lord has offered me something quite considerable <e> <s> on the understanding that i might come back at third reading if the noble lord does not manage to get around this difficulty i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly support this sensible amendment because i was horrified to find that when discussing the dial-a-ride service in tyne and wear which covers five districts to learn that two-thirds of five was rounded up to four <e> <s> i hope that the minister will look as kindly on this amendment as he did on mine just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome this amendment most warmly and also to thank the minister for his very full explanation to the effect that it has the force of the law behind it <e> <s> the amendment does all that the minister undertook to do at report stage to ensure that any scheme set up addresses itself as a whole to the needs of the entire area <e> <s> i think it is true to say that some of the voluntary organisations would have liked an annual review but i think equally one can argue that it is preferable to keep matters under continuous review and as the minister has said that it is not intermittent <e>", "<cs> i should like despite my increased age to say a few words in support of this amendment <e> <s> i must first thank the noble lord lord somers for his good wishes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i too may ask the minister something <e> <s> first i hope that he did not think i was criticising the plans to amend clauses and <e> <s> i think i said that they were very welcome <e> <s> however as my noble friend has just said i think we need to have amendments directly to encourage mainstream operators as well <e> <s> not being as quick as my noble friend lord henderson of brompton to grasp what is on offer which is very difficult to know without seeing amendments to clauses and may i ask the minister whether he is saying that the government amendments will give direct and firm encouragement to mainstream public transport operators to provide appropriate provision as well <e> <s> is he saying that <e>", "<cs> may i also add seconds in support of this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister will look encouragingly on the spirit of the amendment even if he cannot accept it as it is <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> he painted a clear overall picture of what will happen if clause as it stands is interpreted literally <e> <s> in particular he talked about school buses <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on services run primarily for the disabled because i too believe that the words wholly or mainly would mean that these services were no longer eligible for fuel tax rebate <e> <s> a good example exists in chesterfield where a private operator by arrangement with the county council provides a dial-a-ride service for disabled people <e> <s> members of the general public can use the service at a premium fare <e> <s> the services run under a road service licence and under this bill it would be a registered local service <e> <s> at present its availability to the general public means that fuel tax rebate is paid <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very warmly though i am a much less frequent rail traveller than my noble friend so i cannot speak with his knowledge and experience <e> <s> i also know that british rail has been very good in improving facilities for disabled travellers and it has done some excellent things for people to whom mobility is vital <e> <s> i appreciate the ministers points about changes to bus services <e> <s> however here we are talking about routes on which people have been able to travel because they have been going by rail and on which i think i am right in saying it will not in fact be guaranteed by the ministers amendments that they will be able to travel when there is a substitute bus service <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord bottomley for giving us this timely opportunity to look at the needs of voluntary organisations <e> <s> if i may i should like to congratulate him on the comprehensive picture that he gave <e> <s> i do not think that he is in the chamber at the moment but i should also like to apologise for missing the beginning of his opening speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give a warm welcome to the bill which gives disabled people more control over their lives and should result in a better assessment of their needs and more co-ordinated services <e> <s> the noble baroness lady lane-fox has asked me to say that she too welcomes the bill most warmly <e>", "<cs> i too should particularly like to support amendment no <e> <s> which is thankfully pretty free of complicated-looking mathematics and which would help those disabled people who would not as the bill stands receive protection because they were earning just enough to pay contributions although they were on a low wage <e> <s> i am a fool about pensions but i think the noble baroness lady trumpington has offered some help for precisely these people i am not quite certain what so i shall carry on supporting amendment no <e> <s> for the moment <e> <s> i feel very strongly that we should do everything possible to encourage disabled people to return to work or to enable them to continue working for as long as possible <e>", "<cs> may i also welcome this group of amendments very briefly <e> <s> as my noble friend has already said this is something that i brought up at second reading <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> deserves particularly warm thanks in that it ensures that any views expressed by the disabled person or his representative as to the need for interpretation services or what form those services should take will be taken into account <e> <s> perfection would have been if people with communication difficulties were given the same degree of control as a disabled person is given when appointing his representative <e> <s> but i feel that we have been given very much more than half the loaf much more like three-quarters of the loaf <e> <s> i should like to say to my noble friend that the british deaf association who had been worried welcome this amendment most warmly <e> <s> the members of the bda are likely to be the biggest single group affected by subsection but as the noble lord lord swinfen has already pointed out there will be many severely physically handicapped people and those with multiple handicaps who have communication difficulties also <e> <s> i should therefore like to thank the minister and my noble friend for making it possible for all these people to have a little more control over their lives <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment most warmly <e> <s> i find it very worrying that as the bill stands it is those in greatest <e>", "<cs> i welcome the statement by the noble baroness about domestic assistance allowance being granted separately for existing beneficiaries <e> <s> i may be stupid about the new beneficiaries but can the noble baroness explain again <e> <s> the noble baroness said that something was going to be done but is it to be done soon <e> <s> i thought she said that the result of the survey was going to be known in two years <e>", "<cs> but can the noble baroness confirm that the new arrangements will start soon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as a member of the mobile bench give a very hearty welcome to the statement <e>", "<cs> i should like first to thank all noble lords who have supported this amendment and indeed all noble lords who have spoken for or against it <e> <s> i am rather surprised that such a small innocuous amendment should stir up such a lot of talk <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady faithfull who from her great experience said what she said about asking permission of a person about their personal details being bandied about and also to the noble lord lord ennals for his well-argued support <e>", "<cs> i am sitting down <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> this amendment may not be the answer but i still think one could write into guidelines some way in which the social fund officer should behave <e> <s> however i shall not divide the committee <e> <s> i shall read what she has said very carefully go away and have a little think and i hope that perhaps the noble baroness may have a little think as well <e> <s> i reserve my right to come back at the next stage with something slightly different <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support my noble friends amendment which i thought he moved in a very cogent and reasonable way <e> <s> the noble viscount lord whitelaw said that this new benefit will extend to a far wider range of people than those who currently receive domestic assistance allowance and this was a point which the noble lord lord renton picked up <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord banks said it will <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of croy for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject which is of great importance to disabled people and to congratulate him on his tenacity in pursuing this subject and the masterly overall picture that he has given us <e> <s> perhaps i may also say what a joy it is to have my noble friend lady masham of ilton back once more in the ranks of the mobile bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his interruption but that figure comes from the departments own document which i believe says that there are valid badges <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously there needs to be stricter policing <e> <s> measures must be taken to tighten the criteria and facilitate stricter policing and enforcement but certain concessions will have to be made and existing ones maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to welcome this very real move by the minister to help the physically and mentally handicapped <e> <s> i apologise that i arrived too late to hear all his remarks <e> <s> i think i agree with my noble friend lord henderson of brompton in what he said concerning the mentally handicapped but as i did not hear his observations i believe i must confine myself to making one point on the question of the physically handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for giving us this opportunity to look at how the voluntary organisations are faring after abolition to consider the ncvos recommendations and to hear the governments response <e> <s> the noble baroness and the noble lord lord banks have between them achieved a masterly portrayal of the overall view <e> <s> i shall narrow things down very much and in comparison i feel rather as if i am looking through a keyhole <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my warm support for these amendments <e> <s> although my name is not on amendment no <e> <s> it is on amendment no <e> <s> and they basically go together <e> <s> these amendments enable local authorities

wish that i could emulate the unscripted eloquence of the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> however i am afraid that your lordships will have to bear with my attempts to decipher a rather scrappy and savaged script <e> <s> first i should like to say on behalf of my noble friend lady masham who is not speaking because of the number of noble lords doing so that she plans to put down an amendment on health education <e> <s> that matter was also of interest to our late colleague the noble baroness lady lane-fox <e> <s> i should like to say how very much we shall miss her <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word or two from the bottom of the noble earls league table on religious education <e> <s> i welcome the amendments promised by the secretary of state and by the minister <e> <s> however the main worry of the catholic church remains that opting out could be deleterious for catholic education <e> <s> the policy is that catholic schools should be open to all catholic children of whatever

yet disabled child who needs stretching <e>", "<cs> as i have put my name to some of the amendments in this group perhaps i may briefly give my warm support particularly to amendment no <e> <s> to clause <e> <s> that amendment will give some positive curriculum entitlement to those statemented children who are excluded from the national curriculum or subject to a modification of it and will

most warmly <e> <s> however i have three questions for the minister <e> <s> first will facilities be interpreted pretty loosely because it is not just a question of physical access as we discussed at a previous stage of the bill but appropriate support services geared to meeting individual needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for what i think she will realise is a disappointing reply <e> <s> i shall reply to her two points <e> <s> her first point concerned the inadequate pool of therapists <e> <s> obviously the lea cannot buy-in speech therapy any more than the health authority can provide it if the speech therapists are not available <e> <s> but i point out that paragraph b states may and not shall <e> <s> obviously if the speech therapists are not available that is an

schools further education higher education and the improved appeal rights for parents of children with statements <e> <s> i very much hope that the other place will leave the amendment on speech and

keep on deleting it every time it crops up in a new bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support amendments nos <e> <s> and most strongly <e> <s> i am delighted to do so as i was not able to he present in committee <e> <s> like the noble lord lord swinfen i have changed my mind since the passage of the act through this house <e> <s> then i felt that the way to encourage local authorities to build more suitable accommodation for disabled people was by not allowing the existing stock to be bought and thereby diminished <e> <s> however i realised at the time that that discriminated against those people who wanted to buy their houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add a few brief but nonetheless warm words of support for the amendment of the noble baroness lady strange <e> <s> as she said it will benefit agencies which give valuable and much needed advice to people with disabilities <e> <s> i very much hope that the minister can accept this amendment which is very modest <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment worries me because as i read it it would once more make it possible to refuse the right to buy to people with disabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support this amendment especially as it would allow the extra costs of disabled life to be taken into account when determining the grant <e> <s> the noble lord lord swinfen has already briefly mentioned those extra costs <e> <s> i must stress that they really concern the basic necessities of life which most people take for granted for example food where people may need to have special diets warmth where extra heating is needed if ones circulation is bad clothing which wears out more quickly if one is using crutches and calipers washing where extra laundry costs are involved if one is incontinent and mobility where many people cannot use public transport and where the mobility allowance although most welcome does not fully cover the cost involved for other forms of transport <e>", "<cs> my lords in adding my warm support for this amendment perhaps i may give my equally warm thanks on my own behalf to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for honouring his commitment to me at report stage to reclose this loophole in the bill which has prevented people with disabilities from exercising their right to buy <e> <s> i must also offer my warm thanks to the minister for indicating that he looks kindly on the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of my concern about the existing patchy provision in relation to access and facilities for disabled visitors <e> <s> the prison reform trust tells me that there is little improvement in the situation in newly built prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us the cost of the programme <e> <s> has she any information on the best age to vaccinate a child <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord lord allen of <e>", "<cs> first perhaps i may thank all noble lords who have given splendid support <e> <s> not a single voice was raised against the amendment but then as the noble lord lord beloff said it was a totally reasonable amendment <e> <s> i thank the minister <e> <s> at first i was slightly disappointed in his package but he certainly knows how to build up to a crescendo <e> <s> he times himself very well <e> <s> i was disappointed at his only raising the level of the dsa to because as

per annum but for specialist equipment for the whole course <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> in a way i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> it makes the matter clearer <e> <s> however i agree with my noble friend lord henderson of brompton who put the case strongly <e> <s> he summed up by saying that nothing less than abolishing the means test would do <e> <s> we need to respond to the individual education needs of the disabled student <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl will consider discussing this further with us <e> <s> i see that he is nodding which means that he will speak to us about possibly freeing the dsa from means testing <e> <s> that is great <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl very much <e> <s> that is helpful <e> <s> i agree that we need time to examine the whole package and that we shall have <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i believe that it is peculiar and unjust to treat students who for example are blind and those who are deaf in different ways when both have high extra costs <e> <s> i thank the noble earl quite a lot for the package <e> <s> i welcome some parts very much <e> <s> i am more lukewarm towards other parts <e> <s> i thank him enormously for his response to the suggestion of further talks with us <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may offer a brief but warm word of support for the amendments <e> <s> predictably it is the mention of students with disabilities which has drawn me into the discussion <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady david said there is little information available on the problems and circumstances faced by students with disabilities <e> <s> it is important to have specific information <e> <s> it is particularly important that we should know exactly what will be the impact of the loans scheme on people who as the noble lord lord dormand of easington said might well have difficulty finding jobs might be in lower paid jobs and especially relevant might have less disposable income to pay off what might be slightly larger loans than their able-bodied peers <e>", "<cs> my lords although my name is not on the amendment i too wholeheartedly support it <e> <s> i should like to endorse what my noble friend lord henderson of brompton said by way of thanks to the minister for meeting us so speedily and for being so willing to listen and <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister has been able to assist on this aspect <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have fully understood the point about the extra costs of disabled life <e> <s> even if a disabled person manages to obtain a job as highly paid as an able-bodied counterpart and manages not to run up a higher loan there are still the extra costs which are not fully offset by the mobility and attendance allowances <e> <s> those costs occur daily for the rest of your life <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish most warmly to support the amendment <e> <s> i think it would be very useful from the point of view of students with disabilities as the noble baroness lady david has already said <e> <s> i look forward to hearing the ministers reply <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment because it is vital to ensure continuing care such as physiotherapy and speech therapy <e> <s> i agree with my noble friends comments about patients being stuck in specialist units <e> <s> that is a matter which concerns the spinal injuries association because there is a lack of suitable accomodation <e> <s> for example eden hall hospital in scotland has three patients who together have spent unnecessary days in hospital which must be expensive <e> <s> stanmore hospital is a small spinal injuries unit with only patients <e> <s> nine of those patients must at present stay with relatives or go to other hospitals <e> <s> they cannot receive the specialist care they need because their homes are not suitable <e>", "<cs> as my name is attached to amendment no <e> <s> a together with that of my noble friend perhaps i may support what she said about special units <e> <s> i refer particularly to the spinal injury units and their crucial importance to people with spinal injuries <e> <s> she asked a great many important questions but perhaps i may ask one more <e> <s> as the spinal injuries association made clear in the letter to mrs virginia bottomley earlier this month there is a need for new spinal injury units <e> <s> under the government proposals who will be responsible for building the new units <e> <s> if it is the regions and it is unprofitable do we assume that there will be no more new units <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment and certainly declare an interest as a paraplegic <e> <s> i know how essential it is to have good continence advice and no cut-backs in the supplies of for example pads whether in the form of rationing or restriction to one type which may not be the most suitable <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> my noble friend has said much of what i should have liked to have said in relation to people with spinal cord injury the problem of blocking hospital beds and of trying to rehabilitate people in unsuitable housing <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support these two amendments most warmly <e> <s> however i <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment and to apologise to the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> in my keenness to support my noble friends amendments and to make only one speech i pre-empted what he was going to say on the importance of implementing section <e>", "<cs> i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> a project undertaken by radar in showed the importance of this right for organisations <e> <s> eleven local authorities were referred to the secretary of state by radar due to their failure to meet assessed needs of community care services <e> <s> in the majority of cases the service was provided to the disabled person concerned as a result of that intervention <e> <s> therefore i believe that this is a very valuable proposal <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do as the minister said that the amendment was too wide at the next stage can we have a meeting when we might be able to devise an amendment which is not quite so wide <e> <s> as all noble lords who have spoken have said there are special problems which some people have in representing themselves and they need the help of other organisations <e> <s> it may be that their families need the support of organisations to speak on their behalf <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what course to take with this amendment i ask the minister to consider one other matter <e> <s> i am not sure that this proposal does not slightly weaken the provision to repeal section of the national assistance act <e> <s> section of that act reads <e>", "<cs> in vaguely thanking the noble baroness for her reply i am sure that she will not be surprised when i say that i am extremely disappointed <e> <s> i am amazed because very little of what she has said is not contained in letters from the minister for the disabled and from herself to my noble friend lord henderson <e> <s> i am quite taken aback by her reply <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may press the noble baroness the letter states that the government wish to use the definition there as the definition of a disabled student <e> <s> will that be used in future as the definition of a disabled student <e> <s> i refer to the eligibility criteria for the disability and severe disability premiums <e>", "<cs> but can the noble baroness reconsider the matter at the moment <e>", "<cs> if the definition is accepted for a disabled student what implication does that have for the repayment of loans by disabled borrowers <e> <s> would deaf students not be treated in the same way as other disabled students <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy with the situation <e> <s> i

says that the disabled include the deaf and then one asks what is a deaf student <e> <s> if there is a problem about the definition that can be sorted out by using the clinically accepted levels at which people are considered to have a significant hearing loss <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i support what my noble friend said about the disappointment of the disability organisations at the ministers reply in committee and the fact that the situation has been deteriorating since the issue of the health notice <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and with the leave of the house perhaps i may ask her to define guidance <e> <s> she referred to health notice as guidance <e> <s> i hope that i was suggesting something stronger <e> <s> as the health notice does not seem to have had much effect i totally withdraw my suggestion regarding guidance <e> <s> are there two kinds of guidance <e> <s> there is appealable guidance in law is there not <e>

noble baroness warmly but briefly as she is such an expert on the subject and has reviewed the case for the new clause so clearly and compellingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the amendment <e>
