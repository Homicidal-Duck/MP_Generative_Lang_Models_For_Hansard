["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> nevertheless is it not true that in both japan and west germany last month it was declared that the increase in interest rates was due to the staggering increase of the prime rate in new york <e> <s> would not the noble lord agree that these grotesque interest rates penalise productive enterprises <e> <s> may i further ask the noble lord whether it is not worth while at any rate trying to get some international agreement pooling international effort to secure a more rational mechanism for controlling the rate of money growth <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for the words he offers in answer to this question may i ask him whether it is not something over which we ought to brood that the whole of the public sector borrowing this year the whole of it will be required to pay interest on money already borrowed <e> <s> is it not also a fact if one takes percentages and works on them that something like half the total deficit in foreign payments is accounted for by the interest paid to foreign stockholders <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am not interested in scoring party points but that i am trying to put before the house some facts which i think ought to cause us all to think very deeply <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the method of curbing money supply by interest rates is not showing results <e> <s> i am simply suggesting to the noble lord and would he not take it in that spirit <e> <s> that we might have another look at this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord recall that on tuesday with a degree of emphasis he said that the rate of interest would not come down unless and until the rate of inflation comes down <e> <s> are we to assume because there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been insistent on disagreeing with a good deal that has been asked this afternoon <e> <s> may we see whether there are some issues upon which we can agree <e> <s> do i gather that now as on tuesday the noble lord agrees that the whole of the borrowing requirement is required to pay interest on money that has already been borrowed <e> <s> secondly does he agree with my arithmetic that million will he dispersed in purchasing power on these two recent longterm issues <e> <s> thirdly will he agree that as far as productive industry is concerned in this country these rates of interest penalise them as far as on-costs are concerned and make it almost impossible for them to export by creating an artificial exchange rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that answer the fact of the matter is that very definite rates are laid down for the boards of public corporations <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord without commenting at all on the merits or demerits of a recent appointment to the board of the british steel corporation whether he does not find it difficult to defend one rate on the promise of performance as against an inferior rate for those board members who have proved their worth as regards both profitability and public service and expect them to accept an inferior rate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i call the noble lords attention to one rule which is applied relating to the repayment of fees earned from outside directorships <e> <s> that rule is being relaxed in the case of the british steel corporation <e> <s> would he not agree that it will be very difficult to defend the relaxation there if it is maintained in every other case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that answer and in accepting his agreement with me about the importance of the problem may i ask him whether he would not agree that all the figures that have been published so far since the question was set down the figures for the inflation rate the exchange rate and the manufacturing production output show that the position is worsening not improving <e> <s> while accepting that we have to control the volume of money may i ask the noble lord whether he would not consider this <e> <s> if manufacturing industry today can solve problems like going to the moon or world-wide communications satellites is there not another way of controlling the volume of credit other than by this crude interest rate policy <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard what the noble lord said in reply to the question put by a distinguished former chairman of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house is grateful to the noble lord for repeating this statement on what is really a controversial decision <e> <s> may i ask him whether i am not right in saying that quite recently and emphatically her majestys <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will make clear the governments policy in this <e> <s> do they intend to give the authority a deciding role in these spheres or not <e> <s> that we understood was the position <e> <s> may i thank the noble lord for making it clear that there was no other information available to the secretary of state when he came to this modification of the caas decision <e> <s> if there was no other information can he seriously say that the men in whitehall knew better than the experienced and professional judgment of the caa <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked about the reference in the statement to the hope of her majestys government that the government of hong kong will lend support to the laker application <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the original question would the minister give an assurance to the house that there is a sense of urgency here <e> <s> if he would express that feeling again to the spanish authorities it might allay some of the apprehension that is to be found in quite responsible quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for answering the question and while recognising with him as i think we all do the need for restraint in the total national wage bill may i ask him whether if we have a situation where there is a per cent <e> <s> pay settlement for the bbc and a per cent <e> <s> settlement over two years for the itv this can really be justified on grounds of either fairness or economics <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened with great care to what the noble lord was good enough to say may i ask him whether he will therefore give an assurance that if there is an organisation within the public sector which satisfies the criteria which i have set down in my second question there will be no artificial limitation on any wage settlement made there <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting what has been said by noble lords in different parts of the house that there are different settlements in different parts of the economy would not the noble lord agree that if we are to have a genuinely stable society there must be a prevailing sense of fairness <e> <s> if double standards are applied to the public sector as against the private sector no matter what employment bills we get there is bound to be industrial conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> even if we accept the proposition of her majestys present government that we can meaningfully measure the supply of money if the policy adopted to restrain money supply also has the effect of reducing the production of goods are we not left with a situation where less money is chasing even fewer goods and therefore we are not advancing the fight against inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord also tell his noble friend that a much more important influence as regards getting productivity up is to improve the utilisation of equipment and that if the noble lord really thinks that the action taken by her majestys government in reducing money supply in this country is not affecting manufacturing industry then he really is not looking at the world outside <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of staunch supporters of the nato concept who will have their doubts about the wisdom of the decision which the government have taken <e> <s> i am sure we shall all want to study the background documents but prior to that may i ask the noble lord four questions on what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords did i ask the noble lord about the per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the cost of this trident programme will be no more than the tornado programme <e> <s> will this not he in addition to the tornado programme on the basis of what he said in the statement and in answer to my question <e> <s> i therefore ask him to make this clear are we having this and the tornado programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware as of course he will be that since my question was tabled the decision to buy jetstream has been announced <e> <s> may i be allowed to congratulate her majestys government on this application of the new policy <e> <s> would the noble viscount agree that given the necessary determination from everyone concerned including the workforce and i am sure that will be forthcoming that purchase could lead the way to a new competitive position in the market for that size of aircraft <e> <s> may i also ask whether this new policy of the government will mean that british airways will now take a more constructive view of the possible purchase of british aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that i have never asked that british products should be purchased irrespective of cost <e> <s> in connection with british airways it is entirely within the ambit of the secretary of states declared policy that i am asking the minister to agree that they should look at the possibility of purchasing british aircraft in a more constructive way than has been apparent in the last two or three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i for one greatly admire the zeal with which lie strives to defend the indefensible but does he not sometimes lay himself open to the charge of self-contradiction <e> <s> has he not hitherto always maintained that it would be impossible to bring down the mlr except <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer the noble lord to the answer he gave me on th april when i first raised this question of the mlr in which he said at col <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the manner in which the noble lord lord cockficld invited us to accept the bill and especially i welcomed his absolution if we did not discuss the bill in detail <e> <s> the clarity and earnestness of his restatement of policy excited my genuine admiration but i shall not follow him in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness lady airey will allow me in response to the question asked by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter about my reference to the alleged per cent <e> <s> increase in the bank of england pay rates i appear to have been mistaken <e> <s> i apologise and i withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> all he says may be an argument against the planning that has taken place <e> <s> but would he not accept that it is conceivably an argument not against the concept of a planned economy but in favour of better planning <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord now be good enough to say in the present situation by what means the issue of credit is to be controlled <e> <s> if he tells the house that it is by the high interest rates will he bear in mind that the useful export earning industries cannot afford that high interest rate and it is tending to be the non-useful the speculative interests that afford that high interest rate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord now be good enough to answer the first part of my question <e> <s> will he say now the corset has gone what powers the government have to restrain the issue of credit by the banking system <e>", "<cs> question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for three reasons <e> <s> first i see that he is sporting a tie which matches mine <e> <s> secondly it gives me an opportunity to fill a gap in his knowledge with regard to the competitive character of british aerospace <e> <s> if the noble lord remembers the circumstances under which british airways insisted on buying all-american aircraft and if he will refresh his memory of our last report which showed that over per cent <e> <s> of what we sold earned foreign currency overseas i am sure he will not wish in any way to denigrate the efforts which were made <e> <s> thirdly i am delighted to follow the noble lord because in other respects i am going to agree with much of what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to tell the noble lord that the situation has changed a good deal since those palmy days <e>", "<cs> it is not my purpose to contest the principle behind the proposal to establish british airways limited <e> <s> however as the noble earl lord amherst and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter have said i am concerned with the procedure and the mechanism which is involved in this change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the noble lord said that there would be no question of the majority government shareholder veto-ing any appointment to the board <e> <s> can he not be a little more positive than this <e> <s> in the first place there will presumably be a short-term appointment in the wholly-owned government company <e> <s> is there to be no security offered to the executives who accept appointment to that board an assurance from the majority government shareholder that they will be appointed to the successor company <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a committee stage of course but i would direct the noble lords attention to clause which refers to the need for purchase of securities <e> <s> is the cost of those securities within the target limit or not <e>", "<cs> my lords that reference was to the assessment of the traffic potential on this route <e> <s> if the secretary of state is going to take a judgment on traffic potential he can take that judgment on almost any application that is made <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say whether i would be wrong in making the assumption that extra administrators are needed for every unemployed and would i be quite wrong if i said that the extra administrators in fact total for each unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> could i ask him now however whether he really believes that language such as quoted by my noble friend in the supplementaries on the last question really gives the impression that the repor is dealing with real people in the realt world <e> <s> i refer to the quotation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that his noble friends would support him rather better if they had more ammunition <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that it would not be possible to launch a successful flotation in that brings us to <e> <s> in all probability there will be a general election in <e> <s> does the noble lord seriously think they can float a company like this with all the uncertainties that a general election would bring forth <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that the noble lord will probably find himself mistaken on that point <e> <s> i should like to ask a further question <e> <s> in the statement there is a reference to the flotation of the company the powers in the bill of course provide for the transfer of assets to a nominee government company <e> <s> is it intended to transfer these assets in that way or will that be left open <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that very helpful and tutorial answer may i ask whether he can help the house a little more <e> <s> is it not the case that the government are attempting to restrict the supply of money <e> <s> is it not also the case that excessive bank lending frustrates that policy <e> <s> why then if some banks have been over-greedy does the bank of england step in to help them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that but is he not also aware as i have reason to believe he is that there are more sensible and direct ways of controlling the money base than by the damaging procedure of high interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while again thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him this <e> <s> if the industrial losses that we all know about the redundancies and the unemployment are justified by the noble lord and the government in order to create the conditions under which the mlr can be reduced can he really at the same time justify a situation which brings windfall profits to the money speculators <e>", "<cs> my lords while i join in the sympathy for the pension funds may i ask whether the noble lord really believes that the million which we understand was contributed during the past week from overseas for government stocks was made available for any other reason than the expectation of a capital gain <e>", "<cs> would it not be better if when the question is put the committee were rather more seemly than it was on that occasion <e>", "<cs> certainly it was the case that the noble lord chairman put the question but nobody could hear such was the row in the chamber and i am suggestion that the behaviour is rather better in future <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the noble lord on the first part of his remarks about the situation regarding the transfer of assets to a nominee company <e> <s> when i put this point before the noble lord answered me i thought quite sensibly at one point and then had to correct himself on advice from the box <e> <s> i venture to suggest that his first response to my question was probably more understandable namely that there was absolutely no reason why there should not be a transfer of assets to a new company even though the flotation on the market had to be held up <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will agree to this amendment but will the noble lord make it absolutely clear that what he is asking us to do now will be undone if the remaining clauses come into operation <e> <s> undone in the sense that under the new dispensation in or whatever date the guarantees on these borrowing limits will be removed <e> <s> will the noble lord make that quite clear so that we can understand the contradictions behind the government policy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the spirit in which the noble lord has endeavoured to meet the points that i have made <e> <s> i readily accept that there is a difference here as between the non-executive and the executive members of the board <e> <s> i still think that something further ought to be said to give security to the executive members of the board although i quite agree that there is a possibility indeed may be a probability that there would be changes so far as the part-time non-executives are concerned <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a profound inability on the part of the government to understand the thinking of some of my friends <e> <s> the noble lord has just said that apparently what is wanted here is the same relationship between the government and the new company as exists at present between the government and the present corporation <e> <s> that certainly is not my view <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord shaking his head that is what he has just said <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord has had recourse to this argument again about not intending to control the company <e> <s> i hope it can be made clear from this side of the committee as well as that side of the committee that there is no intention of any arrangement under which the government would control the company in the manner which the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> i have said before and i say again as i see the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord would not wish to exaggerate <e> <s> we are talking <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been provided with a highly sophisticated argument in reply to my noble friend but i do not think that he has quite answered the sort of fears that there are on this point <e> <s> the noble lord himself said that there are two elements in a decision the price and the day and he is absolutely right <e> <s> of course i agree with him that on a certain day the government will seek to secure the best possible price <e> <s> it would be absolutely inconceivable that they should propose to sell at a less than best possible price <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed at the reaction of the noble lord and the lack of imagination which is apparently displayed by his honourable and right honourable friends <e> <s> i am particularly sorry that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter should have referred to this proposed director as a tame director <e> <s> why should he be tame <e> <s> why should he be more tame than any of the others <e> <s> just because he represents a point of view of those lives whose are dedicated to the company why should he be described as tame <e> <s> i can imagine that he will be much more lively and much more constructive than some of the others <e> <s> their interests will be much more affected than some of the others <e> <s> of course anyone serving on a board owes first loyalty to the board of that company <e> <s> i aggree with that <e> <s> that does not mean to say that if a person comes from the work force has experienced the day-to-day problems of the company and consults with fellows in the company and then goes into the board room he becomes tame <e> <s> such a person might be extremely constructive <e>", "<cs> i absolutely agree that they should be appointed for their general qualities <e> <s> i hope that employees knowing the quality of their colleagues can appoint to the board someone for whose general qualities they have respect <e> <s> of course one has to consider the capability and competence of a person when he is put on a board <e> <s> that does not mean to say that he should not come from a particular sphere <e> <s> the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord trefgarne know perfectly well that if we have a situation in which some financial institutions take a block of shares in british airways limited it is only too likely that in the course of the discussions that take place they will suggest that a certain person should go on the board <e> <s> that takes place now <e> <s> but because such people come from a certain part of the city or have certain interests outside that does not mean that they are any less valuable on the board <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord suggests that i should read my own amendment i would suggest that he also takes the opportunity of reading it <e> <s> i do not say that the nomination shall be a trustee i say that the nomination should be made by the trustees and of course they can have a wide field of choice <e> <s> i should have thought they would choose someone from the workforce from the managerial level probably or probably from somewhere else <e> <s> it has been very interesting in my experience so far as the trustee company of british aerospace is concerned <e> <s> it is very interesting that when you put someone on those trustees be he an awkward character or a militant on the shop floor he becomes a very constructive person when given responsibilities of that kind <e> <s> so let us not try to envisage an unfortunate or negative person but let us try to envisage someone who will make a contribution <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that this particular director will represent a small group <e> <s> it is precisely because of that that i think there ought to be some provision for it in the statute <e> <s> if there were a wider group or if they had a greater voting power then there would have been no need to make statutory provision <e> <s> it is precisely because otherwise it is unlikely that the employee would have a voice on the board that i think the amendment should be pressed <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the exact proportion at present for that but i think there are at the present time eight executive directors on the board <e> <s> the noble lord may say that they represent the workforce <e> <s> i do not think that is so they are appointed by the government <e> <s> i think there will be some value <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that i do not just think up these things without consulting people and talking to people and i would say that this idea would not be unwelcome at least to some of those executive directors on the board <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount is quite right in voicing a fear of that kind <e> <s> there is a danger in any new experiment <e> <s> the reason why the trade unions generally are opposed to the employee-shareholding concept is that it cuts across the sort of worker-directorship pattern which they would like to see imposed upon some of these public bodies <e> <s> i think the danger would have to be faced <e> <s> as i see it this would be an additional channel and not a conflicting one <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak at this point but i should like to put one question to the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> i confess that i have not read sufficiently thoroughly the act and therefore cannot follow so could the noble lord tell me what appeal there would be to the secretary of state in the event of the authority taking a decision with which members of parliament local residents and so on may disagree <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me to put this <e> <s> am i being unfair or unkind if i say he is coming dangerously near to appearing to want to establish i quote a word which he will recognise a tame authority <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord is not in danger of standing on its head the argument he employed on the first part of the bill about our setting up an organisation and letting it get on with the job <e> <s> when we were talking about british airways the whole tenor of the argument on that side was if you appoint a company do not interfere do not control <e> <s> here we are intending to set up an authority which is a competent authority by all accounts it has had very good training it could not have had better chairmen in the past it has been taught excellent ways of procedure and i would have thought that given the wording in section a we should allow them to exercise their judgment <e> <s> if you are going to say that they can exercise their judgment only in the way in which parliament lays down i think you are unreasonably curtailing their discretion <e> <s> there is absolutely no reason why given this wording they should not encourage all proper competition <e> <s> to say what is all proper competition i should have thought was wrong <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that if there is that lack of confidence in the authority the authority should be replaced <e> <s> given this instruction i would have suggested we should feel safe in letting them get on with it <e> <s> you could not have it laid down more simply and effectively than the need to have proper competition <e>", "<cs> during the second reading debate i made substantially the same points as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has made today <e> <s> in the interests of time i do not propose to repeat those arguments <e> <s> however i do not believe that it is good enough simply to ask for an assurance <e> <s> we were given something in the way of an assurance on second reading <e> <s> in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> i have come to that conclusion that the noble lords draftsmanship is not superior to mine especially after hearing the arguments against the timetable <e> <s> i can see that there was a point there <e> <s> i do not refer to this days in my amendment and i therefore propose to press my own amendment <e>", "<cs> as we have just had the argument here and i do not propose to repeat it i wonder whether we might take my next amendment before the adjournment <e>", "<cs> may i pursue that point <e> <s> if there is a minor matter of concern involved surely there is a responsibility on the part of the secretary of state to make the authority aware of it before the decision is taken <e> <s> in the proposed new section a of the act <e>", "<cs> i think possibly i have misunderstood the amendment but as i follow what the noble earl lord amherst says we are dealing here with a situation where long procedures have been gone through as the noble lord has correctly described with all the witnesses and all the costs and there has been a finding <e> <s> then there comes a situation in which the original decision is cancelled or modified <e> <s> what then is the remedy resting with the operator who has apparently undertaken certain obligations in carrying out the service and yet finds that without any other evidence having been brought forward what he thought was a final decision is in fact changed <e>", "<cs> is not the difficulty here that the noble lord is being just a little too definite <e> <s> he has acknowledged the expertise of his noble friend behind him <e> <s> why does he not say that he will look a little more carefully at what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords while sharing the admiration expressed by his noble friends behind him at the ministers ability to answer questions which were not asked may i ask whether he will be good enough just to answer the simple question as to whether he believes that output has been lowered as a result of high interest rates and if output has been lowered does not that presuppose that the volume of money supply will also have to be reduced <e> <s> may i further ask him whether in the new figures in two or three weeks time we shall see an even lower target of money supply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for making this statement this afternoon especially since he told me on th october during the committee stage that it was unnecessary to make such statements <e> <s> he turned down my amendment which would have provided for such a statement to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not satisfy me at all <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord i think what he has read out is a whole maze of contradictions <e> <s> it is much less convincing than the answer he gave me on committee stage <e>", "<cs> i rise on report stage to reply to the debate <e> <s> the noble lord has made a very convincing case but not about my amendment <e> <s> there was the minor point about section as against section but if we agree with the substance of the amendment it is not beyond the possibilities that we can have a further amendment on third reading along the lines suggested making it section instead of section <e> <s> that is no reason why we should not accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that satisfies the point <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord trefgarne said as to how these matters should be handled <e> <s> i do <e>", "<cs> my lords if things go well what is the assumption of the number of people that may be employed by these new enterprises <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment and to suggest to your lordships that it is really a challenge to the judgment of those of your lordships who have bothered to stay here this friday <e> <s> the noble lord moved his amendment in the most constructive terms <e> <s> it is not one which in any way impeaches the principle of the bill <e> <s> it does not endeavour to overturn a policy with which we disagree <e> <s> it is endeavouring to introduce some responsibility and to have a very proper sense of discipline in an area where it is eminently difficult to get discipline <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my tribute to the noble lord lord trefgarne for his handling of this bill <e> <s> he has combined courtesy with skill in splendid degree and his knowledge of the detail has been most impressive <e> <s> i recall that he flew in from some foreign mission the day before he had to introduce the bill and he could have been forgiven for some unfamiliarity with it <e> <s> but in fact it sounded for all the world as if he might have written it <e> <s> i like to think that if he had had that responsibility he would have made a better job of it <e> <s> it is a bad little bill and in an overloaded parliament timetable it ought never to have been included <e> <s> there is only one clause in the whole of the bill which <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord should not be quite so dogmatic about it <e> <s> when the bill was introduced did the government not have the clear intention to float this company either this year or next year <e>", "<cs> my lords if the appointed boards are so superior why does the bill make provision for a complaints commission at all <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are genuinely trying to assess the consequences of joining the eec ought we not to avoid these highly selective figures <e> <s> in this particular case can the noble lord tell us what was the outward investment over this period into the eec countries <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord says may have some truth in it but would he now be good enough to answer my question <e> <s> would he tell me what was the outward investment over the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that i was glad to follow the noble lord lord mottistone i suppose i might add the words at last <e> <s> i am particularly glad to be able to follow him because i find myself so much in agreement with his general attitude and approach <e> <s> of course i should also like <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will allow me to intervene for one moment <e> <s> he has obviously gone into this very carefully <e> <s> he has dealt with the question of cost and he is rather suggesting that it is not a very important consideration <e> <s> can he now deal with those cases where i suggested it would be quite impossible to get insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl spoke with great satisfaction about a per cent <e> <s> increase <e> <s> can he say whether that was an increase in real money terms <e> <s> if not would he care to say whether it was an increase or a decrease if we are comparing like with like <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the possibility of acting in an emergency <e> <s> would he not agree that there is an emergency in italy at the present time <e> <s> can he say what corporate action is being taken by the community in that case <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble lord says my lords but

was at the time the government took office <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating the noble lord the lord chairman of committees on the distinguished list he has here may i ask him to assure the house that it is still necessary to have so formidable a size of committee <e> <s> to have members on a select committee seems rather on the large side <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to say how that figure is arrived at <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he agrees that with the evidence of this quite phenomenal amount of available money it is difficult to sustain the governments argument that capital raised for investment in the public sector must necessarily mean less for the private sector in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is saying that this money is simply the surplus on the balance of payments may i ask how he can reconcile that with the fact that in the first six months of this year alone billion went out of the country <e> <s> is he really telling us that it is the surplus on our balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords if our economy is as healthy as the noble lord is suggesting if the availability of money is so great as he is suggesting why was it necessary last week for the bank of england to operate in the market to maintain the interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords for the sake of the record may i say that the noble lord placed emphasis on the word claimed <e> <s> is he suggesting that my claim was not accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from what the noble lord has said that the net proceeds to the exchequer were of the order of some million <e> <s> the noble lord will probably correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> if it were around that figure is not million an excessive cost for raising that amount <e> <s> since we are talking about how much went to whom may i ask the noble lord whether he will comment on the report that because the shares were undervalued when quoted the stags made million in the first days trading <e> <s> finally may i ask the noble lord whose financial experience i deeply respect whether he really thinks it sound management to sell off a gross national asset and then use the proceeds as he said unhypothecated <e> <s> by which he means for current household expenses <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the chief whip and to the house generally that there is a case to be made for curtailing the replies on the first one or two questions <e> <s> sometimes the time is used up on the first <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he will explain to his noble friends at the back that if one buys at and sells at one is realising a profit <e> <s> while accepting from the minister that a judgment must be made when floating a company on the market nevertheless a pattern is beginning to emerge that the underwriters are getting their per cent <e> <s> without an element of risk <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate what the noble lord said about the position of the government in these matters he has defined their role he said to ensure a competitive position <e> <s> but is it not necessary to ensure that the competition is fair <e> <s> is there not a case now again i appreciate the difficulties for saying that we could have regulation of fares or we could have a situation where there is no regulation of fares <e> <s> surely it is quite absurd to have the present nonsense <e> <s> can the government not do something more to get sense into this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that in the debate on the queens speech he claimed that he had reduced the number of inland revenue officers below the level of the royal naval strength <e> <s> does he not think that this reduction has something to do with the fact that so much tax is not now being collected <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may intervene for just one minute and i shall restrict myself to what i actually saw or thought i saw in the programme <e> <s> it caused considerable disquiet but to my mind at any rate the disquiet was not limited to the allegations about libya itself <e> <s> the position of some members of the cia was ambiguous to put it mildly <e> <s> no doubt these matters will he ventilated in the law suits which i understand are now proceeding in the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord make it clear that the suggestion was not mine <e> <s> it was in the programme to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that these sums of money which are being distributed

enough to tell the house what was the actual market value of the million worth of public property which they have disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is leaving this point of consensus could he tell me whether i am to gather from what he has said that he agrees or disagrees with what his right honourable friend the prime minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords i did take it that the noble lord had listened to my speech and that he had heard me quote carefully slowly and clearly what the right honourable lady the prime minister said in melbourne <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord seems to be making a point of this may i tell him that the trouble then was under a plan devised some years before <e> <s> the smaller sites were to be closed down on a certain time-scale but the bigger plants had not come on stream <e> <s> i was advocating an extension of the smaller plants simply because the bigger ones were unable to meet the market at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords

"<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> but would the noble earl recall that i asked this question months ago and i was then given an answer in pretty much the same phraseology as the words used by the noble earl this afternoon <e> <s> would he not agree that over the last year very little

circumstances where powers are available under general acts <e> <s> is it then proper for the bill to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the information which the noble lord has given most of which is in my question <e> <s> may i ask whether there was any discussion at all about the size of this increase <e> <s> is it a fact that the spanish pensioners resident in this country will also have to pay this amount of money each month about per month in order to get health service care <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the final part of the noble lords answer is not the bargaining power of her majestys government very considerable in this matter <e> <s> is it not possible for something to be done <e> <s> may i also ask what will be the position if spain joins the european community <e> <s> will there be complete reciprocity on these matters then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord but may i ask him one other question <e> <s> am ito gather from his previous answer when he said that some progress had been made in negotiations that the negotiations are a continuing process and that he is still endeavouring to get some amelioration of this excessive charge <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am in favour of all proper economies and economic administration

clear that there are no staff reductions when absolutely essential services are required <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble baroness the leader of the house agree that the answer to the last supplementary question did open a whole new series of subjects and that it ought to be possible to challenge some of the statements made in that answer <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how very much i was impressed as i think many of us were by the speech of the noble lady behind me <e> <s> in many ways it would have been appropriate for the debate to finish on the note which she struck but i thought i ought simply to say that the interpretation of liberty of the subject given by noble lords on this bench is not one which i share <e>", "<cs> one day i shall have to have a debate with my noble friend about what constitutes moral grounds <e> <s> i believe the interpretation can be very wide indeed <e> <s> we are talking about the judgment of local authorities in saying whether or not a certain type of establishment is appropriate in a particular locality <e> <s> all i am saying to my noble friend lord jenkins of putney is that if one is going to give local authorities the power to stop something happening in a particular locality it is quite wrong to say that in other localities they must agree with that thing happening <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene will the noble lord be good enough to say something about the definition of locality <e> <s> if it is to be a narrow definition <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> in addition to the million abortive expenditure on the first submission is it a fact that an alternative submission must inevitably mean a higher investment <e> <s> and if that is so and of course the emphasis is on environment

"<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask whether this does not mean that

not the government have some misgivings even slight misgivings about these payments made for services which have not contributed one pennyworth of new wealth to the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course absolutely right that the amount realised was something like million but the value of the assets that were sold were probably in the region of billion <e> <s> for the loss of this billion they are actually paying million to the finance houses concerned <e> <s> does the noble lord really think that this is a great achievement or a stimulation to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what lessons the noble lord draws from that but while he and i would deprecate hindsight is it not also to be deprecated if we fail to learn lessons from the past <e> <s> are there not some lessons to be learned from the way in which these assets have been disposed of under market value <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord trefgarne be good enough to clarify what

<e> <s> the question refers to sightings reported to the ministry of defence <e> <s> the question i asked was is that figure correct or not <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the noble lord say that we had never suggested to the argentines that the matter should be referred to the international court <e> <s> is is not a fact that in mr ernest bevin announced in the house of commons quite definitely

international court <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put some questions that are quite irrelevant to what i said <e> <s> would he be kind enough to comment on what i did say on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i went on at some length as the noble lord will see when he reads my speech putting forward alternative proposals for dealing with precisely the problems that the noble lord is discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord with great kindness because i should like to thank him for his previous references that i was not a supporter on that occasion i was a victim <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point will he at least be good enough to give some figures of the returns which have been paid by the publicly-owned industries on the capital so invested <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to the noble lord that he gives a completely wrong picture if he just totals up investments without giving the return on that investment <e>", "<cs>

harder if their decisions are a little cleverer and if their success is that much greater for are we not going to have the situation where the corporation is told to sell off even more <e>", "<cs> my

help me on one point <e> <s> i am trying very hard to understand the contradictions in the bill <e> <s> the noble earl said that my noble friend lord underhill was wrong in thinking that clause has anything to do with the clause that we are now discussing <e> <s> but clause says <e>", "<cs> i should also like to ask a question on the same point and it might be convenient for the noble lord lord tanlaw to answer it when he answers the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i am bound to say that i find it rather strange that there should be in this liberal amendment <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl allow me <e> <s> when he said that they want this company to be the same as any other normal privately owned company would he say that it was normal to have employees share schemes in the normal private company <e>", "<cs> but the noble earl is imposing something new provision is being made for employees share schemes <e> <s> is that not a new departure something which many ministers have said is part of the privatisation scheme <e>", "<cs> i quite understand what the minister is saying namely one reason why the government cannot accept the amendment is that it is something different <e> <s> i am saying that we are already dealing with something different <e> <s> the whole context here and the whole privatisation policy is designed to embody something different <e> <s> ministers have said that they are trying to do something different and are trying to incorporate the concept of employees shareholdings something quite separate and different from the way in which that has been developed in normal industry outside <e> <s> although i accept that the amendment suggests that even further steps should be taken may i ask the minister whether he thinks he is justified in saying he cannot accept it because it is something different when the government are already doing something different in the bill <e>", "<cs> it is conceivable that the government will not accept the amendment but if they do not accept it i wonder whether they can give an assurance about the advice that they will take into account <e> <s> i am quite certain that if they did go as has been very wisely suggested to independent professional advice that advice would take into account timing <e> <s> it is not just a question of the valuation of the shares <e> <s> it is a question of when they are placed on the market <e> <s> i have no doubt that the appropriate professional advisers would say whether or not such and such a date was appropriate for getting the best possible price <e>", "<cs> surely the noble earl is going to deal with this question of the timing <e> <s> is he or is he not going to give an assurance to the committee that the timing will be dependant upon the advice received from these independant professional advisers or is it just going to be a question of parliamentary conveinence <e>", "<cs> i should like <e>", "<cs> i do not want to reply i want to ask a question <e>", "<cs> the minister said the government intended to maintain what he called contact points if the gas showrooms are sold off <e> <s> may i ask him to enlarge on that <e> <s> by contact points does he mean that they will be in the high street in the way they are now convenient but very expensive <e> <s> if so over what other services will the costs of rental and so on be spread <e> <s> will it not be a very expensive operation to maintain the places there simply as contact points <e> <s> agree such places will be absolutely necessary especially if some housewives buy houses only to find they must cook over candles <e> <s> it would therefore be useful to be able to go to a contact point so perhaps the noble earl will explain just what is the governments policy on the matter <e>", "<cs> can we he clear about one point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did not answer my question <e> <s> i wonder whether he would be good enough to think again and give a further answer to it <e> <s> if the british gas corporation finding gas are required under the bill to dispose if the noble earl will give me some idea when he is likely to finish his other conversation i shall continue with my question <e>", "<cs> i am so glad to hear that <e> <s> i personally find it impossible to conduct two conversations at the same time <e> <s> i was asking whether the noble earl can tell me if the british gas corporation in their search for oil are required under the bill to dispose of those gas interests it will encourage or discourage them <e> <s> if it discourages them are we not reducing competition instead of encouraging it <e>", "<cs> a little while ago the noble earl was complaining that i had got up more than once to ask very much the same question <e> <s> i apologise to him in one way if he thought i was repeating myself but i think that what he was really getting at is that the same mischief that the government are trying to perpetrate occurs so often through this bill that one has to react in much the same way in further later parts of the bill <e> <s> so it is when i come to consider clause as a whole <e> <s> what i have been concerned about here very largely is the motivation of people within the british gas corporation <e> <s> that is fundamental <e> <s> indeed i think it is fundamental in any case whether one is considering a football team a political party or an industry <e> <s> unless you get the motivation of people within the organisation you will not get results you will not get success <e> <s> it often depends upon leadership and it often depends upon whether there is something over and above the organisation which can frustrate its efforts <e> <s> whatever may be the cause of generating enthusiasm or of frustrating that enthusiasm you will not succeed unless you get motivation from the bottom <e>", "<cs> i remember an occasion when another noble minister a former chairman or certainly a director of the tottenham hotspur football club the late lord morrison stood at that dispatch box arid made a very persuasive speech but then found that he had got the wrong brief and was speaking to the wrong amendment <e> <s> i was wondering whether the noble lord had the wrong amendment in this case <e> <s> i am talking not about special privileges but about a case where there are special obligations now resting upon the bgc <e> <s> those special obligations were incurred in a situation completely different from the situation which this bill is intended to create <e> <s> i am suggesting that in those cases it is quite unfair to require those obligations of necessity to be undertaken <e> <s> i am suggesting that in those cases there should be the possibility on the part of the secretary of state to allow another entrepreneur

"<cs> i was a little disappointed in the noble and learned lords reply in so far as as my noble friend lord ross says he did not say that he would consider the points in this amendment and see whether there was any way in which he could meet them <e> <s> however i was grateful for the explanation he gave and i shall look forward to reading with great care what he had to say to see whether i can get any more satisfaction from his words <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that i think his criticisms of the bbc are absolutely justified in this particular case <e> <s> that is on the one hand <e> <s> on the other hand is the noble viscount further aware that the implications of the first question seem to be absolutely offensive and help no one <e> <s> does not there seem in this case to be room for getting together with the media in order to see whether or not some new guidelines can be devised <e>", "<cs> i think that we are all indeed grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> what a remarkable demonstration he has given us of legal skill but what a terrible example he has given us of how to run a business <e>", "<cs> it really is impossible efficiently or economically to gather energy from our resources if you have to go through that kind of rigmarole <e> <s> i appreciate that in the end the wording might have the result that the lord advocate stated but the fact remains that going through all those procedures <e>", "<cs> i was disappointed that the government were not able to accept the amendment we moved <e> <s> had they done so it would have justified the claims made by the noble lord earlier about listening to parliament <e> <s> also it would have given us some slight encouragement to support this clause otherwise i am bound to say i think this clause should be taken out <e> <s> it is a bad clause <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord skelmersdale go a bit further <e> <s> he has just said that the british gas corporation will charge its own price and that the private sector company putting its gas through the same pipe-line will charge for its gas <e> <s> the noble lord then made the statement that consumers will then be able to judge the difference between the two prices <e> <s> can the noble lord give an undertaking that the government will impose the same levy on the private supplier as on the gas corporation <e>", "<cs> may i draw the attention of the noble lord the chief whip to the fact that we have still not received answers to questions that have been properly put <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord the minister and i shall study with great interest what he has said <e> <s> i think it is necessary to read what he has just said and this most important announcement <e> <s> it drives a coach and horses through the entire bill if he is telling us that the purpose of this great change is so that we can make a comparison of prices and is now saying that the government will impose a levy on the corporation price but not on the gas from private sources <e> <s> this is a most remarkable confession which i think we will have to consider very carefully <e>", "<cs> i think some things are better understood by repetition but i do not think a bad case is made better by repetition and with great respect to the noble lord i do not think that his case is particularly good <e> <s> certainly we have had an example if i may say so with due respect to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate of instant judgment which was impressive in one way but i am not convinced about its validity <e> <s> i look at this just as a student of language to some extent <e> <s> i see in the clause as at present drafted as the noble and learned lord lord wilson of lang-side said <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will agree to have another look at this matter <e> <s> as i see it it is not simply a question of the compatibility of the gas there is a reference to the point at which one supply joins another supply <e> <s> i disclose my complete ignorance of these matters but i should have thought that the expertise was to be found within the corporation <e> <s> the amendment is proposing that where there is a junction it should be at a point <e>", "<cs> the influence of the noble earl lord lauderdale in this committee seems to be growing with every amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> i think that it is just as well that the noble lord gave that undertaking <e> <s> we shall look forward to hearing at report stage that he has found it possible to accept it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl allow me <e> <s> do any of the other acts to which he has referred provide for the dissipation of public assets in anything like the quantity that is at stake here in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that on the face of it there seems to he something wrong with our society which offers in the case of the most civilised institution in the country namely the health service a salary increase of per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e>

moved by the words of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the law may protect us against tyrants but apparently not against the secretary of state <e> <s> i really do feel that there is something wrong

hospital workers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that it is a most unreasonable explanation it is worse than any i could conceive of <e> <s> it may be that i have misunderstood the noble lord <e>

through that same pipe-line but he will not say that the third party shall pay for some reason because the third party has not the money or possibly is not in a position to use the pipe-line <e> <s> the gas corporation therefore would have to incur this extra investment itself <e> <s> this seems to be absolutely unreasonable <e> <s> i would welcome any other views from noble lords <e> <s> i do not see any political point involved here it seems to me a perfectly straightforward business proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i respect the noble earls judgment and knowledge of these matters but that is not what the noble lord the minister said <e> <s> the noble lord the minister said that it may well be that the third party may not want to use the pipe-line that is what he said and therefore <e> <s> there can be no question of recovering costs by the charge for using the gas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord lord robbins has just said <e> <s> i must say that i am a little disappointed at what the noble earl lord lauderdale said <e> <s> after his intervention at the committee stage i thought that he was saying that we should have regard for technical matters and not for the cross-play of party politics <e> <s> i was wholly in favour of what he said and therefore i was a little disappointed and surprised that after considering what he said was a balance he came down in the way that he did <e> <s> it is a question of balance i quite agree with him <e> <s> on the one hand there is a general obligation on the part of the secretary of state in general terms to give the corporation an opportunity of being heard about the matter <e> <s> it is in completely general terms the discussion might not be about the particular junction that has ultimately to be

<e>", "<cs> i think the only conclusion that the house can draw is that there is no satisfactory answer to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> can he give me any idea of what he means by soon <e> <s> may i also ask the noble earl whether he will

lord glenarthur saying seriously that there is any possibility at all of a private company offering a competitive service to rural telephone subscribers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl could give to the house the approximate date within the governments lifetime when it ceased to be an intolerable burden on the taxpayer for local authorities to spend money and became a welcome

my why although the county council had this opportunity by legislative process by petition here they preferred to rest upon the powers of the highways act <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord address the house <e>", "<cs> my lords by temperament training and experience i am all in favour of the optimum degree of decentralisation <e> <s> we have developed in parliament the practical procedure of delegating to a select committee the responsibility for considering all relevant details in certain legislation <e> <s> so i agree with the noble lord lord hooson that it follows that conclusions reached by the select committee unless there is good reason for another course should be accepted by the house on third reading <e>", "<cs> i have knowledge of maps my lords and i have some knowledge of the difference between the environment when one goes there and what one gathers from maps <e> <s> do i understand from the noble lords intervention that he is saying that they did

noble lord lord hooson has studied the plans as carefully as i have and at this moment it is impossible to have before us the large plans that are available if anyone wants to see them <e> <s> but if one studies the proposals one realises that they are an entirely different set of proposals from those contained in the bill <e> <s> they were in fact designed to help the club <e> <s> they would have provided extra space for the club <e> <s> they would have provided new stands for the stadium <e> <s> they would have provided indoor training facilities for the club <e> <s> they would not have denied access to the club <e> <s> one cannot possibly compare on the one hand proposals that were designed to assist the club with on the other hand proposals which everyone agrees will damage the club <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that it was proper to consider very carefully these matters which very closely and intimately affect quite a number of people <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he made the statement twice that there is nothing new in what i have said <e> <s> since i quoted from the report of the committee which had met after the select committee had been wound up how could the noble lord know what was said at that committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said on two occasions that nothing new had been said here and that he had

however can he tell me why the same arguments do not apply to the public sector <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that in the chancellors statement i quote from the treasury progress report it was said <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord found the supplementary from the noble lord lord nugent of guildford so helpful will he take time to teach the noble lord lord nugent that the cost of the product of the particular public authority for which he was responsible goes into the cost of the private sector products <e> <s> if you are taking action to bring down costs it is important to bring down costs in the public sector and thereby indirectly help the private sector also to bring down costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking again the noble lord lord glenarthur for his reply would he not agree that if that very large sum of money realised by the sale of public assets is used by the government to reduce taxes prior to the next general election it will be both morally wrong and economically damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the case that the great need is to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement is it not a fact that the prime minister wrote to the chairmen of the public sector industries only a few weeks ago asking them to increase capital expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords it being christmastime and the time for good will i had not intended to say anything on this bill but i should like to congratulate the noble minister the secretary of state on the more moderate way in which he justified the discrimination between the public and private sectors so far as this bill is concerned <e> <s> the noble lord has just said that he justifies the discrimination on the basis that there is only a limited amount of money and it might as well be concentrated on the private sector <e> <s> that is rather better than what the noble lord sitting alongside him <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> there is an important point here <e> <s> i follow exactly what the noble lord the minister is saying and i agree with him that there is this difference between one public sector industry and another public sector service <e> <s> but does that not strengthen the argument i have tried to put to the noble lord that it is unwise

amendment and the promise of a probationary period in the second <e> <s> i did not think that in either case this was merited by the record and the work of the royal commission so i was delighted to hear what my noble friend lady birk <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord is being entirely right or fair about this <e> <s> is there not an obligation on the national organisation here when they give a licence on certain terms to see that those terms are carried out <e> <s> is not a difficulty here that if the terms are enforced in this country and not in other countries you are putting british airline operators at a disadvantage in the international market <e> <s> that is the real problem <e> <s> instead of all this other nonsense could not the minister say that the government will make an effort to get an agreement among other governments to enforce the conditions under which licences are granted <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has been given an unusually generous welcome from all political parties and it is a welcome which i support <e> <s> the character of this piece of legislation if i may say so speaks well for the attitude and the aptitude of agriculture ministers including the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> i allow myself to add that if only the treasury and treasury ministers were characterised by the same constructive and expansionist attitudes then our economy might be in much better shape <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> did i understand him to say that the holdings are being offered at the full value <e> <s> if that is so where did the per cent <e> <s> idea originate <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting but if one follows the argument one finds that the old arrangement was not so completely satisfactory <e> <s> what advice what financial arrangements are to be forthcoming for the transitional period <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that using the term community service in its widest context such teaching could be absolutely wonderfully rewarding <e> <s> is the noble earl also aware that the constant denigration by the conservative party and by the conservative government of service in publicly owned industry is bitterly disappointing to those who are engaged in that industry bad for morale and bad for the national effort <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not really got beyond the point when we should be considering the problem as a question of sovereignty under this nation state or that nation state <e> <s> is there not any constructive thinking going on at all about the possibility of some form of united nations trusteeship <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how much i agree with what was said by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale about putting unnecessary words into this bill <e> <s> i should have thought that if anyone wanted to give someone any authority short of putting in duties such as become an officer and a gentleman he would go to subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly support what has just been said <e> <s> i listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord sandford said and i could see that in his mind he draws a distinction between one form of recording or one occasion of recording and another <e> <s> but with due respect to the noble lord when it comes to the recording of the work which has been created by the by-pass round newark i think that it should be done in a scholarly way <e> <s> the personnel whom we have already in the royal commission are quite capable of performing that particular operation which has been created by the by-pass round newark <e> <s> i can see that there may well be some occasion when <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the discussions on the points involved this evening and in committee <e> <s> certain points seem to have emerged which were pretty soundly based and had wide support when there were more people here

to do so <e> <s> the second point made convincingly by the noble lord lord sandford was that we should not amalgamate for the sake of amalgamation <e> <s> there is much evidence to suggest that that is a sound and wise proposition <e> <s> the third point made more than once and made again by my noble friend lady birk is that there is no criticism of the work of the royal commission on historical monuments <e> <s> no one has criticised it all have paid tribute to the work that it has done <e> <s> with those three propositions before us i do not see that we should support the amendments now being moved <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that we leave out clause <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to offer an opportunity to the noble earl lord ferrers to spell out the responsibilities and prospects for the central council for agricultural and horticultural co-operation once it goes into the new food from britain organisation <e> <s> in particular i hope that the minister will now be able to answer the questions which i put to him on second reading <e> <s> the fact that these questions were not answered on second reading leads me to say that the noble earl as we expect of him was

earl has said i do not accept his apology about the non-answering <e> <s> i do not accept it because it was <e>", "<cs> i think i follow the exchanges my point is that there is a specific statutory obligation in the old act to provide funding for the promotion of co-operatives <e> <s> as i understand the noble earl whether or not the new organisation prospers there will be this continuing obligation resting on the government <e> <s> on that understanding and with the intention of carefully reading what i thought was a fine spirit shown by the noble lord in relation to the lsa <e>",

two years time to invest in a new engine probably in conjunction with japan or the united states on which it could be shown that there would be a good return <e> <s> do these cuts mean that there is no possibility of the government making an investment <e>", "<cs> my lords having had something to say at earlier stages about this issue i wish to say now how much i welcome the clear and straightforward statement which the minister made <e> <s> given that statement and the undertakings which the noble lord lord adeane made i hope it will be possible to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the progress of british airways towards privatisation i should like to ask the minister whether it is a fact that in their current accounts british airways had an extraordinary item of the write-off of million <e>", "<cs> my lords looking at this from another angle if there is to be this million write-off and then the assets are floated at this underwritten value is this really fair on other british operators such as british caledonian or british midland airways who through good times and bad have paid their own debts <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord finds on inquiry that it is a fact and that i am right and he is wrong will he be good enough to write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords when he writes to his noble friend would the noble lord underline

discussion now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i congratulate him on somewhat shifting his emphasis in the reply to the question that i put as compared with two or three years ago when he used to maintain that the high interest rates were a major weapon in the governments armoury and desirable on their own account <e> <s> may i ask him is it not essential now for a renewed and greater effort to get international agreement on this matter <e> <s> is it not a fact according to the bis report last month that the total international net credits now stand at over million that much of this was money borrowed to pay interest on money already borrowed and that very little of it has gone into really productive investment <e> <s> would he not also agree that we shall never get real stability in the world unless that vast amount of debt yields an interest

on th july <e> <s> may i ask him whether he will bear in mind what he told me on that date when interest rates were per cent <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finally ask the noble lord this

should be exercised not in the interests of the consumer <e> <s> time and time again i have heard ministers from the dispatch box argue against an amendment that endeavours to put down particulars to strengthen duties in particular circumstances <e> <s> the argument from the government dispatch box is always dont particularise because it weakens the case in other areas <e> <s> here it would seem at any rate that while the secretary of state and the director have a duty to exercise their functions in the interests of consumers and other users in these two parts a normal reading would suggest that in other parts they do not have that duty that they are not intended to or they are under not obligation to promote the interests of consumers and other users <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was very

approval of the position as outlined by the noble earl <e> <s> does he agree that it is a good thing that the prejudice against having modern aircraft in the queens flight now seems to have been dissipated <e> <s> does he not agree that it is cost-effective to have very busy public servants transported by modern aircraft <e> <s> does he not further agree that if the is purchased as i hope it

equally satisfactory u-turn about my previous question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just follow on <e> <s> now that the contract has been signed on the question of the amount of compensation under the general heading of disturbance is it not a fact that the price comes to the an acre which i said originally <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord talks about disturbance i think the term used in the contract was dislocation did that dislocation mean only the moving of an old hut and a telephone line <e> <s> is that not the dislocation that was incurred <e> <s> will the noble lord make it

reputation of this house <e> <s> would he not agree that that enhancement sprang from the growing feeling in the country that here you could advance an argument and that it would be listened to in a more restrained and objective atmosphere than in the other place <e> <s> but is it possible to reconcile that appreciation with the situation on th april when thanks to the professional skill of the

provision writes down its assets by some million in one year and then in the following year brings back some of those provisions and increases the value of some of its aircraft by no less than million

noble lord aware that many people will be especially pleased that he referred to the previous efforts of those responsible for british airways including people like mr roy watts who has been displaced

friday is a rather unusual day <e> <s> secondly in this case the other questions took up rather a long time and i suggest that it would not be right to adhere to the minutes by squeezing out the final question <e> <s> i want to ask if i may without the sympathy of the noble lord does the noble lord lord cockfield expect the recent rise in interest rates to have any effect on the flotation of british telecom and british airways shares in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a good thing when occasionally the arguments in this house do not fall entirely along party lines and this would seem to be another example of that <e> <s> i hope that the debate will be considered all the better for it <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations to those already offered to the noble earl lord kinnoull on his initiative in giving us the opportunity to discuss to some extent the caas proposals <e> <s> i looked forward greatly to hearing what he had to say <e> <s> i have to tell him that i was not at all disappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is saying that what i have said so far is incorrect i certainly withdraw <e> <s> i am quoting the figures published by the noble lord himself in his own report <e> <s> i have been looking at the management brief <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entitled to his interpretation and i am entitled to mine <e> <s> i do not believe that the interpretation that has been put upon them by much of the publicity helps in the current controversy <e> <s> that is all i am saying <e> <s> the noble lord is perfectly entitled to get up and contradict what i have said and i shall respect the explanations that he gives <e> <s> i shall not quote much more but the management brief does in fact say that the comparative results are on the basis of the same accountancy techniques with the exception of the treatment of assets <e> <s> that is all that i am saying that the treatment of assets can be very important indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl be good enough to clarify the answer which he gave to my noble friend lord barnett <e> <s> will he say whether he believes that the million to million cost of the strike so far has been to quote the chancellor of the exchequer a worthwhile investment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord speaks of the bargain for the taxpayer <e> <s> does that mean that the taxpayer will not now be asked to infuse something up to million into the accounts of british airways prior to its privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord to promise to have this matter looked at again <e> <s> is it not a fact that zimbabwe really wants the aircraft <e> <s> if it buys the dutch fokker f it will simply be because of the subsidy which the dutch government are making available to the fokker aircaft company <e> <s> will the noble lord bear in mind that if this order which is worth some million goes to the dutch it will have quite an influence on the sale of other aircraft to countries around zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have seen the arithmetic <e> <s> but if the noble lord looks at that arithmetic he will find that the british content of the is higher <e> <s> i should also like to ask the noble lord to bear in mind that the recent report of the house of commons trade and industry committee calls attention to the way in which we are losing export business because of the aid that is being given by our european friends in their export bids <e> <s> will he see whether we cannot at least match what the dutch are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would make it clear that my noble friend lord paget is not entirely right in what he said <e> <s> is it not a fact that it is not here a question of building up an expensive new state airline it is a question of replacing british aircraft that have given good service over some or years <e> <s> they must now be replaced <e> <s> it is essential that zimbabwe has an efficient air transport service in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether the million is the total cost to all government departments to all local authorities and to all those individuals who have lost their earnings <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that the million does not include any police costs any damage which has been done one way or the other extra expenses to the local authorities and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house will agree that the minister has tried hard but i cannot think that he has convinced many people that he has right on his side <e> <s> one of the features of this bill is that there has been a general feeling on all sides of the house that we are after the same objectives <e> <s> there has been no amendment down that i know about that has not been put down in good faith and where the spirit of it was not understood by noble lords opposite <e> <s> the argument has often been rather narrowly balanced <e> <s> but with a little more generosity the noble lord opposite could have accepted some of the amendments and he really ought to be able to accept this one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said something very important and i just want to make it clear <e> <s> is he saying that the agency would be free in their annual report to give details of the direction and of their reply to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that there were the increases in percentages would he not agree that in each of those cases the reason why he can give an increase in the percentage is that he is talking now about such a low base compared with <e> <s> secondly the noble lord says that there are many vacancies in manufacturing industry that are not being taken up <e> <s> would he be kind enough to tell us to which industries he is referring <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to gather from that that the government are not now considering the request which was made for money to write off the loan outstanding in the united states <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> last week his noble friend lord trefgarne said that the policy statement announced last month puts british airways on the same footing as any other private sector airline <e> <s> is there any other airline in the private sector which has asked for government money to write off its debts <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the way in which he is endeavouring to answer these questions <e> <s> but in answer to the last supplementary he said that it has not yet been decided <e> <s> does that mean that there is still a possibility that money will be given to british airways in order to facilitate its sale <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether in answer to his noble friend lord peyton the noble lord will make it clear that there is no question of selling off any public assets at a profit <e> <s> is it not in this case as with british telecom a matter of disposing of public assets by way of gift coupons <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter on two points <e> <s> first i agree with him when he says that it is quite absurd to have a one-runway limitation on a major london airport <e> <s> i accept everything that he says about that and will try to underline it <e> <s> i have only one reservation <e> <s> that is when he said that in his position as minister of transport in he agreed the two-runway principle at gatwick <e> <s> looking back i thought <e>", "<cs> my lords then my desire to agree with the noble lord is enhanced <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may intervene <e> <s> the noble lord has spoken a lot about liberalisation <e> <s> as an airline pilot he has not once mentioned the need to ensure air safety <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow this point a little further <e> <s> the noble lord has made it clear that the fault appears to be that of the airlines <e> <s> suppose the airlines said we have made a mistake <e> <s> you will have to pay the proper fare but we will advance you the difference between the fare you have paid and that which you will have to pay <e> <s> we will pay that as compensation for our mistake <e> <s> would they then be contravening any regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord appears to have left the question that i asked is he not going to give me any information about the moneys for which british airways have asked to wipe out their outstanding loans for the american aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords they borrowed money in the united states to buy american aircraft and they are asking the british government for taxpayers money to wipe out that loan <e> <s> i am asking what criteria will be applied in making a decision as to whether or not they should be given this money <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the question here is not one of party policy but of what is happening to our attempted exports <e> <s> the noble lord has made a categorical statement that there is equality of criteria as between the different eec countries and the level of support they give to their respective manufacturers <e> <s> will he look at the recent cases of the attempted export by british aerospace of s to zimbabwe and the attempted export of s to a caribbean country where he will find that there was not that same equality of criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister says that one month should not be taken in isolation <e> <s> does that mean that he is optimistic about the other months <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister agree that in this particular requirement parliamentary pressure has probably gone as far down the road as it can usefully go <e> <s> if there is an important issue of british content here will he confirm that the pc now has a british design leadership <e> <s> will the noble lord also confirm that the pc has as high or higher a british content of equipment as any of the competitors <e> <s> in these circumstances will it not be better now to leave it to the professionals to make their choice <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord really saying that the matter will now be closed even though there is such a big gap between what we pay and what we receive <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord confusing the house with this talk of reductions <e> <s> it still means that the united kingdom which is not the richest member of the community is paying into the fund much more than it is getting out <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl three questions <e> <s> first if the airports require additional revenue over and above the landing charges would it not be better to give a straightforward treasury subsidy so that we can see what it amounts to <e> <s> secondly if tax concessions are to be made would it not be more logical to make them available to those people who stay in this country and spend their money rather than to those who go overseas <e> <s> thirdly is any consideration given to the fire hazard posed by the quantities of spirits stored in the luggage lockers <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are looking for a source of revenue and they do not wish to tax either art or entertainment would they consider advertising as being a suitable subject for vat <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl think that in this there is something that we ought to be absolutely ashamed about <e> <s> is it not a matter for national shame that this year when we have made the biggest sale ever of public assets something like million pounds worth of our capital has been sold a once-and-for-all sale and have had this enormous influx into the treasury they have to cut million off research and development <e>", "<cs> my lords by no means for the first time the noble earl lord kinnoull has shown that in matters of public concern his judgment is often sounder than that of this government <e> <s> i believe the government to be wrong in their decision to withdraw the note and i am sure they are wrong too in the way they have reached their decision and in the reasons or excuses which they have given for that decision <e> <s> in the first place there should have been consultation <e> <s> in a matter of this kind when the day-to-day interests of the general public are involved surely a serious effort should have been made to have established public wishes in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord answer the question whether they were consulted about the coin or consulted about withdrawing the note <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord really saying that the general public are deliberately ill-treating the notes <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord says that he agrees with the noble lord lord obrien will he tell the house how he reconciles the statement of the noble lord lord obrien that it is profitable to issue notes or notes with the statement that there will be a loss of million if we continue to issue them <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that a country that spends this amount of money on an independent nuclear deterrent that can never be used independently but that has nevertheless to cut down proper flying practice for its service pilots does not cut a very good figure in international affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> has he or the government a view about the expensive salesmanship of the city gentlemen who say that they can reduce or even eliminate the necessity for paying tax <e> <s> is he aware that one city company for example says <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that there is another aspect to this <e> <s> this wad of material i have here is only some of that which came to me within a space of two or three weeks <e> <s> most of it is on high-quality paper and there are prepaid envelopes <e> <s> if this kind of costly extravagance had been shown by those who dig our coal or produce our gas would not the noble earl be saying that it is evidence of waste in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble earl on his cleverness in the last answer he gave me <e> <s> but may i also ask him is he not aware of this material that is going around <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> may i make it absolutely clear that nothing i say is a personal criticism of mr macgregor but of the fact of the appointment <e> <s> is it not a fact that this information shows that the appointment is one <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order may i suggest to the noble viscount the leader of the house that if he wants to curtail questions it might be just as well to start curtailing them a little earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord need not give way <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> may i make one point <e> <s> i did not make a reference to wealth creation <e> <s> it should have been made <e> <s> i tried hard to prune my speech <e> <s> i was shorter than some of those who followed me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord i believe has overlooked the word directly in directly creating employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will withdraw those congratulations <e> <s> this was not something that i thought up on the spur of the moment i had been thinking along these lines for a long time cameras or no cameras <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had quite a long debate and it has been wound up in a most remarkable fashion <e> <s> the noble viscount lord whitelaw said to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether this is in the nature of a cost-plus contract and does not the british defence industry require a fixed price <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord clarify his answer to me <e> <s> if they are fixed price contracts how is it that they are continually increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies i wonder whether i might ask just one question <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran said that certain parts of the bill applied very narrowly <e> <s> nevertheless there are parts of our country and certain counties that are very importantly affected and the importance did not come over in what the noble lord had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily acquit everyone concerned of sinister motives but if it was fixed some time ago would it have been beyond the wit of the planners of business here to have delayed the second reading until his report had been received <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should not harp on this then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to make this intervention in the statements <e> <s> from this side i should like to add our congratulations to the noble lord lord chapple on his maiden speech <e> <s> had he found it possible to remain in his seat i should have had pleasure in telling him that i admired his practical approach and that i agreed with a good deal of what he had to say <e> <s> i was particularly pleased to be able to support what the noble lord lord nugent said about the speech of the noble lord lord chapple because i always prefer if possible to agree with the noble lord lord nugent and i am going to disagree with him when i come to the substance of this report <e>", "<cs> my lords if this authority is being run efficiently and if it is not asking for treasury money on what principle are the government interfering with management <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that the general public the consumers are not entitled to know what the argument is about <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that the government are being somewhat casual about this <e> <s> as the minister said concerning this particular part of the country the matter was raised in the other place in committee and there the minister gave an undertaking that he would visit the site to see for himself what was involved <e> <s> i should have thought we should have had the benefit of that report before we considered the bill at second reading <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i still do not understand what the noble lord is saying about consultations <e> <s> are there impending consultations about this particular problem with which the amendments are concerned <e>", "<cs> i am not talking about the bill as a whole <e> <s> i am talking about the particular problem with which these two amendments are concerned <e> <s> if i understand the noble lord to say that there are consultations taking place or to be held can we take it that the bill will not be progressed any further until we have had the result of the consultations <e>", "<cs> may i just press the noble lord <e> <s> he is being very patient and i am sure that my noble friend baroness nicol and i are grateful to him <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may be able to help me as i have great difficulty following this <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that throughout the first part of what he stated he referred to ironstone workings <e> <s> the problem in northampton is created by the fact that the permission that was granted to extract ironstone had the effect incidentally almost of allowing the working of limestone <e> <s> what is at issue now is not the extraction of ironstone because there is no steelworks in the area to use the ironstone <e> <s> but there are people who want i have already used the phrase to exploit this loophole for the purpose of extracting limestone <e> <s> do i take it that the power of the minister to abate any compensation provisions would apply to the limestone working equally with ironstone <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that these aircraft have in fact been delivered that they are operating and giving splendid service and that there is even talk of further aircraft <e> <s> but is not the position with regard to european aid quite intolerable <e> <s> it was laid down that that aid would only be forthcoming if liat bought the french aircraft <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me what representations have been made to ensure that this situation does not arise again <e>", "<cs> but my lords is that not quite unacceptable <e> <s> the brussels agency are dispensing funds to which we are a contributor <e> <s> as a matter of fact we probably contribute more than anyone else <e> <s> we are part of that organisation <e> <s> are we not making representations to ensure that in future if an operator or a possible customer wants to buy a particular aircraft it is not laid down that aid is only forthcoming if french aircraft are bought <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not absolutely ludicrous that the people in brussels should say which is the best aircraft for a company to fly <e> <s> the people who actually operate the aircraft should be the judges <e> <s> would the noble lord be kind enough to write to me stating what are the criteria who decided them when they were decided and what input we made into that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press this matter but would the noble lord be kind enough to say whether he would send me the criteria on which the decision to allocate money was made by the brussels agency <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that as a general view anyone who tries to prove his case with percentages lays himself open to suspicion <e> <s> the noble lord tried to show that we were doing rather better than germany or japan in the united states in the last year <e> <s> will he now give the actual figures and not percentages <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his answer <e> <s> will he accept that i am not trying to probe into budget secrets but am concerned with principles <e> <s> would not the noble earl agree that if the government believe it to be necessary to move from direct to indirect taxation it is desirable to levy those taxes on non-essentials of which i suggest advertising is one rather than on such items as home decoration or foodstuffs such as fish and chips <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept that of course i realise that there is a case for advertising <e> <s> but does he not also agree that every day now through every letter box there is evidence supported by the figures which he has given that advertising has passed the bounds of moderation <e> <s> is there not a case for putting it in a similar tax bracket to tobacco and alcohol <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that answer and more for its courtesy than for its content may i say that i sympathise with him in being in the difficult position of having to put forward a credible scenario in what is a quite impossible situation <e> <s> however may i ask the noble lord since he contradicted me so firmly on the th december whether if it ever came to an exclusive bilateral exchange of nuclear weapons there would be a sufficient pause to enable our american allies to withdraw from their united kingdom bases to escape destruction <e> <s> also may we take it that we already have an agreement with the german government which will enable our forces in germany to operate from that territory in the event of this independent war which the noble lord is suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords the more we consider the possibility of the independent use of this weapon does it not become apparent that the thing is absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> but my lords if the noble lord is now shifting his ground and saying that the purpose of trident is to add to the total nato deterrent does he not accept that the two main contestants in this equation the soviet union and the united states already have enough nuclear weapons to wipe out all of us and that there really is no necessity to add this extravagant item trident <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there has been a great improvement in my postal district in recent months <e> <s> our great complaint is not the time taken in delivery but the volume of mail <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there will be considerable regret that the aircraft which the professionals at the raf have consistently wanted namely the pc has not been chosen especially as it made such an attractive training package with the hawk <e> <s> may i also ask the minister whether he is aware that now the decision has been taken all of us wish that splendid team at shorts all good fortune in the manufacture of this aircraft and in the consequent export sales which it is hoped they will obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord talks about looking forward will he say as one interested in industry how far forward they can look if they are allocated million which was the figure allocated to the new developments by the national coal board <e> <s> can he say how they could have looked forward with imagination if they had been given something of the million which was later spent on policing during the strike period <e>", "<cs> my lords but the original amount allocated to the coal board enterprise was million <e> <s> it was later increased to million <e> <s> does not the allocation of that small amount indicate the attitude that is bedevilling the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to proposals from the treasury to the chairmen of the nationalised industries <e> <s> my i ask does this mean that the treasury now has separate and direct access to the chairmen of the nationalised industries in addition to or separate from the sponsoring departments <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl be kind enough to answer my question <e> <s> does this mean that the question is incorrectly phrased or do the treasury have direct consultation now with the nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be kind enough to answer a little more clearly <e> <s> does the treasury or does it not now have direct access to the chairmen of the nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> on a point of order my lords are we not engaged in report stage and not committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had a case brought to my attention of a single parent in belfast with a child of six taking home a week as a part-time cleaner who has a week deducted from that sum under the emergency provisions to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> could this happen elsewhere in the united kingdom and ought it to continue to happen in belfast <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in this case the money was deducted from part-time earnings simply because the supplementary benefit payable did not cover the a week which they wanted to deduct <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always believed in brevity in both questions and answers and i hope that i practise what i preach <e> <s> if the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is reminiscing about what happened in the commons i think i can say that in fact i hold the record for the number of questions answered within the period of one question time <e> <s> i believe that within the hour i answered and then the prime minister came in as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> would he not agree that there is something repugnant or offensive as i think <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the airlines are given all the information but can he tell us what the airlines say in return about the level of charges <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said in answer to a supplementary question from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the soviet union may well be manufacturing chemical weapons <e> <s> will he say whether we have in fact evidence to that effect <e> <s> will he recall the meeting that he attended earlier in the week when it was said by one authority that the soviet union had tonnes by another authority equally firmly that it had tonnes while another authority implied that there were stocks left over from the last war and that they were deteriorating <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that in the case of civil servants who may wish to take up a commercial appointment on leaving the service certain restrictions very properly apply <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether the same restrictions apply to this very sensitive post and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the leader of the house whether this a new rule <e> <s> if a question has two parts is it the case that the minister has been instructed not to answer the second part <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the leader of the house whether the rule about more than one part to a question applies in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister in all kindness as i quite like him not to repeat again the figures he gave for the sales of hardware <e> <s> in this business one does not sell hardware until three or four years after money has been put into design research and re-equipping <e> <s> one cannot prove a political theory with the figures which the minister gave to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer and of course i accept that the receipts go into the general kitty <e> <s> will the noble lord now confirm that out of that general kitty the recent tax concessions were only made possible because of those receipts <e> <s> secondly will he now agree that the gross appreciation of share values which took place in private hands was not compensated for or balanced by any increased production of real wealth was it not therefore inflationary and are we not now facing a situation which is dangerous to the future stability of our society <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say that such is my admiration for the debating skill of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that i accept that he can make a full days debate or two days debate out of any subject that is put into any question <e> <s> i now beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> but will he accept that it does not adequately explain why they should go back on the pledge that was given in that there would be no further sales of shares for the foreseeable future <e> <s> will the noble lord make absolutely clear that not a single penny raised by these sales of government shares went into new equipment for the company <e> <s> will he also take the opportunity to correct an impression which he probably inadvertently gave yesterday that the sale of these remaining government shares would mean that the men and women working in british aerospace would work harder <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said in reply to the third part of my question that the record of the company spoke for itself and of course the record of the company is absolutely splendid <e> <s> what he actually said yesterday was that the sale of these further shares <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government have found a cleverer way of managing these industries why do they pick out the easier and more profitable concerns to hand over to this new concept <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl say why he has chosen the date of th january to discuss this as i shall be travelling back from japan on that day <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> will he accept that i am not here trying to get involved in any argument in regard to milton friedman or maynard keynes <e> <s> my question is a comparatively simple one <e> <s> it is clear there has been an enormous increase in money stock <e> <s> will the minister agree that it has not been caused by the government printing notes or minting money <e> <s> my question therefore is ought we not at this point to have a really serious attempt to find out precisely how the financial institutions do create this extra purchasing power <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not disposed to query anything that the noble lord says <e> <s> i am not saying that the money created is not performing a useful service <e> <s> what i am saying is that at the present moment almost the whole of the money which the government borrow is to pay interest on money which they have already borrowed <e> <s> in these circumstances is it not absurd to leave the creation of money to some private institutions and then for the government to pay interest on that money when they borrow it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it that i have the noble lords approval for an attempt i shall make in the future to have this matter raised again in debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware

on informed pressure if he is without the basic elementary information on which to exert the pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may say that i thought that the noble lord lord northfield extolled the virtues of wembley rather too much for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said rightly that there is general agreement between the club and the police as to the number of police officers on duty in the ground <e> <s> surely however subsection extends the position <e> <s> surely it means that a constable or constables may insist on entering the ground if in their view they feel it is necessary for them to intervene for some reason even though the club may think that the situation is all right <e> <s> if a constable enters on his own volition does that mean that the club is liable to pay for him <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the noble lord lord glenarthur say that clause deals with an agreement between the club and the force <e> <s> here surely it is making provision for a constable to enter the ground irrespective of what other agreement has been reached <e> <s> if that entry is made by a constable or constables surely the cost of that should not fall upon the club
