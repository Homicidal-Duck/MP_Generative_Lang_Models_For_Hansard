["<cs> my lords my noble friend lord shackleton mentioned one very important aspect of the economic future of the falkland islands namely the development of marine resources <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether she is entirely satisfied that another aspect namely land reform is developing satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be unkind to say that it is not only rather wide but also rather more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords when considering these matters will the noble lord bear in mind that at the international match in vienna last week there was no trouble from the english spectators <e> <s> they were addressed by the austrian authorities over the public address system in english not as potential thugs but as sensible people who would wish to know what arrangements had been made <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that having been privileged to be present i am quite convinced that that contributed to the good atmosphere which prevailed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house has reason to be grateful to the noble lord lord foot for the constructive way in which he has followed what the noble earl lord kinnoull has said <e> <s> there is a case here for looking again at this act now years old <e> <s> there are certain factors that are different today as compared with those days in the middle of the last century <e> <s> i feel that there has been injustice caused in recent months or i might say in recent weeks because a fortnight ago the shrewsbury bill fell by the wayside in the other place but the shrewsbury football club is still left with substantial costs to meet <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he say something about the point of the committee before which the second bill has to go <e> <s> would that committee be competent to reconsider the question of costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the time sincerely to thank all those noble lords who have taken part in the debate and not least for their unremittingly good-tempered approach to the issues which i sought to describe <e> <s> i have learned much from the debate not least the meaning of the term fungible <e> <s> my noble friend lord hatch seemed to think that the speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that a properly run airline has to plan its programmes ahead <e> <s> when is the process of consultation to start and who is going to initiate it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply and particularly for its helpful content <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether there is a case today for relating the safety requirements to the number of passengers rather than to the weight of the aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord and of course i value his experience and agree with him that it may be necessary to have two pilots rather than one in the case of an aircraft carrying passengers <e> <s> when is it likely that there will be a decision taken as regards this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i thank the noble lord for that information which i already knew <e> <s> while there is still time for the government to change their mind on this while there is still time to change the order from the american harpoon would the noble lord confirm the fact that the british sea eagle outperforms the american harpoon and the exocet <e> <s> would it not be a serious blow to the british industry especially in their export markets if the british government choose the american weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that all these contenders were good and of course they were but would he make it absolutely clear that what i said at first is true that the sea eagle outperforms the others <e> <s> will he make that clear <e> <s> would he also say when it was decided to buy the american harpoon what rate of exchange was agreed <e> <s> was it not to the pound and has not the rate of exchange now changed <e> <s> may i also ask what undertakings have been reached about the price of spares and does this not come into the total cost <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that when i first asked this question he said on th march that this was a confidential matter between the government and the owners of the land <e> <s> may i ask him why he is now able to change his mind about this <e> <s> could he not have an equally satisfactory u-turn about my previous question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just follow on <e> <s> now that the contract has been signed on the question of the amount of compensation under the general heading of disturbance is it not a fact that the price comes to the an acre which i said originally <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord talks about disturbance i think the term used in the contract was dislocation did that dislocation mean only the moving of an old hut and a telephone line <e> <s> is that not the dislocation that was incurred <e> <s> will the noble lord make it clear that when one includes compensation the actual price paid per acre for this land is as i originally said which compares very strangely with to per acre for similar land in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy and sadness at the tragedy at the hospital in port stanley <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a formidable case against this bill from the bench of bishops <e> <s> i am bound to say that i found myself wondering what a difference there would have been had those right reverend prelates and the most reverend primate joined us in say the matrimonial provisions bill <e> <s> had they then have attended in such force had they then given the same sort of lead had they then employed the same debating skill how much more chance we would have had against the skill of the noble and learned lord who sits upon the woolsack <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government taken into account the fact that the cia appears to have an independent capability of waging war <e> <s> what action would we take in the case of the cia exercising that capability here <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a matter of imagination it is a question of reading the newspapers <e>"]
