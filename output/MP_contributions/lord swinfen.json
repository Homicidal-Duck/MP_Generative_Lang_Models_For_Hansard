["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for his reply may i ask whether he is aware that i would be grateful to know and i am sure the house would as well if any request has been made to the eec for grants or loans to be forthcoming for such a project <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house for not putting my name down for this debate but originally i had not intended to speak <e> <s> i was for a time a co-opted member of sub-committee f under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord sherfield and grew extremely concerned at the very obvious shortage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he can explain why only one of the local authorities in the greater manchester county requires this power and none of the other local authorities seem to want it <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the suggestion of a period of five years rather than three years <e> <s> this bill deals with scotland and people in local authority houses in wales england and northern ireland can also qualify within this period to buy a house in scotland <e> <s> should not the matter be considered at the same time as the housing bill so that the qualifying period is the same under both bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the general principle behind the amendment of the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> there is however one question that worries me and i wonder whether the minister could give the house an answer because possibly the amendment is a wrecking amendment although unintentionally so <e> <s> i have always been under the impression that there is a speed restriction in force on all roads in this country <e> <s> where no other limit is in force and specifically signposted one of miles an hour is in force <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the government have given us no indication of the regulations which they propose to introduce and therefore i think it is essential that your lordships house has the opportunity to discuss them <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which i think is extremely sensible and i hope that if necessary my noble friend will press it to a division <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend has just said because as i read the paragraph it will be a defence against prosecution if you wish to ring a wild goose or duck but not any other kind of bird nevertheless you can examine any bird of any variety for any marking <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and particularly the one with regard to bullfinches <e> <s> a flock of bullfinches can strip an orchard in a matter of hours <e> <s> normal bureaucracy will take not hours but several days to issue a licence and many fruit farmers can quite easily be ruined by a flock of bullfinches <e>", "<cs> there may well be a case for the government considering the issue of blanket licences in areas where specific birds are a real pest <e> <s> i wonder whether they could consider this <e>", "<cs> i am very fond of bats but i am wondering whether their protection particularly that of the horseshoe bat would not be best dealt with under clause <e> <s> then houses in which rare colonies are found could be designated as areas of special scientific interest which might make things easier all round <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should like to say that it is always being pointed out to us that there is liable by the end of this century to be a very serious shortfall in the energy supplies to <e>", "<cs> i believe that there is a parallel provision in the town and country planning act under which anyone who thought that there was possible development on his land could claim compensation in connection with having to apply for planning consent where there was a possibility of refusal <e> <s> there is always the possibility that land that becomes a sssi is not farmland <e> <s> for one reason or another an area of derelict industrial land might become inhabited by some interesting species <e> <s> if that land were declared a sssi and so could not be developed industrially there could be a very considerable loss to the owner <e>", "<cs> one of the advantages to british telecom if this amendment is carried is that they themselves will be able to sell the first instrument to the consumer and would therefore be able to reduce their own capital and borrowing requirement which i think in the future could be extremely important <e> <s> it has also been said that they would be at a disadvantage against competitors in acquiring telephones to supply to customers <e> <s> i would have thought that they were in an ideal position at the moment being the holders of a monopoly whereby they could acquire telephones in much larger numbers and therefore obtain better contract prices from the suppliers to enable them to sell the telephone to their clients at lower costs than anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords is the prevention of delivery of mail to the passport offices not an illegal disruption of her majestys mails <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for rising when i have not put my name down to speak <e> <s> i had originally not intended taking part in this debate <e> <s> i must also apologise to my noble friend lord nugent for not being here when he gave his opening speech <e> <s> however i think i am quite considerably younger than most other members who have spoken <e> <s> i am not a grandparent <e> <s> i am however a parent with children ranging from to <e> <s> i personally as well as a number of my friends are shocked by a lot of the displays that we can see around in our towns and spreading from the towns into the villages <e> <s> not only am i and my own generation shocked but the generation that comes after it <e> <s> in other words my children and my friends children <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise just one point on this particular paragraph <e> <s> why should it be limited to an aircraft only and not a ship as well <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend the minister when replying could answer that point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon appeared to me to base his arguments for his amendment basically on the offences of taking away or stealing a motor vehicle but not on subsection <e>", "<cs> while i agree with noble lords opposite that there is a great deal to be said for reducing the number of people in prison i wonder whether my noble friend lord belstead and his department could think of the possibility of adding another punishment for this crime that of community service bearing in mind that a number of potential offenders could be extremely young <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down are courts not given advice by the lord chancellors department on the sort of sentences that should be passed to ensure uniformity throughout the country <e>", "<cs> can my noble and learned friend say why the driver of a vehicle damaging property does not have to report the accident to the police <e> <s> i am sure that a number of local authorities must lose a considerable amount of money as a result of their lampposts being knocked over and likewise private individuals with their garden walls being damaged <e>", "<cs> in answer to the remarks made by the noble lord lord spens on the small village shop surely once this bill becomes law if the proprietors of the magazines that are sold in the small village shop want their magazines sold in those shops they will produce inoffensive front covers so that the proprietors of the shops will not be committing an offence and will therefore continue to hold their magazines within their stocks <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that the retailers should put covers on the books but the producer of the magazine the publisher <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> if one considers a field that cereals were normally grown in in and the straw alone <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that the object of using a smaller hole was to cause less distress to the sheep <e> <s> is there any hole smaller than the mm one which is large enough for all practical purposes not to grow over that could be used so that more sheep could be caused less distress <e>", "<cs> no my lords the larger hole for use only in this country <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend has just said because i also am not in favour of this amendment <e> <s> if the other place had in their own wisdom thought it right that people who were convicted should stand for parliament they themselves would have brought forward this amendment <e> <s> they are very careful and caring about their own honour and integrity and i do not think it is right that we should disagree with them at this stage by passing this amendment <e> <s> i therefore hope that it will be rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord nugent of guildford on the way in which he has brought the bill through your lordships house <e> <s> at the same time i should like to say to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby that it is not only members of this house of his generation who have taken offence at some of the displays that we see in shops not only in soho but in other parts of london and in other parts of this country <e> <s> as i said at second reading not only my generation but people younger than i am have taken offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this amendment from the government but at the same time i support what my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth has said <e> <s> is my noble friend lord skelmersdale aware that the cereal harvest is already ripening and that the greatest period of danger from fire is almost upon us for another year <e> <s> i feel that it should not be difficult to bring in an order increasing the amount fairly quickly and that would certainly give comfort to a number of railside farmers <e> <s> before we leave this matter perhaps my noble friend can tell the house whether or not fires started by electric trains are also covered under the railway fires act or whether the act covers solely those fires started by steam trains <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with this amendment there is one small point that comes to mind on reading his amendment <e> <s> i wonder what the position would be if belize was attacked and damage was done <e> <s> would not the belizeans if this amendment is passed have a claim in the british courts against britain for any damage done <e> <s> because we would have to continue to take appropriate measures to protect the integrity of belize <e> <s> by passing this amendment should we not possibly be damaging this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought with the great concern that there is at the moment for handicapped people that the vast majority of education authorities were already making plans and revising existing plans <e> <s> therefore this proposed new clause is probably superfluous and it could tie the hands of local education authorities by putting their possibly wider ideas into a narrow context <e>", "<cs> my lords i just wonder whether there is a way round this <e> <s> can my noble friend lord geddes who already has his copy of the bill marked not put a manuscript amendment on all the amendments on the table at the moment <e> <s> is that a matter that would be procedurally correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended asking a question of the noble baroness lady birk before she sat down <e> <s> however unfortunately the noble lord lord winstanley is a much fitter parliamentarian than i am and he beat me to the draw and was on his feet very much faster <e> <s> as the noble baroness is not in a position to reply to my question i shall address it instead in a slightly different form to my noble friend lord bellwin <e> <s> would be confirm that a tenant who is aggrieved at the amount of rent on a property is able himself to apply for a fair rent to be registered <e> <s> would he also confirm <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not hear the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my question is would my noble friend confirm that where a tenant is not satisfied with the rent that he is paying or has to pay that the tenant is in a position to apply for a fair rent to be registered <e> <s> would he further confirm that from the time of an application for the registration of a fair rent the normal period is about eight weeks and not the six months as mentioned by the noble baroness lady birk <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that a number of lorries are already very much overloaded can the minister assure the house that adequate steps <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider the possibility of controlling the sale of instant glues to small children because they also are extremely dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley in thanking the noble lord lord hylton for introducing this debate <e> <s> rural housing is and has been for some time an extremely important subject <e> <s> however i would take issue with the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley in that i personally do not believe that the present governments financial policy has caused the problem the problem was there a long time before the conservatives came to power and i am glad to see that the noble lord is nodding his head in agreement with me <e> <s> the noble lord also mentioned the great shortage in the country of houses to rent <e> <s> i believe that is primarily caused as in the towns and cities by the rent acts of previous socialist governments <e>", "<cs> as one of the more juvenile members of your lordships house i should like to support this amendment first because i am not very fond of sex shops in any case and secondly because i think it is very much clearer for the layman reading the act which this bill will become than is the governments own amendment <e> <s> having myself on occasions had cause to thumb through various acts of parliament to try to find out what they mean it is sometimes very difficult <e> <s> i think it is essential that it should be as clear and as easy as possible for the layman <e> <s> the people who are going to have to work this bill when it becomes an act are laymen the vast majority of them with very little legal training <e> <s> they may have advisers but they themselves have to make the decisions <e>", "<cs> i wonder if my noble friend will give way <e> <s> i wish to raise a matter on the question of locality <e> <s> does it include the whole of a local authoritys area or does it only refer to parts of it <e> <s> can a local authority decide that the whole of its area is a locality or will it only have the power to ban sex shops in certain parts <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> though not a lawyer i think that as it stands the provision could possibly lead to encouragement of contravention of the obscene publications act <e> <s> as i understand it the act of rape is an act of force associated with certain sexual activity <e> <s> as i read it the wording of the bill could well encourage people to watch films of rape which could lead them to indulge in rape which to all sensible people is an abhorrent form of violence <e> <s> apart from that any form of violence or cruelty involving sex that is encouraged is a matter of sexual gratification rather than of love and is something that we certainly should not encourage <e> <s> i have a feeling that as worded at the moment the bill could lead to such encouragement and therefore i wish to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would let your lordships know whether he is entirely satisfied that local residents should be advised only by notices in the newspapers <e> <s> in the areas where sex shops are likely to be established a large number of the residents are elderly with poor eyesight <e> <s> they are not always very well educated and they will not look at that part of their local newspapers <e> <s> they are not interested <e> <s> surely there should be some better way of advising them that there is the danger of a sex shop coming so that they themselves know that they have an opportunity to make an objection <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister say for what term licences would be issued <e>", "<cs> am i not right in thinking that as the bill will have been amended by your lordships house when it returns to another place they will then have an opportunity of discussing the point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is getting late and i do not intend to be very long <e> <s> there is one point which the noble lord lord houghton has raised yet again that is that it is only the elderly who are concerned with this subject <e> <s> i have pointed out in your lordships house before that those of my generation and even younger are concerned with it <e> <s> on this occasion i have taken the trouble to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble marquess <e> <s> i would agree that they provide a case for the protection of children but i was also told that where children had got into trouble with the police it was very often found when the police went to their homes that quite a lot of pornographic material in the way of magazines was in the home a number of the magazines illustrating violence as well as various forms of sexual deviation <e> <s> and it is not necessarily kept away from the children <e> <s> they have free access to it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness can tell us why she has chosen the period of months rather than one year <e> <s> it seems to me that the latter would he rather more sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what my noble friend lord elton has said i still feel that there is a great deal of virtue in the amendment moved by the noble earl lord halsbury in place of my noble friend <e> <s> i feel that it is an additional weapon for the police to use in their fight against the misuse of sex in society today <e> <s> i would therefore give this amendment my wholehearted support <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> at the committee stage of the bill there was considerable discussion on the meaning of locality and i ended up rather confused as i think the whole committee probably did because no clear definition came out at all <e> <s> local authority councillors are all democratically-elected and in theory represent the views of the population and if the council as a whole either want or do not want sex establishments in their area they should be able to make the decision <e> <s> it is quite within the powers of a newly-elected council to reverse a decision that has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wondering what happens if applicants consider the fees to be unreasonable <e> <s> will the local authority have to produce its accounts to an applicant in order to prove that the fee is reasonable <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could tell me what happens if there is some dispute on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no quarrel at all with amendment no <e> <s> proposed by my noble friend <e> <s> but i feel that his amendment no <e> <s> is nothing like as good as lord nugents amendment no <e> <s> for reasons that have already been mentioned by other noble lords <e> <s> a reasonable fee can very easily be construed by the courts as a very low fee <e> <s> i feel it is essential that in the bill the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a subject about which i know very little <e> <s> my instinct tells me that there is a great deal of merit in the amendment <e> <s> i should like to support it <e> <s> however with regard to clause why should a man who fails to comply with the requirements of his licence not be made to go back and serve the rest of his sentence <e> <s> if he has to serve an additional sentence of only a maximum of days he may end up with less sentence than the courts gave him in the first place although having broken the terms of his licence <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to give any indication of on what sort of basis apportionment would he used if rateable value is not to be so used <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can tell us if the owner of a vehicle which is damaged by one of these devices will be able to obtain compensation from the police <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by apologising both to the house and to my noble friend lord nugent that i was not here when he put his question and if i mention any aspects on the question that other noble lords have already raised please forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether those properties that have now been transferred to private ownership are being better maintained and therefore whether the life of those houses is being extended <e>", "<cs> my lords most of what i wanted to say has already been said by other noble lords and said very much better than i can <e> <s> but i should still like <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in favour of the motion because i think a trading fund would lead to very much greater efficiency <e> <s> the system of an organisation being funded on an annual basis by votes is in many ways a rough and ready method by which at the end of some years they have a great deal of money which they then spend in a hurry not always in a well-thought-out way while in other years they run out two or three months before the end of the financial year <e> <s> with the introduction of a trading fund the ordnance survey will be able to look at their financial planning on a much longer and better basis and so be a great deal more efficient in the way they operate and in keeping down not only their working costs but as a result the costs of their products <e>", "<cs> i do not think i would apply it to the whole of government expenditure my lords <e> <s> for a long time the ordnance survey has been selling its products to the public <e> <s> it is very difficult to use the same commercial basis when one is funding a police force or an army <e> <s> one cannot personally buy half-an-hour of a private soldiers time although i know that on special occasions one can buy the time of a constable for example to stand outside while ones daughter is being married <e> <s> but that is a different thing <e>", "<cs> will not my noble friends amendment help to bring this definition into line with the wording of clause <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether in his reply the noble lord the minister has considered the question of one computer talking to another computer transferring information from computer a to computer b would the question of transferring not arise in that situation <e>", "<cs> i support what my noble friend lord renton said about having just one definition clause instead of two <e> <s> my noble friend is a very eminent lawyer <e> <s> if my noble friend has difficulty with two definition clauses in a bill which in due course will become an act what about the rest of us who are mere laymen but who are still expected to know the law <e> <s> therefore i support what my noble friend lord renton said and would ask my noble friend lord elton to look at this point very seriously before bringing the bill back on report <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one comment on the seventh principle before the schedule is agreed to <e> <s> at one point the data subject is given the right of access at reasonable times to the data that is on the computer but i understand that quite often the data is put into some code or into some form that is understood by the users of the computer for their own purposes <e> <s> can my noble friend assure me that the form in which the data is presented to the subject will be such that the subject will understand it in other words in good plain english or if necessary in wales in welsh <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether there will not be a need for the registrar to be kept continually up to date with improved computer technology so that he will know what computers can do <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble viscount <e> <s> this is a sensible amendment which will obviate the excuse from an operator that he did not realise that he had to give all the information that was required <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in his amendment <e> <s> i just wonder whether my other noble friend on the front bench has thought of the position if the single relevant individual happens to be a young woman away on maternity leave <e> <s> she would be away for six months and one would get no answer <e> <s> therefore i would urge him to accept this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will give way for a moment the wording in the bill says <e>", "<cs> i too support my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i am sure there are a number of instances where it is not necessary to have the data registered for instance lists of applicants and their requirements on the computer of a chain of house agents <e> <s> they supply the agents with precisely the information they want them to know as to the kind of houses they want and it can do no harm to anyone to have that on a computer <e>", "<cs> i am briefed on this amendment by the cbi as my noble friend so rightly indicated <e> <s> they believe that a requirement for a code of practice to be drawn up before a data user can operate would be disastrous in terms of getting legislation on to the statute book within any reasonable time-scale and enabling this country to ratify the council of europe <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend lord mottistone on this <e> <s> the government should have a look at this again from the purely commercial rather than the data protection aspect <e> <s> with the sort of delays that could be involved as the bill is written at the moment we could lose possible export opportunities to other countries to the detriment of our own balance of payments <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord decides what he is going to do with his amendment could he answer in his speech one small point <e> <s> the registrar as i understand it has a supervisory position <e>", "<cs> this paragraph is indeed a veritable fog of obscurity <e> <s> if my noble friend is not prepared to agree to its removal would he be prepared to reconsider its wording and come back with a more definite wording at report stage <e>", "<cs> last week i advocated that a professional data users body should be responsible for drawing up the codes of practice and i still adhere to that view <e> <s> one of the points that i do not particularly like about the amendment is that is says where any data user i would prefer that a data users association drew up a code of practice for all data users rather than individual users producing their own code of practice for the registrar to approve because there could be very many different codes all with approval and all slightly different <e> <s> however to have an association or to use the words of the amendment any body representative would be an extremely useful and good way of doing it because they are the people who are working with computers and data the whole time and they know what computers will do and can therefore ensure that if the code needs updating at any point it can be updated <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend on the front bench think of the case where a data user is improving <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend could enlighten me on one other word in sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> surely a circuit judge should be the individual here rather than a magistrate because it could involve the total livelihood of the person whose premises are going to be searched <e>", "<cs> while i am not a computer expert i understand that a number of computers can be given <e>", "<cs> when the minister considers these three amendments would he consider the methods in which computers can give their information <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> there is reference to whether any data equipment was inspected examined operated or tested <e> <s> there is also the question of whether anything was removed <e> <s> a print-out can of course be removed but information given on a visual display unit cannot be taken away for examination unless photographed <e> <s> there is also information given out in some form of sound or another modern method <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister would consider this when looking into the matter further <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble and learned friend this question what would be the position if a data subject were to ask the government as opposed to a particular department what information was held <e> <s> would they have to supply the information held by every single department the health service criminal records motor vehicle licensing the lot <e>", "<cs> in my noble and learned friends original answer he referred to punched holes as being a method of providing information held on the data subject <e> <s> is the scope of the bill then greater than just dealing with computers or are we talking about all mechanical forms of storing and retrieving information <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble viscount on this amendment <e> <s> also may i remind our front bench of the reply given to me by my noble friend lord elton to a question on the first day of the committee stage i forget to which amendment when he confirmed that it would be necessary for the information to be in good plain english or welsh <e>", "<cs> surely this amendment does not prevent the prescribing of a maximum fee <e> <s> that i should have thought was outside the description of reasonable <e> <s> reasonable can be a fee which is lower than the maximum fee it does not have to be higher <e> <s> that would be nonsense <e>", "<cs> where there is a monthly run system or something of that sort where a period of days is possibly too short and a longer period is necessary would it be possible to ensure that the data user has to inform the data subject that he will have the information by a particular date <e>", "<cs> has my noble friend any idea how many exemptions will be required in a typical year <e>", "<cs> surely this could negate the prevention and detection of some crimes <e> <s> the noble lords amendment means that the information disclosed should be made public after a period of six months <e> <s> some crimes take longer than six months to solve and to consider <e> <s> it would allow some criminals to get completely away because they would be warned that the police or someone else was looking out for them <e> <s> it is not a purely medical matter <e> <s> it refers to the whole of this clause and not just to the medical aspects <e> <s> looked at again it would probably occur to the noble lord that it is not just medical but is to do with the detection of crime and prevention of crime <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that it would be easier rather than trying to define kinds of research that may be carried out to define the kinds of research that should not be included such as race religion political ideas and matters of that kind <e> <s> that might be easier <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard my noble friends explanation i am not sure that i am satisfied <e> <s> my noble friend referred throughout to individuals as though individual members of a family could always be regarded totally independently of the other members <e> <s> legally children are represented by their parents <e> <s> a family unit can be considered as a unit and in certain circumstances would i am sure be a single data subject with the information being held on a family as a whole rather than on individual members of that family <e> <s> however i will read what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i may discuss it with him later and i feel free to come back at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for what he has said which i will read carefully <e> <s> i am not entirely convinced that it is an unnecessary power <e> <s> none of us really knows yet what computers can do or will do <e> <s> they are changing and are being improved very quickly <e> <s> i still believe that it would be a useful power for the secretary of state to have <e> <s> however in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i support the amendment brought by my noble friend and urge my noble friend lord elton to consider the amount of work the small businessman has to do already in dealing with vat <e> <s> this will remove a potential burden from him and will also help to keep down the costs of the small businessmen therefore reducing their costs and leading to increased exports <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble and learned friend for his kind remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment despite the fact that a justice of the peace has been replaced by a judge because as the noble lord lord wigoder said it may have been only a technical infringement of the law which has done no damage to anyone in terms of the data protection principles <e> <s> we should make certain as the amendment says that damage or distress is being caused and is genuinely <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one small point to raise on this and i wonder whether the noble lord who has just spoken will deal with it when he makes his decision at the end <e> <s> i understand that computer discs or tapes can hold several hundred thousand bits of information <e> <s> what would be the position regarding a disc which holds privileged information that does not have to be disclosed at the same time as it holds information that legally would have to be disclosed <e> <s> surely the whole disc would have to be taken for examination or is the whole disc going to be retained because part of it has privileged information on it <e> <s> if that is the case a dishonest solicitor and i regret to say that there are a few in the profession would be able to put privileged information on to every single disc so that the rest of it could be filled up with information which he did not wish to be seized <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this particular amendment is impractical because if the computer is going to be used efficiently it must contain the information required for the business of the computer <e> <s> if the sources of all those pieces of information are to be on the computer as well it would obviate the use of the computer and might lead to the data user needing a much larger and more expensive computer and possibly two or even three computers or an <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> the only point that needs to be carefully watched is that the registrar or his staff who have to make the relevant inquiries have the necessary security clearance to look at the rather secret computer data that they will need to look at <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to see that the noble lord had a parachute <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has literally taken the words out of my mouth <e>", "<cs> my lords what would be the position of companies merging and dividing <e> <s> a similar point arises <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have a certain sympathy with the amendment i think it is mistaken <e> <s> the computer which is really what we are discussing in this bill is an extremely new tool <e> <s> most of us in this house do not know what it can do or what it will be capable of doing in the future <e> <s> i feel that this rather roomy jacket that the noble lords opposite wish the registrar to wear will as time goes on become tighter and tighter until it becomes a straitjacket and once computers are used for more and more things will tie the registrar down very considerably rather than give him the leeway that his own common sense should allow him <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies there is a small point that puzzles me and may puzzle other members of the house basically because i am not legally qualified <e> <s> what in this clause is the meaning of family <e> <s> how far does it extend <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord opposite this amendment would not be of great assistance to mail order houses because in order to he effective and keep down their costs they must have more information than just a name and address <e> <s> there are many names and addresses that one can easily get from telephone books and electoral registers but it is no use writing to try to sell expensive equipment in poor areas <e> <s> the mail order houses are specialist firms and they do not broadcast generally <e> <s> they broadcast very selectively <e> <s> in order to do that they need far more information than just names and addresses <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by declaring an interest <e> <s> i work for a charity which is the main supporter of a charitable housing association <e> <s> the points that i wish to make about clause have been mentioned by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> they relate to housing associations which supply accommodation for the physically disabled the mentally disabled and the elderly infirm where they are mixed with able-bodied people who are sympathetic to their position and who are prepared to look after them <e> <s> the able-bodied are not employed by the housing associations themselves <e> <s> if they occupy accommodation owned by the housing association they do not have the protection of those in tied accommodation <e> <s> they are employed by those who are elderly infirm or physically disabled who need to employ them to enjoy their independence <e> <s> as the bill stands the people most likely to buy their accommodation from housing associations are the able-bodied <e> <s> they can proceed to sell the property to someone else who may not be sympathetic to the needs of those occupying the rest of the accommodation <e> <s> some of the helpers are therefore lost and those with disabilities find that life becomes increasingly difficult <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply which gives me much encouragement <e> <s> i do not know what will happen to this clause in the course of this evening but if it remains in the bill it certainly needs to be amended <e> <s> i hope that between now and the next stage i can discuss the matter further with my noble friend or with his officials with a view to coming back if necessary at a later stage with an amendment that is very much more suitably drafted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness mentioned in her speech the john grooms housing association <e> <s> i ought to declare an interest <e> <s> i work for the john grooms <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is in order for me to say so but my noble friend lady parkes was trying to speak before the question was put <e> <s> i do not know what the position is <e> <s> the question has now been put but she appeared to be trying to make a point on the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to my noble friend lord bellwin he has not answered my question as to what might be the position in regard to interest <e> <s> he has told me what would happen to the deposit and that i understand <e> <s> but surely with a deposit being held by a landlord in some instances for a considerable length of time it can earn interest and should not this interest go towards the purchase price <e> <s> if the sale does not proceed and the deposit is returned should it not be returned together with the interest <e>", "<cs> i think it is important to think of it at any time of year <e> <s> if my noble friend had put a deposit on a property he would expect some benefit from the interest <e> <s> i do not see why the tenant of a local authority should not have the same benefit from the interest one way or the other <e> <s> but under the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i thank my noble friend and thank the noble baronesses opposite for their support <e> <s> like them i feel that we should have had not <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely sure that i am satisfied because either in the regulations or in the bill before it leaves this house it must be made absolutely essential that the approved inspector does inspect the building plans because how else will he ensure that any building is properly constructed <e> <s> i will possibly go further into this at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> however i am not sure that it is not <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can help me on the clause regarding just one point for clarification <e> <s> who is responsible for consulting <e> <s> is it the fire authority the local authority or the approved inspector <e> <s> should it not definitely be the local authority and should this not at some place be written into the bill <e> <s> i ask the question in order to ensure that the fire authority is consulted at the relevant stage and that developers do not fall between two stools and end up without the fire authority being consulted <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with noble lords opposite but there is at the same time difficulty <e> <s> the way in which different materials are now coming into the building industry and the way in which technical advances are being made means that the different professional bodies engineers architects electrical and mechanical engineers know the new advances in their own materials and what can be done with them <e> <s> it is extremely difficult for any one central body to keep up-to-date with all the new advances <e> <s> they are different professions they are almost different industries <e> <s> research is being carried out by different bodies <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely satisfied with my noble friends answer <e> <s> i do not think he really expected me to be entirely satisfied <e> <s> to give me a list of the people who might be connected with the approved inspector to give cases where he may not carry out the work is not really all that is required <e> <s> there should be a certificate of some kind possibly prescribed by the regulations for him to give an instance of any other way in which he might be connected whether he happens to be a beneficiary under a trust that owns the land or whether he is a trustee of a trust are examples none of which has been covered by my noble friend <e> <s> there are all kinds of other ways in which a man can have in a development an interest that may or may not be financial <e> <s> he may be responsible for managing someone elses finances as a trustee but he still has an interest <e> <s> be that as it may i would still prefer to see written into the bill the fact that the inspector must be totally independent so that it would be a question of definitely breaking the law not just a matter of regulations <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> we have so far been talking about the construction of buildings but the demolition of them is sometimes even more important <e> <s> with the very complicated and very highly stressed modern buildings if you do not have the right plans when it comes to demolition and you wrongly cut a stressed part of the building the rest of the building can literally explode and send bits of concrete and metal flying for a long way <e> <s> i think that this is an added pointer to the amendment <e>", "<cs> very quickly i see no provisions in this clause or elsewhere in the bill to cover cases where there are changes in the building proposal <e> <s> i am sure <e>", "<cs> that is rather a mouthful and rather a complicated mouthful <e> <s> i think i would prefer to read it in the <e>", "<cs> i must admit that having listened to the debate on this amendment i am not very happy with the outcome <e> <s> i should therefore like to reserve my position and possibly come back at a later stage <e> <s> so in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord <e> <s> lord mcintosh of haringey who has just spoken has stolen my thunder on both the points that i wanted to raise <e> <s> he has said very much what i was going to say but very much better <e> <s> however i was deeply concerned that all the stages i took part in of the previous bill in the last parliament the government advisers did not seem to understand what a modern computer could do what it was capable of doing and did not have a great deal of imagination <e>", "<cs> before we leave this clause may i with some temerity return to a point i made on second reading <e> <s> it is the question of computers being able to talk to other computers and where the data subjects rights lie with information obtained by one computer from another possibly from another firm <e> <s> my noble friend very kindly wrote to me at some length after the second reading debate but it would probably be useful to the committee if something could go into the <e>", "<cs> the committee will recall that at second reading i also supported the idea of codes of practice <e> <s> however i do not support this amendment because codes of practice should come from the industry itself from below rather than from the registrar or the ministry from above <e> <s> as i said at second reading the industry knows how computers are used and how the data will be used <e> <s> it knows the loopholes in codes of practice how they have been created and how to stop them far better than the ministry does <e> <s> i said then that it was a case of turning the poacher gamekeeper and i am still of that opinion <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to point out that surely when a data user registers the use with the registrar he must put down all the purposes for which he is registering data and <e> <s> therefore a data subject will know for what purposes he is using the data <e> <s> it is not necessary to have two separate or a number of different registrations provided all the subjects are covered under the same registration <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies may i say that i wonder what would be the position if a tribunal or court were to decide that none of the data protection principles had been contravened and the registrar had already by that time notified the data subjects that he thought that they had been <e> <s> surely the data user might then have a case for damages or something of that sort <e> <s> it strikes me as a position that could prove very interesting legally <e>", "<cs> if there is some other person who has to look into the question who is actually going to do it <e> <s> is he not also going to have to rely upon the same security forces as produced the first report <e> <s> if it is a question of national security you cannot get an outside agency to look into it because that would be breaking security <e> <s> i am wondering who the noble lord anticipates will do the investigation <e> <s> will this other person himself go round and do the investigation <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord lord hatch of lusby was in the chamber when this bill was before your lordships previously when i asked the minister whether each ministry would have to register separately <e> <s> i was told that they would and that computers were not all registered as one under one system by the government <e>", "<cs> may i be so rude and so bold as to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> is he proposing to make use of the new procedure introduced earlier this afternoon to have a note of the second amendment to which he is speaking put into the <e>", "<cs> i approve of the principle of this amendment but i should like to ask my noble friend one small point <e> <s> if someone having completed his original application form goes on to get more qualifications attends courses or gains various bits of experience that are worked up within the firms own time which the employer may also wish to record in a similar manner what is the position <e> <s> it strikes me that information on the original application would be covered by the amendment but the other information would not be <e> <s> it would be in a totally different position <e> <s> it seems to me illogical <e>", "<cs> i should like to back up what the noble lord lord mcintosh has just said <e> <s> direct mail houses and list-builders of one sort or another are always looking for additions to their lists <e> <s> lists of club members or people who shop in one place or another are very important to them <e> <s> i should perhaps declare an interest in this particular point as a member of the direct mail services standards board <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that the amount of work that would be required if the registrar was to make the codes of practice would be prohibitive <e> <s> would he however consider allowing codes of practice produced by data users who after all know where they can be misused to be authorised or approved in some way by the registrar so that the onus is on the data users to produce codes of practice that then have to be approved by the registrar as fitting in with the data protection principles <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly and very quickly congratulate my noble friend on the skill with which he has taken this rather complicated legislation through this house and on the considerable courtesy with which he has dealt with all the arguments <e> <s> however may i ask the noble lord to ensure that his department keeps an eye on the computer which is a very new tool and is developing the whole time in order to make certain that once this bill becomes law any amendment to the law in the future because of the development of computers is brought in as and when necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords although i work for the john groom association for the disabled what i wish to say is entirely my own view and has not even been discussed with other officers in the association <e> <s> i know that there are a number of organisations for disabled people who welcome the bill put forward by the noble earl lord longford as a hook upon which to hang the coat of informing people about the problems of disability <e> <s> however my own feeling is that legislation is not the best way in which to deal with the problem <e> <s> i would prefer to see it dealt with by education <e> <s> however despite that feeling i am quite happy to give the bill at this stage a second reading to see whether it can be improved as it goes through this house and comes out a much better beast at the end of third reading <e> <s> if it does not come out as the right kind of beast then we can always deal with it at that stage <e>", "<cs> i am worried about the financial aspects of housing for disabled people <e> <s> a house specifically built from the word go costs quite a lot more than a house which is built for a person who is not disabled <e> <s> it needs wider corridors larger bathrooms larger doorways and all sorts of things <e> <s> houses or flats that have been adapted later on in their lives specifically for a disabled person cost a great deal to adapt <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down what would be the position where the disabled purchaser is survived by an able-bodied spouse who then takes out all the special features <e>", "<cs> my lords it is getting late and so i shall try to be as quick as i can <e> <s> if i may i want to follow the remarks made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for whom may i say at this stage i have a very great deal of respect <e> <s> he has always been a supporter of liberty as i am myself <e> <s> however i feel that with regard to the report on video nasties and children that was brought out by a working party of which i had the honour to be chairman the noble lord has been misled <e> <s> he admitted himself that he did not have the time to read all of the report and was relying on other peoples advice <e> <s> i suspect that interests who stand to lose very considerably in the financial field may well have been putting out information on the research to try to discredit it <e> <s> that is quite understandable and quite natural <e> <s> if any of us feel that we are going to lose a considerable income then we want to stop that threat <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also support the passing of this bill and at the same time ask the government to make certain that it has plenty of time to get through all its stages in another place <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether this amendment is not in fact covered by clause which allows the british broadcasting corporation or the independent broadcasting authority to supply video recordings <e> <s> would not news items be covered by that subsection <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment is unnecessary because customs regulations already cover the import of obscene and unpleasant material <e> <s> the customs have wider powers than the police <e> <s> if they find something in the post or anywhere else that they consider to be obscene i understand that the recipient then has to prove that it is not obscene to prevent it being confiscated <e> <s> i feel with respect that this amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for getting up <e> <s> i am the noble lord is perfectly right <e>", "<cs> as a youngster in your lordships committee i should like to say a few words <e> <s> i do not agree with this amendment <e> <s> basically i think that if one is going to make those who are knowledgeable in the film and video recording industry responsible for checking on their own work they can be far too close to it <e> <s> i may be wrong but i believe that the vast majority of the british board of film censors do not actually make films <e> <s> they look at them to judge how fit they are for the general public to view <e> <s> we do not want those who make the videos at any rate not all of them to judge their own quality <e> <s> it is like having an artist act as his own public critic it is worthless <e> <s> i believe that we should have ordinary people from all walks of life <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he has mentioned the report on video and violence and i happen to have been chairman of the working party <e> <s> he has suggested that this bill came about as a result of this report and of the research into it that is what i understood him to say <e> <s> that is totally and completely inaccurate <e> <s> the research project was set up before the last general election the whole idea of it was started before the last general election <e> <s> the right honourable member in another place mr <e> <s> bright did not have the opportunity to bring forward this bill until after the election had taken place by which time the research was already under way <e> <s> the noble lord has suggested that the research was already under way <e> <s> he has suggested that the report is inaccurate and has quoted mr brian brown the head of the television research unit at oxford polytechnic <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the vast majority of the analysis of the data that came in was carried out not at the oxford polytechnic but at other places after the work had been taken away from oxford <e> <s> the report is reliable and there have been a large number of honesty checks carried out <e> <s> i am very satisfied that the work of the research team is highly accurate and is to be relied upon <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord has heard what i said <e> <s> the parliamentary group video inquiry started before mr <e> <s> bright set down his bill and indeed before the governments manifesto was published <e> <s> i think i am right in that <e> <s> part of the report stated that it was on raw data it had not been completely analysed <e> <s> the noble lord should look at part which has been fully analysed <e> <s> if the noble lord is relying solely on part i recommend him to read part so that he gets all his facts accurate <e> <s> but i do not honestly think that we should be spending this afternoon discussing this report <e> <s> we should be spending more time on the committee stage <e>", "<cs> may i first thank all those who have supported my amendment <e> <s> i must admit i was extremely disappointed with the reply of my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> he seemed to be under the impression although perhaps i may have got it wrong that this particular subsection is concerned with labelling <e> <s> i was under the impression that this was a penalty for offences committed under clauses or which concern the supplying of a video recording of an unclassified work or the possession of a video recording for the purpose of supplying and not for mere errors in labelling <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could help me by undertaking to give this matter further consideration before the next stage <e> <s> i realise he may find hmself in some difficulty but i think it would help me and those who have supported me in the chamber if he could give me that undertaking <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that rather discouraging reply but as i said at the very beginning that this was a probing amendment i feel that as a matter of honour i must beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend what he meant by young children in his response to the original question which referred only to children <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to enter upon the debate at this late stage but the minister in his reply has supported the possibility of damage being done to the soil and of pesticides remaining in the soil for a long time <e> <s> his reply however gives us the seeds of a method of controlling it <e> <s> my noble friend said that some pesticides are designed to stay in the soil for a certain length of time <e> <s> would it not be possible to bring in regulations that refer to the type of pesticide and the amount that is still residual in the soil a particular period after application <e> <s> this may be difficult but it would i think produce a practical answer in the long run <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend might like to consider it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that this bill allowed depositors in the bank to buy shares in the bank <e> <s> i should declare an interest because i am myself a depositor <e> <s> however if the amendent is accepted i can see quite a lot in favour of it surely it would not prevent depositors buying any of the other per cent <e> <s> of the shares to be offered on the open market <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to keep my remarks as short as possible because time is moving on <e> <s> i think i should declare an interest because i want to look at the regulations from the point of view of physically handicapped people who live in voluntary homes in homes run by voluntary organisations and i work for one of these organisations <e> <s> yesterday by telephone i passed most of my questions through to my noble friend so i hope that she will be able to answer them <e> <s> if she cannot answer them immediately perhaps she could write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may recall that i asked her whether it would be necessary for those physically disabled people in voluntarily run homes who are not currently in receipt of attendance allowance to claim it or can that be done in bulk for all of them <e>", "<cs> so far as i understand it we are discussing the short title of the bill <e> <s> i have always understood that it was customary for the short title to be as short as is convenient and to the point <e> <s> the title in the bill before us has only two words one is water and the other fluoridation <e> <s> that is precisely what the bill deals with <e> <s> the proposed title in this amendment is far too long and quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> perhaps when my noble friend considers her reply to those questions she will confirm that the council of ministers in europe have already in fact agreed to the fluoridation of water <e>", "<cs> my lords i too cannot support this amendment <e> <s> although a young person at the age of probably has the experience to judge whether another is suitable to represent him in parliament i doubt whether anyone at the age of actually has the experience to serve in parliament <e> <s> it must be borne in nind that when the voting age was dropped from to peers who had reached the age of but who had not yet reached the age of were still and still are excluded from serving in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome this bill and agree with very nearly everything that has been said <e> <s> in fact most noble lords who have spoken have taken the wind well and truly from my sails <e> <s> however i am a little disappointed that there are no noble baronesses speaking on the bill so as to give us the female rather than the male point of view <e> <s> we are all capable of being fathers but none of us i am sure is capable of being a mother much less are we going to give birth to mahomet but that is purely an aside <e>", "<cs> my lords magistrates can impose fines up to under i think the local government miscellaneous provisions act as it now is with regard to offences regarding sex shops <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me what proportion of these new houses has been designed specifically for physically disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say to the noble lord that surely if his amendment is accepted it will do precisely what he does not want to do <e> <s> it will make the bill discriminatory because it will then possibly be legal for one ethnic group to have female circumcision whereas for the rest of the country it will be illegal <e> <s> the whole point of his amendment is totally against what the noble lord has been talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see any point in the amendment <e> <s> any illegal operations will not be recorded or reported and those are the ones that matter <e> <s> the legal ones are done for a very good reason under doctors advice <e> <s> it is the illegal ones that we want to know about <e> <s> they will not be reported because they will get the reporter and other people into trouble <e> <s> the whole thing is a waste of time and absolutely pointless <e>", "<cs> in general i should like to support the noble and learned lords first amendment <e> <s> however i am convinced that we need to get this bill through parliament and we are coming towards the end of the summer <e> <s> there is only about another month left <e> <s> the government as normal will tell us that they have not got any time at all <e> <s> being a government bill i am not sure that i really believe it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support very much the remarks of my noble friend lord craigmyle <e> <s> i also feel that the government if they really wished could get this bill it is called a small bill but is in fact quite a large stepping stone in the right direction through the other place with amendments <e> <s> they have in other legislation been extremely courageous in tackling problems which have gradually been getting worse over the years because various governments have been too frightened to deal with them <e> <s> why on earth do the government not have the same courage to deal with this matter <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that the government either bring forward another bill themselves very quickly or if a private member of either house brings forward a bill give that individual every possible assistance to get that legislation onto the statute book <e> <s> debates on the various amendments to clause have shown that a great deal still needs to be done <e> <s> i must apologise to the committee if what i have said sounded rather like a second reading speech particularly since i had a go at second reading <e>", "<cs> what is the position if the money is paid to them in the form of a legacy <e>", "<cs> i shall consider seriously what my noble friend said and read it carefully in <e>", "<cs> i realise that but part of the law and the penalties fixed by law are a deterrent and we have to make certain that the penalty is sufficiently large to act as a deterrent <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that these two amendments are rather unwise <e> <s> it is the view of a number of people that the real troublemakers at football matches are stone-cold sober <e> <s> they get their pleasure by causing the trouble and the trouble is then exacerbated by others who have had too much to drink joining in <e> <s> if this law is effective and cuts down trouble at football matches those who get their pleasure by causing trouble will go to other sports and other events <e> <s> therefore it is essential that the government have the ability to bring in this power in relation to other sports fairly quickly without delay and without having to come back to parliament <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> from its wording i do not believe that it would be necessary for the buses that we have mentioned to be altered to suit wheelchairs <e> <s> we should remember that when people in wheelchairs are travelling there are often people accompanying them who are themselves disabled in one way or another or infirm <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that british rail makes certain that it has enough staff on hand to help disabled people at all the stations at which the bus services will be calling <e> <s> from what i have seen in the engineering works i believe that this situation can be overcome quite often through physical help rather than alteration to the buses <e> <s> i am rather deaf myself and i sometimes wear a hearing aid <e> <s> i wonder whether provision could be made for those who are deaf and who do not hear the announcement of alterations due to engineering works <e> <s> i wonder whether this could be considered within the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the principles behind the amendment <e> <s> it is worth bearing in mind that with a population that is getting increasingly elderly we shall have more and more disabled people around <e> <s> disability increases per thousand of the population with the increase in average age <e> <s> a code of practice is i believe an extremely useful way of dealing with the matter <e> <s> i do not like the suggestion of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway of a minimum standard purely because minimum standards have a habit of becoming maximum standards <e> <s> with a code of practice different operators will gradually improve and the treatment of disabled people will get better <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> there are a large number of children who do not finish their full-time education until after they have taken their a-levels <e> <s> a number sit their a-levels when they are <e> <s> some because their birthday falls during the year will sit their a-levels at the age of <e> <s> in my own family one of my daughters was ill and was therefore put back a year <e> <s> as a result she took her a-levels at the age of <e> <s> she is not the only youngster who might get ill and drop a year <e> <s> this is not an uncommon occurrence and i think it is quite wrong that those whose education is delayed for a year through illness or who sit their a-levels when they are because of the time of year when they were born should be discriminated against <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord denning has already mentioned the first point that i wish to bring up on this bill <e> <s> that concerns my noble friend lord broxbournes bill of yesterday <e> <s> i think that the two are totally incompatible <e> <s> my noble friend yesterday said that he cannot think that there can be any dissent from the importance of those rights and the desirability of protecting their enjoyment when he was talking about the first part of schedule of his human rights and fundamental freedoms bill <e> <s> if i may quote from that bill it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not <e> <s> i may not be making myself very clear but i do not think this bill is going to help someone <e> <s> i believe that people will feel that they have a licence to help people commit suicide but in fact they have not <e> <s> it could well be a disguise for murder in certain cases and that worries me very much about this bill <e> <s> i think i have said enough to make it clear that if there is a division tonight i shall vote in favour of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris has said <e> <s> the benefits in testing relating to this proposed amendment presuppose that they are solely to the human being <e> <s> what worries me is that drugs which can help to cure and which can be of great benefit to many people very often have very bad side effects on others <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that we are able to test drugs that give the same curative benefit but which have different side effects on different people or no side effects <e> <s> there are occasions when drugs that can be beneficial in certain diseases cannot be prescribed because the side effects are so great that they are worse than the disease itself <e> <s> if the secretary of state is limited by an amendment such as this we may well find that we are not in a position to produce alternative drugs <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness <e> <s> lady ewart-biggs in her amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord meston will accept it <e> <s> i believe that when the age of adulthood was reduced from to it was a mistake <e> <s> for generations the age of has been the age when those who mature more slowly have reached the time when they can be said to make sound decisions <e> <s> i do not think that the world has changed to such an extent that all those of make the right decisions <e> <s> i have children of and and some of their friends mature at different rates <e> <s> i am sure that is the wrong age <e> <s> i support the noble baroness in this amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend answers that point can he advise the committee whether people in england seeking legal aid can get advice reciprocally on scots law <e> <s> i think that point also applies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome the bill and give it my full support <e> <s> i noticed that only last saturday there was an announcement that dr steptoes fertility clinic is going into non-commercial surrogacy arrangements using sisters of barren potential mothers <e> <s> i wonder whether this might not be carried further <e> <s> i can see the possibility of the barren womens mother acting as a surrogate mother for her unfortunate daughter <e> <s> if a woman has become barren later in life possibly her own daughter could become a surrogate mother for her as a result of a second marriage <e> <s> we could end up with very complicated relationships <e> <s> what is the position if a disabled child were born <e> <s> the problems grow considerably <e>", "<cs> i can see something in my noble friends amendment in that the commissioning parents who provide the sperm and

with the surrogate mother i can see that they would have a responsibility to take on and bring up that child <e>", "<cs> i think that i covered in my opening remarks the comments made by my noble friend lord caithness last time and therefore i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the noble earl lord halsbury i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> having considered the matter since the committee adjourned i now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder what relevance what the noble lord is saying has to the amendment under discussion <e>", "<cs> noble lords opposite are trying to suggest that you get the best man for the job but they are limiting it in these two amendments to a man designed for today <e> <s> they are leaving absolutely no scope for a man to be chosen in a few years time to deal with the needs of that time which are not necessarily the needs of today <e> <s> needs change <e> <s> the man who leads that industry may need to be a different type of man with different types of skill <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the post office in this country is more efficient than that in any other country in the world and at a more reasonable cost <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment partly for the reasons mentioned by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> it is not unusual to see notices in the press of a masterpiece in danger of being sold abroad because we cannot raise the funds to buy it and keep it in this country <e> <s> anyone visiting a gallery would be precluded under the bill as now drafted from helping by making a donation as they go in <e> <s> if a major donor who happens to be a busy man arrives at the gallery and says i have only minutes what do you want <e> <s> this would stop the director as he takes him into the gallery from saying i want some money from you <e> <s> that would be an illegal act as i read this bill <e> <s> therefore it is essential that this amendment be agreed to <e>", "<cs> if as the noble baroness said this is a private members bill and it is her partys policy to agree to voluntary donations will she be going into the lobby in favour of the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i misunderstood the noble baroness i apologise <e> <s> i thought she said it was her partys policy not to be against voluntary donations <e> <s> this amendment deals solely with voluntary donations <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for not having put my name down <e> <s> i was not sure that i would he able to be here <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth i welcome the bill and wish it a speedy passage <e> <s> i wish also to speak about clause as she did and to follow the noble lord lord banks who mentioned that the bill was an exercise in crisis prevention <e> <s> many people who look after disabled people at home do not realise what a great financial service they are performing for the community <e> <s> some of them who look after people with huntingtons chorea may not have simply one disabled person in the family to look after they may have several <e> <s> the may even themselves be in the early stages of the same disease knowing that they themselves shortly in perhaps a matter of years will be in the same position as those they are looking after <e> <s> that must be terrible strain and very depressing <e>", "<cs> i do not think that when he moved the amendment the noble viscount said that he was going to speak to any other amendment <e> <s> if this amendment is carried it makes absolute nonsense of the english in the clause <e> <s> he has not referred to any other amendment and i think quite honestly that he is wasting the committees time <e>", "<cs> there is one small point which i think is quite important for disabled people <e> <s> can the noble baroness the minister assure the committee that disabled persons will not be forced to have a relative as the official representative when they are themselves trying to be as independent as possible <e> <s> we all know how with ordinary able-bodied young people very many parents try to hang on to their children and will not let them get away from the nest <e>", "<cs> that which has been said by the noble baroness lady masham and the noble lord lord ennals adds emphasis to the point that i raised earlier <e> <s> i shall be most grateful if my noble friend the minister will give the matter her very serious consideration when preparing the letter that she said she would write to me and when the regulations are being prepared in due course <e> <s> it is a very important point so far as disabled people are concerned <e>", "<cs> there is one point on this amendment <e> <s> it is not just the deaf who have difficulty in communication <e> <s> there are a number of people with speech defects of such a nature that there are a very limited number of people who can understand them <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that the local authorities when providing the necessary services make certain that those very few people are used for the interpretation <e> <s> sometimes the officials may not be aware of who the relevant person is to do the interpreting <e> <s> will they please make certain that they make any necessary inquiries and not just assume that a mentally capable physically disabled person is considered to be mentally disabled purely because they cannot communicate properly <e>", "<cs> may i add a quick word on that <e> <s> i think this is quite an appropriate amendment because in a number of instances the young person under the age of because of the good feeding we have had in the last few years is considerably larger than the mother and often the father and if there is any disagreement as a result of the mental disorder serious damage could occur to the parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a pilot i do not own any ships and i have never run a port <e> <s> indeed i do not expect that i should be allowed anywhere near one on the running side but only accepted as a passenger <e> <s> i have no real axe to grind <e> <s> however i was asked to take an interest in this matter by a friend of mine who is a pilot and the more i have read about it the more complicated it seems to become <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that over the next years the number of london pilots will be reduced by some per cent <e> <s> through natural wastage their having reached the age limit <e> <s> surely this means that they will need to recruit in order to keep up their numbers even to the lower figure that my noble friend suggested was the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords if we wait for the government to produce legislation on the whole of the warnock report i think we may well have to wait a long time <e> <s> these are moral issues and as such throw up important decisions of principle which make drafting extremely difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome this amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend the minister to bear in mind the need to ensure that the disabled persons representative is someone who can understand and communicate with a disabled person who may find difficulty in communication <e> <s> as i have said before very often disabled people are able to communicate through only one or two people and it is very important that that channel of communication be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not go upwards i would maintain the speed limit of miles per hour <e> <s> many cars lorries and coaches regularly exceed that speed limit today <e> <s> i know that this is slightly off the subject of trailers but i am sure that most members of the house who drive on motorways will agree that many vehicles drive far too close together <e> <s> therefore increasing the speed limit simply increases the chances of accidents <e> <s> it also increases fuel consumption and i think that through excessive speed we sometimes use an excessive amount of fuel on our motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend finally moves that the regulations be accepted i believe he said that a code of towing practice has been issued <e> <s> what proportion of the towing public have received this code of practice <e> <s> it is not just caravan owners who tow trailers <e> <s> all sorts of other people tow trailers from someone who hires a trailer to move a tent over the weekend to people towing horse-boxes chimney sweeps towing trailers and all sorts <e> <s> what proportion of the towing public has received this towing code <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the minister <e> <s> the social fund will help those in the greatest need <e> <s> those who are well-off with good accountants will make certain that their estates for taxation purposes are at the lowest possible level <e> <s> as i see it those who are well-off will be able to claim the grant much more readily than those who just slip out of the social fund net <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord kilmarnock will really be trying to help the wrong people <e>", "<cs> i may be somewhat naive but i have not come across a bill before with notes in it as part of the bill <e> <s> i should have thought that this was extremely bad parliamentary drafting <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me whether when the bill becomes an act the note will be part of the law <e> <s> how is it to be used <e> <s> it strikes me as most extraordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the other place did not agree to the amendment made by this house but i should be prepared to accept the new amendment put forward provided that this house accepts the amendments to it proposed by the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> if his amendments are not accepted a large number of disabled people whether or not severely disabled will find that as their disability becomes more severe they will be forced to move into residential accommodation run by the various voluntary organisations <e> <s> they will not have the funds to live independently <e> <s> disabled people by the very nature of matters for the most part are low earners <e> <s> it is more expensive to keep a disabled person in a residential home than it is for them to live independently <e> <s> therefore the more people we force from independent living into homes the more expensive it becomes for the government because ultimately the government pay through supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords although i agree that everyone should pay rates will my noble friend please keep in mind the position of housing associations which deal specifically with physically disabled people <e> <s> they often have considerable difficulty in making their outgoings and income match <e> <s> often their tenants rely on housing benefit which is severely delayed in payment <e> <s> if they have to pay part of the rates without a full rebate that will exacerbate the situation <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can help me <e> <s> i see that the regulations can provide where the landlord is a housing association the right to an advance from the housing corporation <e> <s> how will this affect funds available to housing associations for new developments for elderly disabled people people without accommodation <e> <s> is it anticipated that the loans will be so large that they will affect the funds available to the housing corporation because they are the source of funding for housing associations on new developments <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to my noble friend it has nothing to do with regulations <e> <s> it has to do with the amount of money available to the housing corporation <e> <s> if they are lending their money they will not have the same funds available for new buildings <e> <s> is there going to be a separate pocket provided for the housing corporation <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend will look further at this and write to me <e> <s> it is a question of where the funding is coming from and whether this <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to my noble friend lord montagu so far no one has spoken against listing <e> <s> i believe that most people are fully in favour of listing <e> <s> however justice must be seen to be done <e> <s> in the eyes of a large number of people listing buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put in a word here <e> <s> surely the question of what is or is not reasonably practicable is purely a charter for members of the legal profession to earn vast fees in various courts one after another arguing on that one point <e> <s> what is practicable one day may not be practicable on another and the situation is impossible <e> <s> it is just a lawyers charter <e>", "<cs> my lords during the debate on marine pilotage that we had last summer on i think th june i asked the minister at the time my noble friend lord caithness whether he would convene a conference of all interested parties <e> <s> he was not very keen on doing it <e> <s> i got the impression that he did not think it was necessary <e> <s> again on th july i put down a question for written answer to her majestys government to ask what progress had been made in their consultations and whether they would convene a conference of all interested parties <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench will recall his reply that he had agreed to take the chair in a meeting between trinity house and the british ports association <e> <s> so there has been some consultation with the pilots not however i think a very great deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i took advice on that matter and i understood that for vessels under tonnes it was the vessel that was exempt if it was used for coastal traffic <e> <s> i honestly do not see how a vessel can steer itself <e> <s> i have met men in the past who have said that their cars know the way home late on a saturday night

friend sits down is he aware that when i was talking about exempt vessels i was talking about existing legislation and not the bill <e> <s> under part ix of the london pilotage district by-laws it is stipulated that vessels under gross registered tonnes and i did say earlier i apologise to the house trading coastwise are exempt from the need to take a pilot <e> <s> they must use a pilot for days

sure that the minister will be able to put us both right <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not as i understood it <e> <s> i think it is absolutely essential that we make sure that this point is in the bill before it becomes an act <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in welcoming this bill introduced by the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> it seems very strange to me that in society today when we spend a great deal of money and time trying to prevent physical and mental disability in some of our schools they are promoting sexual disability <e> <s> there is no doubt in my mind that homosexuals and lesbians are disabled sexually <e> <s> it has nothing to do with their physical ability but is to do with the whole aspect of sex <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first looked at this bill my immediate reaction was in favour of it <e> <s> i understand that in bringing down the age of viability of a foetus to weeks there remains a strong chance of a healthy infant being born alive and viable <e> <s> i further understand that because of the development of the foetus it is unlikely that the viable term for the foetus would be reduced to weeks or less <e> <s> it may not reach that far

view possibly to coming back at the next stage with a different amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that he was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> was he speaking to amendment no <e> <s> also <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i point out that he mentioned fair and equitable treatment <e> <s> where in the bill are the guarantees that government have been promising for so long <e>", "<cs> my lords i must support the noble lord lord underhill in this amendment <e> <s> if this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about the ministers comments that because the arbitration does not go on beyond three years that should not have any effect on the contract that goes on beyond that term <e> <s> contracts

feeling that barrack-room lawyers in particular might draw the word personally too broad <e> <s> the question of the discussion of a pilots hours on duty could be considered to be personal to one

competent harbour authorities be local authorities as well <e> <s> otherwise surely they would be excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i think that

us <e> <s> he gave me to understand though i may not have understood him correctly that the regulations were being produced under section of the merchant shipping act <e>", "<cs> i gained the impression my lords that there was some difficulty in drafting regulations that were suitable for all the different harbours and the different areas in which the pilot boats would be operating <e> <s> one of the points about my amendment no <e> <s> is that section allows for different regulations for boats operated from different harbours <e> <s> if that particular aspect is a problem in drafting the regulations will my noble friend consider bringing forward an amendment to this bill that would amend the relevant act so that different regulations can apply to different pilot boats in different areas <e> <s> quite obviously a boat that may suit the noble lord lord kirkhill out of aberdeen may not be suitable out of southampton they have different conditions <e> <s> i should be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say <e> <s> i wonder whether he will consider that point and give me an assurance on it <e>", "<cs> my lords having received that information i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the spirit behind the amendment on the environmental grounds that i mentioned in committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord greenway

the deputy speaker said that amendment no <e> <s> cannot be moved <e> <s> i do not honestly think that amendment no <e> <s> is all that important <e> <s> it is simply that the word particulars strikes me as being better than information <e> <s> the house may disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether there will be a spinal injuries unit at chase farm hospital <e>",

amendment put forward by the opposition i have a feeling that my noble friend would have been on his feet declaring that this was a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it strikes me as most odd that the

that the government will bring forward a better drafted amendment in another place <e> <s> i am not surprised that the drafting is defective as it is mine <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> it helps the position of pilots who are made redundant within the four years after the bill becomes an act because at the moment they would only receive redundancy pay from the time that they were taken on by the competent harbour authority even though they may have been licensed pilots for the past years or more <e> <s> this is not a fair position when the government themselves have brought in amendments to allow other staff of the pilotage authorities and indeed those employed by the pilots themselves to have their position maintained so that they will be deemed to have been employed from a period when originally employed by the pilotage authority or by the pilots <e>", "<cs> my lords at the report stage the minister said that regulations were to be brought forward with which pilot boats would have to comply <e> <s> this amendment may well be a belt to help those braces <e> <s> however the position of pilots trying to hoard vessels in extreme conditions as the noble lord lord carmichael has said is extremely dangerous <e> <s> it is very worthwhile having belt and braces in this case to make certain

who are extremely responsible and as i said at an earlier stage who often go out in the most appalling weather to help vessels in difficulties <e> <s> despite what the minister said at report stage i think that he would be wise to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank my noble friend the minister for taking on board what was said at earlier stages of the bill and assure him

qualified chemist and at the same time a highly qualified barrister <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that at least one minister in the government is in that position <e> <s> it is then said that

so that more money is available for housing for those physically disabled people who live in non-stress areas <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers may i say that any valuer worth his salt and i speak as one who has been a valuer will take the condition of the property into account when deciding its value <e> <s> when the minister last spoke he gave me the impression that he was trying to insist on the purchasing landlord putting the property into a reasonable state of repair <e> <s> if that is his intention it is expressed in a rather ungainly manner in the bill <e> <s> i suggest that it should be put in as a separate clause that it he part of the purchasers obligations <e> <s> i suggest that should be spelt out very much more clearly <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> although the number of people going to church seems to have been declining over the last few years i believe that if one checked on many forms in the space where people are asked to state their religion the vast majority in this country would say that they were christian or some form of christian denomination <e> <s> most of those people do not feel capable of teaching christianity to their children and rely on schools to do the job properly particularly those who do not attend church because they do not think of sending their children to sunday school <e> <s> either with this amendment or in a replacement amendment at a later stage we should put the word christianity in the bill <e>", "<cs> i feel that we must have the word christian in the bill somewhere <e> <s> as clause is currently drafted as i understand it i am not a lawyer if a school were to set up a model of paddington bear and have regular worship of paddington bear a clever lawyer could make a good case for saying that as the bill is drafted at the moment that is legal <e>", "<cs> the insertion of the word christian would only act as a marker <e> <s> it does not prevent the right reverend prelate coming back at a later stage with a better form of words if he so wishes <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend tell me whether a licence to occupy constitutes a legal estate <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend lord jenkin is rather unfair to the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> the noble lord has always spoken in this house in favour of the family <e> <s> the fact that his party was remiss some years ago is not his personal fault <e> <s> the amendment has much to be said for it <e> <s> it is important to keep the family together <e> <s> the increasing demand for accommodation in the south-east is <e>", "<cs> those students from england who are actually in scotland will start paying the community charge next april while the family is still paying full rates in england <e> <s> in my view that is worse than the situation in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the amendment is totally unnecessary <e> <s> it is covered by the word responsibilities in clause b <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak very quickly to support the spirit behind amendment no <e> <s> and both the amendments to it <e> <s> i was extremely worried when the right reverend prelate wound up on amendment no <e> <s> because my impression was that per cent <e> <s> of any one religion would not be taught to children of that religion but that all children would in the main be taught christianity and also taught other religions <e> <s> i may have mistaken what he said but that was my impression <e>", "<cs> my lords with pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the opting out arrangements that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway wanted are already covered in amendment no <e> <s> which the house passed some minutes ago <e> <s> i think that subsections a and cover the opting out of christian worship and the right for children to participate in worship of a proper nature of another religion also organised by the school or elsewhere <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend the minister would answer that point in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i particularly support the words of the noble baroness lady fisher on the length of time needed to educate children with special needs <e> <s> as many of your lordships know i work with physically disabled people <e> <s> because of their great difficulties a large number of those children who have left school come to my organisation still not fully educated to a standard where they can go out into the world and live on their own <e> <s> we then have to carry on <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finish what i have to say because i cannot continue once i have sat <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if there is to be a maximum number of days during the year which will be paid for as i believe to be the case with magistrates <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend could confirm that a husband is responsible for his wifes debts <e> <s> is this not a case of the law as it stands by common law in any case <e> <s> i wonder why it is necessary to put it in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a point on this amendment which has not yet been mentioned <e> <s> there are a number of children who speak a language other than english at home and learn english as a second language <e> <s> the time when it is easiest for them to learn english is when their own language development is taking place when they are young in junior school <e> <s> i understand from those who teach languages to young children that english is best taught at the same time as they are being taught the basics and proper grammar of their own language so that the two languages develop together <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the amendment <e> <s> given the right education as a child a disabled person with whatever disability stands a greater chance of independence later on in life <e> <s> know that it is not the responsibility of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> but another department the department of health and social security is the whole time trying to make disabled people independent because it is cheaper that way for them to be looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the general idea behind the bill it is to increase the amount of accommodation available for rent <e> <s> with only one type of landlord throughout the nation at present the matter can only he improved <e> <s> i should like to raise three points dealing mainly with disabled people <e> <s> i understand that the new assured tenancies will not he liable to an assessment of a fair rent <e> <s> i welcome the introduction of private sector money to help housing associations rather than only the housing corporations but i believe that that may well cause rents to rise and to rise steeply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has totally misunderstood me <e> <s> i have been saying that it is virtually impossible for a disabled person to buy his own house because he does not have the right to buy <e> <s> i have been saying that disabled people should have the right to buy that is my view <e> <s> i have changed my mind <e> <s> as i said before when we were discussing the housing act i fought against the right to buy specially adapted accommodation for disabled people <e> <s> i have now said that i am in favour of it with one exception that is where there are special blocks of flats for disabled people and permanent help available in the form of a warden or someone else <e>", "<cs> my lords of the dwellings to be refurbished can the minister tell us how many are to be refurbished and made suitable for physically disabled people <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend would consider the case where a mortgage on a property is made some time after the tenancy has started <e> <s> as i understand it the grounds in the bill are to cover cases where somebody has bought a house for his own use has gone abroad for a time and has let it to pay the mortgage before returning <e> <s> however what about a case where there is already a tenant in the house the landlord needs to raise money obtains a mortgage on the house to raise the money and subsequently defaults on the mortgage and the mortgagee then wishes to sell the property to recover his money <e>", "<cs> that is what i am saying <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps he will tell the committee whether if a tenant is in difficulties through a delay in housing benefit or through illness he can get help with his rent from the social fund <e>", "<cs> i should like to pick up a remark made by my noble friend <e> <s> i find the answer that he has given to me somewhat disturbing under certain circumstances <e> <s> as an example let us take a self-employed person who does not have any sickness benefit for one reason or another <e> <s> if through injury and no fault of his own he were off work for two or three months he would lose the roof from over his head as well possibly as his business <e> <s> i think that that is something that he should bring to the attention of his noble and right honourable friends in the department of health and social security <e>", "<cs> while i appreciate the need for representation on the board of the housing corporation by the housing associations which are using the money being given to them by the corporation we ought not to lose sight of the fact that the corporation is spending taxpayers money <e> <s> therefore it needs to be under ministerial and government control <e> <s> regarding both amendments i cannot agree with the appointment of a chair <e> <s> a chairman is the leader of the board <e> <s> as far as i can see the movers of both amendments wish to appoint an inanimate object for the board to perch upon <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> i am not sure that she is in order in showing pictures in the chamber <e> <s> perhaps she can leave them in the library so that we can see them easily <e>", "<cs> i support the group of amendments <e> <s> i had intended to put my name to them but i was too slow <e> <s> the most important amendment of the group is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that amendment would ensure that housing action trusts keep constantly in mind the work they are doing as regards people with <e>", "<cs> i too think that this is an interesting suggestion <e> <s> however i wonder whether residential buildings for higher education should not be used during the holiday period of current students for residential courses for other students so that the buildings are used throughout the year for purposes of education <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may raise another practical point with regard to this problem of housing homeless people <e> <s> at the moment a large number are housed in hotel accommodation which specialises in letting to homeless people <e> <s> some of the hotels make a large profit <e> <s> if homeless people are to be housed during the vacations in accommodation that was used by students it means that those hotels will probably go bust and go out of business <e> <s> therefore there will not be hotel accommodation available for the homeless to use during term time <e> <s> i think that this proposal could exacerbate the situation <e>", "<cs> i cannot agree with the noble lord although like him i am interested in and concerned about proper housing for disabled people <e> <s> i can see no reason why housing action trusts should not improve accommodation that has been especially adapted for disabled people as well as for those who are not disabled <e> <s> a number of specially adapted flats are in blocks of flats <e> <s> it is impractical for a block of flats to be acquired by a housing action trust with one or two flats excluded <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can help me <e> <s> what is the position of purchasers of stock on the open market offered for sale by a local authority secured on housing that might be taken for housing action trusts <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down can he confirm that generally speaking it is easier for a local government housing authority to obtain possession from a defaulting tenant than for a private landlord to do so <e>", "<cs> the market value of a property is not necessarily the replacement value <e> <s> if one tried to insure ones house for what one paid for it the insurance company would so to speak probably do it for nothing <e> <s> the replacement value of any property or item is not necessarily what it cost to build <e>", "<cs> if after further consideration my noble friend still decides to talk about fee simple estate should not the expression be an estate in fee simple <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief because the noble lord lord carter has explained the series of amendments extremely well <e> <s> the government should bear in mind that with a gradually ageing population there will be as time goes on a greater number of people disabled through age quite apart from illness and accident <e> <s> in addition doctors keep injured people with disabilities alive whereas a few years ago they were unsuccessful <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down would he consider asking the housing corporation to make it mandatory for the proposed new landlord to set out what his ideas and proposals would be towards helping a person who becomes disabled not someone who is disabled now but someone who becomes disabled later while a tenant of the new landlord <e> <s> particlularly as regards people who are past middle age and becoming elderly there is a greater chance of their becoming disabled in one way or another and therefore this is of great importance to them <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers that question is it intended that there be covenants that run with the property and therefore cannot be avoided by any future purchaser <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend tell the committee where in the bill it states that the purchasing landlord needs the secretary of states approval for a purchaser of his interest <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord mcintosh will realise that gathering this information could be expensive particularly in respect of <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble baroness will realise that there is a maximum amount of tax relief i believe it is -that anyone can claim on any one dwelling no matter what its size <e> <s> of course one needs to have a large enough income to take advantage of that relief <e> <s> however over a very large part of this country a mortgage of is now needed to buy a property <e> <s> with the greatest respect the size of the dwelling has nothing to do with it <e>", "<cs> they are not alternatives <e> <s> i would rather speak to amendment no <e> <s> a when we get to it <e>", "<cs> to help me make up my mind as i raised this matter on second reading nearly four months ago will my noble friend the minister tell me <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> perhaps i may thank all who have taken part in this useful short debate <e> <s> i share with other noble lords concern over a potential reduction in the stock of special housing for physically disabled pople <e>", "<cs> briefly i support the amendment of the noble lord lord carter and i should also like to hear what my noble friend the minister has to say on the subject of tenants of charitable housing associations who do not have the right to buy having a transferable discount <e> <s> when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> my noble friend said that he was in agreement with part of my amendment but not with the whole of it <e> <s> that will leave a certain number of people in specially designed accommodation for the disabled without the right to buy unless there can be an agreement that all disabled people should have the right to buy <e> <s> i feel that they should be able to obtain a transferable discount so that if they so wish they can buy another property <e> <s> that would still leave the property in which they were before available for reletting <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear my noble friend correctly that he is going to accept the amendment <e> <s> if that is the case i commend it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the desire of the noble lord lord carter to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of suitable accommodation for physically disabled people <e> <s> however this is not the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> i did not say that it would reverse the decision but that it was a retrograde step <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to thank my noble friend not only personally but also on behalf of his noble kinswoman for the courtesy that he has shown both of us in discussions on the right to buy between committee and report stages <e> <s> my noble friend lord ingleby has also asked me to pass on his thanks for the words that the noble earl had to say on the working of the chronically sick and disabled persons act in relation to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i too commence by thanking the noble lord lord allen and his committee for this report <e> <s> i am particularly interested in the concept of handynet <e> <s> i understand that it is not likely to start for some nine months or a year <e> <s> if for any reason it does not start in the ec i hope that my noble friend will ensure that a similar arrangement will be set up in this country from which we could expand later into europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will allow me to intervene <e> <s> he mentioned disabled people <e> <s> is he also including in that the voluntary organisations that help disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell the house how the increase in the rat population relates to the proliferation of plastic rubbish bags which have replaced the relatively rat-proof old-fashioned rubbish bins <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down and purely as a point of clarification is the subsection in the bill merely so that a patient who needs medical help can be traced and given that help <e>", "<cs> i am just wondering what the position would be if there were some serious change to the directive mentioned in the amendment <e> <s> perhaps it ought to be redrafted in such a way that it does not refer to a particular directive or annex to it <e> <s> what happens if it is all changed <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied with the steps being taken by british businessmen to take advantage of the channel tunnel <e> <s> what help are the government giving to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that somewhere in the bill it is stated that there will be no discussion and that there can be no discussion between trade unions and employers <e> <s> will he tell the house where that provision is stated in the bill <e> <s> i have not seen any such provision <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by taking up a point raised by my noble friend lady blatch namely the effectiveness of the local government ombudsman <e> <s> if i heard her aright she suggested that when the ombudsman found against a local authority there should be some form of financial compensation <e> <s> i am not in favour of financial compensation generally because it can increase the number of spurious claims by people who wish purely to obtain money <e> <s> i very strongly agree with her and support her suggestion that there should be some form of judicial enforcement <e> <s> the ombudsman needs to be given at least one tooth <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the government will consider taking away the amendment as has already been suggested and rather than have an expert as a member of the committee have an expert who is an adviser to that committee on technical matters but is not a member of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to associate myself with what the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have spoken in support of this amendment <e> <s> i also wish to thank my noble friend the minister for his offer to meet me to discuss a suitable alternative amendment for the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i am happy to agree to that <e> <s> i am also happy to meet the noble lord lord carter at a suitably damp and boggy part of some farmland somewhere in the vicinity of westminster to discuss the proper conversion of a miniature tractor <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i suggest that my noble friend or his officials have discussions with the disablement income group which makes a point of looking at the financial aspects of disability <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend the minister will pay particular attention to the remarks of the noble lord lord seebohm on the preservation of the housing stock <e> <s> it is far cheaper to repair a building than to replace it <e> <s> the old adage that a stitch in time saves nine works for the nation as well as for the housewife <e>", "<cs> i should like to read what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i do not think that he has answered the whole point <e> <s> the clause does not put a disabled person on a par with able-bodied people <e> <s> more <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall read what my noble friend has said and study his words with care <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have noted what my noble friend has said <e>

his words carefully and possibly come back at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not particularly satisfied with my noble friends response to this amendment <e> <s> this is a type of housing transaction that i have not come across before <e> <s> if those who get involved in it particularly at a time of rapidly rising house prices are late with the rental part of their payments at any one time there could be a foreclosure and they could lose their home <e> <s> the individual who does that will start all over again at a higher price with a different person <e> <s> it may not be a very large problem affecting a large number of people <e> <s> however it is a matter which i believe the minister and his department should look at even if this bill is not the appropriate place to deal with it <e>", "<cs> i shall follow on from what the noble lord lord hylton said regarding the wording <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for agreeing to look at the wording <e> <s> if members of your lordships committee are not clear about what the wording means many local authorities may not be either <e> <s> the words of my noble friend in this debate are not taken into account by any court when considering the matter <e>", "<cs> my name has been mentioned particularly in respect of the right to buy for the disabled <e> <s> i have tabled amendment no <e>

that a number may go to small families to couples <e> <s> the vast majority will still be bought by elderly people because they are suitable for them <e> <s> it does not prevent the need to build <e> <s> the private sector should be encouraged to build <e> <s> there is absolutely no reason why the private sector should not build for elderly people as well as for people with families <e> <s> the mere fact that it is private does not make the building any less suitable for elderly people <e>", "<cs> i do not mind whether they are for rent or for sale it is the accommodation that is important <e> <s> there is one point that has not been raised and that is the need for elderly people to be mobile to be able to move to where their younger relatives are moving <e> <s> we have a very mobile labour force today and it is often extremely difficult for young people to be able properly to look after their elderly relatives if their relatives are left in one part of the country and the young people have a job in another <e> <s> if the elderly are able to buy their accommodation and sell it they can move on and buy similar accommodation in another area and still be looked after by their relatives <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hesketh raised the matter of a potential purchaser who was unable to complete failed to complete or failed to move into the house at one time or another after the dwelling had been constructed <e> <s> the purchaser or lessee is in a contractual position <e> <s> as drafted the amendment would not come into effect until the contract had been exchanged and was therefore binding <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that it was the intention of his department and of the government to ensure that scarce public resources reach where they are most needed <e> <s> can he please advise the house how much they estimate will be saved to the exchequer by carrying out means tests <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read carefully what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i do not intend to press this matter tonight <e> <s> however i reserve the right to come back to it at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment

another attempt to move this forward <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour of the night i rise briefly to support my noble friend lady masham <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wonder whether my noble friend will undertake to look at this again <e> <s> it seems such a simple matter <e> <s> it may be complicated but surely the bill is set out somewhere on a computer or a word processor <e> <s> it cannot be that difficult <e> <s> it is not as though we are working with a quill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by correcting the

extremely short-sighted on the issue <e> <s> i have a strong suspicion that they felt that there was not sufficient civil service time to write the provision into the bill at this stage <e> <s> it would have paid the treasury to have paid some overtime and it would have saved a great deal of money in the long run <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will give an indication that the proposal will be taken on board and brought forward as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to see that the government in commons amendment no <e> <s> have removed all reference to dwellings particularly suitable for disabled people because by the removal of my amendment no <e> <s> disabled people would still have had considerable difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider doing away with the red and amber signal before the green signal <e> <s> this would prevent traffic moving off on that signal which causes many accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to dispose of the human fertilisation and embryology bill <e> <s> i do not think that that bill should be used in this house as a vehicle to change the law on abortion <e> <s> if members of

noble and learned lord for his correction <e> <s> he is far better versed in the law and the way in which bills are written than i am <e>", "<cs> my lords when introducing these regulations my noble friend said that the donor might well be advised by a medical practitioner who is also the medical adviser to the recipient <e> <s> i can understand that the person who treats both in hospital may well be the same specialist but i should be interested to know what arrangements are being made for the donor to receive independent advice from a medical practitioner who is not the medical

all know there are couples who live together throughout their lives although unmarried for one reason or another <e> <s> it does not matter what the reasons are <e> <s> they are living together as a married couple <e> <s> that would be a marriage that was made not by any formal ceremony on this earth but a marriage nonetheless in my view although not recognised by law <e> <s> surely it would be

couple or two single people does that have any effect on the question of consents <e>", "<cs> my lords can we also bear in mind that in this palace lights need to be left on in certain places purely on grounds of security <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord ennals would take into consideration the case of a disease such as huntingtons chorea <e> <s> would it not be of the most considerable assistance and relief to the child to know that that particular disease which he knows to be a horrible one will not have been transmitted to him or her because it was all done by

lost am i not right in thinking that it canrot then be brought back <e>", "<cs> i strongly support this amendment <e> <s> there is a growing tendency for housing associations particularly with physically disabled people as their residents to work in conjunction with other voluntary organisations for physically disabled people and where the other organisations provide the nursing care element <e> <s> it is essential that that is paid for by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i especially agree with the remarks of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> members of the committee will know that i work for the john grooms association for the disabled <e> <s> over the past few years the association has taken very severely physically disabled people out

takes very special people to make a career in that sort of work <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord peston replies will he be good enough to define the term voluntary organisations used in his amendment <e> <s> to my mind he seems to have been extremely rude to a number of very well established very highly professional charitable organisations that have been the leaders in community care for generations <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for again giving way <e> <s> perhaps i may point out to him that the term voluntary organisation in many instances is a total misnomer as i am sure the noble lord lord peston and members of the committee will acknowledge <e> <s> there may be some organisations which are as he said totally bumbling <e> <s> however the reputable organisations are highly professional and are pushing the community care profession further ahead than almost anyone else <e>", "<cs> i also support the three amendments spoken to by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth i can see no logical reason why my noble friend on the front bench and the government in general should refuse to accept these amendments even if they need to be reworded in some way to improve them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> in a reply given on th april to the noble baroness lady masham my noble friend lady blatch said <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support this amendment bearing in mind particularly the plight of physically disabled people <e> <s> the house will know of my interest in that direction <e> <s> i want to tell the house briefly of two situations <e> <s> one was when the people for whom i work opened a home for severely physically disabled young people the other was when with the assistance and connivance if that is the right word of the national health service we took very severely disabled people from long-stay wards in a local hospital into homes that we set up in order to help that particular hospital to close <e> <s> in both cases it was extremely difficult to find general practitioners who were willing to take as their patients these physically disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend does not need to reply to me this afternoon but i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment and particularly the words of my noble friend lady faithfull that it should be also be made to apply to homes run by voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords there is considerable merit in the idea behind this amendment but so far as i can see there is one major difficulty <e> <s> is there a legal definition of a rural area <e> <s> peoples ideas of what is a rural area vary considerably <e> <s> are we talking <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> however as i see it it has one flaw <e> <s> not all disabled persons are able to make their own request <e> <s> therefore somehow we should include the disabled persons representative <e> <s> it may be better to do that by agreeing to amendment no <e> <s> which we shall come to in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that my noble friend lord mottistone is entirely right in what he has just said <e> <s> but i shall not go into that argument <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house how many dwellings above shops throughout the country have been empty for years <e> <s> what steps are the government taking to ensure that trey are re-occupied and used as dwellings <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down he said that in section of the disabled persons services consultation and representation act there is a duty on local authorities to consult carers <e> <s> i have the act with me <e> <s> section states that <e>", "<cs> my lords there are certain conditions which arise whereby the individual has both good and bad days <e> <s> at the same time the assessor also has good and bad days <e> <s> what is the position when the disabled person is having an extremely good day but has to meet with a very grumpy and bad assessor <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that there should be a right of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also briefly support the amendment <e> <s> voluntary organisations use a great deal of skill in assessing disabled people <e> <s> some of the specialist voluntary organisations by their very nature will know a great deal more about an individuals specialised disability if i can put it that way than local authorities who will be dealing with all kinds of disability physical mental sensory and so forth <e> <s> it is an eminently sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is sensible <e> <s> i wonder whether the best way of dealing with it is the following <e> <s> when an assessment is originally made there should be a recommendation as to when there should be a reassessment <e> <s> obviously some people may not need an assessment for a number of years <e> <s> others whose condition changes rapidly may need further assessment after only a matter of months <e> <s> the best way of dealing with the point might be for it to be tied into the assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment as i have added my name to it <e> <s> in particular i support the point raised by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth concerning representatives of disabled people especially of those who have communication difficulties <e> <s> only in section of the disabled persons services consultation and representation act is the authorised representative of a disabled person taken into consideration <e> <s> as i understand the bill we are discussing there is no procedure for that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the remarks on guidance made by my noble friend lord mottistone as i believe will most others who have taken part in various debates on this bill <e> <s> i approve of the general principles behind this amendment although i do not know whether the wording in detail is the best possible <e> <s> i wonder what would be the position of an ec national working in this country which will increasingly be the case after who will not be the direct responsibility of any local authority <e> <s> where will the money come from <e> <s> such people are just as likely to require community care as anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down and purely for clarification she said that if an individual is paying a community charge in one area and is found in need of community care in another local authoritys area the second authority would become responsible for paying <e> <s> surely if the person is paying the community charge in the first local authority he must be resident there in order to be liable for that community charge <e> <s> therefore the first local authority would be responsible for that individual <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness was rather muddled <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much support this amendment <e> <s> with a disabled person living at home the strain on a family can be appalling <e> <s> when someone needs to be taken to the lavatory more than once every single night or perhaps has to be turned so that he or she does not develop pressure sores or is generally disruptive to the rest of the family particularly when there are children there can be a danger of a breakdown in health of those who are caring and indeed a breakdown of the family itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> if my noble friend of the front bench is proposing to reject the amendment on the grounds of cost will he please advise the house just what the cost is first in financial terms and secondly in terms of the cost to disabled people as regards their physical and mental welfare <e> <s> i can see neither a logical nor a moral reason for rejecting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may give two instances <e> <s> one is of a man who is unfortunately now dead <e> <s> he was paralysed from the neck downwards but he was able to run his own life hire and fire his own helpers and use his own social security benefits to that end and manage his finances <e> <s> he lived at home <e> <s> he said that doing that considerably enhanced the quality of his life <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider putting in an independent individual to monitor such schemes <e> <s> i am sure that the house will give her leave to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will be prepared to reconsider her amendment and if necessary come back at third reading with other amendments to make certain that we cover people such as schizophrenics as well as others who have disabilities with long periods of remission when they may not need any help but with whom the disease recurs quite suddenly <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to support the amendment <e> <s> i have a feeling that where a health authority has a department that is serving a high proportion of people who do not come from its area that department will say these are not our people <e> <s> let someone else look after them <e> <s> such a department could well be cut <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords these are people for whom local authorities have responsibility to provide community care <e> <s> generally speaking that care is not available within the local authorities themselves and it is the voluntary organisations which provide that care and which are then paid by the local authorities for the care of the individuals for whom the local authorities are responsible <e> <s> that does not mean to say that local authorities dictate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to think that assessments are portable <e> <s> at report stage i mentioned the possibility that when an assessment is carried out it should state when the next assessment is likely to be needed unless there is a serious deterioration in the individuals condition <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government had a mind to do so they could accept the amendment <e> <s> the only way in which it can be improved is to accept it and send it to the other place <e> <s> members there can reject it or improve upon it and send it back to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment as my name is associated with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to welcome the governments efforts to bring community care genuinely into the community <e> <s> however i doubt very much whether their efforts for disabled people will work unless they put into operation at the same time as the community care part of the bill sections and of the disabled persons services consultation and representation act <e> <s> that is slightly wider in scope and is designed specifically for such a purpose <e> <s> it is not a catch-all measure as is the bill that we are discussing tonight <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i believe it would also cover paint from a spray can which is frequently used to disfigure all kinds of places around the country <e>", "<cs> it is not at all unusual in towns and cities for a proportion of the pavement sometimes quite a large proportion not to be owned by the local authority or highway authority but by the freeholder of the adjoining land <e> <s> can my noble friend advise the committee whether that part of the pavement that is not in public ownership counts as part of the road as suggested in the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to intervene <e> <s> he mentioned the pavement which is maintainable at public expense <e> <s> in a number of instances in which the pavment is now owned by the public authority it has to be maintained by the freeholder <e> <s> that puts a rather different slant on the matter <e>", "<cs> i entirely approve of the idea behind my noble friends amendment but i am a little worried about the words in the penultimate line of the amendment which state <e>", "<cs> i assume that the authorised officer of the litter authority will not be a constable <e> <s> as such will he have the power to ask for the name and address of the litter lout <e> <s> if not is the amendment not required <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been speaking for some time on this so i shall be as brief as possible <e> <s> the various groups of disabled people who are not included in the other places ring-fenced amendment are in many ways those who are least able to make their voices heard locally because of their disabilities <e> <s> it will be said that their carers will do that for them but that is quite wrong <e> <s> for the most part the carers will be far too exhausted to try to do anything <e> <s> they will be suffering under their burden <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord ullswater for his undertaking which i gladly accept <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> if there had been room on the marshalled list my name would have been on it as well possibly a sixth one following the right reverend prelate <e> <s> it may be of interest not only to the committee but to the noble lord lord winstanley in particular that the british deaf association is about to publish a sign language dictionary which is funded by bp <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend so early in his speech <e> <s> i trust that he will forgive my intrusion <e> <s> he is quite wrong in his assertion <e> <s> subtitling does not make television available to all those who are deaf or hard of hearing <e> <s> indeed there is a large proportion of people whose only language is signing and who cannot properly read english <e>", "<cs> i too strongly support the amendments <e> <s> with an ageing population there will be more blind people in our community for whom the services will become essential <e> <s> like the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth i am attracted to amendment no <e> <s> za which encourages the commission to undertake or make arrangements for research <e> <s> however i am concerned that if included in the bill as it should be the amendment will clash with clause b which states <e>", "<cs> it may therefore be for the convenience of the committee if we deal with my amendments nos <e> <s> and only as the noble baroness obviously wishes to deal with her amendments separately <e> <s> i appreciate that <e> <s> perhaps i may say that the noble lord lord mccoll whose name is attached to amendment no <e> <s> has asked me to make his apologies <e> <s> he has been called from the chamber <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> clearly the government when preparing their briefs should prepare answers to each of the amendments even if they wish for their own convenience to group them together <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the powers that be nobody ever troubles to telephone us to find out our views <e> <s> most of us are doing other work during the day and only come to the chamber for bills or parts of them in which we are specifically interested <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden for his response to my two amendments <e> <s> i shall read what he has said with great interest <e> <s> i look forward to seeing the amendments that he will be putting down in due course <e> <s> i still reserve my right to table my amendments again <e> <s> i may not like his amendments although i suspect that his amendments will be better drafted than mine <e> <s> i shall wait to see <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness lady birk that i shall always be delighted to be grouped with her <e>", "<cs> my lords while genuinely support-ing the amendment moved by the minister i should also ike to support the amendment to that amendment moved by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth <e> <s> we are not asking that sign language should be used to any great extent just that the prospective licensees should consider the use of sign language <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the work he has put into the matter <e> <s> i am delighted to accept the alternatives <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the general principles behind amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that likens advertising on television to the rather dishonest practice of supermarkets putting large quantities of attractive sweets by the checkout <e> <s> i am a little worried by subsection b <e>"]
