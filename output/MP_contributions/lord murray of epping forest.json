["<cs> my lords it was with a measure of trepidation that i chose to address your lordships house for the first time on this issue of employment and unemployment <e> <s> however this seems to me to be an issue on which no one can keep silent even at the risk which i hope i can avoid of transgressing against the protocol of occasions such as this and indeed incurring a fate which is too awful to contemplate <e> <s> i count on the tolerance of your lordships and indeed on your reputation for listening even if not always agreeing which has been so impressed on me since i came here a few short weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords some or so years ago a leading industrial correspondent wrote and published a book entitled <e>", "<cs> but i am not going to talk about our noble house or as has been proposed the argument about whether we should be subject to annual reselection although having seen the marvellously caparisoned members this afternoon i am perhaps tempted to wish that that were an annual occasion <e> <s> however i would suggest that people who live in undemocratic glasshouses should not be the first to lift a stone <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to take up and develop a point made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester and if only in deference to a request from the government front bench to confine myself to one single and simple point <e> <s> i hope it is a positive point <e> <s> it is the way in which this report illustrates the need for and the justification of comparability in the process of income determination the need for fairness and for people to observe a fair relativity between their incomes and those of others and the justification of government intervention where necessary in the interests of securing that fairness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for allowing me to trespass upon your goodwill at this late hour to indicate my support for my noble friend lord underhill and to declare my common interest with him as a resident of the area and as one who has benefited from the services and the tender loving care as my noble friend has described it of forest hospital in my own time <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the point previously made would the minister not agree with me that it is a fact that the employment of males is falling that the employment of females is falling and that the only increase in employment of which great play has been made in terms of jobs being created is as has been said that of females working part-time <e> <s> is the minister not concerned that the level of employment in manufacturing industry is still per cent <e> <s> below that of <e> <s> what steps are the government intending to take as distinct from speeches being made to rectify this appalling situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my voice to those of your lordships who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> this is not merely a matter of humanity though it is that <e> <s> it is a matter of equity of morality of reasonable expectations on the part of thousands of people who believed and believe that they had accrued an entitlement to something which was theirs of right <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls addressed himself at the opening of his speech to the issue of consistency <e> <s> let me take the same theme and ask where the consistency is in the proposals which are before your lordships committee <e> <s> great play has been made quite properly of the advantages which it is said consumers and customers will gain from this measure <e> <s> a picture has been painted to us of them rushing out and maximising their satisfaction on sunday mornings in a way they cannot do at any other time in the week <e> <s> so be it <e>", "<cs> i find very offensive the idea of dividing into sheep and goats people who are working side by side for the same employer in the same conditions in the same circumstances and at the same time <e> <s> that is a situation which would create resentment and uncertainty but it would have a further effect which would fly in the face of what is proposed in the bill <e> <s> it would give an employer an <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord simon has a highly optimistic view of conditions in the shops trade <e> <s> if he believes that a person who had previously not worked on sundays and who wished to continue not working on sundays would be able to withstand the pressures put on him by an employer of the kind i am discussing then my views of the qualities of that sort of employer differ from those of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the government far from rejecting <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary i think that what should apply on sunday should apply to evening working as a whole <e> <s> although i do not like the bill i recognise that it ranges over the whole gamut and therefore i think it proper that any changes made under this heading should apply to both <e> <s> that is my view <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some degree of reluctance that i support this amendment with reluctance because i have no particular fondness for the wages council as an institution <e> <s> i vastly prefer voluntary combinations of work-people coming together collectively in trade unions to bargain with employers and establish their wages and conditions <e> <s> but i had to recognise as indeed trade unionists have had to recognise over the years that there are situations in which this is not possible and in which organisation is extraordinarily difficult <e> <s> the classic cases are shops and restaurants typically places where very small numbers of people are employed and therefore where in the past those small numbers of people this is well documented have been to an extent at the mercy of unscrupulous employers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord do us the courtesy of replying to the point made by my noble friend lord bruce that the productivity of an extra million people is nil and that in giving productivity figures he should make allowances for that fact <e>", "<cs> we should perhaps remind ourselves that a major aim perhaps even the main purpose of this part of the bill is to extend cashless pay <e> <s> this was the basis of discussions between the tuc and a former secretary of state for employment <e> <s> it is a purpose that i think should commend itself to the committee and indeed to most people <e> <s> it is right and proper to the extent that the truck acts are an impediment and various inquiries have shown that they are only a minor impediment to the extension of cashless pay in an orderly way <e>", "<cs> very briefly may i say that i would not wish it to be assumed that silence on these benches implies in any sense acceptance of the statements or unsupported assertions made by the minister for example the reiteration of the assertion that this measure is designed to produce jobs <e> <s> there is not a shred of evidence that measures of this kind defend jobs <e> <s> if his argument is that this measure is necessary to defend the job of a defaulter who other-wise might be taken to a tribunal the answer is that if there is dishonesty his job should be at stake <e> <s> if there is alleged dishonesty he should have the right to go to <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend not so much in the sense of arguing that clothing is a special case as arguing that it is a case which graphically illustrates the need for protection for workers of the kind to whom the noble lord has referred <e> <s> i think in particular of the east end of london and of the area around brick lane where even the most casual observation will show the dangerous dilapidated and appalling conditions in which mainly bengali women are working <e> <s> it was the area where the word sweating first entered the industrial vocabulary <e> <s> it was the area that gave rise to the trade boards themselves <e> <s> if this bill is passed the state of those workers will be even more degrading <e> <s> that is why i share my noble friends view that the bill which is a licence to exploit people in that situation should not commend itself to the committee <e>", "<cs> in addition to the reasons for supporting this amendment that have been so ably advanced by my noble friend lord mccarthy and other noble lords who have spoken there are the implications that this clause carries for britains standing in the world <e> <s> historically other countries have looked to britain to set and maintain decent and civilised standards of employment not least by way of the conventions established by the international labour organisation which is a body composed of governments employers associations and trades unionists <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness inform us whether her definition of flexibility would include provision for bringing forward supplementary estimates if the fund itself was clearly in danger of being exhausted <e>", "<cs> my own doubts about this amendment were rather brought to a focus by the talk of making a gesture <e> <s> it might well be that a gesture of this sort would have a rather less favourable effect on the staff of supplementary benefit offices and so on who if consulted might ask why is it necessary <e> <s> what have we been doing wrong <e> <s> i doubt whether the effect on them would be as salubrious or as salutary as has been suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the indebtedness of the house to the noble and learned lord who moved the amendment not only for the manner in which he moved it but also for giving the house the opportunity to express clearly and fully the debt that we owe so elegantly put already to the men and women affected by this bill <e> <s> we are not talking about so many head of cattle to be bought and sold some to be put down because they are no longer necessary <e> <s> i am sure that this is not a case that i together with my noble friends and those who support the amendment need to argue with the government or those on their front bench <e> <s> i am sure that they share this view and that they share the purpose of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing here more than a mere change in the quantum of industrial injuries benefit <e> <s> the change proposed in the bill touches on the central principle of industrial benefit on whether compensation should be paid at all for certain categories of physical or mental injury for pain suffering and disfigurement <e> <s> the fact is that the great majority of current industrial awards of this sort are for less than per cent <e> <s> the sufferers from the most common complaints such as occupational asthma and vibration white finger and most of the benefit payments are indeed less than per cent <e> <s> the change proposed in the bill would have the effect of largely descheduling injuries of this sort <e> <s> there has been a steady decline in injury claims on industrial disablement benefit from about in the mid-s to about now <e> <s> i think that is partly because of the work of the health and safety commission to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> the proposed change has attracted widespread independent criticism notably from the industrial injuries advisory council and i think it indicates a somewhat offhand attitude towards industrial injuries which should not be encouraged <e> <s> i therefore warmly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in examining the feasibility of a bill of rights in northern ireland will the noble lord take proper account of the need to consider the right to work as an essential right of the people of northern ireland <e> <s> in that situation does he join in commending the northern ireland committee of the ictu on its recent initiative in the calling of a conference to insist that the men of terror shall not be allowed to intimidate ordinary men and women from going about their normal work in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state accept that there is no disposition on the part of the occupants of these benches to seek to defend people who do not treat fairly their applications for work and that there is no propensity whatever to take action which would ensure that they were not required to pass a fair and effective test of being available for work <e> <s> any government must do this <e> <s> it is equally fair that any government should pass an effective test of their capacity to ensure the availability of work and will the noble lord accept that on this test the government have manifestly failed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that whatever the merits of wider share ownership it is not necessarily desirable that employees in companies should be encouraged to invest their savings in those companies <e> <s> in the event of a company getting into difficulties that employee is then in double jeopardy both as regards his savings and also his job <e>", "<cs> my lords i am doubly indebted to my noble friend lord donoughue first for initiating this debate and secondly for referring in his introduction to the special needs of the disabled in relation to the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that the difference between the present situation and situations which have existed earlier in the course of this dispute is that there is now in existence an agreement which has been accepted by the represenatives of the overwhelming majority of teachers <e> <s> that includes the union the professional association of teachers which has received the seal of approval from her right honourable friend the chairman of the conservative party <e> <s> it has been agreed by the representatives of the employers and it has been welcomed by representatives of parents the national confederation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a mistake to think of the bill as being a crisis measure in the sense of it being a response to a crisis <e> <s> there has been a crisis in our educational system but that crisis is on the way to being resolved <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beloff pointed out it has not yet been entirely resolved by any means but those who look now at the situation within the negotiating machinery would not have believed months ago that it could get as far as it has <e>", "<cs> i find some slight reassurance in a growing tendency among speakers on the government side to emphasise the interim nature of the governments proposal <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff the noble lord lord elton and the noble lord lord renton all dwelt on this point <e> <s> that is at the heart of the amendment <e> <s> that being so the issue before the committee is when are we to be favoured again with negotiating machinery to settle teachers salaries <e> <s> the assumption is that people who have been involved in finding agreements are much more likely to work with that agreement and to honour and respect it than people who have an agreement inflicted upon them <e> <s> i should have thought that would be common ground <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is a strong view among trade unionists that one thing which saturday nights events proved beyond doubt is that the legitimate and proper grievances of the trade unionists in this dispute will not be resolved by mass picketing or by the <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment refers to action which may be taken on or before the expiry of the act <e> <s> its purpose is not only to keep alive a necessary little spark of hope in the minds of teachers that one day their free rights of negotiation will be restored but further than that actively to encourage teachers and employers to address their minds to the preparation and creation of machinery which is sensible and practicable <e> <s> we hope that its practicability and common sense will persuade the secretary of state to review the way in which he is proposing to impose settlements on teachers himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the lack of enthusiasm of my noble friend lord houghton for short strikes of this nature <e> <s> i do not believe that they achieve very much <e> <s> having said that none of us can be surprised if teachers take the only means left open to them of expressing their concern and their anger at being deprived of basic rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will join me in welcoming the well informed and reflective contribution made by the noble earl lord cowley who brings with him great <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain how the fact that between and million extra people are now unemployed as compared to that their productivity is nil and that the fall in their productivity has been per cent <e> <s> contributes towards the wellbeing of british industry or of the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness care to remind her noble friend that there are always two sides to every argument and every dispute <e> <s> will she advise her right honourable friend the secretary of state that a very positive contribution towards resolving these difficulties which no one likes would be for him to sit down with the unions concerned and the employers as speedily as possible to devise new negotiating machinery which could come into effect very quickly <e> <s> does the minister agree that that would be a much more positive approach to resolving this issue than merely castigating one side or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this debate not least because it provides the occasion on which an old friend and colleague will have the opportunity of making his maiden speech in this house <e> <s> i look forward very much to hearing the way in which my noble friend lord basnett negotiates as it were a non-controversial way through a difficult and barbed subject one which is perhaps less of a green paper than an instalment in the conservative partys election manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the fact that the trade union movement helped the government of the day including mr callaghans government to bring down inflation from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> over three years is a service not to that government but to the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not distinguish on the one hand between the use of collective action to enforce the rights of an individual and on the other hand the development of some spurious sense of collectivity <e> <s> what trade unions are concerned with is the development of organisations so that the individual can get his rights through the support of his mates <e>", "<cs> my lords as well as providing a most valuable analysis of the contents of the action programme the report is welcome as a reminder to the european commission to governments and to us all of the range of factors which we should have in mind when discussing the environment <e> <s> i suppose that now we are all environmentalists <e> <s> be that as it may it is easy to be carried away by the sometimes passionate singlemindedness of the environmentalists <e> <s> that is not to deny the need to take fully and properly into account the environmental considerations when making decisions about industry <e> <s> all around us we see the results of ignoring those considerations <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord nugent has reminded us those decisions must also take account of the realities of the industrial and employment situations <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord carmichael for initiating this debate for his panoramic survey of the situation and indeed for his description of the plight of the merchant navy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful my lords <e> <s> i rest my case <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment because it seeks to limit the harmful effects of the bill on employees whose needs as has already been mentioned by many members of the committee are ignored in the bill <e> <s> during our discussion of the shops bill this chamber made it clear that whatever its merits it was wrong and i think that it was the noble and learned lord lord denning who used the phrase to smuggle into the bill a worsening of employees conditions <e> <s> whatever the standards used by requiring people to work on sundays this bill is worsening their existing rights and expectations as well as those of their families <e> <s> therefore any way in which the bill can be improved so as to limit the ill effects of this legislation on those employees and their families will i hope commend itself to the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wyatt has painted a touching picture of the working man in a cloth cap popping along to his betting shop on a sunday afternoon to put on a couple of quid <e> <s> that is no doubt extending his range of choice and enlarging his freedom and those are very fine matters in themselves as well as contributing to the proceeds of the betting shop owners for seven days a week instead of only six <e>", "<cs> even if that were true it would leave people who would be under great compulsion and great strain <e> <s> they would have no redress at industrial tribunals unless we adopted certain other amendments and would have no defence whatever <e>", "<cs> this chamber has agreed that race tracks should open for a limited number of sundays <e> <s> but surely the least that we can do as a corollary of that is to ensure that the basic rights of existing employees of established not new employees are protected <e> <s> these are rights they have always had and have a proper expectation of maintaining <e> <s> i have no doubt that some employees support the bill <e> <s> i have no doubt that there are other employees who do not like the bill but who will settle for extra pay on sundays or extra time off <e>", "<cs> it is not the purpose of those who support this amendment to seek in any way to defend or protect a master who is negligent <e> <s> it is right that a master who is negligent should be answerable for his proper statutory responsibilities and indeed his contractual responsibilities <e> <s> however it is equally right that we should recognise that the ultimate responsibility must rest with the owner <e>", "<cs> i agree that we should move with the times <e> <s> the shift in the method of payment with the agreement of the seamens <e>", "<cs> my lords the causes of homelessness are legion <e> <s> anyone who visits places where the homeless especially the single homeless to whom the right reverend prelate has referred gather realises that all human life is there <e> <s> one important factor has been the alarming increase over the past three or four years in the amount of homelessness caused by the closure of our large mental hospitals <e> <s> the closure of such places as claybury and friern and the acceptance of patients into the community is obviously welcome and desirable <e> <s> but caring will only work if there are <e>", "<cs> my lords while i hold no brief for the victor in that election is the noble lord alleging that there was deception and <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to address myself to part i of the bill and indeed to quite limited aspects of it <e> <s> but before i come to that i wish to comment on the claims often put forward and repeated here this afternoon by the noble lord lord trefgarne about the alleged achievements of the legislation that we have seen so far in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the union of democratic mineworkers the members have not walked away from the union <e> <s> they have succeeded into a particular sector which is still very highly organised and which i hope will soon be realigned and reunited with the national union of mineworkers <e> <s> it is in the interests of no one to multiply the number of unions we have in this country <e> <s> i should not have thought that the noble lord <e> <s> lord wyatt would advocate that <e> <s> we already have too many <e>", "<cs> i suspect that there will be considerable competition for what is indeed the privilege and the honour of congratulating the noble lord on his maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure that those congratulations would have been offered had he made a speech of a different kind <e> <s> his speech has reflected the experience wisdom and judgment which have always shaped his attitude towards industrial relations <e> <s> if i may be partisan for a moment i should like to say that i believe that has also reflected his common sense and wisdom acquired through his previous experience of legislating <e> <s> i am quite sure that we shall hear the noble lord often <e> <s> i hope that i shall always agree with him as i agree with much of what he has said today <e> <s> however whatever the noble lord says we shall always listen to him with respect and affection <e>", "<cs> i think that it is common ground that we want to see trade union leaders general secretaries and other officials accountable and responsive to their members <e> <s> presumably that is the objective of all of us <e> <s> what puzzles me about the proposal from the government side is that it seems that it will have directly the contrary effect <e> <s> all general secretaries or presidents are accountable to the membership of the union in two ways through the operation of the rule book and through the elected executive committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps the distinction that i draw between the existing role of the courts in relation to the rule book on the one hand and the putting on to the statute book of this entirely new piece of legislation on the other hand is not obvious or clear <e>", "<cs> i must not weary the committee <e> <s> i simply put this suggestion to the noble lord lord cambell of alloway as a method of meeting both our worries <e> <s> when this law is passed in whichever form it is adopted the members of a union through secret ballot should be able to say whether or not they wish this law to apply to them or whether they wish to continue to be governed by their own rules <e> <s> this would be quite consistent with the dignity of this chamber and of another place <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to meet me on that common ground i should be delighted if he would draft an amendment to that effect to which we would both subscribe at report stage <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree with me as he has mentioned mr scargill that the decision by mr scargill to seek election was precisely based on the grounds that it would strengthen his position <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister can throw some light on the case of a trustee who satisfies all the requirements in the clause except that as the union holds its conference biennially and not annually he is elected by the conference on a two-year basis largely because of the cost of bringing members together <e> <s> he will presumably require to satisfy the electoral and ballot requirement contained in other provisions of the bill <e> <s> can the minister confirm whether that is so <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i referred to a trustee not an honorary president <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> at the expense of boring the committee which i suspect is deeply bored already will the noble lord explain why those on his national executive committee who are by no means the champions of mr scargill have lent their support to the statements that that election was above board <e> <s> will he tell us how many conservative laws are meant to dance on the point of a scargill <e>", "<cs> in order to help the committee in its further consideration of this interesting matter will the minister publish the list of the people who have been considered together with their ages <e>", "<cs> i think that all we are anxious to know is what the minister means i think i am quoting him correctly by the known facts <e> <s> will he publish the known facts to which he has referred in his subsequent answer <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the precise purposes of the amendment is to prevent bullying <e> <s> in the tensions and heightened emotions of a pre-strike situation and of a strike situation there is a natural if indefensible tendency on the part of some people to be angry and incensed <e> <s> one purpose of a unions disciplinary procedures is to stop individual members of the union from taking the law improperly into their own hands in regard to those who refuse to stand solidly with the rest of the members and from doing things of which none of us would approve <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy described an earlier amendment as minimalist <e> <s> i think that description applies to this amendment as well <e> <s> as he has so rightly said unions come in a variety of shapes sizes and forms <e> <s> the characteristics of the unions with which we are dealing here are that they are small

union of marine aviation and shipping transport officers that although the iraqi authorities warned the foreign office of an impending attack on the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the ministers reply to an earlier question imply that we should regard rises in property prices as a sign of economic health <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the national schizophrenia fellowship has asserted

at the crisis at christmas discovered that per cent <e> <s> were suffering from psychotic disturbances <e> <s> if he challenges those figures will he instruct or at least encourage regional health authorities to institute proper systems for surveying following up and statistically examining what happens to people who have been discharged from mental hospitals so that we can have the information which the minister says that he does not have at present <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that we are not discussing a unique situation <e> <s> does she share my dismay that britain should be found guilty in the company of such countries as chile colombia bangladesh and rumania of persistently being in breach of obligations which as she herself has said are part of conventions to

accorded to us in this united nations organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister seek to persuade the european commission that the definition of vat as a broadly-based tax should take full account of social considerations as well as narrow economic considerations of a fiscal kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is impossible to understand the concern felt by the staffs of our schools

baroness lady serota not only for the extraordinarily able way in which she led the inquiry but also for the original happy thought of having it at all <e> <s> it is quite clear from the response of the commissioners and also of the staff whom we met in brussels both formally and informally that they were warmed by the thought that we should have considered their role in the community and should have devoted some time to examining their contribution to the success of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i share with the noble lord lord geddes a sense of indebtedness to the noble lord lord kearton not only for his clear and comprehensive introduction of the report this afternoon but also for his able and forceful chairmanship and perhaps not least for the happy phrase which is incorporated in paragraph of the report where it refers to billion in five years being spent through these funds as no small beer <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stoddart referred to the possibility that an analogy might be drawn between this provision and some possible future amendment to industrial relations law to take into account those trade unionists who do not vote in a strike

maintenance of professional standards which are dealt with in the main in chapter and annex d i speak essentially as a layman and as a lay member of the professional conduct committee of the bar council <e> <s> in serving on that committee i have been struck in particular by the dedication of the barristers who are professional members by their toughness on their fellow barristers who are in

those in shops factories and offices who know what is happening and who are aware of the implications and consequences of the new legislation <e> <s> that is all that the amendment provides <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put forward for consideration one small but significant factor <e> <s> during this time of an ageing population many district councils have houses with two or three bedrooms being occupied by old people who have lived there all their lives and whose families have grown up and left <e> <s> they are stuck there <e> <s> they are not necessarily going to move unless they can be offered smaller and more convenient accommodation of the sort which is the subject of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that noble lords will forgive me if i intervene briefly <e> <s> i am sure that it is some dreadful error on my part that has led to my name being inadvertently omitted from the list <e> <s> if it is any consolation to noble lords as it is to me many of the points that i would have made have been made and much more effectively by previous speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one very brief point which is additional to those which have been so very ably put forward this evening and i promise to be brief <e> <s> we have been reminded that integrated education in northern ireland is a delicate and fragile matter <e> <s> i welcome the sympathy which the government and the minister have shown towards this subject and for making available additional resources in northern ireland for that purpose <e> <s> they are not enough and we should ask for more but they have certainly made available some additional resources <e>", "<cs> i should like to underline one point <e> <s> the acceptance of the proposal would reduce the danger of strikes rather than increase it <e> <s> if a union which has taken a ballot intended in part to induce a period of reflection and it is then faced by court proceedings which are terminated in favour of the union there could be a danger of the union unduly precipitantly engaging <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the arrangements for pay settlements made in the fire service in the winter of in which my noble friend lord callaghan played an incisive part have produced more than a decade of excellent industrial relations in that critical service <e> <s> does she agree that it would indeed be folly to disrupt those arrangements <e> <s> does she also agree that in considering the future of the ambulance service it would be wise to reflect on the benefits which have been received from the fire service and to seek to negotiate something which would be by agreement with the unions penned to ambulancemen and women <e>", "<cs> my lords given the fact of the high and rising proportion of homeless people who are former in-patients of psychiatric hospitals can the minister confirm that resources are to be made available under the new mental health grant scheme to house between and of those people <e> <s> can he also say what provision will be made for the rest of these people as at least people discharged from psychiatric hospitals are not in squats or in bedsits but are now sleeping rough on londons streets alone <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may point this out <e> <s> more than per cent <e> <s> of <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i am appointed by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor with my colleagues to cast a critical and if necessary suspicious eye over the activities of barristers <e> <s> we all agree that the cab rank rule as such is enormously valuable <e> <s> some barristers show a degree of reluctance to join the cab rank on occasion <e> <s> that is very exceptional and rare <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must surely recognise that in adducing this argument he has completely missed the point <e> <s> for example in the ambulance strike the leadership recommended acceptance of the offer while the members turned it down <e> <s> what the leadership recommends and what its members decide is totally irrelevant to the issue under discussion <e> <s> the issue is a simple one <e> <s> i put it to the minister in this way if he had thought of this argument during the passage of the bill would he have written the existing condition into the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim of the governments employment legislation is to improve industrial relations <e> <s> one of its sub-aims is to reduce the number of strikes <e> <s> that is fair enough we are all in the business of trying to reduce the number of strikes wherever we can <e> <s> the assumption that the government are making on this issue is that the holding of a second ballot would reduce the probability of a strike <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene in the dispute but i should like to comment on the way in which i see the balance between lay people and others on the committee <e> <s> i have doubts about the committee as such it has astonishingly wide terms of reference and an enormous amount of hard work will be involved <e> <s> the way in which the best candidates will be obtained remains to be seen <e> <s> however as the noble and learned lord has said it is critically important to get the composition right <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has throughout our discussions rightly impressed on us the fact that one of the central purposes of the bill is to improve the service to what he and i prefer to describe as the client but which many people refer to as the consumer <e> <s> i should have thought that in this context the anxieties that some clients or consumers may feel that their case may be put in a second rate way should be a cogent thought in all our minds <e> <s> from the point of view of the chap who has to try and get bail he is entitled to the best counsel going <e> <s> he would have little confidence in persons whom the bill proposes to allow to conduct cases <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the developments in recent years notably the reduction in crewing levels the faster <e>", "<cs> my lord does the noble erl agree that putting steel in the backbone of the commission on the one hand and strengthening the powers of the court of auditors on the other are not mutually exclusive <e> <s> will the government look again at the arguments for strengthening the powers of the court which were so well set out in the report of the committee chaired by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i suppose that the concern felt all around the committee on this issue is exemplified by the fact that the noble baronesses lady robson and lady macleod and i served together as trustees on the charity crisis at christmas which apart from running the open christmas funds many homelessness projects <e> <s> one has only to come to the open christmas to see that the need for medical treatment in particular for dentistry and chiropody is endemic and widespread <e> <s> for many of those who come to us christmas is the only occasion in the year when they can see a dentist or have their feet seen to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister inform the house what action is being taken to increase the number of uk air traffic controllers thereby increasing the safety of air travel and reducing the danger of congestion and the possibility of industrial disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the emphasis rightly placed by noble lords in all parts of the house on bringing into the public arena empty property for the use of homeless people <e> <s> is he also aware of the notable contribution made to that approach by the empty property unit which on a shoestring budget has helped to make almost such properties available on a short-term basis <e> <s> is he not concerned that a cut of one third of its funding will severely affect the work of the empty property unit which is in the front line of that activity <e> <s> will he urge his honourable friend the minister for housing to receive as a matter of urgency representatives of the section liasion committee to discuss the content of that decision at a time deep into the financial year when other funds are not available <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express briefly my support for the amendment <e> <s> the provisions of the bill are very welcome not least because of the additional protection they bring to masters and to crews <e> <s> however this provision and others in the bill are further instances of additional obligations laid on shipmasters who are almost engulfed by a torrent of new legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords clause appears to be framed in a way which suggests that a master has complete control of a ship <e> <s> we may mislead ourselves by using the word master in the sense that the individual concerned is omnipotent <e> <s> the general duties regulations make it clear that the master is an employee and that his powers are circumscribed <e> <s> if the provision were enacted the master might find himself caught between the millstones of the law and those of his employer <e> <s> like my noble friend lord underhill i suggest that we should accept the reality of the masters position and limit his obligations to matters where he genuinely has competence <e>", "<cs> my lords we all very much welcome the reduction in the number of custodial sentences and we are also grateful to the government for the policy changes that have been made <e> <s> does the noble earl share the general anxiety that the number of young adults held in custody on remand has risen from five years ago to about now <e> <s> can he say when we can look forward to a similar initiative to reduce the number of these young people in custody one of whom we saw on the roof at strangeways prison a few weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords in the event of other european countries not being prepared to give guarantees about the reservation of their coastal trade to their own shipping guarantees on cabotage will the government be prepared to consider making a unilateral decision to reserve such shipping facilities including offshore facilities to british ships in order to concentrate the mind if only that of other community countries <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby questioned the relevance of the bill to the environment <e> <s> there is one aspect of the environment to which the amendments are highly relevant and that is the working environment of many thousands of people who because of their occupations have to approach houses which are strange to them and where very often there are dogs that find them even stranger <e> <s> i am talking about postmen meter readers policemen and milkmen <e> <s> last year cases of savaging of postmen by dogs were reported <e>", "<cs> there is no nonsense about fairness on this <e> <s> the rates which a reasonable employer will offer are the rates which will attract an individual to work for him <e> <s> in a market economy and in a labour market such as we have the rate will be at or about what other employers are offering for similar work by similar workers <e> <s> therefore is there any possible way in which one can define what a reasonable employer would offer except in terms which are broadly along the lines of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i cannot see that there is any contradiction between the two amendments <e> <s> on the contrary one must be expressed in terms of the other <e> <s> therefore why the fuss <e>", "<cs> the so-called closed shop the per cent <e> <s> trade union shop or the union membership agreement has taken many forms <e> <s> i suspect that it will also take many forms in the future <e> <s> we are seeing a change in its shape and in its arrangements <e> <s> however at its heart there is a purpose and an intention to which the noble lord lord mellish has referred <e> <s> it is not a mean or a base motive <e> <s> the motive is that of fair play which is a phenomenon well known and admired by the british <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton illustrates appositely the paradox of this situation <e> <s> if a man is alleged to have committed a serious offence by his employer and he is sacked the employee can go to the industrial tribunal and pit his arguments against those of his employer and ask for a fair and impartial hearing <e> <s> however if a man advent <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down does he agree with me that managers are as likely as working people to lose their tempers sometimes <e> <s> just as a group of workers may say oh blow and take industrial action a manager may say i have had enough of this <e> <s> out <e> <s> there is the door there are your cards <e> <s> out you go without even stopping to think <e> <s> if he has to stop to think about the consequences of his actions that might help him <e> <s> i take the noble lords point but does he agree with me that some coolness on the part of both people and a lack of opportunity might be helpful to both sides not just to the worker <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will clarify the confusion that has arisen in my mind <e> <s> he has drawn a distinction between official and unofficial action <e> <s> in most unions or all of them for all i know official action is action which is approved by the responsible authority within the union typically the executive council <e> <s> it is done at the request of a group of workers a branch or whatever it might be <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may pursue the point with the minister <e> <s> no official is entitled to make an action official unless it is provided for in the rules of the union <e> <s> however even if that is ignored and no official has been involved either in giving or withdrawing the permission the action is taken by a group of workers which does not contain an official of the union as defined by the rules <e> <s> can the minister say whether he approves of the employer sacking people without a moments notice indiscriminately without appeal for taking lawful industrial action after a ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord appealed to our common sense <e> <s> i do not pretend to understand the legal complexities of this clause but i thought when exercising my common sense in reading it perhaps the noble lord will explain why i am wrong that an official becomes a member by attending a meeting the mere fact that he goes to a meeting makes him a member of that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that reply very helpful <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can help me a little further <e> <s> will he explain to me as i do not fully understand where the words appear in the clause which state that if the official goes to a meeting for the purpose of not endorsing the action he is therefore not a member of that group <e> <s> where do i look in the bill for that explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords when a final decision is made on sunday collections will the minister ensure that due account is taken of the desire of many post office workers to share in the advantage of spending sundays with their families as do so many other workers in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords when will the government summon up the courage to give effect to the clear ruling given by mr justice hoffmann that the law is being properly carried out and that all that is lacking is will on the part of the government to enforce it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask for the indulgence of the house as i have a long-standing speaking engagement in essex this evening and i regret that i shall not be present to hear <e>"]
