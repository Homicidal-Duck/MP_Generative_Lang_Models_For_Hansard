["<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with my noble friend <e> <s> i did not hear the report to which he has referred but i can tell him this it is our intention to persuade our community partners not to allow subsidised food to go for export <e> <s> however in the event of our not being able to persuade them in that way this country would be in breach of its arrangements with the european community if we were to act unilaterally <e> <s> however if i may tell my noble friend this he may well be aware of it already there was so much concern within the european parliament that the european parliament not only threw out the budget but also passed a resolution in which they said they might retrospectively prevent the subsidy money being forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely the reason why our partners in the european community want to export these surpluses <e> <s> our only complaint is that it is wrong to send them to russia <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is to be an export to russia of subsidised butter and if subsidies are permitted then it is not within our choice to prevent that butter going to russia <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is this any butter which goes into intervention is community butter irrespective of the country in which it is held in intervention <e> <s> the commission have recently changed the system and individual tenders now have to be made for individual consignments of butter <e> <s> this did not happen before and the proposals for the special sales of butter to russia are in suspense for about two weeks because of the resolution which was passed by the european parliament to which i referred a few minutes ago <e> <s> within that general framework the governments sympathies are entirely with the view of the noble viscount lord st davids and <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of questions in that <e> <s> first may i say to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts over the subsidy to the british housewife that is perfectly true but it merely exacerbates the problem because if there is a surplus within the community however desirable it may be to subsidise the housewife the real problem is to get rid of the surplus <e> <s> the second point is whether the new system will change the rate of subsidy <e> <s> i am bound to tell the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts that it will not change the rate but it will give the management committee those are the people who authorise these sales a chance to consider each tender and to vote on the tender <e> <s> on every occasion the united kingdom has voted against sales to russia <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we are bringing every pressure we can to bear upon the commission to prevent these sales <e> <s> but as the house will appreciate in the end we are part of the community and it is a community decision <e> <s> my right honourable friend the lord privy seal my noble friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs and my right honourable friend the minister <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly true my lords it was <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that one of our great complaints at the moment is that the commission is proposing that the per cent <e> <s> subsidy which we got on butter from feoga should stop <e> <s> this is something from which britain has benefited <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is certainly a point of view which should be looked at and so far as possible pursued <e> <s> but in the end of course the food has to be paid for somehow by somebody and if we have a surplus the main thing to do is to get rid of that surplus <e> <s> i would only repeat and re-emphasise if there are noble lords who are concerned that we as part of the community should be exporting butter to a country which has been involved in afghanistan in the way in which it has that this government are equally concerned and we are also concerned to try to stop it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to follow the thread of the noble lord lord wigg <e> <s> i cannot see that there is any reason for suggesting that the government are in an utter muddle <e>", "<cs> of course they are not <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord we are part of the community and we are trying to encourage the community to take the right action and not what we believe to be the wrong action <e> <s> that is not muddle <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the remark which mr silkin made over the week-end in which he was quoted as saying damn the common market would not meet with the accord of the present government <e> <s> that is not our view <e> <s> our view and i agree with the noble lord lord brown is to try to restrict the products which are in structural surplus and to that end we are content to see those prices not increased <e> <s> what we are not content to see is the proposals of the common market acting unfairly against the united kingdom as opposed to other members of the community and under their present proposals that is what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords the five advisers have principally been considering the potential for improved marketing in bacon potatoes milk and apples <e> <s> they have also been looking at co-operation policy and export promotion <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food has already acted on their advice on co-operation <e> <s> changes are being made in the organisation of the central council for agricultural and horticultural co-operation and in the emphasis of its work <e> <s> they will continue to advise my right honourable friend in the course of the work which they are undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there has not been any publication nor indeed is it anticipated that there will be <e> <s> these are five individual people whom the minister has asked to look into various sectors of marketing and to advise him in such a way as they think fit <e> <s> their remit is very wide <e> <s> they can look into something individually or collectively or as a group of two or three <e> <s> they may publish their advice if they wish but they are not obliged to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will consider anything which the noble lord lord peart suggests <e> <s> but the distinction is that this is not something which they have been asked to do which has a finite end to it <e> <s> they are investigating the possibilities of marketing throughout quite a range of products over quite a period of time <e> <s> of course there will be many points which they raise which they will wish to be discussed and we have no intention of inhibiting such discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite see my noble friends concern <e> <s> i think that there is a slight difficulty in her mind and i should like to try to simplify it for her <e> <s> these five marketeers have been appointed by the minister to give him such advice as they think fit and if they wish to publish it to do so <e> <s> there is no question of my right honourable friend taking decisions upon their advice without having first consulted the people concerned <e> <s> of course there will be consultation but they are not a council which will periodically issue reports <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not really a quango <e> <s> however i can tell my noble friend that apart from the secretariats cost of three full-time officers who have been seconded from the ministry the cost to date to rd march has been <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend either is being mischievous or is hard of hearing <e> <s> i did not say that they were going to encourage any kind of marketing <e> <s> what i said they are doing is that they are trying to look into marketing in order to advise my right honourable friends on the measures that ought to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e> <s> the purpose is to give effect to the secretarial allowance for ministers and other office holders in your lordships house which was announced in the statement which my right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster made on th february and which i repeated here <e> <s> the new allowance of up to per annum is available only to ministers and other office-holders in your lordships house and is towards the cost of secretarial <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the concern which the noble lord lord wells-pestell has expressed <e> <s> the best way in which i can explain this to him is as follows <e> <s> the expenses allowance which at the moment is allowed consists of which is tax-free and the rest which is taxable <e> <s> however that is the subject of a separate claim and has to be claimed as an expense <e> <s> under this system it will be possible to claim not but and it is not impossible that if these are justifiable expenses accompanied by vouchers there would be a larger amount which would be free of tax <e> <s> but that is of course a matter for negotiations with the treasury <e> <s> however the allowance to which the noble lord refers is the subject of a special allowance claim and is not part of the salary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to know what people claim on their allowance forms <e> <s> in fact that which is claimed should be claimed because of expenses undertaken <e> <s> but i certainly take the noble lords point and if he is concerned about it and wishes to discuss it further i should be quite happy to discuss it with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i would not dispute that at all but from the noise that was emanating it was not at all clear what was being expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of a tenant of publicly-owned land is exactly the same as that of a tenant of privately-owned land <e> <s> he is in the market to purchase that land at the prevailing price <e> <s> it so happens that the price of land for a ministry tenant is higher than if it were sold on the open market as let land <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had quite a lot of supplementary questions on this and although i know my noble friend would be delighted to carry on answering them in view of the fact that we have other business i wonder whether it may be considered appropriate to move on <e>"]
