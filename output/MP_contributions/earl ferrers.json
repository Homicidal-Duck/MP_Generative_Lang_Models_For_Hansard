discussed by many people in many forums <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fascinating idea but i rather doubt whether my right honourable friend would accept that a minister should be specially designated for refugee problems <e> <s> but i would remind the noble lord that where any government give aid for certain particular people there is always the danger that it may not reach those people

for specific information on aid given by other countries i will do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly see that my noble friend has his attention brought to both suggestions

to be common agreement and the difficulty is to get eight other <e>", "<cs> my lords the great difficulty is to get the supply and demand in equilibrium and in balance <e> <s> what we would wish to achieve and this is perfection is that that which is required is produced and that there should not be any surpluses <e> <s> but the nature of life is that if we are not to have shortages in some years we are bound to have surpluses in other years <e> <s> the dramas created by shortages are with respect infinitely greater than the dramas created by surpluses <e> <s> perhaps i could give the noble lord one example <e> <s> about four years ago potatoes were in short supply not only in england but throughout the common market countries <e> <s> prices simply rocketed from a tonne to a tonne <e> <s> the complaint then was that consumers were having to pay too <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point but unless we draw this discussion to a close we shall be embarking on an agricultural debate <e> <s> perhaps with your lordships approval we might return to the debate on which we originally embarked <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that although they have been running at a loss they have in fact now turned round and are becoming more profitable and the figures which i have indicate that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always felt that the method of calculating the monetary compensation amounts is not very satisfactory and we should wish to see an alteration but the fact is that in order to achieve the alteration you must have the agreement of the other members of the community <e> <s> but we have been concerned to see that our producers can compete on fairer terms and the way in which this is best done at <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt something which is of very great concern but in view of the fact that we are slightly up against time and that the questions on this statement have gone on for about minutes i wonder whether it would meet with the approval of the house if we were to move on bearing in mind that my noble friend has said that he would be quite happy through the usual channels to consider a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the present position is that imported pre-packed milk cannot be sold here unless it is unpacked heat-treated again and repacked on registered premises in this country <e> <s> that expense will probably render the imported milk non-competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the delivery of milk to the doorstep is one of the most important facets of our national life and we wish to see this continued <e>", "<cs> my lords our standards are extremely high <e> <s> at the moment there is no common european commission directive on uniformity of standards although one is lying on the table <e> <s> we would not wish to see any agreement to a european standard being reached if it lowered in any way the standard which we have at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord leatherland has had the advantage of me if he has slept in a french cowshed <e> <s> all i would tell him is that any milk which is sold in great britain must conform to the standards which great britain has <e> <s> we make those standards operate by having premises which are registered and inspected by the local authorities <e> <s> therefore any milk which comes from france even if it is produced in the disagreeable situations which the noble lord lord leatherland has suggested would have to be treated in premises which are under the supervision of local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise that parliament will be under some pressure this session <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that we will nevertheless do our best to see with i am sure the help of the opposition that the arrangements which are made for the conduct of business are as acceptable to your lordships as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the kind remarks that he has made about my noble friend lord soames <e> <s> anyone who has been leader of this house will know as the noble lord lord peart does that it is always difficult to get major legislation starting here <e> <s> clearly the decision to take the local government bill in another place will in the words of my noble friend risk the july log-jam becoming greater but it is entirely up to this house to decide how we conduct our business to deal with that log-jam <e> <s> i have no doubt that as we have met the real points that the opposition had they in turn will make sure that they will help us to see that government business is got through <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is the governments decision as to the house in which a bill should be taken but being an accommodating kind of government we considered the view of the opposition and tried to meet them over it <e> <s> having done so we are in control of our business in this house and i am sure that we shall all do the best we can to ensure that the disagreeable thoughts that my noble friend has will not materialise <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there are some new bills which will be coming shortly after christmas and in the new year <e> <s> progress on the competition bill and the industry bill in the other place indicates that they will be with us fairly soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord will find many ways in which he can help us even though that might not be one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the motion standing in my name on the order paper be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to your lordships for the welcome which has been given to this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord peart had the advantage of being both succinct and brief <e> <s> he simply said that he supported these regulations and i am grateful to him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has invited me to agree with him on a number of issues <e> <s> i will take note of the noble lords point of view and see that that is directed to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might be permitted to add my remarks of thanks to the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale for what he has done on the european committees because he has guided them through very difficult controversial and extremely complicated legislation and indeed he has guided the whole house <e> <s> i think the house owes him a great debt of gratitude for what he has done <e> <s> i agree so much with what he said that the house and indeed parliament should not get out of touch with the european members of parliament <e> <s> i think he is absolutely right in that westminster should not get out of touch with what goes on in europe and the european members should not get out of touch with what goes on in westminster <e> <s> i believe everyone will agree with that with the possible exceptions of the noble lord lord shinwell and the noble lord lord wigg who feel that they do not like the thing anyhow and want to be shot of it <e> <s> but to most people the european parliament is there and we have to make a success of it <e> <s> it would he a great pity if we could not keep in step <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend will not have any hesitation in routing me out of a chair if i am occupying it when he wishes to go to the library <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a matter for the whole house and no doubt the whole house will consider the noble lords view <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has explained to the commission his reasons for disagreeing with their proposals and the commission have agreed to consider these and come forward with different proposals <e> <s> with regard to the lom convention i can assure my noble friend that the eec has a commitment to purchase million tonnes from the acp countries <e>", "<cs> my lords if the commissions proposals as they stand at <e>", "<cs> my lords this is exactly why i said in my original reply that my right honourable friend agrees with the commissions proposals for reducing the surpluses but does not agree with the proposals in so far as they affect the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no sugar stockpiles as such they are sold during the course of the year and therefore there is not a stockpile like that of butter or other commodities in intervention <e> <s> but i can tell the noble lord that on the whole there is a surplus of about million tonnes per year which the community produces and which has to be distributed elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord leatherhead that we consult tate lyle and the british sugar corporation and all other interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the common agricultural policy agricultural produce protection of community arrangements amendment order which was laid before this house on th december be now approved <e> <s> the need for an amending order arises because of a change which has been made in the export refund arrangements which are applied to the export of cattle from the community to third countries <e> <s> the adjustment which was made in response to pressure by the united kingdom allows pure-bred breeding cattle to benefit from export refunds as from st august <e> <s> it gives our export trade in pedigree cattle the same <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie said he was sure that the agricultural community would be grateful for any small benefit <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that it is not quite as small as he might think <e> <s> it depends upon the weight of the animal and an animal of approximately cwt <e> <s> will receive an export refund of approximately <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends what the question is <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble viscount lord hanworth that a number of people take that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that the question to which the noble lord lord wells-pestell refers in fact relates to the length of speeches as opposed to the actual unstarred question <e> <s> i would only put this thought in the noble lords mind it is not the duty of the government though i accept that it would be the duty of the leader if he felt that there was sufficient reason for this to be brought before the committee <e> <s> i have done a little ferreting into this matter and the noble lord might like to know that over the last three years the average length of time of an unstarred question has been only hours and only on occasions has an unstarred question exceeded the hours which is the time limit of a short debate <e> <s> therefore on the face of it i would not have thought that that was a cause for suggesting to your lordships that there should be a strict curtailment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that might be a trifle unparliamentary <e> <s> the correct procedure would be for my noble friend to write to the chairman of committees asking him to put this before the procedure committee <e> <s> if the chairman of committees were to do so and i have no reason to suspect that he would not then the procedure committee could discuss it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting question to which i am not quite certain how i should reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to your lordships for the general welcome that you have given to the bill and i have certainly noted the comments that have been made about it <e> <s> as always <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that if we are not careful we shall get into a committee stage over this <e> <s> but if i may say so to the noble lord lord wynne-jones he says that this is a government bill and the government must be responsible <e> <s> my immediate reaction to that is to say with respect watch it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says that it is a cruel and inhuman process and he is entitled to his view <e> <s> when he asks whether the government will agree to that i am bound to tell him that we will only consider all the advice which is given to us by the farm animal welfare council which is going to take advice from a number of different organisations and people <e>", "<cs> my lords farm deer are already protected under various acts of parliament and i have no particular evidence to show that the method of killing them is at present unsatisfactory but if my noble friend cares to let me know of any case which he thinks is unsatisfactory then i shall certainly look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that at one moment my noble friend was going to declare an interest but he did so in an aside manner <e> <s> all i would say to him is that so far as i know there is not a market for old antlers but i understand that there is a market for antlers in velvet to which this country does not at the moment subscribe <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to inflict myself again upon your lordships especially when your lordships are in a querulous mood <e> <s> however we have spent eight minutes on the question and perhaps your lordships might feel that it would be appropriate to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that there is a scope in this country for both refined sugar from cane and also for sugar beet <e> <s> my noble friend asked for an assurance that there will be an equal profitability from the two by brussels <e> <s> of course that is not brussels particular responsibility <e> <s> perhaps i could give her this piece of information which might help to put it in perspective <e> <s> it is estimated that the margin for producing one tonne of white sugar from sugar beet is approximately <e> <s> within this the refining margin from sugar beet to white sugar is estimated to be <e> <s> the margin for refining one tonne of white sugar from raw cane is estimated to be about <e> <s> in this country in dealing with sugar beet the difficulty is that it is not only the refining but the processing of the complete crop which is taken into account in deriving the margin whereas with sugar cane it is only the refining <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in fact the noble lord will find that the demand for world sugar this year is outstripping the actual supply <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that the noble lord is of course absolutely right but in fact he is very nearly right <e> <s> we consume about million tonnes of sugar <e> <s> we import from other countries about million tonnes <e> <s> we import from acp countries million tonnes and we produce about million tonnes ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i take absolutely the point made by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> we are equally very concerned that the sugar refining industry is kept as healthy as possible <e> <s> moreover we think that there is a substantial part that can be played by the sugar beet industry <e> <s> our concern at present is that the original proposals put forward by brussels would severely restrict the growing of sugar beet in this country by hectares which is unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be glad to know that the arrangements for importing acp sugar into the community are of indefinite duration <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of your lordships i should like to repeat a statement which is being made by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster in another place on parliamentary pay and allowances <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer the observations made by the noble lord lord peart and the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> first i accept that the noble lord lord peart said that he would like to reserve his position and consult with others about this <e> <s> perhaps he means with us <e> <s> by all means let him do so should he so wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for having made that observation <e> <s> i concur with him totally <e> <s> it is a very very difficult job of work to get the balance right when there is absolutely no yardstick by which to compare results <e> <s> if the noble lord the leader of the opposition wishes to have consultations by all means let him do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to that question is that peers expenses will be reviewed periodically by the top salaries review body <e> <s> they will not necessarily be reviewed every year but probably biennially <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of the noble lord lord shinwell and it does not exactly surprise me that he referred to the fact that those who were members of parliament before and retired receive no pension at all <e> <s> i know that this is a matter of great concern to those who are so placed <e> <s> i think the noble lord said that he was a member for years before that occurred and there was no pension there and only the dole <e> <s> that was a fairly traumatic experience but of course things have altered quite a bit <e> <s> i even remember that when i first came to your lordships house there was no expenses allowance at all <e> <s> indeed the only allowance we received was a travel allowance provided we attended a third of the sittings and if one intended to attend a third of the sittings and one did not there was no refund of the travelling expenses <e> <s> so things have advanced since then <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that part of the expenses of your lordships allowance ought to go to provide the noble lord lord leatherland with a pair of spectacles because i have the third page here and the curious thing is that the third page does not say anything about the expenses which your lordships draw because in fact that does not come into the review undertaken by the noble lord lord boyle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that that cryptic observation will be read with concern by those whose responsibility it is to lay this legislation and of course they are not at present in another place by virtue of the fact that they have left it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall have to write to the noble lord lord aylestone on that <e> <s> it is a matter of detail about which i am not certain <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it must be quite a unique occasion first to <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not dare to intervene as to who required it most or more but i will see that the sentiments of the noble lord lord shinwell on that matter will also be passed to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster but i dare say he would rather that one was not passed on in fact <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord hives for explaining the purpose of his amendment <e> <s> i am bound to say that when i saw that my noble friend was going to seek to amend this bill i could not restrain a slight smile from crossing my face in that my noble friend lord hives was in fact seeking to amend the bees bill <e> <s> i thought it was highly appropriate not only from a nomenclature point of view but also because as my noble friend said he is himself a beekeeper <e>", "<cs> i found my noble friends explanation quite fascinating <e> <s> it is perfectly true that whatever the subject when it comes to your lordships chamber there is always an expert on it and i was delighted to hear my noble friend describe how he has seen <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord wynne-jones may be under a misapprehension <e> <s> what i said was that there is permission to include the method of destruction in an order but we think it right not to include such a method of destruction in an act nor provide for it to be forced into an order for the simple reason that there may arise different circumstances or different diseases requiring different treatment <e> <s> when that happens it is possible to make a new order in which the method of destruction can be included <e>", "<cs> i gather the other two amendments which are to follow this are based on the assumption that my noble friends amendment is not pressed <e> <s> on the assumption that he does not press his amendment i think it would probably be better to leave the arguments as to compensation for what they are to one of the later amendments if that is agreeable to the committee <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to say that the noble baroness is wrong but i think that she is and the reason why is because she has looked at amendment no <e> <s> and has omitted to look at amendment no <e> <s> as well which is the paving amendment to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if she takes amendment no <e> <s> she will see that it will run <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i did not put the amendments down but i think the noble baroness will find that amendments nos <e> <s> and go together which in fact permit payments to be made under subsection but not under sub-sections and <e>", "<cs> i rather fancy that if it was a queen bee which got into the aeroplane followed by all the others the occupants of the aeroplane including the noble lord lord davies of leek would get off fairly sharply <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friends lord lucas of chilworth and lord malmesbury for putting down these amendments <e> <s> i recognise that this is a point about which people feel very strongly and it is a point to which as my noble friend lord lucas said at second reading everyone apart from one person had referred <e>", "<cs> if i may first reply to the question of the noble lord lord kilbracken the answer is that the order would specify that colonies of bees within a certain area of an outbreak would be destroyed and there would be discussion with the industry as to the terms of the order <e> <s> your lordships have made it perfectly clear that you are very keen that some form of compensation should be put into the bill <e>", "<cs> i take that point <e> <s> the noble lord lord wynne-jones said that i was disingenuous <e> <s> he said that i had said that this is a bill introduced by the beekeepers <e> <s> i never said anything of the sort <e> <s> he said that it is not a private bill <e> <s> i never said it was <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that it is a government bill and that the government have introduced it at the behest of the beekeepers <e> <s> we went along and discussed it with them and they said we want to keep the diseases out and we said yes we too want to keep the diseases out <e> <s> there was discussion of the terms of the bill and the government said yes we will give government time to this bill for one reason because there is not going to be an exchequer involvement <e> <s> that is the reason why the government were prepared to give time to what might otherwise have been a private bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord wynne-jones now comes along with everybody else and says because you have introduced the bill let us slide a compensation provision into it <e> <s> this puts a very different complexion on the bill <e> <s> if at the outset there had been a <e>", "<cs> just before my noble friend presses his amendment i wonder whether he will permit me to say this <e> <s> i never said that your lordships were not entitled to move this amendment <e> <s> of course i did not <e> <s> your lordships are entirely entitled to move it <e> <s> what i said was that i did not think it would be very easy for the government to continue a bill which had this kind of thing attached to it <e> <s> if your lordships wish to include it then of course your lordships are entitled to do so <e> <s> the last thing i would do would be to say to my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth no you mustnt do this <e> <s> of course it is up to your lordships what to do <e> <s> however if i may respectfully say so i think that your lordships would be ill advised with the interests of the beekeepers in mind to do this <e>", "<cs> surprise surprise <e> <s> this does not seem to provoke quite so much interest or controversy as the last amendment but i can tell my noble friend that if we were in fact to accept this amendment it would make quite a difference to the bill <e> <s> there may well be circumstances in which bees kept for research purposes or for their genetic characteristics should be dealt with somewhat differently from other bees <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend will find that when this bill becomes an act it will in fact subsume the order which has gone before <e>", "<cs> in view of the decision your lordships took on amendment no <e> <s> i would not object to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand my noble friends point of view the elimination of the surpluses is one of the great problems presenting itself to the common agricultural policy <e> <s> at the moment the view is that if there is a surplus the best thing to do is to eliminate it in order to get back to regularity of supply <e> <s> it is our intention at the moment to press for conditions where surplus food is not produced <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord shinwell misheard <e> <s> probably it was my fault due to bad articulation but it is per cent <e> <s> not per cent <e> <s> which is our contribution to the community budget as a whole of which about per cent <e> <s> goes to the common agricultural policy <e> <s> i think the noble lords question was what do we get for that <e> <s> i can tell him that what we get is a united europe which is trying to find a way to deal with the problems which we recognise as confronting it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is nothing very much between us because precisely the concern which the noble lord lord bruce of donington has expressed is one which is shared by her majestys government that our contribution to the community is at the moment too great <e> <s> i should like to give the noble lord the following information in which he might be interested <e> <s> according to the figures provided by the commission for the dublin summit last year in the net contributions or receipts of member states will be such as will result in the netherlands having the benefit of million france of having million germany having a net deficit of million and we ourselves having a net deficit of million and it is that that we consider is far too great <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point of view of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie which is one that we share <e> <s> it is that when we joined the community we joined it for considerably greater purposes than just the purely fiscal ones <e> <s> but i am bound to tell the noble lord that when we joined the price of oil in the world took off and we are now in a position of contributing sums of money which at that time were never envisaged <e> <s> if my figures are correct i think i can tell the noble lord lord mackie that we are now contributing four times that which was contributed in and that is a figure that was never expected then <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts is entirely right <e> <s> the political opportunities and advantages arising from our membership of the community are enormous and it is our desire also to see that the financial contribution is fair <e> <s> we can do that only through co-operation discussion and agreement with the other eight members of the community and that is what we want to try to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of my noble friends observation and let her know what the position is <e> <s> the difficulty in all these matters is that if you have a surplus and if you have to dispose of it somebody has to pay for it <e> <s> it is easy enough to get rid of it if you do not make any charge but all that does is to increase the sum of money which the community itself has to bear <e>", "<cs> my lords of course our position is that we are a net importer of food and that we are not a contributor to the surplus <e> <s> one of the reasons why my right honourable friend is at the moment placing on record his objection to the proposals of the community is that in milk sugar and butter in regard to which we are not contributors to the surplus we are in fact becoming the hardest hit under the commissions present proposals and that is what we think is unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that negotiation was done by people other than ourselves by the party opposite when they were in power and it may he that they are the ones who ought to answer that question but i think in fairness i would say that in all these negotiations one can negotiate only on the basis of what one believes at the time to be something right for the future <e> <s> when conditions for the future change and they have changed considerably since we have been members of the community then one very often finds that things which are <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an idea which we certainly would consider <e> <s> again the difficulty is that if you give subsidised food within the community all you do is exacerbate the problem of dealing with the surplus <e> <s> but having said that the noble lord will recall that we have in fact a butter subsidy which is per cent <e> <s> subsidised by feoga <e> <s> under the commissions present proposals that subsidy is to go and again we think that that is unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not in fact very easy to give the breakdown of the figures <e> <s> what i will do is give these figures to the noble lord lord robbins which he may find a little difficult to digest at the moment but which he may be able to digest a little later <e> <s> the total provision for expenditure on farm price support in was about million <e> <s> of this some per cent <e> <s> was for export subsidies and a further per cent <e> <s> for various subsidised sales within the community <e> <s> at least per cent <e> <s> therefore could be said to go on disposing of surplus production <e> <s> a further per cent <e> <s> went on purchases into intervention and on storage costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is enough for two questions but i fancy that certainly it is enough for one <e> <s> i hesitated to suggest that your lordships might move on because i thought your lordships might think that i was not wishing to answer any more questions but if you were to think that it might be suitable to move on to the next question perhaps your lordships will be good enough to cease asking me any more <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we might move on <e> <s> it seems hours ago when my noble friend lord dement said that we had spent minutes on the first two questions <e> <s> if one looks at the digital clock we see we spent only four minutes on the second two but i think the digital clock has got stuck <e> <s> while this is a not unimportant issue if <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for those comments <e> <s> he asked about the cash position of the white fish authority <e> <s> in general he is correct <e> <s> in march there was a total surplus of <e> <s> there was a deficit during the year of which left therefore a surplus a balance of <e> <s> during there is likely to be a further deficit of which will in fact create an overall deficit <e> <s> that is the reason why if we do not take action during the year beginning march there will be an overall deficit at the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend that it is highly desirable that we should join the international sugar agreement but at the moment it is very difficult for the community to do this when they are a surplus producer <e> <s> the fact that they are intending to cut down the production of sugar should make that a more likely possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the world price of sugar at the moment is about a tonne <e> <s> three weeks ago it was a tonne <e> <s> the intervention price of eec sugar is a tonne so at the moment the intervention price is very similar to the world price <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no substantive discussion of quota allocations since the commission last tabled proposals in january <e> <s> however as my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food explained in another place on th january the issue is likely to be placed on the agenda of the next fisheries council <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there are two points in my noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> the first is with regard to the factory ships <e> <s> i would merely point out to him that they are not of course catching fish they are processing fish caught by other people and the factory ships represent an important market for our own fisheries catch <e> <s> the second point to which my noble friend draws attention is of course the urgency for getting a common fisheries policy <e> <s> it is perfectly true that we have stopped fishing because our quota has been caught and that other members of the community have not ceased fishing because their quota has not yet been caught <e> <s> the total allowable catch is of course agreed by the commission <e> <s> what are not agreed are the quotas between members as to how that catch should be made up and that is what we wish to see agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly see that my right honourable friend who is responsible for discussing this in the community takes note of my noble friends point <e> <s> all i would tell him is that i in fact have here a list of different catches total allowance catches and they run to four or five pages of different types of fish and different types of areas <e> <s> it is a very complicated process <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend that assurance without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that your lordships have a record of being particularly courteous and that is the reason why very often speeches of noble lords are referred to by ministers who wind up even though the noble lords may not still be in their places <e> <s> i would re-emphasise the noble earls point that those who take part in debate ought to be present to hear the opening speech they should not leave the chamber until after the speaker succeeding them has spoken and they should remain to the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with that but i am not sure what the question was <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> if i may say so members walking in and out of the chamber during maiden speeches is a practice which has been growing <e> <s> a person should not walk in or out of the chamber at this time <e> <s> there is no excuse for not knowing because there is a list of speakers and your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is entirely correct in that <e> <s> indeed if that practice were to be followed i fancy that the list of speakers would be truncated quite a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the occasion to which my noble friend refers because i was here <e> <s> i am bound to say that i was horrified at the total exodus from the chamber <e> <s> this was no reflection on he who was about to make the maiden speech but it must have been peculiarly upsetting and disarming because he may well have thought that it was <e> <s> i think that your lordships if i may say so with respect ought corporately to be a little more careful when maiden speakers are making their speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the exodus takes place when noble lords are about to go out <e> <s> whether it is for their tea or for another purpose i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that supplementaries should not be read <e> <s> i did refer to supplementaries both the questions and the answers which i thought on the whole including my own were too long <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is quite right to draw attention to that because the purpose of debate is in order to hear and to take part <e> <s> it is not supposed to be only for those who are taking part <e> <s> again it is something we ought to attend to corporately <e> <s> we should as partakers of what goes on in the chamber be prepared to be here and listen even though we are not taking part <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be something for the procedure committee to do if that was considered desirable <e> <s> my own view is that it would be very difficult to limit speeches <e> <s> we have the clocks which are supposed to help <e> <s> i know that my noble friend the government chief whip did suggest on one occasion that it might be appropriate to put a cuckoo in the clock so that whenever the minutes appeared there was an appropriate birdlike noise which might interrupt the speaker <e> <s> but i think it would be difficult to restrict noble lords to minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord lord davies of leek is quite right <e> <s> it is the presentation of it that is important because however important it is for noble lords to go to other meetings it is equally important that they should not imply discourtesy to a maiden speaker <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the farm capital grant variation scheme which was laid before this house on st january be approved <e> <s> i think that it might be for the convenience of the house if we took at the same time the horticulture capital grant variation scheme which was also laid before the house on st january <e> <s> these two schemes are subject to affirmative resolution by your lordships <e> <s> but i should like to refer also to the farm and horticulture development amendment regulations which were laid at the same time but which strictly speaking do not require debate as they are subject to the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> but they all form part of the same proposals which represent the first step towards a new simplified scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the observations which noble lords have made upon these orders and i am grateful for the basic welcome of your lordships <e> <s> i must say that i thought the noble lord lord bruce of donington was stretching the point a little bit far <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with my noble friend <e> <s> i did not hear the report to which he has referred but i can tell him this it is our intention to persuade our community partners not to allow subsidised food to go for export <e> <s> however in the event of our not being able to persuade them in that way this country would be in breach of its arrangements with the european community if we were to act unilaterally <e> <s> however if i may tell my noble friend this he may well be aware of it already there was so much concern within the european parliament that the european parliament not only threw out the budget but also passed a resolution in which they said they might retrospectively prevent the subsidy money being forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely the reason why our partners in the european community want to export these surpluses <e> <s> our only complaint is that it is wrong to send them to russia <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is to be an export to russia of subsidised butter and if subsidies are permitted then it is not within our choice to prevent that butter going to russia <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is this any butter which goes into intervention is community butter irrespective of the country in which it is held in intervention <e> <s> the commission have recently changed the system and individual tenders now have to be made for individual consignments of butter <e> <s> this did not happen before and the proposals for the special sales of butter to russia are in suspense for about two weeks because of the resolution which was passed by the european parliament to which i referred a few minutes ago <e> <s> within that general framework the governments sympathies are entirely with the view of the noble viscount lord st davids and <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of questions in that <e> <s> first may i say to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts over the subsidy to the british housewife that is perfectly true but it merely exacerbates the problem because if there is a surplus within the community however desirable it may be to subsidise the housewife the real problem is to get rid of the surplus <e> <s> the second point is whether the new system will change the rate of subsidy <e> <s> i am bound to tell the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts that it will not change the rate but it will give the management committee those are the people who authorise these sales a chance to consider each tender and to vote on the tender <e> <s> on every occasion the united kingdom has voted against sales to russia <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we are bringing every pressure we can to bear upon the commission to prevent these sales <e> <s> but as the house will appreciate in the end we are part of the community and it is a community decision <e> <s> my right honourable friend the lord privy seal my noble friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs and my right honourable friend the minister <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly true my lords it was <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that one of our great complaints at the moment is that the commission is proposing that the per cent <e> <s> subsidy which we got on butter from feoga should stop <e> <s> this is something from which britain has benefited <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is certainly a point of view which should be looked at and so far as possible pursued <e> <s> but in the end of course the food has to be paid for somehow by somebody and if we have a surplus the main thing to do is to get rid of that surplus <e> <s> i would only repeat and re-emphasise if there are noble lords who are concerned that we as part of the community should be exporting butter to a country which has been involved in afghanistan in the way in which it has that this government are equally concerned and we are also concerned to try to stop it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to follow the thread of the noble lord lord wigg <e> <s> i cannot see that there is any reason for suggesting that the government are in an utter muddle <e>", "<cs> of course they are not <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord we are part of the community and we are trying to encourage the community to take the right action and not what we believe to be the wrong action <e> <s> that is not muddle <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the remark which mr silkin made over the week-end in which he was quoted as saying damn the common market would not meet with the accord of the present government <e> <s> that is not our view <e> <s> our view and i agree with the noble lord lord brown is to try to restrict the products which are in structural surplus and to that end we are content to see those prices not increased <e> <s> what we are not content to see is the proposals of the common market acting unfairly against the united kingdom as opposed to other members of the community and under their present proposals that is what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords the five advisers have principally been considering the potential for improved marketing in bacon potatoes milk and apples <e> <s> they have also been looking at co-operation policy and export promotion <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food has already acted on their advice on co-operation <e> <s> changes are being made in the organisation of the central council for agricultural and horticultural co-operation and in the emphasis of its work <e> <s> they will continue to advise my right honourable friend in the course of the work which they are undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there has not been any publication nor indeed is it anticipated that there will be <e> <s> these are five individual people whom the minister has asked to look into various sectors of marketing and to advise him in such a way as they think fit <e> <s> their remit is very wide <e> <s> they can look into something individually or collectively or as a group of two or three <e> <s> they may publish their advice if they wish but they are not obliged to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will consider anything which the noble lord lord peart suggests <e> <s> but the distinction is that this is not something which they have been asked to do which has a finite end to it <e> <s> they are investigating the possibilities of marketing throughout quite a range of products over quite a period of time <e> <s> of course there will be many points which they raise which they will wish to be discussed and we have no intention of inhibiting such discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite see my noble friends concern <e> <s> i think that there is a slight difficulty in her mind and i should like to try to simplify it for her <e> <s> these five marketeers have been appointed by the minister to give him such advice as they think fit and if they wish to publish it to do so <e> <s> there is no question of my right honourable friend taking decisions upon their advice without having first consulted the people concerned <e> <s> of course there will be consultation but they are not a council which will periodically issue reports <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not really a quango <e> <s> however i can tell my noble friend that apart from the secretariats cost of three full-time officers who have been seconded from the ministry the cost to date to rd march has been <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend either is being mischievous or is hard of hearing <e> <s> i did not say that they were going to encourage any kind of marketing <e> <s> what i said they are doing is that they are trying to look into marketing in order to advise my right honourable friends on the measures that ought to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e> <s> the purpose is to give effect to the secretarial allowance for ministers and other office holders in your lordships house which was announced in the statement which my right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster made on th february and which i repeated here <e> <s> the new allowance of up to per annum is available only to ministers and other office-holders in your lordships house and is towards the cost of secretarial <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the concern which the noble lord lord wells-pestell has expressed <e> <s> the best way in which i can explain this to him is as follows <e> <s> the expenses allowance which at the moment is allowed consists of which is tax-free and the rest which is taxable <e> <s> however that is the subject of a separate claim and has to be claimed as an expense <e> <s> under this system it will be possible to claim not but and it is not impossible that if these are justifiable expenses accompanied by vouchers there would be a larger amount which would be free of tax <e> <s> but that is of course a matter for negotiations with the treasury <e> <s> however the allowance to which the noble lord refers is the subject of a special allowance claim and is not part of the salary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to know what people claim on their allowance forms <e> <s> in fact that which is claimed should be claimed because of expenses undertaken <e> <s> but i certainly take the noble lords point and if he is concerned about it and wishes to discuss it further i should be quite happy to discuss it with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i would not dispute that at all but from the noise that was emanating it was not at all clear what was being expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of a tenant of publicly-owned land is exactly the same as that of a tenant of privately-owned land <e> <s> he is in the market to purchase that land at the prevailing price <e> <s> it so happens that the price of land for a ministry tenant is higher than if it were sold on the open market as let land <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had quite a lot of supplementary questions on this and although i know my noble friend would be delighted to carry on answering them in view of the fact that we have other business i wonder whether it may be considered appropriate to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said i had not answered his question <e> <s> with the greatest of respect to him i did answer it <e> <s> his question was hypothetical <e> <s> he asked what do the government intend to do with people who <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position on this was made perfectly clear by my honourable friend the minister of sport when he wrote on th january to the chairman of the tours committee giving the governments view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry the noble baroness has not succeeded <e> <s> i suppose it can be said that the government have not succeeded either because what the government have done is to explain to these people that we think this is wrong and so far as government employees are concerned we have said that if they go they can go under their own steam or they can take annual leave but they will not go on paid leave <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the arrangements were that we were going to finish the report stage of the bill this evening and that is what we anticipate doing <e>", "<cs> of course this is very much a matter for the house is it not my lords <e> <s> one cannot control exactly how long noble lords speak but i think your lordships will realise that some noble lords have spoken more than once and we have had odd divisions called by mistake all of which has taken up time and i do not think that that can fall to the blame of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is a question of how much time the government have allowed for it <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell knows perfectly well that we have allowed reasonable time <e> <s> of course the business of any government can be frustrated if noble lords talk at length <e> <s> everyone knows perfectly well that if one talks <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect my lords i am not suggesting that we have talked at inordinate length <e> <s> all i am saying is that if noble lords do talk at inordinate length then the business of any government will be frustrated <e> <s> what i would suggest to the noble lord is that we have made reasonable progress and i am sure that if we can go on for a short while longer that progress will be brought to fruition <e> <s> but i really do not think it would be reasonable to suggest that we should stop at the moment <e>", "<cs> it is interesting my lords that among others the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe should say hear hear that she finds it disagreeable to have direct taxes lowered <e> <s> that will make a very interesting fact <e> <s> but it is not easy to control bureaucracy <e> <s> it feeds on itself and if one is not careful promotes itself <e> <s> yet despite that we have managed to secure a drop in the number of civil servants from when we took office to in january of this year whereas the previous administration had planned not to decrease the number but to increase it up to by april of this year <e> <s> is that reduction something for which we should be condemned <e>", "<cs> well that is fine but it is a pity that the noble lord did not manage to get some other things straighter <e> <s> the noble lords government had this deliberate policy <e> <s> what happened to the cost of food which he was trying to protect <e> <s> it went up by per cent <e> <s> and farm incomes fell in real terms by per cent <e> <s> we thought it intolerable to deny british farmers the same price as other european farmers and we undertook to devalue the green pound during the lifetime of a parliament <e> <s> in fact we achieved this within nine months <e> <s> there is nothing in that to be censured about <e>", "<cs> well my lords i find it very odd that the noble lord thinks that that is funny <e> <s> what did he expect the government to do <e> <s> to get involved <e> <s> throughout the dispute people asked what are the government going to do <e> <s> as if by some magic wand the government could alter or resolve a situation which was not theirs <e> <s> too often in the past people have turned to governments of all political complexions and asked and even demanded that the government should solve problems which are not the responsibility of the government <e> <s> too often solutions have been sought and made in a glare of publicity in downing street <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fundamental fact of this governments approach to life that individual taxation was too high <e> <s> of course that is the case and that is why we have lowered it <e> <s> other taxes may have to go up but the reason for any rise goes back to the borrowings of the labour government during their term of office <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that the noble lord lord jacques was asked a question at the end of his speech <e> <s> this is not a committee stage and i think that it would be right for the noble lord lord harris of high cross to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend the figures at the moment but i will write to him to let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to go off on a tangent but i would say that there is no reason why we should not have plenty of english cheeses provided <e>", "<cs> my lords i like caerphilly very much <e> <s> if the noble lord would care to give me some i should be delighted to remind myself of its delicate flavour <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the latter figure to which the noble lord referred is somewhat high <e> <s> my under <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the force of that argument but of course inevitably the defence estimates themselves cover a whole wide range of subjects and i do not think that it is very easy to restrict such a wide range to a relatively narrow debate particularly if that will be a question of having two debates <e> <s> i appreciate the problem of my noble friend but i do not think that there is any reasonable way of getting round it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not quite clear what the noble lord lord shinwell meant when he said that he wished to widen the range of debates i thought what he was saying was that he wished to narrow the range of debates <e> <s> the noble lord said that people roam rather wide i think that that requires a discipline which noble lords who take part in debates of this nature must place upon themselves <e> <s> the noble lord also said that in another place they have debates on separate subjects <e> <s> of course under the unstarred question procedure we have the ability to have debates on specific subjects <e> <s> i would simply draw the noble lords attention to the fact that on th march the house had the opportunity of a whole days debate on home and civil defence we also have the annual army air force and naval discipline continuation order which gives the house an opportunity to discuss matters obtaining to that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter which could certainly be discussed through the usual channels but at the moment i cannot see the likelihood of a two-day debate being particularly helpful unless more than the normal number of speakers wish to take part <e> <s> were that to be the case we should certainly consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to underestimate the importance of the subject of defence <e> <s> indeed if there is the requirement to spend more than one day on defence then we would certainly consider this <e> <s> i would only put this to the noble lord <e> <s> as i understand my noble friends question he wanted to concentrate peoples minds on various aspects of defence <e> <s> if we accepted lord shinwells suggestion by having a two-day debate on defence i fancy that that would merely diffuse the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends of course on what my noble friend wants as a result of a debate <e> <s> if he wishes to air his views then an unstarred question on a particular subject is an excellent way of airing particular views <e> <s> i would remind him that the particular subject under discussion is the question of the defence estimates <e> <s> in other words it is the government producing an opportunity for people to discuss a government document as a whole <e> <s> i should have thought that it is very difficult to separate the contemplation of the document as a whole into small different aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course would be perfectly possible but i would remind the noble lord lord gladwyn that the only purpose of a two-day debate is if there are so many speakers that you cannot accommodate them all on one day <e> <s> the point i would draw to your lordships attention is that if you separate the debate into two different parts on one day you will inevitably have the problem of peers who say they want to speak early because they have to leave early and they will then be introducing into the first part of the debate matters which would necessarily happen in the second part <e> <s> you would then have the problem of peers who wish to make maiden speeches when the convention is that they will come early in the debate and they would have to make a speech possibly on a subject which would more properly be kept to the latter part of the debate <e> <s> there are difficulties here <e> <s> i shall certainly consider the views of the house <e> <s> if the noble lord lord shinwell asks will i consider it again <e> <s> of course i will <e> <s> but i would merely remind him that the problems are not quite as easy as might appear when the question was put down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord peart a for agreeing with me and b for elevating me to the level of lord privy seal which was the first i knew about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still wondering from lord davies of leeks question who are those who are not the intelligent members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord may provided that it is in the form of a question <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is certainly a possibility <e> <s> i am bound to say that the idea of it simply horrifies me because i can imagine no better way of muddling the whole debate than by having about three amendments to one simple question <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of your lordships if i now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the two noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> if the noble lord lord peart was a little disappointed at this statement i would merely repeat the words he used when he said that nothing had happened and it was a most remarkable meeting <e> <s> i think if my right honourable friend were here he would say the noble lord was quite right <e> <s> this was a very frustrating meeting <e> <s> the noble lord knows perfectly well that trying to get a consensus of agreement over eec prices is one of the most difficult things imaginable <e> <s> we wish to sec those agreements made as soon as possible <e> <s> it was a very long meeting i think i am right in saying that my noble friend left at three oclock this morning to come hack to london <e> <s> the fact is that there was no agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i apologise for misrepresenting the noble lord i thought i recalled him using that word <e> <s> i would merely stress that my right honourable friend of all the common market ministers is the one who is determined to say that there should he no <e>", "<cs> my lords the final result of the negotiations will be one which must accord with the agreements arranged with the ministers <e> <s> i have explained that the line which our minister has taken is that there should be no such increase <e> <s> as regards the press reports it is of course evident that the french would have liked a cut and dried paper on common agricultural prices to go before the european council on the basis of which the european council could then take decisions <e> <s> but in the agricultural council it was clear that there were substantive differences of opinion on many issues between almost all member states and not just between france and the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to your lordships for having welcomed this order <e> <s> i would assure the noble lord lord peart first of all that the apple and pear development council is not a quango as such because of course it is not financed by the government <e> <s> it is financed wholly by the growers and it does do an excellent job of work <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say if the noble lord had not been quite so sharp on his feet that many people say that we must do something about golden delicious imports whether that is restricting them or whether it is ensuring fair competition <e> <s> all i would say to the noble lord is that in all that we have discovered and looked into and we have done a great deal about this there is no unfair competition between imported golden delicious and our own in so far as we can find no evidence that the french government are doing anything contrary to the community rules as such <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer is that if the noble lord puts down a question i shall answer it <e> <s> but whether i could give him the answer which he requires is another matter because of course all that i can do is to say what the british government do <e> <s> i am not in a position to answer for what the french government the dutch government or any other government do nor would i be in a position necessarily to ferret out if one may use that word the kind of points which the noble lord suggests which i think are an indication that the french government are doing something which is not really quite right <e> <s> we have no indication at all that they are doing anything which is not fair just or permitted under the eec rules <e> <s> they may give various subsidies but they are perfectly entitled to do that and it would be unreasonable i think for the noble lord to say that because the french the dutch or the germans give a certain subsidy therefore we should have to match that subsidy pound for pound ourselves <e> <s> we try to support our industry in the best way that we can and we think that the way in which we do that is the best way for our purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that many people are concerned as to the protection which is given by the fishery protection vessels but i would let my noble friend know that during there were no fewer than boardings at sea to inspect the vessels which were there and as a result of that foreign vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords any kind of illegal fishing is disturbing <e> <s> all i can tell the noble lord lord boothby is that our fishery protection vessels are vigilant and they have during the course of the current year prosecuted foreign vessels <e> <s> of course there are some vessels of other countries which may invade our waters and deposit their catch elsewhere in which case that is the responsibility for the other countries provided that we look after our own territorial waters which i have explained that we have tried to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise the apprehension to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they do <e> <s> the five royal naval island class vessels to which i referred are built for offshore protection which refers to both fish and oil <e>", "<cs> my lords we use a number of different machines <e> <s> i do not think we use the ones to which my noble friend has referred but i shall certainly take note of his suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that the noble baroness had purchased a packet of weedol but i am grateful to her for the information <e> <s> she is perfectly correct in saying that paraquat is a poison but weedol is not a <e>", "<cs> my lords i perceive my noble friends apprehension <e> <s> i would merely tell him that what is a scheduled poison and what is not is decided by the home secretary on the advice of the poisons board and the poisons board specifically excluded weedol because it is in a granulated form and because as such it is undrinkable and unpalatable <e> <s> i will certainly look into the point made by my noble friend but i would reassure him that there are instructions on the packet which indicate how it ought to be handled and obviously any chemical if it is handled wrongly can cause harm <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly see that the observations made by the noble baroness are drawn to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of your lordships i should like to repeat a statement which is being made by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the two noble lords for the welcome which they have given to this statement <e> <s> i would be the first to recognise the duty which the noble lord lord peart did when he succeeded <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> i am unable to give him the information which he has requested which is a matter of very considerable detail <e> <s> but i shall see whether i can obtain it for him and i will write to him about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls felt that i had in any way obscured the facts by giving too much detail <e> <s> all i would tell him is that if i gave him too much detail it was merely a tiny fraction of that which was given to me <e> <s> i totally agree with him that we should not permit the details to obscure the facts and also <e>", "<cs> my lords i am gratefull i think to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for his observations <e> <s> he asked some penetrating questions and i am grateful to him for his appreciation of the statement <e> <s> he asked how the statement had resolved the problem of surpluses within the community <e> <s> he will know better than i know as he was a minister himself that one cannot resolve problems like that overnight one can only make a gradual contribution towards doing so <e> <s> i would point out one significant fact to him and that is that under the sheep regime there was a near total confrontation <e> <s> that has been avoided and one of the ways in which it has been avoided has been the principle of what we used to regard as deficiency payments which has enabled meat not to go into intervention and then to be sold to third countries probably with an eec subsidy but has retained the meat within the countries of the community to be consumed as fresh meat <e> <s> i believe that that is a major contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords those are fairly harsh words and i would not go all the way with the noble lord lord bruce of donington on that but of course i accept that where large sums of money are being spent on putting good food into intervention that seems to be wrong <e> <s> we want to see that stopped we want to see a change but one does not just make a change overnight <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce knows that full well <e> <s> where there are nine other countries to take into account these things cannot be done either successfully or effectively if over night one set of traditions is swept away and replaced with another set <e> <s> but i take his point entirely and of course we are just as worried as he is that so much money is spent on putting good food into store <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will now repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence in answer to a private notice question <e> <s> if i might do so i should like to apologise to noble lords on the opposition and liberal benches for the fact that they did not get copies of this statement earlier than they did <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for the way they have received this statement which i can well understand causes them and others concern because of what might have happened <e> <s> perhaps i can put your lordships anxieties at rest by saying that when the noble lord lord peart says there is great disquiet over this sort of thing it is absolutely understandable but in fact this was caused by a malfunction of the computer <e> <s> the noble lord lord gladwyn asked whether the wrong information was put into the computer <e> <s> the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble and learned lord that there are in fact a number of steps which would verify the cause of any such decision <e> <s> in fact when an alert comes about certain automatic measures are taken which may include aeroplanes going into the air <e> <s> that does not mean they will be despatched to their targets <e> <s> any action of that nature will be taken only as a result of a final decision but the immediate result of an alert like this is that immediate actions are taken some of which may include aeroplanes being put into the air <e> <s> however that is a normal defensive action it is not an offensive action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord shinwell <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the general welcome that they have given to the statement <e> <s> these matters are always complicated and it is not easy to understand the details but i shall do my best to elucidate some of the points to which the noble lord lord peart and the noble viscount lord thurso referred <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord peart spoke of scotland <e> <s> he mentioned that we have had a debate on fisheries and said that he was concerned about hull and grimsby and about how they had suffered from problems affecting the fishing industry <e> <s> the same point was mentioned by the noble viscount lord thurso who also referred to the effect that these problems have on local communities <e> <s> the government are fully aware of the real problem which the fishing industry has faced and we are determined to try to secure a satisfactory common fisheries policy of a kind that will adequately reflect the needs of the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> that is what we have been striving for over the past several months <e> <s> we shall continue to strive for it and i hope that there will be a satisfactory conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross says that the mere mention of the words common fisheries policy makes scottish fishermen shudder <e> <s> all i can tell him is that it makes me shudder too because it is a very compli <e>", "<cs> we indeed have sophisticated equipment to monitor catches but of course the total allowable catch is agreed <e> <s> what is not agreed is how that is going to be split up between the nations <e> <s> then the noble lord asked whether i will give an assurance that we will not be blackmailed <e> <s> indeed i can give him the assurance that we intend to do everything possible to see that the common fisheries policy is such as will meet the requirements of our fishing industry <e> <s> clearly there has to be change and the noble lord would be the first to accept that but when he asks whether we will show as much chauvenism as the french have shown over how they deal with our sheepmeat i am sure he would be the first to understand that it would not be appropriate for us to indulge in breaking community law even if others do <e> <s> but within the community law we will do our best to see that the fishing industry is given the best possible opportunity to reorganise itself for the requirements of the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that my noble friend is absolutely right when she says that many people in the south-west depend upon the fishing and that like their colleagues in scotland they are worried about the fishing situation <e> <s> but i would tell her this <e> <s> the appearance of factory ships of itself is not wrong <e> <s> we in this country are permitted certain quotas of catch and it is our business as a country to ensure that those catches are not exceeded <e> <s> having caught the fish then the fact that they are sold to factory ships is in fact an outlet which very often enhances the value of the fish and therefore is not necessarily a drawback <e> <s> if my noble friend lady hornsby-smith says that these factory ships then go out and themselves catch within our waters then of course that is a very serious matter and if she has any evidence of that i should be grateful if she would send it to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can reassure the noble lord lord boothby on the last of his supplementary questions which is that the solution of the common fisheries policy is one which must be found on its own account and it will not be part of barter over any other aspect of the community least of all the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the problems which we are trying to overcome by the solution of the common fisheries policy <e> <s> it is our desire to see and in this we are in agreement with all the other members of the community that there is a fair and proper allocation of fisheries within the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the original problem arose when the fisheries limits were extended universally to miles <e> <s> as a result of that in in third countries we used to be able to catch tonnes of fish and now our quota from third countries is less than tonnes <e> <s> therefore in that respect the noble lord is quite right there has been a severe curtailment of the deep-sea fishing industry <e> <s> i go along with him in understanding the concern which is felt in the western parts of the united kingdom but i can only tell him that that is not solely the result of the common fisheries policy <e> <s> however we are trying to achieve a fair settlement which will benefit the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree per cent <e> <s> wholeheartedly with the noble lord i would go along with him to about per cent <e> <s> whole-heartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the point to which my noble friend refers but i shall certainly look into it and let him know <e>", "<cs> no my lords i regret that i cannot do that because it would require a change in the law in order for that to be done <e> <s> i am aware that the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals has issued statements of its views <e> <s> they are entirely entitled to hold what views they wish <e> <s> parliament has discussed this matter on a number of occasions but the debate has always been inconclusive and as a result of that it has been decided by parliament that these exemptions should be made for the killing of these animals on religious grounds and for religious convictions <e> <s> that is the law as it stands and must remain so until parliament decides to change it <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the noble lord lord janner asks me to be a postbox for his views to the noble lord lord dunleath i am happy to undertake that facility <e> <s> what i would say to the house is this <e> <s> i realise that people have many views on this <e> <s> but this is a religious matter <e> <s> parliament has always taken account of peoples religious feelings and that is the reason why the situation is as it is <e> <s> i would tell the noble lord lord dunleath that my right honourable friend announced on th december that the terms of reference of the farm animal welfare council have been extended to include welfare at the places of slaughter and i understand <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a possibility in so far as co <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the situation as it is is that these animals have to be slaughtered by a method which has to be approved by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> oddly enough my lords i was aware of what motivated the noble lord to ask the question <e> <s> i can tell him that in the consideration of any pesticide as with any chemical such as a medicine or a veterinary medicine it is essential that the result should be scientific unbiased and impartial and should also be clinical <e> <s> that is what the advisory committee on pesticides does <e> <s> as the noble lord said the advisory committee does not include any representatives of the national union of agricultural and allied workers and indeed i think that it would he wrong if it did <e> <s> however the health and safety executive is involved in it in so far as three members are on the advisory committee and one member is on the technical secretariat of the pesticides safety precaution scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hale is perfectly correct the last report of the advisory committee was in march <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture has asked the committee again to consider all the evidence including the evidence of the national union of agricultural and allied workers where it is concerned <e> <s> the committee is doing this at the moment and it will make a report when it has concluded its investigations <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i wish to add that in this scientific area in which there is much concern felt by people whether we accept or reject a product it is absolutely essential that the decision be made on scientific grounds not on grounds based on opinion or concern no matter how strong they may be <e>", "<cs> my lords we are entirely aware of the fact that in this country we must decide matters on their merits <e> <s> all i can tell the noble lord is that all these matters are being considered <e> <s> we have asked the advisory committee to consider all the evidence yet again and i suggest that it would be quite inappropriate that the government should accept or reject a particular product simply because there is what one might describe as understandable emotion building up about it <e> <s> the matter must be decided on scientific grounds and that is what we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the advisory committee deals with all pesticides as opposed merely to pests <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord davies of leek said that my noble friend lord bellwin was a kindly minister who listened to everything that was said <e> <s> he is right he does <e> <s> unfortunately it falls to me to answer the noble lord and i assure him that i am not nearly so kindly as my noble friend lord bellwin but that i have tried to listen to every word that has been said <e> <s> i would say this <e> <s> i find that to all the contributions which have been made so far it is impossible to take exception because the main points made are that allotments are vitally essential to the well-being of the country and to the production of food are essential for leisure and form a centre piece of our society <e>", "<cs> any money which is raised by the sale of allotment lands which has to have the approval of the secretary of state then has to go towards paying off any liabilities which the local authority <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may say this to the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i find it very difficult to answer some of the points he has made because it is rather like a person talking in one language and having a reply in another language <e> <s> he said that he was concerned to see that there is proper production from allotments that people are requiring allotments and that there is not enough provision of allotments <e> <s> all that i agree with but with the greatest respect to the noble lord that has nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> all that the amendment does is to remove the secretary of states powers in schedule <e> <s> all the points to which the noble lord lord avebury referred are still being kept <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> i think that was last done in about <e> <s> it has not been done since then because people thought that they had better get on with fighting the war as opposed to giving reports to parliament about the situation of our allotments <e>", "<cs> i know that the war is over and that we are years ahead <e> <s> but i do not see the advantage in the secretary of state giving reports to parliament particularly when that has not been done <e> <s> of course if the noble lord and the party he represents like to go back years that is for them but i cannot suggest that that would be a suitable course of action to take <e> <s> one of the reasons why this is being repealed is simply that it is not being done now <e>", "<cs> that of course is a matter for the local authority <e> <s> once having sold some land if a local authority under the acts to which i have referred consider that there is a requirement for more land and they desire to buy it they can do so <e> <s> they can spend their money as for any other purpose <e> <s> that is a matter for the local authority <e>", "<cs> try a little harder <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wallace of coslany is remarkably conciliatory and i appreciate that very much <e>", "<cs> if i may make a personal observation i think the noble lord was very misguided to do such a stupid thing on his holidays <e> <s> there was no point in going on holiday he could have sat here <e> <s> i am not so dumb as the noble lord thinks because i realise that the purpose of his amendment is to persuade the government to come along and produce this amending legislation but i cannot do more than i told him before and i would correct him in regard to one thing <e> <s> he said that the government had promised to bring in amending legislation <e> <s> what the government said was that they would consider it <e> <s> of course we will consider it and we will carry on considering it <e>", "<cs> it occurs to me that if this amendment has come about as a result of the noble lords fortnights holiday in malta i hope he will be able to have a more refreshing holiday next time because i can assure him that it would be a great pity to accept this amendment and delay this alteration <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for the way in which she so succinctly deployed a very persuasive case <e> <s> as my noble friend lord sandford has said he was speaking from the same brief as the noble baroness and therefore it is not surprising that they concurred <e> <s> my problem is that i have a different brief and i shall do my best to explain to your lordships why i believe that my brief possibly has the edge on theirs however excellent theirs may be <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble baroness is that very often orders can be made when people do not realise that they will be affected <e> <s> when a local authority knows that if it makes an order it must have the approval of the minister even though per cent <e> <s> of such orders may be unopposed that makes the local authority certain that what it is doing is correct and proper and will have the scrutiny of the minister <e> <s> it also means that those people who may be affected but who do not know that they may be affected will know that it will have the scrutiny of the minister <e> <s> one can foresee problems whereby local authorities could make orders and if they knew that they would not have the scrutiny of the minister they may possibly find it a little <e>", "<cs> the minister is of course an unaffected third party who can see the position dispassionately <e> <s> the local authority is of course an interested party and that is the reason why it is desirable to have somebody who is totally disconnected with the matter <e>", "<cs> by all means i am quite happy to do that <e>", "<cs> i would find it very difficult indeed rather disagreeable to disagree with my noble friend lord ridley in this fairly substantial amendment which he has put forward because it has the effect of restoring parts of the no <e> <s> bill which originally started in your lordships house <e> <s> the proposed schedule would implement some of the proposals in the governments white paper which was published in september last year and it would reduce bureaucracy and extend local authority discretion <e>", "<cs> if this amendment were accepted it would remove the default powers from ministers under the food and drugs act <e> <s> it is the objective of the government to lessen ministerial control over local authorities but it is not the intention of the government in this bill to remove or repeal the default powers of the minister <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which your lordships considered earlier and which was accepted makes it clear in clause that what is being repealed in schedule is the power to give local authorities general directions and the power to require local authorities to make certain byelaws <e> <s> the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lord mottistone that grit dust and arrestment are very complicated parts of the bill and i confess that most of us were not familiar with them until we came across the bill <e> <s> i am glad that as my noble friend lord sandford moves round in a sort of paul jones on these amendments he should find himself on this occasion allied with me <e> <s> i assure him that is a good stance for him to be in and i suggest he repeats it throughout the remainder of the bill <e>", "<cs> paragraph of schedule relaxes the secretary of states regulation-making powers in connection with the condition and the use of receptacles for controlled waste <e> <s> instead the collection authorities will be able to serve a notice requiring the occupiers of premises to take action in respect of any of the matters that were to have been covered by those regulations <e> <s> i do not anticipate that there will be many or indeed any unreasonable requirements imposed by collection authorities when they serve notices <e> <s> but i fully accept that the occupiers right <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to my noble friend i had hoped he would not be too quick in withdrawing his amendment because i have just said i accepted it <e> <s> what i said was that in addition to that we would put down some other amendments to make the totality workable <e> <s> i would merely chide my noble friend lord sandford in this respect he said he was speaking on behalf of the association of district councils <e> <s> i would remind him that of course he speaks entirely for himself and that not even the noble lord lord sandford speaks on behalf of anybody even though he may have a brief for the association of district councils <e>", "<cs> we have moved with astonishing rapidity from grit arrestment to dustbin control <e> <s> i welcome my noble friends general thesis of trying to reduce bureaucracy but this amendment would remove the duty on a collection authority to consult and secure the consent of the highway authority to its intention to serve a notice under section of the control of pollution act requiring the placing of a receptacle on the public highway <e>", "<cs> it is perfectly true that he can pick up the telephone and no doubt he will do so <e> <s> the only purpose of this is to say that where there is a conflict of interest between two local authorities it would be right that they should be consulted <e> <s> that is all this seeks to do <e>", "<cs> under section of the public health act a local authority can make bye-laws enabling the authority to serve a notice requiring the occupier of premises to place his house <e>", "<cs> i would be delighted to help the noble lord lord avebury in any way i can but i fear that the noble lords powers of concentration must have slipped somewhat <e> <s> i did give a certain explanation as to why he accepted this <e> <s> i explained when amendment no <e> <s> was first introduced that the amendment had the effect of restoring parts of the no <e> <s> bill which relaxes ministerial controls and highway regulation matters <e> <s> they were omitted from the present bill because of the pressure of time <e> <s> they implemented proposals in the governments white paper <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to achieve the purpose of the noble baronesss earlier proposed new clause which is to abolish completely the surcharge on unoccupied commercial property <e> <s> as i said during the discussion on that amendment we believe that it is better to leave the secretary of state with a power to revive the surcharge if in the light of changing economic circumstances this seems desirable <e> <s> for example if there were a recurrence of the property boom with a lot of speculation in empty office property the surcharge might have a part to play <e> <s> with regard to the other amendments to which the noble lord spoke at the same time i am bound to tell him that it is the governments intention to use the order-making power in the sub-paragraph which his amendment seeks to delete to reduce at the earliest opportunity the maximum level of empty property rate which may be levied to per cent <e> <s> of ordinary rates on business premises <e>", "<cs> i absolutely understand the reasons which concern the noble lord lord monson and i think that anyone would have a great deal of sympathy with what he has said <e> <s> but he will appreciate that the government recently published a report on the vacant property survey which provides certain information on the amount and the condition of vacant property in england <e> <s> this report found that a considerable number of properties were empty because private owners had been deterred at least in part from reletting by the effects of the rent acts and in our housing act this session we have introduced a number of initiatives most notably the provision for shorthold tenancies in order to encourage such people to bring their vacant accommodation back into use <e> <s> the survey also found that per cent <e> <s> of empty properties were built before and our proposals for promoting home-ownership at low cost such as the support lending scheme and statutory backing for schemes such as the glc homesteading one will we think make it easier for owners of older property to find purchasers <e> <s> prospective buyers of properties in poor condition will also be helped by our proposals in the housing act to make the house renovation grant scheme more attractive and flexible <e>", "<cs> i can understand my noble friends desire to see empty property totally derated <e> <s> it is almost the same argument as the noble lord lord monson had earlier about derating domestic property <e> <s> there are three strong arguments against this <e> <s> first to remove the requirement for owners of <e>", "<cs> i will deal with this as quickly as i can <e> <s> all i will say to the noble lord lord ponsonby is that there is a severe problem for the organisation of rating panels because the nature of the work is cyclical owing to the revaluation of rates which takes place every so often <e> <s> then there is a great bulge after a general revaluation falling off to a much lower level in between <e> <s> because of the cancellation of the revaluation the workload of the service is currently at a low level and there is no prospect of it picking up significantly in the next two years <e> <s> the panels and the department of the environment are looking for staff saving and economies and in some cases that can be achieved within an individual panel but with a small service and in this service there are only staff in the whole country that is not always possible and in some cases mergers of offices and staff between neighbouring panels can provide a better answer <e>", "<cs> my noble friend wants to remove the rights of a rating authority to be involved with proposals to alter various rates on properties <e> <s> i suppose that rating authorities can add to the delays and costs of valuation proceedings but i am sure it does not happen a great deal <e> <s> i know a few cases where rating authority intervention has been greatly resented by ratepayers and sometimes justly <e> <s> on the other hand there is an <e>", "<cs> my noble friend can certainly bring the matter up at a later stage if he wishes and then he will be able to discover whether the government have reached a conclusion by then but i cannot anticipate that they will have done so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos said he did not wish to dilate at this hour of night on an important subject like this and i would not wish to do so either <e> <s> equally however i would not wish to be so intolerably brief as not to do justice to an important matter and i agree it is a pity that the noble baroness lady emmet of amberley is not here because in your lordships house she has been one of the greatest protagonists for fish farming <e> <s> i have certainly noted the enthusiasm with which everyone has spoken in favour of the amendment <e>", "<cs> is it not the convention that somebody is always supposed to say content or not-content <e> <s> i do not have any particular part to play in this but i should have thought that the lord chairman put the question and nobody in fact said content where as some noble lords said not-content <e>", "<cs> i should have thought it was entirely a matter for the committee <e> <s> the lord chairman was doing his best to put the question and if people answer or do not answer that is of course up to the committee <e> <s> having said that i should have thought that as noble lords are here and if it were the view of the committee that the question be put again that would meet with the approval of your lordships <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend said this is consequential upon earlier amendments and we are happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> as far as i am aware the long title covers all the points which have been made <e> <s> certainly if it does not we shall bring forward further amendments <e> <s> but to my knowledge it covers everything <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry the noble lord did not think that i answered his question but he will realise that his question asked her majestys government what economic justifications there were for allowing the closures and my answer referred to the fact that the closures resulted from the judgment of the commercial enterprises concerned <e> <s> of course we bitterly regret the fact that this has been necessary and i accept entirely the point the noble lord has made about the unemployment this has caused <e> <s> in fact the two pulp mills have been operating in a situation of making losses <e> <s> the government have been in consultation about both the mills at fort william and at ellesmere port to see if there are ways in which they can help <e> <s> suggestions were made to both companies with regard to substantial financial help from the government and in both cases it was their commercial judgment that notwithstanding this offer they would still have to close the plants <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend can give me any factual examples of where there has been dumping then of course we will consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought the noble lord said monetary policy that is why there was a little confusion <e> <s> there will be a statement on the governments forestry policy <e> <s> it was hoped that this would have been made a little earlier than it will be i can tell the noble lord that it will be made some time in the future but i cannot be precise about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that per cent <e> <s> of that which went to fort william has now gone on contract abroad and i have no doubt that the forestry commission will be in consultations about getting rid of the wood that used to go to ellesmere port <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord exactly where the output of the welsh forests will go <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will certainly look into that and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with my noble friend that the high cost of energy is one significant point <e> <s> of course the scandinavians have cheap hydro-electric power which is not available to the united kingdom <e> <s> there are two other factors <e> <s> there is the high level of sterling which makes imports competitive and the third factor is the fact that newsprint is internationally traded in dollars and of course the situation is also affected by the fact that the wood from which that is made in north america is about half the price of the wood which is available in this country <e> <s> when wood comes in at that price it is very difficult to make ends meet when you have a high pound <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i do with the greatest respect disagree entirely with the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> there is one fundamental flaw in what he says <e> <s> he knows as i have tried to explain that for reasons of world recession and world competition these mills have been operating at a loss <e> <s> two things can be done <e> <s> either the commercial effects have to be taken into account and the mills closed and that is a matter for the commercial judgment of the owners or the government can subsidise them and carry the losses which private industry is not prepared to carry <e> <s> the noble lord lord paget may think that that is the right thing to do <e> <s> the government have taken the view that they cannot continue to subsidise one industry after another <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter of strict energy policy which i would be quite happy to debate with the noble lord lord george-brown if he so wished <e> <s> but even if that had not been so the government are not at the receiving <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i absolutely take the point and i would not wish to appear not to recognise it <e> <s> the government have been so concerned about both fort william and ellesmere port that they have been in consultation with the owners to see whether it is possible to construct new mills or modernise those plants <e> <s> had that been done the government would have been prepared to give substantial financial help in that process <e> <s> we have done that and we are quite prepared to look at any new proposals that industry can bring forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend does not think that i gave a very helpful answer i thought that it was a very helpful answer and that is what it was supposed to be <e> <s> i am bound to say that i did not realise that there was any class distinction here <e> <s> i thought that it was rather the reverse in so far as most wives of peers who come here are given the privilege of not having a pass because on the whole they are known by all the staff <e> <s> if they are not known then they are not so to speak allowed in <e> <s> but i did not know the history of the wife of a former lord chancellor and my noble friend gave me a fascinating piece of information <e> <s> when he asked whether the committee should not take the matter a little further the answer is that i am sure without having consulted the administration committee that it would be delighted to do so if my noble friend lord inglewood were to draw the matter to its attention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord byers and i must have an affinity of mind because that is precisely the question which i asked <e> <s> indeed i shall give the noble lord the answer if he can contain himself for a moment <e> <s> i think that the answer is that noble lords must have a pass because it is part of their duty of coming into the houses of parliament <e> <s> on the other hand peers wives because of the situation which exists in this house are known and therefore do not have to have passes <e> <s> they are permitted to go to the peers gallery of their own right <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury if i may say so is always a maverick and i am interested to hear what he has done about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is really all part of the security arrangements of the palace of westminster <e> <s> i really think that from the views which have been expressed there is a considerable amount to be said for my noble friend lord inglewood putting this matter to the administration committee where it can be thrashed out properly and an answer can be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an excellent point to put before the administration committee <e>", "<cs> my lords they may do but one of the curious features i believe is that wives of members of parliament have passes but then of course the population in the house of commons tends to turn over a little quicker certainly on the male side than it does in the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord gainsborough for explaining that the amendment as it appears on the marshalled list would not in fact be operative as now printed but that it could be operative if it has made to it the alterations that the noble earl proposes as a result of the earlier amendments being agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl withdraws the amendment perhaps i might with the leave of the house make a comment because he has put us in some confusion having moved an amendment and then having said that he does not agree with it at all but that he did it on behalf of somebody else <e> <s> i would not wish to be unkind to the noble earl but of course he will remember will he not that when he speaks in your lordships house he speaks for himself and not on behalf of anyone <e> <s> it really does confuse the house somewhat when a

great change of habit will not be foreign to him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just speak for one moment not having <e>", "<cs> my lords in a relatively thin house it would be dangerous for a minister to decline to accept an amendment which has had the support of every noble lord who has spoken so far in this debate <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord radnor for saying that he would couple with amendment no <e> <s> a amendments nos <e> <s> b a and b because they are all closely connected and tie up england wales and scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could just make one or two remarks on that point <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lady elliot of harwood is under a misapprehension as regards one matter <e> <s> it is not whether it is possible to do what the noble viscount wishes to do in his amendment under existing legislation <e> <s> what is under discussion is whether in fact the amendment should be moved at all irrespective of what it contains <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham of ilton said that the english act contains certain provisions which the noble viscount lord thurso wishes to see contained in scottish measures <e> <s> that may be but we are in a difficulty here and i think that the noble viscount is treading on somewhat dangerous ground because in another place they have a speaker and the speaker decides what is within the scope of a bill <e> <s> if an amendment is tabled which is not within the scope of the bill the speaker disallows it <e> <s> in your lordships house we have no speaker we have no scope but we do have relevance and it is determined what is relevant and what is not <e> <s> if it is determined that a certain amendment is outside the relevance of the bill i suggest to the noble viscount that he is on very dangerous ground if notwithstanding that he then says that he will press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the alteration of the long title of the bill is dependent upon the incorporation of the amendment <e> <s> all i would say to my noble friend lord ferrier is that in the end the house is responsible for its own operations and if your lordships choose to disregard what is relevant that is a matter for your lordships <e> <s> all i am saying and i am giving this to your lordships as impartial advice is that we are on very dangerous ground as a house if we start accepting or considering amendments which are irrelevant to whatever bill may be before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might be permitted to make one further observation over this with the leave of the house <e> <s> i quite understand what the noble viscount wishes to do and i wish him and the house to understand that anything i may say is not said as a member of the government at all but simply to

consider that <e> <s> i was not addressing myself to the type of amendment but merely to the fact of what the amendment said <e> <s> if the noble viscount wishes to change an amendment that is up to him <e> <s> i would only refer to one other thing which i meant to refer to before and that is that a certain noble lord asked was it not possible to alter the long title of the bill <e> <s> the answer is that it is possible to alter the long title of a bill provided that the amendments are relevant to the subject matter of the bill <e> <s> in some cases in the past long titles have been altered but only when the amendments were relevant to the subject matter of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a curious procedure to adopt when we come to amendment no <e> <s> to move a manuscript amendment to no <e> <s> which has not yet been written out so that noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount is such a professional at getting round difficult situations and indeed in

understand it if the noble viscount were to be kind enough to lay that piece of paper on the table your lordships could probably discuss the amendment in its amended form <e> <s> but i respectfully

that the report be now received curious though that may seem <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that it is because we are members of the community that we have been able to protect the interests of australia and new zealand in the way i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords if we have been guilty of lack of consultation of course i would apologise to both my noble friends for the inconvenience which has been caused <e> <s> they will of course both be aware of the volume and complexity of the amendments with which we have had to deal in this bill and of course local authority associations could have made representations to us when they saw the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord middleton down on the marshalled list for the committee stage <e> <s> but as far as i am aware they failed to do so <e> <s> if that has upset my noble friends of course i apologise to them <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house may i say that of course i

i know that noble lords feel very strongly about this but i think the noble lord lord avebury is being less than fair if he says that any one of your lordships is trying to rule by insinuation <e> <s> i do not think my noble friend has sought to do that nor do i think that any other member of your lordships house would do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord howie said this was utilising a device <e> <s> again on reflection i think that is a fairly strong description <e> <s> i think that what was happening was that my noble friend was airing a view which some people would have that it is not the normally accepted procedure to list as a matter for third reading a whole series of clauses which should be left out <e> <s> the principal purposes of amendments at third reading are to clear uncertainties or to get clarification on various issues which have been raised earlier or for the government to fulfil undertakings <e> <s> that has been generally accepted to be the purpose of third reading amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to your lordships for the way in which you have received this order <e> <s> i entirely accept the point which my noble friend lord drumalbyn has made and which was indeed made by my noble friends lady elliot of harwood and lord glenkinglas and the noble lord lord ross of marnock about the difficulties that have been facing hill farmers <e>

course a prerogative of the government and i can only tell my noble friend that he will find out the answer to his question as soon as negotiations are completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be delighted to give the noble lord lord peart a satisfactory answer <e> <s> i recognise that this is a very important point <e> <s> he will realise that in the government of which he was a distinguished member fixed the grants for hill livestock compensatory allowances at a certain figure and they remained unchanged until when they went up by a p supplement for the higher rate for hill sheep <e> <s>

the difficulty of trying to ensure that their livelihood <e>", "<cs> my lords an immediate inquiry my noble friend will be glad to know is being instituted but an immediate answer i cannot give for the reasons i have already given <e> <s> but if my noble friend is patient for a short while she will soon have an answer <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is an increase in money terms and not necessarily in real terms <e> <s> i would have to find out the answer to that point before i gave it to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it has been at the expense of the hill farmers but i

the disadvantages of the rgime which we have come up against the rgime has enabled france to keep the system of intervention that she likes it has enabled the united kingdom to keep the variable

asked a very pertinent question and i will do my best to give him a reasonable and full answer <e> <s> i will certainly look at it <e> <s> so far as one can ever gauge what is likely to happen in the

an opportunity to consider this again further <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment it may be that it may not destroy or damage the roof of the house but it might destroy or damage the breeding place of the bat <e>", "<cs> i will look into it <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes me to say that the words in the bill cover ants taking butterfly larvae down into their holes

place may be put when used for shelter or protection <e> <s> of course it then depends on what one means by breeding copulation or birth or aftercare <e> <s> if you are going to include in that the

said because what he has said is very important indeed <e> <s> my own feelings lie in fact with those of the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> it would be a pity to add yet another schedule of protected species to the bill as it is now because at the moment we have provided sufficient and adequate protection for animals and i would be reluctant to add another category because although these animals may be rare i am advised that they are not in danger of extinction <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend to address himself to clause a which gives the secretary of state permission to add <e>",

house for shelter or protection <e> <s> obviously one would hope that such actions would be taken only when necessary and after the most careful consideration on the part of the owner or occupier of the dwelling-house <e>", "<cs> in clause i think there are a number of definitions <e> <s> whether dwelling-house <e>", "<cs> if i may add to that i will merely tell the noble lord that in fact all

really do not think there is much between us <e> <s> the ncc gives advice on matters relating to bats <e> <s> as the noble lord lord melchett said people frequently consult the ncc about bats <e> <s> the only point i would wish to stress is as my noble friend lord gibson-watt said how far is it right to put an obligation in law in an act of parliament that a person must consult with the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i should have thought it would be undesirable to put that restriction in law but of course we will consider the arguments which have been put forward today <e>", "<cs> i

this is a type of exception which is by no means new <e> <s> the noble lord lord northfield referred to the deer act but this particular exception is one which is found in the conservation of wild creatures and wild plants act <e> <s> of course my noble friend lord stanley put his finger on the nub of the question which is as your lordships will see in clause <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friend could possibly have heard what i said or if he did he did not address his mind to the problem <e> <s> i tried to explain to him that in the bill we are creating conditions for the future

eventuality for the future and that is what we seek to do <e> <s> my noble friend asked what damage was likely to be done and he said that dolphins and otters could do a certain amount of damage <e>

<e> <s> on the one hand my noble friend lord onslow is saying what on earth is the matter with the animals listed in schedule <e> <s> they will do no harm <e> <s> my noble friend lord mountgarret said

stupid <e> <s> i do not always realise it <e> <s> it is such a rarity and it comes rather unexpectedly <e>", "<cs> it will not have escaped the notice of my noble friend nor indeed the rest of the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett is <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i shall be able to clear the matter up for the noble lord but i will explain the position <e> <s> as i understand it there is no statutory definition of the word fisheries <e> <s> when using the term in the bill we have had in mind its use in the protection of birds acts to which are of course re-enacted in the bill <e> <s> the term fisheries is normally taken as a generic term water where there is fishing and it has been used in a similar manner in several international instruments of wild life conservation i am thinking for example of the european communitys directive on the conservation of birds and article of the berne convention <e> <s> if the noble lord lord melchett considers that a generic term like fisheries is unduly wide and thereby widens the scope of the defences provided in clause <e>", "<cs> as i say we will certainly look into this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilbracken asked if it covered fish farming and that is one of the points i shall be looking at in detail <e> <s> i am bound to say that at the moment my opinion is that fisheries covers what might be described as wild fish whereas fish fanning is a captive form of farming and in a way they are grown as a crop <e> <s> probably they would not come under the title of fisheries but i shall certainly look into that <e>", "<cs> i think game birds are ones property and are livestock in so far as they are being reared <e> <s> however once they are let out of a cage there is nothing to stop them from flying on somebody elses land and one could then ask whose property are they the property of the person who reared them or of the owner of the land on which they are temporarily sojourning <e> <s> in effect once they are released they become wild and that is why we did not include the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett has put the point infinitely clearer than i would have been able to put it <e> <s> all i would tell my noble friend is that if he is rearing birds and he has got them in a cage and some pest eats them then he is entitled to kill the pest <e> <s> if some rare animal mentioned in the schedule eats them then he is entitled to take action while they are in the cage but once my noble friend has released his pheasants from the cage and they fly about whether on his land or on anybody elses land the provisions of the bill apply <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett has been so particularly helpful that despite the fact that the new forest moth does not live in the new forest but in scotland i am more than happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that when i first saw this amendment i had a horrible feeling that my noble friend dare i say it <e> <s> had made a mistake or that the printers had made a mistake <e> <s> my noble friend will correct me if i am wrong but i thought that in fact it was supposed to be eurasian whereas in fact what is printed on the marshalled list is aurasian <e> <s> i may well be wrong about that but it does of course reflect what is known as the common otter which as my noble friend quite rightly said is a curious misnomer for something which is endangered <e> <s> i think that probably the best way of resolving this problem would be to refer to it as lutra lutra and just the otter <e> <s> if my noble friend were happy with that position perhaps we could put it right at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for putting down his amendment and for giving us the opportunity of hearing the result of the research to which he referred <e> <s> i am advised that the pine marten does not fulfil the criteria for addition to schedule that is it is not in danger of extinction in great britain or likely to become so endangered <e> <s> my information is that the species has spread considerably since its range became greatly restricted in the early years of the present century and it is now found in the lake district in the scottish highlands and in wales <e> <s> as a tree-living species it has been considerably helped by afforestation and the animal has benefited from a reduction in its persecution by gamekeepers and fur hunters <e> <s> therefore i do not think that there is any justification at the moment for including it in the schedule but i will give consideration to the views expressed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i should be delighted to do so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right his noble friend raised the point <e> <s> i was going to try to explain it to him <e> <s> these matters are a trifle complicated even after one has looked at them several times <e> <s> schedule refers to animals which one cannot kill or take without a licence <e> <s> schedule is a restriction on the methods of killing for those particular animals which appear on the schedule but other methods can be used for other animals <e> <s> that is the complication on those two schedules <e> <s> regarding the red squirrel which the noble lord asked to be put on this schedule the noble lord lord mowbray castigated me for making a speech which i had not made <e> <s> he said why on earth can we not add these things to the schedule <e> <s> we must be told why they cannot be added to the schedule <e> <s> but had he held his patience a little i should have been able to tell him that i agreed with my noble friend lord onslow that this is a perfect example of something which could be added to the schedule <e>", "<cs> in the interests of expedition if by accepting an amendment one gives rise to such a rumpus and disagreement i shall be very much inclined not to accept amendments <e> <s> as i said i would on this occasion i shall <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend lord mowbray who asked where this had been found to be a pest i am advised that in certain forestry commission areas and certain northern parts of the united kingdom it can be found to be a pest <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that we get on <e> <s> we are hoping to get to the end of part i of the bill tonight and that means dealing with pages of amendments <e> <s> so far we have completed pages <e>", "<cs> the point is taken <e> <s> i said that i did not think that it would be suitable to include the pine marten in schedule but of course i take into account what has been said <e>", "<cs> i have a certain amount of hesitation in involving myself in the debate <e> <s> whatever one says one is bound to incur the odium of at least half the committee <e> <s> however that will not be an unfamiliar posture <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett made a very persuasive speech on the amendment <e> <s> the amendment would have the effect of banning the use of snares without a licence <e> <s> one has to balance as the committee have balanced on the one hand the natural human sensibilities which everyone has over catching or killing any animal and on the other the need for adequate and proper pest control <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble lord of course he has got the wrong end of the stick which is unusual for him <e> <s> i was not saying that it would be altered under this bill because he is quite right in saying that it could be done under licence <e> <s> what i was trying to point out was that there are occasions when one can use a snare for the purposes of capturing an animal without necessarily intending to kill it <e>", "<cs> i think that there are difficulties here <e> <s> i quite see why the noble lord lord houghton has put down this amendment <e> <s> but if one can use colloquial terms mammals are what one might describe as furry animals and animals include birds and fish and other creeping objects <e> <s> one of the effects of the noble lords amendment and i know that he is a great humanitarian as regards for instance fox-hunting badgers and indeed snares is that if it were to succeed he would in effect ban much fishing because the effect of the amendment might well be to prevent fishing with the use of live bait live fish and indeed even maggots <e> <s> i think that that is probably going rather further than the noble lord expected and therefore i hope that he will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the justification for having a few reservations about this amendment is that we would not wish to see a general ban on the use of tape recordings as a decoy <e> <s> i understand that there is the possibility that tape recordings could be a potentially effective tool in pest control <e> <s> if the amendment were moved into the bill it would lead inevitably to a demand for licences to employ the method <e> <s> we would wish to avoid any unnecessary licences <e> <s> but the use of any live animal which has been tethered or secured in some way as a decoy is i think reprehensible if indeed it is practised <e> <s> so far i have not heard of any instances and i wonder whether the noble lord is able to give any instances <e> <s> however i would not wish to oppose the amendment so far as the use of live mammals as decoys is concerned and i would only ask my noble friend that if he has any particular examples perhaps he would care to produce them to me before the next stage of the bill and we can see exactly what it is that he is getting at <e> <s> i am still not absolutely certain myself what he is getting at with this amendment <e>", "<cs> if i am not totally out of order in referring to the noble baronesss amendment i should like to say that when she moves it i was going to say that i had not any idea of what examples she might have in mind and i was hoping that she would be able to produce some <e> <s> but as in fact she is unable to produce any i shall not make that remark when she comes to move her amendment <e> <s> what i shall say is that of course i shall consider the matter but without any obvious reasons for introducing the amendment i cannot see why we should be tempted to agree it at the next stage <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord melchett is about to fulminate and i shall certainly listen to him and consider what he has to say <e>", "<cs> of course we shall look at it again <e> <s> i am bound to say that i thought that the second of the noble lords arguments which he said was even the more forceful was in fact infinitely less so <e> <s> to say that you use something for birds and therefore you use it for animals invites the obvious retort that birds are different from animals birds fly and animals do not and certain restrictions which may be required to be applied to birds need not necessarily be required to apply to animals <e> <s> however i shall certainly look at it <e>", "<cs> i shall look at that as well <e>", "<cs> with regard to this amendment i think that the same stricture applies as applied to the <e>", "<cs> as i said i shall certainly look at this again <e>", "<cs> i said that in view of the remarks that have been made i would look at this again <e> <s> i would only say to my noble friend lord cranbrook that even though the fishing fraternity do not like or do not approve of the use of live bait it is of course used <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett for saying that he would not press this amendment <e> <s> had he indicated otherwise i would be bound to say that in the nature of it as it is it would be unacceptable <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for highlighting the problem as he has because it is a real one <e> <s> he said that there was a confused situation with regard to the use of poison <e> <s> i would not call it confused so much as intricate <e> <s> in fact all poisons which are used in pest control are covered by legislation but the legislation is i agree with him piecemeal and complicated <e> <s> it would probably he imprudent and indeed undesirable for me to go into its ramifications here <e>", "<cs> i would add in confirmation of what the noble lord lord melchett said that i am acutely conscious of the fact that it is the misuse and abuse and not the use of the poison substances that is doing the damage <e> <s> i am also acutely conscious of the fact that if there are those who abuse it they will possibly in the long run deter proper use of the product and that of course would have deleterious effects such as the noble lord lord mackie mentioned <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton is always a fund of information and instruction and i was surprised to hear of some of the things they get up to in surrey <e> <s> as my noble friend lord avon has given a commitment to consider a similar amendment in regard to birds i can assure the noble lord that we shall certainly give consideration to this amendment in regard to animals <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt my noble friend i am sure he will be expressing the views of the british deer society but he does not speak for anyone other than himself <e>", "<cs> i really did not mean to truncate my noble friend too quickly and i apologise if i did <e> <s> all i would say is that i should like to support the amendment too but i cannot actually accept it because i think it may not be technically correct <e> <s> but on the understanding that i will look at it and put down an amendment which will be correctly acceptable i hope my noble friend will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> the bill as it is drafted provides that a licence can be given by the nature conservancy council for scientific and educational purposes <e> <s> this is the course which we favour <e> <s> it may seem unnecessarily bureaucratic but the restriction on methods of killing certain mammals and the shrew is one of them arises from the council of europe convention <e> <s> it is also a requirement of the

certain methods to be employed against certain species will in fact provide the basis for that report <e> <s> but i can assure my noble friend that no obstacles will be placed in the way of licences which permit the use of traps such as the longworth trap for scientific and educational purposes <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance my noble friend will be satisfied and will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend may be under a misapprehension which is probably due to me <e> <s> the fact is that there will not be any restrictions upon the use of the type of trap to which he referred the longworth trap though in some cases some traps incidentally happen to kill shrews although they may be used for the trapping of other animals <e> <s> the fact that i used the word killing in the explanation of the reasons for having this in the bill may possibly have misled my noble friend <e> <s> however i do not think that there is anything between us <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to remove the use of semi-automatic weapons from the methods which may not be employed against schedule mammals unless a licence has been granted <e> <s> the government are required by the terms of article of the berne convention to prohibit particular indiscriminate and non-selective means of killing some wild animals which are in need of protection <e> <s> semiautomatic weapons are included in the list of indiscriminate and non-selective methods of killing <e> <s> a similar provision appears in the european community directive on the conservation of wild birds <e> <s> to omit these weapons from the provisions of the bill would be contrary to the obligations which the government have undertaken so i hope that my noble friend will see the reason why we find it difficult to accept his amendment <e> <s> i would point out to my noble friend that it is not a ban on semi-automatic weapons <e>", "<cs> the intention of the subsection as drafted is to prevent vehicles being used as gun platforms for hunting schedule creatures <e> <s> it is not our intention as it would seem to be that of the amendment to prevent the use of vehicles like land rovers to approach areas where schedule creatures may be causing damage and where it is necessary to control them <e> <s> indeed if my noble friends amendment were to be accepted we should be in the curious position of finding that we should be unable to approach the particular site by land rover for instance but we could get to the site by shanks pony by a stage-coach or by a camel <e> <s> therefore i think it would be inappropriate to accept my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining to me exactly what this amendment does because i am bound to say that when the amendment was tabled i was not clear as to exactly what effect it would have <e> <s> i realise that the problem of bats is one to which my noble friend has given a great deal of attention and of course i will consider this along with the other amendments which have been tabled about bats <e>", "<cs> this seems to be an entirely reasonable amendment but perhaps i could be permitted to consider it further before accepting it <e>", "<cs> the clause as drafted is designed so that the secretary of state may give speedy effect to any international agreements which the government have concluded relating to the prohibition of certain methods of the killing or taking of animals <e> <s> the amendment which my noble friend has suggested would give the secretary of state a much wider power and it is conceivable in certain circumstances that the power might be used to vary the methods of killing for other than conservation reasons <e> <s> i should have thought it would be bad for the secretary of state to have more power than parliament specifically permits him <e> <s> i would hope my noble friend would agree not to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not so sure <e> <s> we have run on so quickly that it is not always easy to keep pace with the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> i think this is a question of semantics but i am advised that the clause as drafted is quite sound <e> <s> the effect of adding or omitting any method in subsections or would be to vary only one of the subsections and not both and that subsection in line is correct <e> <s> with this short explanation which i hope the noble lord will find acceptable perhaps he will consider withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> he moved it very hastily <e> <s> he did not <e>", "<cs> i hope there will not be any feeling of suspicion <e> <s> the bill provides that any order amending the lists of protected creatures or restricted methods of killing shall be made by statutory instrument <e> <s> it is not considered that the content of any of the orders concerned will be of such importance as to justify a parliamentary debate <e> <s> i would only say to my noble friend lord gibson-watt that it is relevant to point out that the absence of any parliamentary procedure in relation to these sort of orders accords with the present provision under section of the protection of birds act <e> <s> so far as i am aware no one has previously suggested that there was any need for a more elaborate procedure <e> <s> i hope that on reflection my noble friend will agree that that is reasonable <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asks whether i will consider it <e> <s> the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> i said it would be considered <e>", "<cs> i will consider that as well <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is disturbed by polecats then the right thing to do is to apply for a licence and if he has a licence he will be permitted to take them <e>", "<cs> i think that it was my noble friend lord gibson-watt who asked me to rule on whether or not this was permitted <e> <s> far be it from me to rule on what your lordships are permitted to do but if your lordships put down an amendment about the badgers act then your lordships are entitled to do so and the noble lord lord melchett was quite right to move it <e> <s> i shall do my best to respond to it <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord for his effort at constructiveness in this amendment <e> <s> indeed i was grateful to him for saying that he did not want to draw on the controversy which surrounded the gassing of badgers <e> <s> this is important

conservation purpose is to be served by amending the conservation of seals act <e> <s> the act represents what we believe is a reasonable balance between the protection and the control provisions for the conservation of common and grey seals in british waters <e> <s> we think it is fair to claim that on the whole the act has been successful in conserving large populations of both species and neither is in risk of decline <e> <s> it may be appropriate on a later occasion to look at the act as a whole <e> <s> therefore i would not be in favour of these fairly substantial amendments which the noble lord seeks to make <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield said that this was a long and complicated amendment which indeed it is and he asked for the sympathy of the committee which i think he will receive <e> <s> i must say that i admire his ingenuity and persistence in trying for i think the fourth time to get on to the statute book a bill in which he has been involved but which for one reason or another he has not been able to get on to the statute book <e> <s> there was a deer act in the last session <e> <s> it went through parliament was considered by your lordships and as a result of that only half of the bill or thereabouts got on to the statute book <e> <s> it had in that respect a regrettable history <e> <s> i had a certain sympathy with my noble friend lord caithness when earlier he asked whether this was the correct bill in which to make major alterations to other legislation and indeed to the deer act <e>", "<cs> i have been trying to get to my feet during the last few minutes just to say that i was so grateful when my noble friend lord cranbrook said that he would do anything to make life easier for me and then proceeded so far as i could see to put a knife into my back <e> <s> when the noble lord lord beaumont said you cant win on this bill he never said a truer word as i was castigated by the noble lord lord houghton a little earlier because he said that i always took things away and would not make up my mind <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett says that i have not had the advantage of sitting on his side but if there be any advantage in seeing nodding heads on my side he is welcome to that advantage <e> <s> i say to him that it is slightly disingenuous and unfair when a minister conies to the committee to state in all sincerity what the government feel and becoming aware of the pressure of feeling in the committee says all right i will take this away and look at it to say lets push it into the bill now <e> <s> i have given an undertaking to the noble lord lord northfield which is not constrained or constricted <e> <s> of course i will consider this in its entirety and i should have thought that with that undertaking it would have been reasonable for the noble lord not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment would make it clear that a licence would be granted to enable action to be taken against seals where they were causing damage to the flora and fauna of areas which were recognised as being of particular importance because of their nature conservation value <e> <s> this may not be the case at present and although i accept the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord gibson and by my noble friend we wish to look at this matter along with other changes to the seals act on a later occasion <e> <s> i am not in the slightest out of sympathy with the view which has been put forward but dare i express the hope that this amendment will not be pursued too far because i do not think it would be a good thing to amend the conservation of seals act piecemeal <e> <s> there will be an occasion when we can do it rather than attempting to do it in this bill <e>", "<cs> the answer is some time <e> <s> i would not wish to be more precise than that <e>", "<cs> i should just like to say that of course when any noble lord puts down an amendment it is important to consider the merits of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord thurso is rather quicker off the mark than i am but i shall certainly see whether there is a misprint <e> <s> perhaps i might reply to the noble lords amendment as a whole <e> <s> the government accept the need to continue to give statutory protection to the two british species of seal the common seal and the grey seal to which this amendment relates <e> <s> but as the noble lord knows we have we referred to it earlier this evening the conservation of seals act which as i said i thought it would be inappropriate to alter piecemeal <e> <s> but in the governments view this act meets our obligations under the berne convention <e>", "<cs> my lords when we joined the community the council of ministers said that in the absence of an agreement by st august on an alcohol regime which was then being discussed refunds under protocol which deals with cereals included in spirit drinks would be paid as from that date <e>

january refunds would be provided for cereals used in exported spirits under the cereals regime as protocol determined <e> <s> approximately million per year will be the value of this and the retrospective value which is of course a matter yet for discussion we consider to be in the region of million <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first supplementary question is yes <e>

lord craigton has displayed again this evening <e> <s> we have carefully considered the points which were so clearly brought out in committee that large numbers of bats live in attics and that they can if necessary be displaced from these places without undue mortality provided that expert advice is sought <e> <s> i cannot agree that we should overturn the principle that a householder should be free to remove bats from his house without let or hindrance <e> <s> it is already proposed in the bill that it should be an offence intentionally to kill or injure a bat except in closely defined

i think the chances of an agricultural pest being added to the schedule are so remote as to be almost unthinkable <e> <s> it would be quite inappropriate for me to say that never in any circumstances would any secretary of state in future ever do anything of the kind but i think it is extremely unlikely <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord melchett is quite right the amendment does not add another schedule to the bill <e> <s> but i am grateful to him and to my noble friend for drawing attention to the fact that it is quite permissible in appropriate cases to apply selectively the provisions affording protection to animals and i can confirm that where advice is received to the effect that the course is the proper one the government will not hesitate to consider it favourably <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that it may take some time for the advice to be given but when the advice is given whether the bill is in the process of going through parliament or whether it has in fact been enacted it is still possible to add these species to the list <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will appreciate i was very careful in the words that i chose <e> <s> of course the government will act on the advice but in the end the government have to be the arbiter and the advice is only advice <e> <s> i have no reason to suspect that the government will not act on the advice

are going down all sorts of hypothetical tracks <e> <s> i have said to my noble friend that we have asked the nature conservancy council for advice on the particular species that he has listed <e> <s>

for advice and we are waiting for it <e> <s> therefore i would not be in a position to recommend to your lordships that we accept this amendment until we have received that advice <e>", "<cs> my lords

the leave of the house might i make this clear in case in the nodding of heads there might be confusion <e> <s> the bill does not apply to the channel islands <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say again to my noble friend that we shall certainly take his point and his observations into account but i should prefer to suggest to your lordships that we do not accept this amendment as it is until we have had the advice we seek <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton said that one would not take offence if one was called a sly old fox <e> <s> if i might say so with the greatest of respect to the noble lord he is a sly old fox <e> <s> here he puts down an amendment and first of all he said he looked at the previous debate and found everyone was against it <e> <s> he looked at the division list and found they were all scotsmen and so he put down an amendment which relates only to england and wales to keep out the scotsmen <e> <s> so he realises in effect that the whole argument deployed at the committee stage will be deployed with equal force in the report stage and for the same purpose <e> <s> he said that he wanted to know what the governments purpose was in this bill <e> <s> i shall tell the noble lord what the governments purpose is use of the snare should be continued for the purposes of catching such animals as it is necessary to catch because in some cases it happens to be the most effective weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the reasons why the noble lord lord houghton has tabled this amendment <e> <s> my understanding is that it is an offence to disturb an otter in its holt but i really could not advise your lordships to accept this amendment because in fact it is not a conservation amendment it is an amendment against hunting <e>", "<cs> it is my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett shakes his head but he has been arguing for the last five minutes that it should be wrong to hunt otters and all i am saying is that this is not the correct place for that kind of amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is already illegal there is no point in putting it in the bill and i think it is quite inappropriate to put in this bill measures to outlaw

have made <e> <s> as the noble lord lord northfield knows when this particular amendment came up at committee stage i was not particularly disposed to accept it for the reasons which i gave then <e>

melchett that it is nice when one thinks of that as being accommodating as opposed to the walls of jericho falling <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett for pointing out that badgers are now fully protected around the countryside other than on the occasions when it is necessary to gas them from the point of view of tuberculosis protection <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the great virtues of this bill is that it has been totally non-party political and indeed i think there has been fair enough evidence of that this afternoon <e> <s> one of the other great virtues <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that it was a non-starter <e> <s> that is pretty devastating <e>", "<cs> all right my lords but the noble lord said a good many other things as well which were pretty uncomplimentary <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for that but i attempted to give the noble lord lord melchett my noble friend lord craigton and others who had put down the amendment advance warning of what was going to be put down <e> <s> the noble baroness lady white will realise that we have been operating under a certain amount of difficulty and i certainly apologise to her and to the

you have my noble friends amendment then you obviate entirely clause <e> <s> far be it from me to generate any heat the whole purpose of this amendment was to try to meet everyones wishes and all it seems to have done is to have stoked up everyone <e> <s> i would simply say to your lordships that the basic point is that there are not enough financial resources to give all these sites super treatment the clause treatment <e> <s> either one accepts what is in the bill which is to say that there will be the funds and that there are the obligations and abilities to do this on a certain number of sites and then try to protect the remainder or one says that the system will not work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to make that point <e> <s> at the moment where the nature conservancy council wishes to operate clause it can do so but at the end of the road it comes to a question of finance <e> <s> if it says this is what we want to do and the secretary of state

management orders and compulsory purchase <e> <s> it is at that juncture where the limitation is bound to come in because the resources are not there <e> <s> i would suggest that the amendment which i have moved is the most likely one to catch the remaining sites <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord melchett is entirely correct <e> <s> if despite his assiduous researches into the marshalled list he has not found that the government have tabled a particular amendment that does not mean that we did not consider it <e> <s> we did consider it and have come to the conclusion that the powers in the bill are already sufficient to cover the points that the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> so far as designated sites are concerned both the nature conservancy and the secretary of state will be able to ensure that where practicable the site is large enough to safeguard the scientific interest and his amendment therefore will be unnecessary <e> <s> where this is a large site and it may possibly cover a number of owners the site itself will be so designated and will be sufficiently large to cover the problems he envisages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett for saying he tabled the amendment to see if he could have an assurance as opposed actually to seeing it inserted in the bill for i should not be able to accept it if the latter were his wish

knowledge will realise that there are other facilities available if a decision has been arrived at before the end of proceedings on the bill as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great hesitation in speaking again and indeed in craving the indulgence of the house to do so because this is not a committee stage and i do not wish to offend against the principles when i criticise others for doing so

reading <e> <s> that is my opinion <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to press the amendment he may do so but i must tell him that i could not advise the house to accept it <e> <s> i say that because of the hesitations that i mentioned when i originally replied <e> <s> to include this proposal in the bill would raise fairly fundamental issues and i think that it would be wrong to do so until the

put down at the committee stage <e> <s> at that stage the government expressed concern that we should not place too many obstacles in the way of people who have to deal with an emergency <e> <s> we have of course proposed amendments to other provisions in the bill concerning emergency action but those amendments related to instances where the alternative course to immediate action was fairly clear cut <e> <s> that is not so in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord lord melchett was giving the noble baroness lady david his views <e> <s> i can understand the motive which caused my noble friends to put down these amendments <e> <s> i can understand their feeling if they consider that somebody is going to lose as a result of an sssi <e> <s> they are rightly concerned that landowners should be compensated fully for any loss that they might suffer as a result of orders under clause being applied to their land <e> <s> i agree with that concept and that is why the bill provides that compensation should be paid for any loss arising from more than three months enforced delay to an owners planned operations <e> <s> i do not think that the nature conservancy council should be forced to pay twice-over though <e> <s> if we accept this amendment one owner who had no plans to develop this land and who suffered no delay might claim capital compensation for a reduction in the value of the land although we think that any such reduction would be more than offset by the possibility of obtaining compensation following the service of a notice

seek to prevent any compensation arising from a delay of longer than three months which an owner might experience and which was brought about by his need to inform the ncc of his intention to carry out operations specified in an order made on his land by virtue of clause if and this is the crux he had not <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt but the noble lord is really being

lord lord hunt i have warmed to the amendment because it has a great deal to commend it <e> <s> however one of its effects would be to introduce major changes in the scope administration and implications of the system of grant-aid for farmers <e> <s> that may be one of its purposes but it would certainly be one of its results <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend made the reference he did to hill farmers who live a hard and tough life and the amendment is designed to enable them to have a continued or increased income with grants by methods which need not necessarily be agricultural <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i understand the sense and feeling which has been expressed <e> <s> however the money which is made available for grants is for the ministry of agriculture to spend in order to stimulate food production <e> <s> i would only say that the practicalities of this amendment were it to be passed would be such as to endeavour to make available that level of grant which would have been given to stimulate food production for something other than food production <e> <s> the fact is that the ministry of agriculture would not have that capacity because they have not the ability to make financial contributions for those purposes and however much your lordships may think that in principle it is right to do this the fact is that each government department has got to organise its own grant system <e> <s> it is a fallacy to say that there would be a certain amount of grant available if the project had been accepted but because it had been rejected therefore that amount of government money is available even if it comes from a different department <e> <s> it is the practicalities of it which i respectfully suggest would not work <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord cockfield i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord peart and the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for their acceptance of this statement and their confirmation that they agree with what is being done <e> <s> the answer to the question put to me by the noble

government offer is for the commercial value of the animals <e> <s> it is for all expenses dealing with disinfection of the premises <e> <s> however of course it does not cover loss of profit for

<e> <s> on its own it appears to imply that there are some animals in schedule which are wild and some which are not <e> <s> if the noble lord addresses himself to clause which is amendment no <e> <s>

difficult points which have been raised <e> <s> i thought and it is a happy thought that the reason why there were no amendments in the name of the noble lord lord melchett was that the department had considered all of the points that he made and met them as well as the noble lords total mental exhaustion over the bill with which i have some mild sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord cranbrook for raising this which of course he did at report stage as well and i am grateful to him for the information which his unique knowledge has given the house <e> <s> when he said that he hoped i would consider that his advice was as good as that of the nature conservancy council i would merely say far be it from me to draw the comparison <e> <s> all i would tell him is that of course the nature conservancy council is the body which officially advises the minister and not possibly with regret my noble friend <e> <s> he seeks to afford a measure of control over the trade in those reptiles and amphibians which are found on the british mainland and that of course is a thoroughly creditable intention <e> <s> but i am told that the nature conservancy council have examined such evidence as is at present available and while they are satisfied as my noble friend lord cranbrook quite correctly says that there appears to be a decline in the distribution of the species concerned they are not yet in a position to advise my right honourable friend the secretary of state as to what conservation measures if any would be appropriate in relation to the species which are listed by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish to abuse the laws of procedure but with permission i should like to say just one thing <e> <s> the whole way through this bill we have relied upon the advice of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> it has always been said that we should rely upon their advice <e> <s> here is the one case where the nature conservancy council have in fact not said that this should be done and have said that they would wish for time before they give such advice <e> <s> it really seems quite extraordinary that the noble lord lord melchett should nevertheless wish to disregard that decision so that we push the change into the bill ourselves <e> <s> if the nature conservancy council give this advice then of course my right honourable friend will take it but he is obliged to consult other people as well and that he will do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord northfield has been a persistent person with regard to getting the wording of this right and being a helpful kind of fellow i will be happy to go along with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord because it might save him some time <e> <s> i was going to say that i would agree to accept this amendment and the following one if he would wish to put them without explaining the details <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly gives the noble lord lord melchett the opportunity of asking the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say this is essentially a matter for the house <e> <s> in the procedure committee considered this possibility and set up a sub-committee <e> <s> the sub-committee suggested and the procedure committee agreed that any such suggestion should be approved only as a result of the procedure committee agreeing and your lordships house agreeing and neither of those actions came about <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a fascinating revelation but i doubt whether that was the purpose of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords that peculiarity may not reflect only upon noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords that also is perfectly true and no doubt would be covered by any such investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that if anybody was going to ask a question it should have been the noble lord lord brockway who i notice tried to get in half a dozen times without success so i think we should move on now <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the pleasures of debates on this subject in this house is that your <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it was a habit of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord he knows as well as any of us that it is customary to put ones observations in the form of a question <e> <s> the noble lord continues to make a statement which is contrary to the practice of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think with respect to the noble lord lord brockway he has put three supplementary questions and we have now gone on for minutes and the noble lord lord brockway has the next question too <e> <s> if he would agree i think it might be suitable if we moved to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will continue to support the botswanan authorities in the proposals which they are making to the european communities for the resumption of exports of beef to member states provided that adequate animal health safeguards are maintained <e>", "<cs> i am aware of those facts my lords <e> <s> it is for botswana to negotiate with the eec over this issue <e> <s> i understand that in the latest way in which their proposals have been made they are likely to be adequate <e> <s> but i can only assure my noble friend that this will be discussed after easter by the standing veterinary committee of the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that and i am grateful to the noble baroness for having made the point <e> <s> i can say that the reason why there was a cancellation was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease of a variety called sat not at the moment applicable in europe and it is appropriate that the most stringent regulations are applied in order to ensure that europe does not get that variety as well as the others <e>", "<cs> my lords i was fascinated by the speech of the noble lord lord wallace of coslany because he is always so careful <e> <s> i was not surprised that he did not hold his position with the late lord macpherson of drumochter too long if he sold off all his cows which he thought were barren cows only to find they were in calf <e> <s> he must be a very good person to do business with <e> <s> i am sure i have done the same too but the only difference was that i did not know it <e> <s> i suppose i should declare an interest <e> <s> i also farm but i do not export any animals for slaughter or further fattening <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be good enough to contain himself i shall come to the point to which he addresses his mind quite correctly <e> <s> there is another aspect of the bill to which i should like to refer before turning to that point namely that if the ministers of agriculture and transport were to approve any by-law which could be construed as limiting trade between members of the european community they would be placing the government at the risk of causing a breach of its obligations under the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be quite welcome over here if he has any doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could make one point to the noble lord lord mishcon who said that <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of bringing this matter up at this stage was twofold first i was advised that it was the appropriate moment and secondly in order precisely to avoid getting the principle of the amendment muddled up with the objectives of the amendment <e> <s> that is why i thought it fit to produce it at this moment in order that the noble lord lord mishcon could take into account what had been said when he decides whether or not to move his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness lady jeger i think it would be fair to let the noble lord lord kilmarnock have his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to say that it is a pleasure to see the noble lord lord boothby back in his place after his temporary indisposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely say that i had prepared myself for a number of quite difficult questions <e> <s> i had not prepared myself for such felicitous remarks as have been made <e> <s> i greatly appreciate it as will my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think the noble lord is making the mistake of thinking that the damage to the industry is because we have joined the common market <e> <s> one of the real problems is the shortage of fish and finding the correct method of apportioning the fish which is available among the interests of the various countries involved and indeed of the world <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i dare say that the extension to the -mile limit has probably caused more problems than it has solved <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate would certainly not be out of order in making a constituency point but he would have been out of order if he had made a speech <e> <s> i can tell him that we are deeply conscious of the plight of those who operate in the fishing industry and that is the reason why the government have recently made a substantial concession to them <e> <s> we are concerned to see that in the final negotiations on the common fisheries policy there should be a viable industry left and of course that part of it which is based in lowestoft is indeed a very important part it happens apart from anything else not only to be where the right reverend prelate comes from but also not all that far away from me too <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord this is report stage and i think that the noble lord has already spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect we have been on this statement for half-an-hour and considering the amount of business that there is to take place i think that we should move on <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to say at the outset what a pleasure it is to see the noble lord lord bishopston taking part in agricultural matters once again <e> <s> certainly as far as i know this is the first time in this house <e> <s> of course he was a distinguished minister of state in the department in which i have the honour to be involved <e> <s> i was not a little concerned when i saw in a previous honours list the preponderence of ex-ministers of state from the ministry of agriculture now coming into the house to keep us all very much on the ball <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have understood my noble friends question correctly he is referring to sheep which are being exported <e>", "<cs> my lords it then becomes a question of what is the practical size <e> <s> our experience and belief is that if you have a hole less than mm it is always possible that the hole will heal over and the animal could be presented again <e> <s> if that were to happen the auditors of the commission could easily find that we had been misappropriating funds by paying twice on one animal <e> <s> nobody likes earpunching of any animals <e> <s> it is a fact of agricultural life <e> <s> we have tried to ensure that the punched hole is as small as feasible and practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords the internal drainage board has been discussing the proposed drainage scheme with the broads authority for some months and there now seems a reasonable prospect that a solution will be achieved which will protect the sites of special scientific interest in the area and preserve part of the existing landscape <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food is awaiting the outcome of these negotiations before deciding what action he should take <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends concern but of course he will realise that public inquiries are expensive things to carry out <e> <s> the present position is that there are four statutory bodies concerned the internal drainage board the broads authority on which are representatives of the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission as well as the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission <e> <s> i think it would be unreasonable for my right honourable friend to step in at this stage and say in effect that whatever the outcome of the negotiations of these four statutory bodies set up by parliament he would nevertheless hold an inquiry <e> <s> what he wishes to do is to see what agreement they can come to and thereafter he will decide what action to take <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is bound under section of the countryside act to have regard to the needs of conservation and <e>", "<cs> my lords it has certainly expressed a number of views to the internal drainage board <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that my noble friend is not correct on that point <e> <s> the cost of the new pumps would be million <e> <s> the cost of replacement of the existing pumps is about per cent <e> <s> of that figure <e> <s> the cost of the new scheme to farmers would be per annum per acre for years <e> <s> the cost of replacing the old pumps would be per acre per annum for years <e> <s> the problem is whether the farmers concerned will be able to recoup the per acre from just grazing if it is done as it is at the moment <e> <s> either scheme whether it is an improvement and larger pumps are used or the existing pumps are used is to my understanding eligible for grant because the replacement of the old pumps which are now between and years old is of itself an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might answer my noble friends question first <e> <s> i absolutely take my noble friends point that of course there is a gain <e> <s> equally there will be a loss if the pumps are not replaced and the land becomes flooded and therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the right reverend prelate that my right honourable friend will not do anything hasty which would be undesirable <e> <s> however i do not wish to give him the impression that it will be so unhasty that he will be accused of doing nothing <e> <s> i am in a slightly embarrassing position because i think that this question time has gone on for minutes <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to accept any other questions i know that the noble lord lord winstanley wants to ask one but i think that it might be for the convenience of your lordships if we pass on to the next business even though it will also be for my convenience <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord winstanleys first suggestion is if i may say so with respect slightly off beam <e> <s> there is of course a great attraction in areas which are natural grazing land as there is in arable land and as there is in flooded land <e> <s> my right honourable friend has not taken any decision upon this matter as yet but he will do so when he has heard all the appropriate views <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree of course that information is always vital but it is the commissions responsibility to be told what aid is being given and having been told to decide whether it is fair or not <e> <s> it is their duty then to inform member states where such aids are not fair and not just <e> <s> all i would say to the noble lord lord mackie i absolutely take his point is that we want to be careful that each member state does not find it its duty to look at each aid which is offered by each other member state because otherwise we shall be going round in concentric circles <e> <s> it is the duty of the commission <e> <s> i do not wish in saying that to devalue the point made so forcefully by your lordships that the whole essence of the system is that there must be fair and reasonable competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that my noble friend has made that point clear <e> <s> i was not fully seized of it and i shall certainly look into it <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> parliament has discussed this question on a number of occasions my lords and it has always come to the conclusion that it is correct to make such exemptions for the purposes of those religious minorities who require them <e> <s> parliament deliberately permitted this method of slaughter for those reasons and it is not the governments duty to seek to influence either the increase or restriction of this method of slaughter the local authorities are the enforcement authorities <e>", "<cs> it depends on the nature of the by-law and the nature of the request my lords <e> <s> the ministry of agricultures duty and the duty of the government is to see that the laws which parliament has provided are permitted and those laws are that there should be this form of slaughter for those people who require it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting observation of which i was not aware and i am grateful to the noble lord for informing me of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bishopston for having been so kind and so gracious to the government on this order because he made one or two very pertinent points <e> <s> he said that british livestock is supreme in the world which indeed it is and it is essential that we hold this position in the world and anything which the meat and livestock commission can do to encourage that can only be to the good <e> <s> he said that he was glad that as a quango it was not cut or not axed i think was the word he used <e>", "<cs> slaughtered that is even worse <e> <s> i hesitate to inform the noble lord that it is not actually a quango <e> <s> a quango is generally accepted as being a body which is financed by the government whereas this is financed by the industry and therefore is not truly a quango <e> <s> but the difficulty that we are in is that the noble lord quite rightly wishes to see the work of the meat and livestock commission continued research and development continued and promotion continued and in a period which we are in of inflation and at the same time recession it is difficult to achieve these things without increasing the demands upon industry to an even greater extent than at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept my noble friends consternation about poaching <e> <s> i only hope that the consultations we have will not result in as he put it years of delay <e> <s> the main thing is that we want to get it right and that is the reason why we propose to have consultations <e> <s> secondly where administrative action can be taken and sometimes it can be we wish to take it as soon as possible after those consultations have taken place <e> <s> the third point is legislation <e> <s> that is bound to be more lengthy and will have to fit into the legislative timetable <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept my noble friends anxiety over this matter <e> <s> what i would tell him is that the consultation paper was issued i think on th july <e> <s> consultations have been allowed up to th october which is a fairly brief period of time and thereafter advice will be given to ministers as to how best and how most appropriately to act <e>", "<cs> i agree my lords that it may be odd and it may be awkward i do not know whether it is <e>", "<cs> my lords of course one could have a holiday in july august september or october <e> <s> all i was telling my noble friend is that whatever day one moves it to almost certainly one will find that there are inconveniences <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is not strictly correct in that respect because the banking and financial dealings act allowed bank holidays on boxing day easter monday the last monday in may which is the spring holiday and the last monday in august <e> <s> there are powers in the act permitting additional holidays every year if a royal proclamation is made and it is under those powers that the may day holiday is taken which is on the first monday in may <e>", "<cs> my lords i had a curious suspicion that that question might come from one noble lord <e> <s> the answer i fear the noble lord lord airedale knows it perfectly well is that the easter act permits the fixing of easter provided that all the churches agree and as i think the noble lord knows full well the orthodox churches do not agree on a fixed date for easter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely certain that the easter act has anything to do with the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think it is a question of celebrating a soviet rgime at all <e> <s> it is not on may day which is may st but on the first monday in may <e> <s> i would also remind my noble friend that there always used to be may day celebrations and that it was only i think way back in the th century that may day was suppressed by none other than oliver cromwell <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord did not think it was a satisfactory answer <e> <s> i gave him the most succinct answer i could in reply to his question <e> <s> of course the government are extremely concerned at the level of unemployment highly concerned and that is why we have introduced such schemes as the youth opportunities programme and the young workers scheme <e> <s> i absolutely take the noble lords point when he gives his view that wages councils set too high a rate <e> <s> i do not think that can be considered as a blanket operation because obviously different councils operate in different ways but i shall certainly bear the noble lords point in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords wages councils are independent councils over which the government have no say <e>", "<cs> my lords the government hope that all negotiators including those on wages councils will avoid setting rates which tend to price people and particularly young people out of the market <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the association of the noble lord lord brockway with the initiation of the wages councils <e> <s> but he was quite right when he said that they started up as a result of sweated labour <e> <s> all i can tell the noble lord is that wages councils have reduced in number and they do fulfil a certain role

melchett asked i am bound to tell my noble friend lord sandford that the guidelines regarding the consultations are not expected to become statutory but i shall certainly look up the point and take a note of it <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley of alderley asked whether the period of one month will refer to the final offer or the first offer and discussion <e> <s> the answer is that it will refer to the final offer in which a person has the time to accept or reject the final offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend says that he is entirely happy to leave it at that because in fact he was entirely out of order to have spoken again <e> <s> i can tell him only what i have previously told him and your lordships namely that the drafts will not stipulate any specific sums per acre to be paid in consideration of the restrictions which are imposed <e> <s> that would be completely inappropriate as the payments offered whether by way of annual payments or a capital sum must depend on individual circumstances and be subject to negotiation <e> <s> therefore such draft guidelines as are envisaged will not relate to sums of money by which my noble friend thinks it is possible to make calculations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as i explained when speaking on amendment no <e>

plural phrase it may be performed by or to either of them separately <e> <s> however there is one exception <e> <s> subsection excepts the case where the action consists of making a moorland <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall come to that point when i have finished dealing with the northern ireland problem <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord davies of leek had temporarily transposed himself from wales to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords we should have the distinction that maize gluten and manioc cannot be associated together as similar properties <e> <s> if these different

cannot meet the protein <e>", "<cs> my lords the youth opportunities programme and the young workers scheme are not comparable in terms of net costs per place <e> <s> however the present net cost of a yop place is around per week <e> <s> it is not possible to state the net cost of the young workers scheme first because it does not start until th january and secondly because there will be too many

operating assumption is that the coverage is likely to build up within a few months to between and young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not seen the article to which the noble lord referred and of course the difficulty is that it is very simple to make calculations of that nature without going into all the complexities of the position <e> <s> i would only tell the noble lord that the whole purpose of both the youth opportunities programme and the young workers scheme is in order to try to alleviate the problem of unemployment which is affecting young people <e>", "<cs> my lords when you take into account the gross cost it covers all the costs of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord oram is ingenious <e> <s> of all the questions which one might have anticipated i never thought that the wildlife and countryside bill would come up under this question <e> <s> he is perfectly correct in that some of the money which will be paid under the young workers scheme will go to those who anyhow will have been employed <e> <s> that is why it is difficult to answer my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> of course the advantage of this is that it is a payment to employers to make the work of young people more attractive and the administration is very small <e> <s> in other words all the expense of the scheme goes to the purpose for which it is required which is to encourage the employment of young people <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very important point but i do not think it is the whole point <e> <s> many people have perfectly good training but are unable to get jobs <e> <s> the purpose of both these schemes is to encourage these people to get jobs whether or not they have training <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace is absolutely right of course these are temporary expedients <e> <s> but we are going through a period of great recession and of great human discomfort <e> <s> the government are doing their best to try to ensure that the temporary position is alleviated while at the same time ensuring that the future of the country depends upon being competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords with that thought i suggest that we return to the original subject we were discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords the wages councils are set up and are in operation only in conditions where there are no other recourses to collective bargaining or where pay is low <e> <s> my noble friend asks whether we are satisfied with the results of the settlements <e> <s> i can only tell him that her majestys government are not satisfied if the settlements of wages councils are such as to lead to an unacceptable increase in unemployment <e> <s> that is why her majestys government are concerned to ensure that wages councils should take full account of the consequences of their decisions before they arrive at settlements <e>", "<cs> my lords the wages councils can conduct themselves in whatever way they wish <e> <s> if he is worried about that all i would tell my noble friend is that during the pay round the manufacturing industries wages councils settled at about a per cent <e> <s> increase which was about the equivalent of the private sector the non-manufacturing wages councils settled for about per cent <e> <s> which was about per cent <e> <s> higher than the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that on the whole employers pay above the minimum rate set by the wages councils and in fact sometimes in the nature of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords argument can be made for the abolition of all wages councils i accept that <e> <s> what the government have concluded is that the arguments for doing so have not yet been sufficiently persuasive to suggest that this should come about <e>", "<cs> my lords the immediate aim of the programme will be to fund a range of perhaps to projects leading to open learning schemes of different types being developed and these would be introduced and evaluated over the next three to five years <e> <s> of course they will not all come into operation at once and some will become operational earlier than others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has clearly not realised what is going on in the world and that in fact the trough of the recession is likely to be over <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord davies of leek for acknowledging that his noble friends question was not serious <e> <s> however i would say to the noble lord that there are causes for having proper equipment in schools just as there are causes for having proper training facilities <e> <s> the purpose of this objective is to try to encourage more technical expertise in those who are adults who are not yet employed or who are unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords yes they have <e> <s> they have answered the proposals and have said that they welcome these constructive measures to increase the supply of technicians and to improve training facilities for adults <e> <s> they have made some very useful comments which we shall take into account before framing the open tech programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for passing that information to me to pass on to the noble lord lord davies of leek <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely accept my noble friends requirement that there should be speed on this <e> <s> however i would only say to him that it is important that we should get the facts right before we act upon them <e> <s> that is why copies of this document went out and replies have been received <e> <s> we want to be quick with this but we must get it right <e>", "<cs> my lords in a tine of recession as the noble lord lord peart knows full well there are bound to be cuts and there are bound to be hardships <e> <s> what we are trying to do in this particular exercise is to encourage people to learn technical skills so that when the upturn comes they will be fully equipped to take part in the work which they will have to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that these points cover different things <e> <s> what the question is about is the open tech and it is this which is a new concept and which we wish to see get off the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that our training programmes have not always been as good as those of our competitors and that is the reason why we are trying to do our best to ensure that they are improved as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the hops marketing bill be read a second time <e> <s> this is not a lengthy bill <e> <s> it is relatively simple in intent but in order to understand it it is necessary to touch upon some of the intricacies of the system of hops marketing <e> <s> for those who are directly affected by it it is an important piece of legislation even though its relevance may not be fully appreciated by the many millions whose only contact with hops is when they drink some beer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for the welcome you have given to this bill because one recognises that the hops marketing board has done a great job of work and everyone was content with it <e> <s> in so far as it is necessary to change this i suppose it is inevitable that there is a certain degree of regret <e> <s> if i may say so i think that my noble friend lord selbourne who is after all chairman of the board put his case not only extraordinarily clearly and well but without any sense of bitterness and rancour at seeing the board over which he presides being changed mostly in nomenclature but also with a few other differences <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly had a most interesting debate on the subject of internal drainage boards <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord buxton for having introduced this debate because this is a subject which does not often find the light of day and yet it is one which is very important <e> <s> i could not help being a little amused because when he started off i agreed with the noble lord lord de ramsey who said that he felt he could go along with him <e> <s> but by the time my noble friend had come to the end of his speech i thought he had virtually put a torpedo right through the internal drainage boards and he then said in that charming way of his of course there is little left to argue about <e> <s> it is merely a question of what has to be done <e> <s> at the end of his speech i thought there was a great deal to argue about <e> <s> he said that the boards are undemocratic and the noble lord lord melchett followed along in the same tune asking who are the culprits <e> <s> maff the ministry of agriculture forces the idbs to do things which they do not wish to do and they destroy the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not mean that <e> <s> it means exactly what i said that both my right honourable friend and i want the bodies on the ground to come to an agreement if that is possible <e> <s> if that is not possible we are then involved in a new position <e> <s> but i very much hope that agreement will be possible <e> <s> the land for which the internal drainage boards are now responsible and which as my noble friend lord buxton has pointed out contain same valuable conservation sites is in its present condition simply because of the efforts of the boards and their predecessors <e> <s> these are not natural landscapes or habitats <e> <s> in most cases they represent areas which have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes <e> <s> the main function of the board and <e>", "<cs> my lords if that irritates the noble lord then he ought to take out a writ against his local drainage board <e> <s> i daresay that then it would not happen again <e> <s> what i think is behind the question of my noble friend lord onslow is that the boards are run by people who have a loaded interest in other words those who farm or own the land or who live in the area <e> <s> in a sense this is perfectly correct because it is the land which they own or farm which will be affected by the work of the internal drainage boards <e> <s> there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that and with having a body elected from those whose property is to be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not got those figures <e> <s> i will see if i can find them and if i succeed i will let the noble lord know <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord for the information he gave about the demands of the happisburgh idb for the nature conservancy council to contribute towards the maintenance cost <e> <s> this is a recent development and i shall look into this and see whether a compromise settlement is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal of training going on at the moment <e> <s> the whole purpose of this document is to try to see where that training can be improved <e> <s> her majestys government are particularly concerned to ensure that young school-leavers can obtain employment and can obtain adequate training <e>", "<cs> my lords the announcement made by my right honourable friend earlier this week will not in fact make any difference to the new training initiative <e> <s> the whole purpose of that announcement was to indicate that the government consider that the industrial training boards have done good work but statutory boards are unnecessary <e> <s> in all these cases where they have been removed they are being replaced by voluntary training schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords a very great deal is already being done as the noble lord will know under the youth opportunities scheme and also under the young workers scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend will make a statement towards the turn of the year as i said in my original reply <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting idea but it goes rather wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest of respect to the noble lord i do not think that that is a particularly helpful question <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that the success of this country depends on being competitive <e> <s> we wish to see primarily inflation kept down and people adequately trained to take advantage of the new circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of unemployment of young people is a very serious one which the government take most keenly <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill is not correct in his assumption that this will be permanent <e> <s> the whole purpose of my right honourable friends document and i can only quote their words at the beginning of the document which was signed by my right <e>", "<cs> my lords t am grateful i think to the noble lord lord bruce for what he has said <e> <s> he did say that the particular part he wanted to comment upon were the political observations i made at the end of my speech <e> <s> what i would say to the noble lord is this he is a delightful but a curious noble lord <e> <s> i did not think i made any political observations at all i merely made observations of pure practical common sense <e> <s> the fact is that we have to be competitive as a nation and if you do have a period of recession periodical redundancies are bound to come about <e> <s> i would agree with the noble lord when he referred to the original purpose behind the act <e> <s> i think it was his right honourable friend the then minister of labour ray gunter who is in moving this bill as it was then in the house of commons said that it had <e>", "<cs> well my lords that seems to me to be rather similar <e> <s> however i will accept that and even if it is man-made it is mans business to try to overcome it and that is not a very easy task <e> <s> that is the background which we have to accept whether we like it or not and we do not before we consider what effect our own peculiar national circumstances may have in contributing to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be perfectly true but what i am telling my noble friend is that nevertheless it does produce a vast sum of money and if that sum of money has to be produced from elsewhere one has to shift the burden of tax <e> <s> that may be possible it may be desirable <e> <s> certainly my noble friends suggestions will not go unheeded <e>", "<cs> my lords that if i may say so is totally different and it could very well even be true <e> <s> i would say this to my noble friend that there is a case which can be made and the noble lord lord spens did make it the other day at question time and my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has made it before for abolishing the wages councils <e> <s> if you did that you would of course lower the rates which they set <e> <s> if you lower the rates which they set the inference is that more people will be employed <e> <s> the danger of that is that there could be pressures on those people who are already employed who would have the wages council rate fixing removed to do the same work for less money <e> <s> that may be desirable it may be i am not saying it is <e> <s> the reason why the wages councils were set up in the first place was to stop just that <e> <s> the only places where they are kept are where there is no other system of collective bargaining and in places where the people involved are fairly diverse they are also the lower forms of income group <e> <s> few of the adult rates exceed per week and that should be seen in the context of national average weekly earnings of for men and for women <e> <s> they do refer to those who are at the lower end of the wage scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of the latter fact <e> <s> the fact that no more reductions are planned does not of course mean that they are excluded it means merely that they are not planned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> i think that that is largely so and i would add that the office of manpower economics is totally independent <e>", "<cs> my lords simple mental arithmetics are not always the best guides to efficiency <e> <s> all i would tell my noble friend is that the estimated costs for are in fact per cent <e> <s> below last years in money terms which presumably is more than in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton is always fun to listen to <e> <s> he said that he was in a playful mood <e> <s> he began by saying that i got up in a spirit of resignation <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that i have no intention of resigning <e> <s> it may be that others will dispose of one but in that respect i do not think the noble lord will have much joy <e> <s> i think he really meant a spirit of resignation that for some extraordinary reason in his eyes things are not as pleasant as they might be <e> <s> but i assure the noble lord that the government are entirely happy with the state of affairs in which they are trying to improve matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course perfectly right and he opens up a wide discussion which it would be inappropriate to start upon now <e> <s> all i would say to him is that those who are the most efficient are in a way those whose existence can be justified on financial grounds but that there are other factors which have to be taken into account <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston referred to discrimination against the united kingdom in pig places <e> <s> in about per cent <e> <s> of united kingdom holdings had fewer than pigs and less than per cent <e> <s> had between and pigs <e> <s> the average pig herd in the united kingdom consists of fewer than pigs and most pig farmers therefore will still be able to qualify for grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it will discriminate against the united kingdom <e> <s> it will cover each state equally in so far as the grant which may be payable refers to the same size of farms whatever state one is in <e> <s> in that respect therefore it is uniform <e> <s> of course i accept that it does not apply to the larger farms and that in that way it is discriminatory <e> <s> but it does not apply to the larger farms in any other country either <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a remarkable respect for my noble friends mental acrobatics <e> <s> he asked whether this means that the large dairy farms have got to reduce the numbers of dairy cows down to the size at which they can claim the grant <e> <s> i never said anything of the kind <e> <s> the statutory instruments do not say anything of the kind <e> <s> i cannot understand how my noble friend could have begun to think such a thing <e> <s> if however he thought it and he clearly did i can tell him that he is wrong <e> <s> indeed i went further than that <e> <s> i said that it does not stop larger farmers from expanding their dairy herds they can do so <e> <s> but they will do so without the benefit of the government grant or without the benefit of a european community grant simply because there is a surplus of this product and it is considered unwise to encourage those who are already big producers to get even bigger <e> <s> but if they <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the hoover works as the noble lord has said has been an industrial landmark for many years <e> <s> however it is not the duty of the government to interfere in the commercial decisions of a company however much the government may regret the circumstances which bring them about <e> <s> what we can do is to help regarding deployment of the people which is done by the manpower services commission <e> <s> as i indicated in my original answer that is what the government are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained that the government have considered whether they can make a contribution and how best they can make it <e> <s> i can only say that when an industrial company has lost million in the last year and million in the first nine months of this year it is bound to have to take strident measures many of them unacceptable to deal with that position <e> <s> when the noble lord refers to the internationality of the problem i would remind him that the recession in which we are all involved is an international one which affects other countries as well as ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some people employed by hoover in the merthyr tydfil area of whom some will be made redundant <e> <s> the same services will be offered by the government in that case as in the case of hoover in perivale <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bishopston for his general welcome to the bill <e> <s> he did ask a number of points and i will do my best to clarify them for him <e> <s> he rightly suggests that if a two-thirds majority is not obtained in the poll of registered producers provided for in clause of the bill then the result could be considerable instability in the hops market <e> <s> in practice we have good reason to hope and to expect that the first poll will successfully provide for the transfer of the boards assets and liabilities <e> <s> the board have kept producers well informed of the situation and have sounded out their feelings so that they may be taken fully into account in framing the question to be put in the poll <e> <s> the poll will be carried out along similar lines to that provided for under the agricultural marketing act <e> <s> there are two components to the requisite majority first a two-thirds majority of the individual producers who vote in the poll and secondly those producers voting in favour must between them be capable of producing two-thirds of the potential hops production of all those voting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his observations <e> <s> i agree with him that it does augur well for part ii of the wildlife and country-side act <e> <s> i would only re-emphasise that as regards matters of conservation it is a question of understanding and co-operation between all those who are involved and if the last months work has been indicative of that then i think that we can look forward to success in the future <e> <s> of course we shall keep the system under review but i cannot tell my noble friend yet at what juncture the government will state the results of any such review <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that it does demonstrate the co-operation which is shown by the farmers and by adas and also by the national parks authorities and the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i think that it is a cause of rejoicing that that has been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome which both the noble lord lord mccarthy and the noble lord lord rochester gave <e> <s> i was heartened when the noble lord lord mccarthy in his true and generous spirit congratulated the government on the points with which he feels in favour

bench opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that he will get a full opportunity to make his intervention but it would be helpful if straight away i could answer the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> first i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that he appreciates that the training should be up to standards <e> <s> he asked me how the supplementary benefit will work and how one will determine whether or not a person should have his supplementary benefit reduced <e> <s> the point at issue is that if there is an opportunity for people who leave school to be given a years full-time training it is not reasonable that if they refuse to take it up they should nevertheless receive supplementary benefit <e> <s> the noble lord asked me how this will operate <e> <s> i am bound to tell him that the benefits reductions will be a matter of judgment and discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that my noble friend should say that in the old days the political pendulum swung backwards and forwards across the chamber <e> <s> things do change and sometimes the pendulum does go around and around because what happens on the benches opposite sometimes changes <e> <s> nevertheless i am very glad that my noble friend had an opportunity to ask his question even though he was not able to do so quite as early as he would have wished <e>", "<cs> my lords i supposed that my noble friend did mean that and although he used the wrong word i got the right sentiment and i can assure my noble friend that i admire his prowess in getting in a plug <e> <s> i will see that it is taken note of but i will give no guarantee either way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that their families will be disadvantaged <e> <s> i absolutely agree with <e>", "<cs> my lords

which i gave were based on the figures on unemployment which arc available at the moment and which we wish to see reduced and this scheme is one of the ways by which we wish to see them reduced <e>",

create a <e>", "<cs> i accept my noble friends historical analysis without disagreement my lords <e> <s> regarding his latter point i think i am correct in saying that those who are mentally and physically handicapped will be subject to the same conditions but if i am wrong about that i will write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> it is of course more efficacious if people stay on at school and get a better and fuller training my lords <e> <s> the whole object of the government scheme is that those who have left school should nevertheless be trained and they will be trained for a year <e>

is examined <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is absolutely correct my lords it is very difficult to force people to stay on at school when they do not wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will be aware that the scheme comes into operation in april some months ahead <e> <s> this time will be used to make sure that those facilities are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble

new youth training scheme would continue to receive child benefit <e> <s> i now understand that this is not the case and i must apologise to your lordships for describing this aspect of the proposed arrangements incorrectly <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill was of course taken through its stages and if the noble baroness thought that the questions were put too quickly or anything like that that is a matter for the noble and learned lord who sits upon the woolsack and perhaps it would be as well if my noble and learned friend were to make any comments upon that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think we are in danger of getting into a discussion upon a statement which was invited by the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies <e> <s> i think that if one may try to draw any conclusions from

scheme has to be thorough because of the need to safeguard substantial public funds which may be involved <e> <s> the commissions operating experience is that hasty approval of schemes may lead to difficulties which cannot afterwards be rectified <e> <s> the commission is anxious to establish good training schemes as quickly as possible and it will certainly give all the help it can to doing this <e>", "<cs> my lords the increased volume of output from british farms in was worth about million to the food and feed component of the balance of payments in that year the latest for which figures are available <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right in that he has underlined the importance of british agriculture to the economy <e> <s> it may interest him to know that from the beginning to the end of the s there was a drop from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in net imports of the types of food which can be grown here and in there was a further fall to per cent <e> <s> and during the lifetime of this government between may and december in round figures the retail price index went up by per cent <e> <s> the price of food went up by per cent <e> <s> and farm gate prices went up by per cent <e> <s> that is a measure of the very major contribution which agriculture is making to the economy and we hope to see that that continues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his approval of what the government are doing and i would only remark that his last few words were hardly in a community spirit <e> <s> whether <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it would be fair my lords but if the noble marquess wishes to do so i should be delighted to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords a revaluation of the green pound in the light of the commissions price proposals is totally unacceptable to the government because it would give british farmers only half the increase which has been permitted under the proposals for other member states <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bishopston is entirely correct to draw attention to that fact this achievement has been carried out by a very small percentage of the population and i go along with him and say that if every other industry had been as successful as agriculture we should not be in quite the difficulties we are at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i admire the ingenuity of the noble lord lord blyton in bringing the mining industry into a question on agriculture <e> <s> certainly any industry which increases its productivity in the way agriculture has deserves a similar commendation <e>", "<cs> it is a very serious state of affairs my lords and one about which the government are acutely concerned <e> <s> it does not however refer solely to agriculture it happens in other industries as well <e> <s> there is a sign of an upturn and we hope to see that being continued <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that we consider it a matter of great concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of investment whether in machinery or buildings is a total one and as i explained in answer to the last question it is a matter that is causing great concern <e> <s> i would merely underline my reply to my noble friend by saying in regard to the drop in the level of investment that the contribution which agriculture has made by accepting lower price increases than almost any other industry and that was the figure to which i earlier referred is one of the reasons why possibly the investment has not been forthcoming since the funds have not been there to undertake it <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot possibly generalise on individual borrowings but quite clearly borrowings are for all kinds of different purposes some of which may be in order to keep businesses going <e>", "<cs> my lords certain national aids are permitted under the european community regulations and these we of course approve <e> <s> where countries give vast national aids and so produce the structural surpluses which other countries have to pay for we consider this to be totally outside the community spirit and a course which we deplore <e> <s> this has happened in some countries and it is a matter which my right honourable friend takes up very forcefully with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords national aids are permitted to be given by various countries to their agriculture with the approval and the agreement of the commission <e> <s> where that is done there is no trouble <e> <s> there are countries that are doing it on a scale which undermines the concept of the common agricultural policy and that is what we disapprove of <e> <s> the points which the noble lord lord leatherland makes are in fact agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both noble lords for what they have said and for the support which they both generously gave to my right honourable friend in the stance which he took over what is the preliminary start of the price fixing arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord davies of leek referred to the winter which has recently hit farmers very hard and he was quite right to do so <e> <s> many farmers suffered very considerably <e> <s> clearly where this happens it is a matter of great concern <e> <s> one is always in the position of trying to see whether it is possible to help them or not and it is possible that there may be some help <e> <s> this will be pursued from the european point of view because it is not something that governments help out with always <e> <s> we have taken the view that a government can help out where there is a national disaster but this was not a national disaster <e> <s> it certainly hurt some farmers more than others <e> <s> but that is the nature of farming where one is involved in the weather

say that while the noble baroness lady seear was referring to quangos i could not help recalling the little jingle which i saw one person write that began <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that i have agreed with him <e> <s> i would merely say that the total allowable catch was of course agreed by the council of ministers but that the quotas were not agreed and that we wish those quotas to be agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bishopston will know very well that a great deal of discussion is going on in order to achieve a common fisheries policy <e> <s> i agree with him that that is the answer <e> <s> it is her majestys governments desire to get a common fisheries agreement as soon as possible but i cannot tell the noble lord when that will be <e>", "<cs> my

like to think that i produce some of the food and eat rather less of the food that is produced in this country <e> <s> in this debate we are all concerned to see that the right course is taken for british agriculture and european agriculture <e> <s> i liked the final words of the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> i liked a number of his words but particularly the final ones where he said that we must try to lift our sights above the problems immediately of europe and think about those parts of the world which are less fortunate than we <e> <s> in that way british agriculture expertise and technological know-how has a great part to play in helping other countries develop their own agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i quite agree that i totally misheard my noble friend and am glad to be corrected <e> <s> we think there should be prudent price increases for products in surplus and i would emphasise the word prudent <e> <s> we endorse much of

wedderburn of charlton referred <e> <s> the noble lord quoted from somebody who is perfectly entitled to have his own view <e> <s> i am grateful to him for doing so <e> <s> however i disagree totally with his concept that my right honourable friends legislation is repressive <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right in saying that if these figures are well publicised perhaps people will be keener to invest in this country <e> <s> i cannot give him the figures which he requested in the latter part of his supplementary question but perhaps he will take comfort from the fact that in both and the number of strikes was fewer than in any year since <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord the answer which he has requested without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any great value in apportioning blame <e> <s> we must recognise that we are in a state of world recession and that we each whether management or employees owe it to each other to try to get out of this recession <e> <s> the only way in which we can do that as a country is by being competitive both in price and in work <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is one of the reasons that unemployment is as high as it is now <e> <s> much of the unemployment which we see now was in fact carried before by firms and now they have had to slim down so those figures which were previously concealed are now regrettably on the unemployment list <e>", "<cs> my lords i would just remind the noble lord lord jenkins that even if we have a level of unemployment which is totally unacceptable

himself choke so that he corrected himself <e> <s> but the responsi <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bishopston for the welcome that he has given to this modest order <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the fishing industry has gone through a very difficult period and i am sure that the noble lord will readily realise that during those difficulties as well as during the economic difficulties which the whole world is going through the government have been the first to support fairly well in fact very well the fishing industry and million has been given in special aid over the last two years to the industry <e> <s> that is a measure of our determination to see that the fishing industry will have a viable future in the changed circumstances in which it finds itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord darling for having introduced this bill this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord explained in detail the rationale behind this bill

my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement which is being made by my right honourable friend the minister of state for agriculture in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i was going to thank both noble lords for their replies <e> <s> i will thank the noble lord lord peart for his reply and i will thank the noble lord lord mackie for part of his reply but will maintain reservations about the latter part of his comments on the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord peart was quite correct when he said that this was a serious statement so it is <e> <s> it does contain a lot of problems which have not heretofore arisen in the community <e> <s> that i readily acknowledge <e> <s> he also asked whether the government would arrange for a debate to be held on this matter <e> <s> that is a matter which can be considered through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> there will be a fisheries meeting in due course and we shall have to await the outcome of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord kennet is perfectly correct in saying that this is as he put it one of the nightmares of some people who felt that there might be laws passed of which the united kingdom disapproved <e> <s> this has in fact happened and it is a matter of considerable concern <e> <s> i think it is right to point out that the luxembourg accords represent a political agreement and are not part of the treaty itself <e> <s> despite the differences between member states about the interpretation of the accords it has been the invariable practice for the member states which invoke the agreement to decide whether their important national interests were at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that there are many aspects of this statement which are extremely encouraging and highly beneficial to agriculture <e> <s> the package will provide an extra million of additional receipts to british agriculture and there are many benefits to consumers as well with regard to school milk the butter subsidy and the fact that the co-responsibility levy has been reduced <e> <s> there are many benefits and these have been slightly over-shadowed by the action that was taken yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn asked me to say whether in retrospect i think that her majestys governments policy had been misconceived and that we were being too obdurate over the price fixing <e> <s> i would only remind him of the debates which we have in this house in which his noble friend and noble lords opposite frequently take part in which they criticise the common agricultural policy because of its high costs because of its increasing costs and because of its increasing surpluses and they ask what the government are going to do to reduce these <e> <s> we have consistently said to the community that there must be restraints on these <e> <s> we have consistently said that we must not increase absurdly the prices of those commodities which are already in structural surplus <e> <s> that is what we have done and i see the noble lord lord sainsbury who has invariably advocated that <e> <s> with respect that is not being difficult <e> <s> it is trying to get a fundamental concession and review of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> it is no use pretending that there is no connection between that and the budget because our contribution to the budget is a very substantial one and as a result of this agreement it is now going to go up by million <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not agree more with the noble lord lord stewart in the latter part of his remarks <e> <s> of course it is absurd if member states are going to use one set of rules when it suits them and another set of rules when it does not suit them <e> <s> we have to try to get unanimity <e> <s> it always was the practice that there was unanimity and that these arrangements came about by agreement <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord stewart would find that it would appeal very much more to the people of this country and indeed to the people of the community if they felt that arrangements were arrived at by unanimity rather than by <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge and belief at no time has there been any con <e>", "<cs> my lords i always knew that the views of the noble lord lord molloy were fairly different from our views but i am glad that he has equally distanced himself from the views of the liberal party <e> <s> he asks when this will happen again <e> <s> i cannot answer that question <e> <s> all i can tell him is that it has not happened for years and that is why we never expected it to happen this time <e> <s> but i would add that we are members of the community and we want to see it succeed <e> <s> inevitably in the process of growing and evolving there will be difficulties and substantial problems <e> <s> when one comes up against a difficulty such as we have now come up against we should not regard that as the ending of all the previous relationships which we have had <e> <s> we have to get over these problems and make sure that they do not happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords i know many stories but i did not know that one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords question <e> <s> i would only inform him if i may that the total aid to hill farmers last year of million compares with million in which means that it has about doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ross will have noticed yesterday many of the parts of the common agricultural price review which he says was imposed upon us were in fact agreed beforehand and many of them will benefit hill farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie has his own method of calculation <e> <s> all i would tell him is that between and the hill cow allowance rose from to which is an increase of about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is perfectly true but i cannot see what that has to do with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the survey to which my noble friend refers is now complete and the precise nature of the case which might be made to the european commission is at present being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords that also is an ingenious question which goes rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the government provide substantial financial aid for promotional campaigns for british farm produce and they are helping to fund a series of british food weeks which are designed to increase sales of british produce in leading stores <e> <s> my departments advisory service provides advice to producers on all aspects of marketing <e> <s> my right honourable friend appointed five marketing advisers to suggest ways in which british agriculture can improve its marketing <e> <s> they have made many valuable recommendations and are continuing their important work <e> <s> we hope shortly to announce plans for improved co-ordination of marketing at a national level <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that discussions on this have been going on for some time <e> <s> my right honourable friend was concerned to get the answer right rather than have a premature announcement but i can tell my noble friend that the announcement about this will be made very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords that is being discussed and i cannot tell the noble lord what the results will be <e> <s> however if i am in a position to let him know i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly has been of great value <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can give the noble lord lord mackie of benshie an answer which i think he would understand fairly easily i think that the answer is in the negative <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was primarily directed to what is being done to help the marketing of produce <e> <s> that is rather different from a question on the future of cherry orchards <e> <s> certainly if cherries are produced it is important that they should be marketed properly and correctly and i hope that they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i apologise for leaving out the word emotionally which i quite see is very important <e> <s> i would only like to say on that however he feels we have or have not led public opinion we are totally part of europe we are totally determined to remain a part of europe and to make the common agricultural policy and the european community succeed <e> <s> it was the noble lord lord kennet who said that historically europe had been in conflict over the years and that one of the great advantages of the european community is that that has not been so in recent times <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i did not make the point clear <e> <s> i did not wish to attribute to my noble friend anything which he had not intended <e> <s> i realise that the expression bad taste referred to the latter negotiations <e> <s> i merely went on to say that even if that was in his view a bad taste nevertheless it was part of the overall position <e>", "<cs> my lords of course had it been possible to have come to a settlement this would not have happened but it takes everyone to agree what a settlement should be <e> <s> it was the noble lord lord mackie who last week i think it was referred to the lady who said isnt it a funny thing that everyone is out of step except my tommy <e> <s> had it been possible to come to this agreement then the veto may not have been used but the fact was that the agreement had not been arrived at <e> <s> all i am trying to say is that there is a distinct connection between the two and a connection which was realised <e>", "<cs> that was an excellent way of putting quite a complicated problem my lords and i congratulate him <e> <s> t hope your lordships will see the current proposals of the government as part of a continuing series of

house will be conveyed to my right honourable friend and will help him in his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly had a wide-ranging debate and if i might i should like to start off by answering a question asked by the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> he wondered what agriculture had to do with this bill <e> <s> i am bound to say that i thought that was a very pertinent question

happen to be unfortunately a member of your lordships house having to listen to me reply to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord lord underhill the undertaking which he requires because it entirely depends on when professor gennard completes his report <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill would be the first to agree that it would be inappropriate for an incomplete

me to say nor do i know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any disparity or difference between the answer that i then gave and the answer that i have now given <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i always try to be as helpful as i can to the house and if the noble lord lord underhill asks a perfectly reasonable question he receives what i hope he will think is a perfectly reasonable answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bishopston for his welcome to this modest little order <e> <s> i am bound to say that his sense of humour was pretty elastic when he referred to it as a ewe turn <e> <s> all i could think was that it was a ewe k order <e> <s> the noble lord made one comment and he wondered whether there was a reason or an argument for making scotland a separate area <e> <s> in fact this is not so because great britain forms a single market with trade flowing between england scotland and wales and there would be no logic in creating a separate region for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to sugar in a few moments <e> <s> i would not wish my noble friend nor would my noble friend wish to distort or put a wrong impression on what i have said <e> <s> all i was trying to say was that to allow for or even to plan for a surplus in general is not necessarily a wrong thing because shortages which are the other side of the spectrum can be even more of a problem <e> <s> but i will come to the question of sugar later <e>", "<cs> my lords we have achieved something by this debate and i am glad to be able to enlighten the noble lord <e> <s> i never thought in all my years that i would ever be able to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is perfectly fair as he always is but he will be the first to recognise that there was an expected expansion in the sugar market <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says why <e> <s> i am saying that there was an expected expansion in the sugar market which for a variety of reasons did not come about <e> <s> it so happens that the communitys system has resulted in a surplus of sugar and that i entirely accept <e> <s> it may be that one ought to try and reduce the surplus of sugar in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn who is so vociferous in saying hear hear will i know repeat hear hear when i tell him that there was an occasion when the community exported sugar and made a profit on so doing of some considerable sums of money <e> <s> of course it is not easy to get the balance right and we want to see the balance right <e> <s> it may be that the imposition of quotas not only on sugar but on other commodities as well might be a possibility and it is an interesting example which we could try and follow <e> <s> however i would only draw the following distinction <e> <s> it is easier with sugar because most community countries did have some form of sugar quota because the sugar which was produced had to be processed and had to go through factories <e> <s> that is not so with other commodities and it would be very difficult to get commodities such as wheat to go under a quota system <e> <s> however it is certainly a point worth looking at <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right and it is the extension of the -mile limit that has caused a great deal of difficulty over the past few years and against which the british fishing industry has adapted itself quite remarkably <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food is extremely concerned to see that there is a proper and adequate common fisheries policy before the end of the year <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that my right honourable friend is doing all in his power to see that such an agreement comes about within the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord lord boothby the undertaking that my right honourable friend will do the best he possibly can for the fishing industry and that there is no question of the british government selling out to the common market fishing industry <e> <s> but the problem remains and the noble lord lord boothby is quite correct to draw attention to it over-fishing remains one of the greatest problems and that is where the difficulties arise over total allowable catches and access <e> <s> that is what my right honourable friend seeks to achieve for the benefit not only of great britain but also of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet will be the first to recognise that it is difficult enough getting agreement between current member states without extending it to those who might join in the future <e> <s> but i quite agree with his overall point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because my noble friend does not wish to see fishing up to our beaches that some of the negotiations have been prolonged <e> <s> of course the noble lord is quite right that the majority of the fish happen to lie in waters in which we traditionally fish but if a common fisheries policy is to be agreed it must be one that is acceptable and reasonable not only to us but to other member states and also in regard to the preservation of the fish stocks <e> <s> it is to that end that we seek to get agreement <e> <s> when the noble lord asks is my right honourable friend aware of the concern in the industry <e> <s> the answer is yes definitely <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend that the penalties in the private sector operate under company legislation whereas those which operate in this particular sector come under the

amounts paid are paid by various people <e> <s> the amounts of money which are paid by this method are sums of money paid out of government funds <e> <s> i will give the noble lord lord hatch an analogy <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that in business or in agriculture any grant that is made to an individual is not disclosed because you would be disclosing an individuals private means <e> <s> that is a factor which has prevailed under all governments and i suggest that it is one which should prevail under this government <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter asked for confirmation that the expenditure would be subject to review by the comptroller and auditor-general <e> <s> of course he was entirely correct and was also correct in his mild altercation with the noble lord lord howie <e> <s> the real point is not that these figures will not be known by the comptroller and auditor-general or by anyone else but whether or not they should be made public in a published report <e> <s> it is that which the government feel should not happen <e>", "<cs> i do not think that makes very much difference <e> <s> i repeat what i said at the end <e> <s> the fact is not that the facts will not be known it is whether they should be published <e> <s> the comptroller and auditor-general has a perfectly sound method of investigating all expenditure by government as all government departments know <e> <s> so in this case <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord presses his amendment may i make one or two points <e> <s> it was entirely unwittingly i am sure but the noble lord was guilty of one or two inaccuracies in what he said <e> <s> he wanted to know about professor gennards report and said that we must not be hugger-mugger <e> <s> the fact is that the report is in the department <e> <s> the fact is that the secretary of state has not seen it <e> <s> the reason why the secretary of state has not seen it is because it is in its draft form <e> <s> the reason why it is not being published is because as a result of discussions which are normally carried out when these reports are made it may be subject to considerable change or revision <e> <s> therefore i repeat that it is wholly wrong to put in the library a report which is not complete and whose final version may be changed <e> <s> there is nothing hugger-mugger about that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said it

he made was that he did not want there to be any secrecy <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to address his mind to any payment which a government makes on anything <e> <s> look at tax matters they are

<e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch of lusby said that i made an important statement <e> <s> it was very nice of him to say it but actually i did not think it was very important <e> <s> in fact i had given the information in an answer to the noble lord lord underhill on rd june <e> <s> this is public knowledge and there is nothing funny about this <e> <s> a draft report from professor gennard was received at the department of employment in february of this year <e> <s> in professor gennards view his report is not yet complete nor is it in a publishable form <e> <s> that is professor gennards view <e> <s> it is professor gennards report and he elects when he wishes his report to be published <e> <s> it is perfectly normal for a person producing a report to consult a department to make quite certain that some matters concerning factual accuracy or statistical accuracy are correct <e>", "<cs> that merely shows the wisdom of the noble lord reading a little bit quicker another time <e>", "<cs> i thought that when the noble lord lord mccarthy introduced this amendment there seemed to be two phases with which we would become familiar <e> <s> one was hugger-mugger and the other was professor gennard <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that they do not seem to be able to get professor gennard out of their system <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mccarthy was speaking i could not help recalling the young boy who was going in for a scripture exam <e> <s> he was told one question you are bound to be asked is the dates of the kings of israel so for goodness sake remember that <e> <s> when he went into the scripture exam he found one question which was criticise the character of st paul and he was lost <e> <s> he just wrote far be it from me to criticise such an eminent saint but i append here with the list of the kings of israel <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord is right and i do not think that he is exaggerating the case <e> <s> i think in fact that he is wrong <e> <s> it does not give anyone an automatic right to anything <e> <s> all that clause does is to permit the secretary of state to make payments towards compensation and the methods by which those payments should be adduced are in schedule <e> <s> therefore there is absolutely no question of anyone being given an automatic right <e>", "<cs> i thought i must have misheard the noble lord <e> <s> did he say that the purpose of his amendment was to ensure that no one individual should be suffocated <e> <s> it seemed to be contrary to what he was arguing <e>", "<cs> may i try to enlighten the noble lord <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he is of course entitled to make a speech on the clause stand part but as the clause and schedule are so interlinked i wonder whether he would think it convenient for the committee if his clause stand part speech were made on schedule as opposed to clause <e>", "<cs> i was glad that the noble lord lord mccarthy said that he would do his best not to hot up the temperature of the debate by moving his amendment no <e> <s> which includes the word and i did not think that of itself it was particularly inflammatory but of course amendment no <e> <s> goes further and the noble lord quite rightly took the two amendments together <e> <s> professor gennard popped up again but i shall not answer the noble lord on that particular point <e>", "<cs> the basic principle of these compensation arrangements is that what is now to be payable should be broadly what an industrial tribunal sitting at the time of dissmisal would have awarded if it had found the dismissal unfair <e> <s> the first of these two amendments would place this imaginary tribunal hearing one month after the date of dismissal <e> <s> in fact an aggrieved employee has three months within which to go to a tribunal <e> <s> this amendment therefore seems to introduce an arbitrary time scale for which there appears to be no obvious merit <e>", "<cs> that is wholly outside the amendment <e> <s> therefore i shall satisfy myself with not addressing my mind to that point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord molloy said that i cannot answer the noble lord lord spens without answering him <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord is that he had better wait and see <e> <s> what he said was totally out of context with the amendment <e> <s> but as i have not even been permitted to reply to the noble lord lord spens the noble lord lord molloy does not know whether or not he will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my noble friend had a part in this amendment <e> <s> he merely moved it <e> <s> therefore if i may he permitted the courtesy of your lordships to make my speech in my own way bad though it may be i shall endeavour probably inappropriately and inadequately to satisfy all sides of the committee <e>", "<cs> we seem to be getting on famously and i am glad that the noble lord lord mccarthy and i both agree that on the whole the amendment would not be an improvement to the bill <e> <s> the method by which compensation is payable as i have explained in fact allows for interest to be paid <e> <s> i said that interest was running at the rate of per cent <e> <s> at the moment <e> <s> in fact the interest would be calculated on the basis of the interest rates which prevail during the course of each year for which the person was denied his monies <e> <s> the principle of that is that it gives the person the interest for the money he should have had <e> <s> it does not seek to take into account inflation <e> <s> the fact that it may almost cover inflation would be incidental <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord harris of high cross that peace will reign on the conservative benches if it did not reign before <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton is always persuasive <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bishopston says not enough and i am bound to say that he might have taken the words out of my mouth instead he said them out of his own mouth from a sedentary position <e> <s> the point we are discussing is quite simply the one where the employer was induced to dismiss the complainant by pressure which a trade union or other person exercised on the employer <e> <s> that is the position that the employer was induced to dismiss the complainant <e> <s> who is in the dock in this case <e> <s> it is the employer <e> <s> who is responsible for the dismissal <e> <s> it is the employer <e> <s> let us consider the person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the employer <e> <s> who is this person if it is not the employer in one form or the other <e> <s> it is clearly someone who acts with the authority of the employer <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton asked about the manager <e> <s> the manager would be acting on the authority of the employer and the employer would be the person responsible for the dismissal <e> <s> if it is the manager who might have been the cause clearly it is the employer who is the right person to defend in unfair dismissal proceedings <e>", "<cs> i hate even to suggest to the noble lord lord wedderburn that he may be producing somewhat of an irrelevance <e> <s> i can only bring him back to the position in which we are <e> <s> it is where the employer was induced to dismiss the complainant by pressure <e> <s> nobody else dismisses that man <e> <s> it is the employer who is in the dock <e> <s> he is the one who is being criticised he is the one who has taken the action which is considered to be unfair <e> <s> when the noble lord says one ought to bring along a whole lot of people who operate black lists i really think that is a irrelevance <e> <s> it is the employer who is the person responsible for the action and he is the person the complainant is making the case against <e> <s> if it is to be fair and the whole onus of unfair dismissal is against the employer for perpetrating the unfair dismissal in all these cases it is bound to be the employer who is the person who must carry the can and who must defend himself <e>", "<cs> i would have thought that had nothing to do with it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy argued that the amendment is designed to prevent an individual possibly a trade union official finding himself personally liable for an award of compensation of many thousands of pounds <e> <s> but in arguing that i think that the noble lord ignored three basic points <e> <s> first there is no absolute reason why an individual should ever have to pay this compensation <e> <s> if a closed shop has been approved in a ballot then providing the employer does not dismiss those who are protected under the law the dismissal of the non-unionist will not be unfair <e> <s> in that case the question of joinder will not arise <e> <s> even if the closed shop has not been approved by a ballot an individual will be liable for compensation only if he does put pressure on his employer to sack non-unionists <e> <s> if he exerts no such pressure there can simply be no risk of an individual having to pay out a large sum of money <e> <s> therefore anyone who finds himself liable for compensation under this clause will be in that position solely because he chose to be <e>", "<cs> i long to be helpful to the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> he said that he thought it was difficult to see what the answer is and he asked the government not to leave it to the good sense of tribunals <e> <s> unfortunately that is exactly what i am going to say to the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment provides that where an employer has to comply with a reinstatement order made by a tribunal the union should in no circumstances be liable for the higher special award <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn argued that in this situation it is clearly the employer who is at fault in not taking the employee back and that therefore it would be wrong to penalise the union or some other third party for his misdemeanour <e> <s> the noble lord was very persuasive in what he said <e> <s> but there is a crucial weakness in that line of argument <e> <s> it ignores the fact that the employers refusal to comply with the tribunals reinstatement order may itself be the result of trade union pressure <e> <s> for example the union may threaten to come out on strike if the complainant is reinstated <e> <s> in that situation clearly it would be wrong for the union to escape all responsibility <e> <s> it will of course dare i say it to the noble lord lord wedderburn be for the tribunal to decide whether that is a sufficient reason for the employers refusal to comply with the order <e>", "<cs> if i may say so to the noble lord i have always thought he was so versatile <e> <s> i never realised he was as versatile as that <e> <s> he must teach me sometime how to do it <e>", "<cs> i am not an expert on swedish law either and therefore i shall contain myself to english law on which i am also not an expert <e> <s> rather like the noble lord lord mccarthy who was commendably brief i too shall contain myself to what the clause does <e> <s> the noble lord said that he was going to divide on it in any case and so i do not suppose that it matters very much what i say <e> <s> therefore i shall content myself by saying merely that the whole purpose of the clause is about what happens in a position of unfair dismissal <e> <s> in particular we think it right that where a union or other person uses industrial pressure to force an employer to dismiss an employee unfairly for not being a member of a trade union that union or other person should be liable to pay its or his fair share of the price for its or his actions <e> <s> the union or the person should bear its or his fair share of any compensation which may be awarded to the dismissed employee <e> <s> that compensation may be none it may be some but we think it right that the union or the person should pay its or his fair share <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> it was interesting to see the noble lord lord mccarthy clutch what cherries he could see coming from his noble friend behind him <e> <s> there is not a great deal of difference between the motives of the movers of the amendment and the government <e> <s> we both agree that there should be limits on the damages which can be awarded against trade unions <e> <s> we both agree that these limits should be related to the numbers of members in trade unions <e> <s> the only difference is that the movers of the amendment would like to divide the top category of unions with over members into two categories and apply rather lower limits than those contained in the bill to all but the very largest of unions <e>", "<cs> if the unions had registered it would not have caused any trouble <e>", "<cs> that was their fault <e>", "<cs> after that considerable riposte from the noble lord lord harris of greenwich may i say that i did not regard this in a frivolous way and nor did i intend to regard this amendment as a joke <e> <s> i did explain to the noble lord lord kilmarnock and i said this perfectly clearly that it was a matter of judgment <e> <s> i merely gave the reasons why we thought that the figures we have in the bill are reasonable <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich i do not see that that is a reason for jumping on me and assuming that i regarded this in a flippant way i do not do so in the slightest way <e>", "<cs> of course i will be entirely happy to consider what the noble lord lord kilmarnock has said <e> <s> i will certainly look at it <e>", "<cs> the paragraphs on political funds and on provident benefits funds and these are the paragraphs in subsection both state quite clearly that the term means something specific and they are therefore definitions of the terms concerned <e> <s> the paragraph on provident benefits in fact begins with the words provident benefits includes and the list that follows is a list of examples of provident benefits <e> <s> i understand the concern of the noble lord lord wedderburn but of course it is clearly not an exhaustive list nor is it an exclusive list <e> <s> it is simply guidance to the courts as to the sorts of things which might constitute provident benefits <e>", "<cs> i think there is absolutely no reason why that should not be included <e> <s> i would only draw the attention of the noble lord lord davies of leek to the fact that it says <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord spens for his help in saying that he wished to assist me to overcome the problem <e> <s> i am bound to say that it is a curious form of assistance where he multiplies the fine -fold from to <e> <s> my noble friend lord orr-ewing asked this question the other day and he was concerned that trade unions had not presented their accounts at the appropriate time <e> <s> but there is no evidence of serious non-compliance with the legislative requirements for trade unions and since the certification officer was appointed in there have been no prosecutions under section and it is perfectly true in fact that both trade unions and employers associations have encountered certain difficulties in complying with the statutory requirements <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy must have been grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for quoting his book so generously <e> <s> indeed so copious were his quotations that i thought there was no part of the book he had not quoted <e> <s> i have a certain sympathy with the noble lord lord mccarthy in saying that when he read my noble friends amendment he did not understand it and wanted to ask some questions <e> <s> i know the feeling <e> <s> when i read some of the amendments put down by the noble lord lord mccarthy i did not understand them and had to ask sonic questions not of course of the noble lord but of some kind gentleman w ho illuminated me as to exactly what they meant <e> <s> i found that i did not agree with them so at least in that the noble lord and i have a common conclusion <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would with his customary patience be a little patient he will see that a document will be issued depicting exactly what will be discussed <e>", "<cs> soon <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best to help the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i am so glad that on this occasion he did not think i was joking <e> <s> i should like to correct him on one point namely that the government have changed their mind <e> <s> the government have not changed their mind <e> <s> as i explained before it is not a change in the governments thinking but the pace at which that thinking will be translated into action which has been expedited <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord exactly when this consultation will start <e> <s> i have already said that the government intend to start consultations as soon as possible <e> <s> the scope and the timing have not yet been decided but union elections will be covered <e>", "<cs> that is quite an interesting proposition but of course it has nothing to do with this particular amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone said that he had misgivings about the amendment but he liked the idea <e> <s> every noble lord who has spoken on the amendment seems to have been mildly in favour <e>", "<cs> i was taking the advice of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway on the earlier amendment when he said and i think the noble lord lord mccarthy would agree with him that it would be unwise to rush into legislation of a certain nature without first making quite certain that what we do is going to be an improvement <e> <s> we have no intention of rushing pell-mell into anything and i do not think this bill makes the government be seen to be rushing pell-mell into union affairs at all <e> <s> it is just a gentle modest progress <e>", "<cs> i always like to respond as positively as i can <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for explaining the difficulties which the shipping industry envisage they would have on balloting <e> <s> we must remember that all employers with closed shops will have at least one year and possibly two years after the bill is enacted to organise their ballots <e> <s> they have already had more than six months while the bill has been going through parliament in which to consider any problems that may arise <e> <s> i would think that this is an entirely adequate and indeed fairly generous period of time in which employers could prepare themselves for ballots <e> <s> i find it remarkable that the shipping industry requires five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i can help <e> <s> i think there was a slight contretemps when both the noble lord lord molloy and the noble lord lord wallace got up <e> <s> i think perhaps if the noble lord lord wallace put his question that might solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene but we have spent minutes on three questions <e> <s> there is yet another one to go and if your lordships think it appropriate i suggest that despite the noble lord lord molloys intervention we ought to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords on that very appropriate note i think that we should move on <e> <s> possibly unusually bright lights in the chamber at the moment have a stimulating effect on your lordships in asking so many questions but i think it would be proper to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been on the statement for minutes <e> <s> it would probably be appropriate to move on since my noble friend has given fairly full answers <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord northfield would put his question as succinctly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts one in a difficulty because it is not my intention to weigh up a balance of who has spoken and who has not spoken <e> <s> the only balance i was trying to weigh up was the one of the length of time taken on this statement in view of the members who wish to speak on the major business of the afternoon <e> <s> with the greatest respect to my noble friend and i do this with due deference to his parliamentary agility i would have thought that if he could contain himself on this occasion it would have met with the approval of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i realise he is asking for clarification but it is report stage and he has spoken once <e> <s> i think we might be contravening custom if the noble earl made a second speech <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an important debate on what is a very important matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy said that he wondered when i spoke whether i was going to use the argument that this was the recrudescence of voluntarism <e> <s> i am bound to say that i do not know whether i am going to do so because i am not quite certain what the expression means <e> <s> but i am quite certain that every other noble lord knows what it means and i shall listen to my speech with interest to see whether in fact i shall achieve what the noble lord anticipates <e> <s> we had a similar debate on an almost identical amendment during the previous proceedings in committee and i am bound to say that i admire lord rochesters parliamentary dexterity in ensuring that by putting this amendment down for mention even before clause i his arguments and his amendment will be properly considered as opposed to what happened when the matter was dealt with at in the morning <e> <s> he certainly has ensured and quite rightly so that it has had a good hearing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may reply to that intervention by the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> i would ask him to look back over the last years and see the enormous progress which has been made by industry over employee participation over the general understanding of the new ways in which people think <e> <s> no one person is responsible for doing the persuading <e> <s> it is a matter of fact and it is a fact of life that public opinion persuades people to change their attitudes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatful to the noble lord lord mccarthy for taking amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> this group of amendments reverts to a theme which as he quite rightly said we discussed at the committee stage <e> <s> at that stage your lordships debated whether the opinion of an applicants former employer and the relevant trade union should have to be sought before payments could be made under the provisions <e> <s> now with amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to have all decisions notified to the former employer and trade union and with amendments nos <e> <s> and he seeks to allow employers and trade unions to be able to request reconsideration of a decision on compensation on the grounds that the decision was based on a mistake as to or ignorance of some material fact <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had our two old friends pop up from the committee stage again professor gennard and now hugger-mugger <e> <s> i wondered whether we were going to see them appear again <e> <s> as schedule is presently drafted it will make an applicant liable to repay compensation which he has been awarded only where he has been at fault for example by failing knowingly to disclose some material fact <e> <s> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mccarthy could require him to repay compensation where he in fact has acted in perfectly good faith but where some mistake has nevertheless occurred <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether they are in gennard too which the noble lord lord mccarthy will realise we have not seen though which i believe he has seen <e>", "<cs> my lords as the bowling has returned to me the noble lord lord mccarthy will have the satisfaction of knowing as he put it in his own words that he will not be outclassed so he may relax <e> <s> the noble lord generously acknowledged that his amendment was complicated <e> <s> i will also acknowledge that clause is complicated and is quite difficult to follow <e> <s> it may therefore help if i briefly explain the background to the clause before i deal directly with the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will with the leave of the house try to answer that question and the point worrying the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i would say that it is perfectly reasonable to have a differentiation for instance between wage rates for union and non-union members <e> <s> it is perfectly reasonable to say those who are union members will get a per cent <e> <s> rate above non-union employees and i take that merely as an example <e> <s> when negotiating new wage rates maybe they will all go up and you will still have a per cent <e> <s> differentiation <e> <s> what would be unfair would be to say we shall negotiate a wage increase for union members and union members will have a wage increase but meanwhile non-union employees will have no increase <e> <s> however it would not be unfair to have differentiation between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the view which the noble lord lord rochester expressed and i would just tell him that the government have not yet made up their minds as to the precise form in which your lordships wishes could best be implemented <e> <s> the statement which i made was an initial reaction in order to indicate the way that the government felt <e> <s> the way that the government felt was to see that those wishes are implemented <e> <s> i merely indicated that it could be that in the governments view and here one takes legal advice and all sorts of other advice the best and most appropriate way might be under those orders <e> <s> if that were so they would come directly under the companies act as opposed to coming under <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that what i thought was a perfectly modest amendment has evidently got its own aura of complexity <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton is totally right when he says that a small word can make a big difference particularly if it is a word like not <e> <s> but this is not a world like not it is a word like or <e> <s> that can i agree make some difference but i assure the noble lord that there is no intention of altering the intention or the phraseology of the bill as it is drawn up <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> as he knows at report stage one can speak again by leave of the house and it is possible sometimes to ask a question before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> i think he is extending the capacity of the report stage if he makes three interventions in my noble friends speech <e> <s> if my noble friend could continue with his speech he could possibly answer the noble lord in the best way he thinks fit and if the noble lord lord howie will contain himself i think that would be the best course <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second occasion on which we have debated the subject of strike ballots during the bills passage through your lordships house <e> <s> it has been fascinating because the opinions as a scientist might say fractionated out in a curious fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept lord aylestones correction <e> <s> the principle of discussing ballots as a whole is probably what i should have referred to <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> what i said was that i am sympathetic to the motives which constructed the amendment and which lay behind the amendment but for the reasons which i gave i did not think it was correct to put these statutory obligations into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord mccarthy must have had his mind temporarily and only momentarily concentrated upon professor gennard <e> <s> what in fact i said was that the response to the green paper elicited that information <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment sponsored as it is from different quarters of the house has fair ruffled the feathers of the party opposite <e> <s> even the beer that the noble lord lord jenkins drinks will never taste the same considering that he feels that he will be subscribing inadvertently to the conservative party <e> <s> but the amendment itself does raise a very important subject and a very controversial one as we have heard of the contracting out of the political levy <e> <s> there are many noble lords who are concerned about the trade unions act of which enables a union to collect political contributions from members who do not take positive and specific steps of their own initiative to contract out <e>", "<cs> my lords that merely makes the noble lords position even more obfuscated than it was before <e> <s> frankly the government have much sympathy for the view which is expressed in this amendment but one cannot overlook the fact my noble friend lord campbell has not done so that the present position has <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be kind enough to let me give the government view he may find out what the view is <e> <s> i was saying that this amendment and i said that we had a certain amount of sympathy with it goes considerably further and it raises the problems of not only trade union democracy but political democracy as well <e> <s> i was going to say that this is pretty heavy stuff <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton said that it deals with the financing of political parties <e> <s> he is quite right it does <e> <s> in this bill we are concerned with employment and industrial relations <e> <s> the bill is concerned with the law as it affects the individual at work in his relationship with his employer and his relationship with his trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords i was actually moving only one and speaking to the other two <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords concern <e> <s> in the imports of new zealand butter were tonnes in they dropped to tonnes in they were tonnes and in they were tonnes <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that the arrangements always did entail a cut in new zealand supplies to europe <e> <s> but on the other hand the noble lord will be aware also that there has been a decrease in the amount of butter consumed and that over the period between and the sales of new zealand butter on the united kingdom market declined by only per cent <e> <s> whereas the consumption in the united kingdom as a whole declined by per cent <e> <s> therefore the share of new zealand butter in the united kingdom market has remained virtually the same at per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> it is our intention to see that while the effect of the lowering of the butter demand in the european community is a fact new zealands sales should remain an important part of the united kingdoms efforts in europe <e> <s> it is our intention to ensure that there are proper supplies of new zealand butter <e> <s> if i can assure the noble lord the discussions which are going on at the moment which insinuate a figure of tonnes have the approval of the new zealand government <e>", "<cs> my lords not entirely because the fact is that butter demand is decreasing <e> <s> as i tried to explain to the noble lord lord beswick although new zealand butter imports to the united kingdom have gone down their share of the united kingdom market has remained the same as it was before we joined the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that last remark and i endorse it <e> <s> we have every intention of doing all that we can to ensure that new zealands butter supplies continue in the appropriate and the best fashion <e> <s> my noble friend is quite correct in saying that the disposal of surplus community butter on to the world market affects new zealand as indeed would the disposal of american butter or butter from anywhere else <e> <s> we want to see that the amount of butter coming from new zealand remains a reasonable and proper amount and that is what we intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords without going into too much detail the short answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos is that in tonnes of butter were imported from new zealand in tonnes were imported and in and this has not yet been decided the commissions proposals were for tonnes <e> <s> this has the approval of the new zealand government <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn referred to the butter mountain <e> <s> i would remind him that at one time the butter mountain amounted to tonnes in intervention and it now is only tonnes which is about three days supply for the community <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends where the milk goes <e> <s> it may go into consumption it may go into butter or cheese <e> <s> i cannot answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a levy on new zealand butter as there is on all imported butter but the levy which is applied to new zealand butter is at a concessionary rate and is lower than that applied to other butter <e> <s> the noble lord says that if there was more new zealand butter if it was cheaper people would buy more <e> <s> maybe they would but the fact is that people are buying less and the fact is that part of the agreement when we joined the community was that we would protect and there would be a protection for new zealand butter supplies even though they are on a degressive basis <e> <s> that we have striven to ensure is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anybody in any part of the house would disagree with what the noble lord lord molloy has said about new zealands contribution in the last war and her total and great allegiance to this country particularly during recent events <e> <s> what we have tried to do and have succeeded in doing is ensure that as part of the community regulations they will have an agreed amount of butter coming into this country <e> <s> it is the governments intention not to agree a figure of which the new zealand government would not approve and that we have not done <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of august people were in receipt of this allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords

question we should move on to the other business <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for putting his question so succinctly <e> <s> he said that the bill was not without controversy <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord that it is a bill the prime object of which is to enable us to ratify a convention and the convention for the protection of new varieties of plants is a convention to which the united kingdom has been a party as indeed it was a party to the previous convention <e> <s> it is true that plant breeders have become fewer in number a matter to which the noble lord drew attention <e> <s> this is so in almost every facet of life with which we deal <e> <s> breeding is a very complicated issue inevitably takes a long time and inevitably a lot of resources are applied to it <e>", "<cs> i am aware of the view that is taken that some of the plant breeders have as i think the noble lord said plundered the resources of the third world by using some of their genetic material <e> <s> i do not think there is any question of plundering it is a question of making the most of the resources which are available <e> <s> it is true that when breeding is carried out new breeds appear and old ones tend to disappear if one is not careful <e> <s> the way one avoids that is by having gene banks <e> <s> in the united kingdom for instance the plant breeding institute at cambridge holds some cereal varieties and the national vegetable research station has the capacity for seed of vegetable varieties of only species <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the members of the committee who are not familiar with this particular bill will agree with the noble lord lord walston that his amendment is abstruse <e> <s> he said that it was just a small little amendment which he hoped would clarify the position <e> <s> i think it makes it somewhat more obfuscate than it already is <e> <s> he said it is only a clarification of the present legal position because if material which is capable of being reproduced is not intended to be used for reproduction and this is clear from the circumstances surrounding the sale then such material is not reproductive material for the purposes of either section of the act or article of the convention and any sale of it will not be caught by section a of the act <e>", "<cs> the current definition of plant variety is to be removed from the act because in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must point out to my noble friend that it was the commission and not the government which took the case to the court <e> <s> once the case was before the court the government had a duty to make their position clear <e> <s> my noble friend asks why a friendly settlement was not arrived at <e> <s> there were attempts to arrive at a friendly settlement and during those attempts the government offered to refer the issue of costs to a taxing master to pay the costs incurred by referring the matter to the taxing master and to abide by the taxing masters decision but the lawers of the railwaymen did not approve of that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it perfectly plain to my noble friend that the government have always taken the view that the position in which the railwaymen were put by the act was totally obnoxious and that is why we took the first opportunity to alter the position under the employment act <e> <s> when my noble friend asks why we did not submit to the opinion i can only remind him that the commission having given an opinion decided to take that to the european court <e> <s> once the case was taken to the european court the government had to make their position clear <e>", "<cs> my lords if there was any unwisdom it was on behalf of the previous government of noble lords opposite which introduced an act which put people in the united kingdom in the position of being unable to abide by their human rights <e> <s> that was the situation we wished to see reversed and that is what we did <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the duty of the government and their lawyers to pursue the three very important points which i explained in order to make the position perfectly clear and that is what they did <e>", "<cs> my lords the european court asked the european commission to adjudicate and give an opinion upon costs <e> <s> when the commission gave an opinion it was then taken to the court to give a judgment and the courts judgment was in line with the commissions opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords article of the european convention makes the united kingdom liable for costs if it loses a case <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly each case has to be judged on its merits but my understanding is that in cases in this country it is almost unheard of for a successful litigant to recover per cent <e> <s> of his costs and often but by no means always the figure turns out to be around two-thirds <e> <s> i would re-emphasise what the european court said in its recent judgment on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be most inappropriate for me to make a comment on what the legal costs were and how they moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is helpful to go into all the reasons why lawyers took certain views <e> <s> i would tell the noble lord that had the previous government not enacted a piece of legislation which put members of this country against the european convention on human rights this case would never have been brought and had it been dealt with expeditiously as it should have been under the labour government it would not have taken the course which it has taken now <e> <s> but the satisfactory part is that the people concerned had their case vindicated and material costs of awarded to them and they have had a large proportion of their costs paid <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of your lordships if i repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of state for agriculture <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords what a fascinating question to be asked at the very end of the noble lords intervention <e> <s> i am grateful for the welcome which both noble lords have given to the statement <e> <s> both noble lords asked for an assurance about the special status of great britain with respect to foot and mouth disease <e> <s> of course

policy <e> <s> we have that policy for very good reason <e> <s> it is seeking to dovetail that policy with those countries which do not have it which causes the problems <e> <s> i am hopeful that we can come to an agreement that will be suitable to all member states <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord walston is entirely correct <e> <s> there is not a great deal of meat in this statement <e> <s> my right honourable friend thought as is his practice that the customary and proper thing to do is to inform the other place of the discussions which have taken place and the conclusions such as they were arrived at during the last council of ministers meeting <e> <s> it was considered appropriate for that statement to be repeated here <e> <s> the noble lord is right in saying that there are not too many conclusions <e> <s> with regard to the specific point about botswana i will find out the answer to his special question and contact him <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not strictly come under the foot and mouth regulations <e> <s> there are regulations which control the movement of calves but they do not come under those for foot and mouth disease <e>", "<cs> with regard to the latter point i think we should still be in the same confusion if the title was to be the royal botanic gardens at kew which would be the legal entity whereas in fact the royal botanic gardens at kew would also be operating in wakehurst place <e> <s> i think that to avoid confusion the title would have to be kept as it is <e> <s> i understand the predicament of the noble earl lord perth when he reminds us that there is a scottish royal botanic garden a very eminent one too <e> <s> following the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i would not wish to do anything to offend scotland <e> <s> i am sure that nothing in this bill would do that because one must remember that the bill makes it clear that its provisions do not extend to scotland or to northern ireland and the royal botanic gardens in edinburgh are the responsibility of the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> at present there is no reason to think that there should be any change in that respect <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not hold any overridingly strong views on it <e> <s> all that i was trying to explain is that the bill makes it perfectly clear that it refers only to england and that the royal botanic garden at edinburgh will still remain the responsibility of the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> certainly i will look at the point which the noble earl has put forward <e> <s> if there are overriding reasons to alter it we shall certainly take the point into account <e>", "<cs> the concern which my noble friend lord craigton has reflected is a very proper one <e> <s> it is that those appointed as

international role is an important facet of the activities and must remain so <e> <s> i remind the committee that the bill states in clause in some detail the functions of the gardens and that

statute or a bill difficult to comprehend i am sure i would find it more so <e> <s> the object of clause is to permit fees to be charged for entry to any property which is occupied or managed by the board <e> <s> in this instance one might readily think of kew gardens where an entry fee is at present charged <e> <s> on the other hand under subsection the board cannot fix a fee either for entry

parentheses that none of them applies to me because i have not been personally involved in the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be inappropriate for me to disclose the names of people who are recommended for appointment but the <e>", "<cs> my lords the organisation consulted was the national association of teachers in further and higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make it clear <e> <s> the advice was given but it was not accepted because it is the duty of my right honourable friend to make in his judgment the best appointment and that is done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is not totally correct over that <e> <s> if the secretary of state were to accede to a recommendation against his better judgment that would in effect give the right of appointment to those who were consulted and not to the secretary of state to whom the statutory duty applies <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble baronesss first question i was not aware that it was a shifty answer <e> <s> i thought the answer i had given was perfectly plain <e> <s> in answer to her second question i must be absolutely clear <e> <s> the secretary of state for employment has the right and the duty to appoint <e> <s> he is obliged to consult <e> <s> he has consulted he has not for various reasons taken advantage of the names put forward and has appointed as a result somebody who is eminent and totally worthy <e> <s> i think it is most unfortunate if the noble baroness considers that as a result of that the person concerned will not retain the confidence of the teaching profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might help by drawing your lordships attention to the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the years to the united kingdom was allocated grants totalling million from the european social fund including million in <e> <s> grants from the european social fund have made a substantial and very welcome contribution to training and employment schemes in this country especially for young people <e>", "<cs> my lords if anyone was in any doubt about how to apply i am sure that if he were to get in touch with the department of employment he would be so instructed <e>", "<cs> my lords i may tell the noble lord that the social fund itself is to per cent <e> <s> of the european budget <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be good enough to contain himself i shall try to answer his question <e> <s> as i said the social fund is to per cent <e> <s> of the european budget <e> <s> our average share of that fund since accession has been per cent <e> <s> and our share in was close on per cent <e> <s> if the noble lord will be good enough to work out the figures from those statistics which he can probably do in his head he will come to the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i do not think that these grants are small <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that per cent <e> <s> of the social fund is given by the european community to the united kingdom <e> <s> but i tell the noble lord that in our public estimates the allocation of the contribution from the social fund is taken into account in arriving at the figures and had it not been for the social fund the figures for public allocation would have been bound to be lower <e> <s> therefore the grants have been a direct contribution to the additional amount which is spent on training and such schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beaumont put a very persuasive case in moving this amendment <e> <s> i could not agree with him that this is a bill which restricts trade <e> <s> it is as the noble lord lord john-mackie said a bill to protect the rights of those who have invested considerably in various forms of plant breeding for which investment they are perfectly entitled to a return otherwise plant breeding will not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has an uncanny knack of lifting up stones and seeing what kind of slugs are underneath them <e> <s> i am bound to say that this particular amendment of his is not necessary since its effect is obtained by the provisions of clause of the bill as it stands <e> <s> one of the main purposes of the clause is to delete from the act the provision which enables plant breeders rights to be extended to the sale of end products such as blooms or fruit obtained by the seller from plants of protected varieties of plants which he has multiplied up in the united kingdom <e> <s> this provision has never been used since it has been considered undesirable that a breeder should enjoy double protection <e> <s> he should not be able to obtain royalties in respect of a product which has been obtained through the multiplying up of his variety as well as the royalties obtainable on the multiplication itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the views expressed by the noble lord lord john-mackie and by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie was puzzled about why th october was the date specified <e> <s> that is the date on which my right honourable friend made the announcement of the intention to pay aid and it is quite appropriate to make the basis for qualifying for aid the date which he used for the announcement <e> <s> that is the reason why th october was chosen <e>", "<cs> what i said i was confident about was that the scheme which includes the requirement among other things for per cent <e> <s> of the crew to have been british on that particular date and all the other things which had to apply on that particular day will result in those vessels not being applicable for grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that to a large extent much of the increase in production is due to new and improved varieties in which the agricultural research council has a very substantial part to play <e> <s> but the expenditure on research which is commissioned by the ministry of agriculture from the agricultural research council has increased from million in to an estimated million in <e> <s> there has therefore been no cut <e> <s> the reduction to which my noble friend refers does not relate to the coming year but to the years and <e> <s> it is from funds which are distributed by the department of education and science <e> <s> this cut has been made on the advice of the advisory board for research councils which gives advice to the government on the distribution of the whole of the science budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally am delighted by the increase in both meat and cereals production but the noble lord lord john-mackie is quite right in saying that there is an imbalance <e> <s> this imbalance is of concern to the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> it is also of concern to the commission <e> <s> that is why the increases for cereals last year were less than those applicable to the meat sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome your lordships have given to the bill <e> <s> almost without exception noble lords have welcomed its provisions and i am grateful to them for that because the introduction of food from britain is a milestone in the life and production of marketing in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the holdings are being offered at tenanted value and i am sure that the noble lord lord beswick will know the difference between tenanted value and freehold value <e> <s> i do not mean that in any disparaging way <e> <s> very often the tenanted value is in the region of maybe per cent <e> <s> of the freehold value <e> <s> that is a fact of life <e> <s> i am not saying that that is the figure that will be given in each individual case <e> <s> but one of the facts is that tenanted value is about per cent <e> <s> of the freehold value <e> <s> whatever figure is assessed the occupant will be able to purchase the holding at tenanted value <e> <s> if he so wished he would then be in possession of something that he could sell thereafter at freehold value <e> <s> that is why it is quite an attractive proposition for the tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the dictation to by government if that is the phrase that i used and it was probably not the best of phrases was due to the fact that growers were obliged to market all their products through the lsa <e> <s> if in their view the lsa did not market them as well as it should have done the growers were struck with no other outlet <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a number of statements by my right honourable friend explaining what is to be done <e> <s> i think that it would be difficult for me to go into them in detail now <e> <s> but i would say that we originally set a deadline for april of this year <e> <s> there were complaints that that was not long enough for lsa tenants to make their own arrangements for their own co-operatives <e> <s> we have extended the deadline to december for those who wish to continue to market through the lsa <e> <s> for those who make their own co-operative arrangements meanwhile that is in order <e> <s> there have also been extensions for facilities with regard to their financing <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that possibly his noble kinsman was a little ungenerous <e> <s> i am bound to say that i do not deny my right honourable friend the opportunity to open a bottle of champagne when this agreement has been arrived at after years and years of hard negotiation <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie really did get it wrong if he thought that my noble friend was gloating over achievements which have been made by britain at the expense of others <e> <s> the achievement was a european achievement <e> <s> it was the fact that member states with differing interests conflicting interests had nevertheless and despite those conflicts been able to come to a common accord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a reciprocal arrangement between the commission and norway and it is outside the actual common fisheries agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not there when that was said and i do not know whether the noble lord agrees with everything that is seen in the papers <e> <s> but if it was a conservative achievement and i would not wish to throw politics into this it is actually a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords to hear one who has spent so much of his life involved with the fishing industry and who has been years watching its progress say as the noble lord lord boothby did this afternoon that it is a happy day for him is a very moving experience <e> <s> he has not been uncritical during those years <e> <s> he has himself made very many pertinent points and i think that the most pertinent was when he said that these negotiations required courage and patience and they required fortitude which is unusual <e> <s> there is quite a philosophical thought behind that for which i am most grateful <e> <s> i will certainly see that the noble lords congratulations made as they were in such personal specific and generous terms are passed to my right honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that <e> <s> it will probably be most helpful if i deal with it in my speech when i hope to explain in more detail exactly what this common fisheries policy agreement means <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross is quite right to refer to the enforcement system because it is a very important part of the arrangements <e> <s> before going on to that perhaps i might just thank the noble lord for the generous remarks he made about my right honourable friend in another place because he has been deeply involved in all these negotiations and the comments of the noble lord lord ross will i know be welcome to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take my noble friends point <e> <s> i suppose that if you were a purist you would say that the more boats you had the more likely you are to catch everyone <e> <s> in the same way one could say that if you had more police it would be a good thing but we have to work within the realities <e> <s> in fact we have a very substantial force of aircraft and ships which police the waters and on the whole it has been very successfully done <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ross that probably we have the best policing system in the world and certainly in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the last point the danes will have their agreement which is a reciprocal agreement between the commission and norway <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe also referred to the particular case of mr kirk <e> <s> so far as i understand the position the case is concluded <e> <s> if it is not concluded it is <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting and important debate <e> <s> everyone has a natural sympathy for fishermen <e> <s> they live a hard tough and rugged life and for who they are and what they do they earn respect for themselves <e> <s> what has been said this evening in all quarters of your lordships house has been a clear indication of our concern for their future and the way in which they earn their living <e>", "<cs> industrial fishing does not come within this agreement my lords <e> <s> one of the most important demands of our fishermen was to have a sensible system of enforcement in which member states could not overfish their quotas and could not infringe the access provisions <e> <s> that has been repeated this afternoon almost universally <e>", "<cs> my lords the main intention is to sell forestry land which has plantations on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any particular flood of representations from farmers <e> <s> certainly there have been queries from a number of individuals but not necessarily from farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly find the figures which the noble lord requested and send them to him and to my noble friend <e> <s> i think there is no doubt that any sales of forestry commission land which take place are made in order adequately to reorganise the forestry commissions assets and where land is sold it is only that which is not anticipated to be required for urgent use <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am not aware of any specific organisation having written complaining if that is the inference of the noble lord lord hale <e> <s> periodically people write in about sales of specific parcels of land but not in a general way <e>", "<cs> my lords the land which is forestry commission land on which forestry stands is sold to private purchasers who will continue to use it for private forestry <e> <s> i should make the point though that if people who have purchased forestry commission land wish to fell it they must have a licence from the forestry commission who also have power to direct them and indeed to enforce their direction to replant that land <e>", "<cs> the noble lady understood me slightly incorrectly my lords <e> <s> i said the main object of the selling of the land was to sell land which had trees on it and i said i would find out and let the noble lord lord john-mackie know and the noble lady if she is interested exactly how much of that land has trees on it and how much has not <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why the noble lord directed that question to me <e> <s> what the terms of my noble friends question are is a matter for my noble friend <e> <s> having said that i would not agree with the noble lord lord bruce <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> the question to which i am asked to give a reply appears to be getting more and more convoluted <e> <s> i think the best thing for me would be to write to the noble lord as indicated and then if my noble friend the duke of atholl wants further information if he would table a question for written answer i will give him all the information that i can <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i do wish the noble lord to do justice not only to the noble lord lord walston but also to me <e> <s> i think he did not refer to me as the scargill of the agricultural industry but as the st scargill <e> <s> i have never myself ascribed beatification to that gentleman but i am quite happy to have it ascribed to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may with the leave of the house answer some of the points which have been put to me <e> <s> i have had the privilege of making a speech earlier and therefore so far as is possible i will answer those points that have been made <e> <s> if i may i will say at the outset that i agree with the noble lord lord raglan that very often people think that the moment a hedge or a tree is cut down that is a bad thing <e> <s> but of course all plants and all crops have their life and to cut a tree down is not necessarily bad <e> <s> very often it exposes the beauty of others that still <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect i simply cannot see that that has any bearing on the subject whatever <e> <s> the noble lord has asked me the question and he must allow me to answer <e> <s> how the government fund defence is a totally different thing from how you nationalise a certain asset whether it is a railway or land <e> <s> if i may say so it is typical of the views that are sometimes expressed by people in favour of nationalisation <e> <s> they say that the principle is right and therefore the money must be found and they do not in fact look to see how it will be found <e> <s> with land having the value that it does your lordships will find that it is a very substantial form of funding which would have to be arranged <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks defence expenditure is unjustified all i can tell him is that this would be additional to that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting slant <e> <s> i did not pick that up from what the noble lord said nor from what the noble lord lord hatch said <e> <s> i think he was rather in favour of that <e> <s> let me just say this on the general principle <e> <s> there are those who take the view that too many people have left the land <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch said that and that this was bad <e> <s> he said that if there were no support there would be a return to livestock farming on pastures the farm workforce would be higher and it would be generally an idyllic countryside <e> <s> i believe there would be gross unemployment in the countryside <e> <s> incomes would drop and the purchasing power of people would drop <e> <s> if the support for agriculture were to go the purchasing power of farmers and farm workers would drop <e> <s> villages would become depopulated and poverty would soon abound just like the s <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a funny thing but sometimes i can have it both ways <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch of lusby may have forgotten that we are members of the euopean community <e> <s> he may have forgotten although i cannot believe that he has that one of the fundamental and even controversial parts of the european community is a common agricultural price system <e> <s> if we are members of the community we are members of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> that means that it is part of the communitys policy to support a successful agricultural industry <e> <s> the noble lord may disagree but we are members and we therefore go along with being part of the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord john-mackie when the noble lord lord houghton gets on his feet one is greatly tempted to follow him down the fascinating passages along which he takes us <e> <s> we all realise his deep interest in and concern about the welfare of animals <e> <s> i was prompted to raise a smile when he referred to the arable mafia <e> <s> i was not totally concerned about to whom the noble lord <e> <s> lord houghton was referring the noble lord <e> <s> lord john-mackie said that it was obviously to him but i should like to correct him on one point the agricultural industry is not rolling in cash <e> <s> he referred to the question had they never had it so good <e> <s> if i may say so i think that that is a total exaggeration <e> <s> what has happened is that this last year appears to have been a <e>", "<cs> the first thing i must do is to leap to the defence of my noble friend the chief whip <e> <s> the noble lord lord beswick said that he had come equipped with a new missile called an alarm to terrify ministers <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord beswick that my noble friend has no such missile and that even if he did it would not terrify this particular minister <e> <s> but i saw the noble lord lord beswick use a missile of his own which is commonly known as a sidewinder to put into one who has succeeded to the post which the noble lord held with such distinction <e> <s> i have no doubt at all that when the noble lord was chief whip he used his own form of deterrence if noble lords spoke for too long <e> <s> if however i did not answer the noble lords questions and i did not i give him a wholehearted apology <e> <s> i had intended to do so <e> <s> it was due to my own incompetence and concern for brevity <e> <s> i see that at that time i had already spoken for about minutes and felt that i had probably spoken long enough to have exhausted your lordships <e> <s> evidently and i am delighted to hear this i had not exhausted the <e>", "<cs> i have been discourteous enough to the noble lord <e> <s> lord beswick <e> <s> and it is not my intention to be discourteous again <e> <s> if the noble lord will be content to wait a little longer <e> <s> i will come to that point as well <e>", "<cs> i think it would be impossible at this juncture to say exactly what the split of funds would be as to smaller organisations and bigger ones <e> <s> then he asked whether food from britain would have ready access to the minister if there were any political problems <e> <s> the answer is that it would <e> <s> there will of course <e> <s> be continuing interest by the minister in food from britain because apart from anything else <e> <s> he has responsibility for the appointment of members <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord lord beswick to see whether i can clarify something to which he referred and also the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> i want to make it quite clear that the funds which come into food from britain will be virtually from three sources <e> <s> one will be government funded pump priming for five years <e> <s> that will be for marketing <e> <s> secondly there will be funds from organisations which will make subscriptions <e> <s> the third will be funds from the government for the business of co-operative ventures and co-operation which the central council used to have before <e> <s> my noble friend asked whether we could give an indication of what that split will be <e> <s> the government will be giving million over five years to the business of marketing <e> <s> that will be in addition to the l million annually which will continue to go towards that which the central council now does <e> <s> i hope that has clarified the point raised by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> there is no question of a reluctance to answer <e> <s> my noble friend said that i cannot answer but if he thought that i could not answer it i wonder why he asked the question in the first place <e> <s> i would merely say that the million which goes into food from britain goes towards assisting marketing and assisting presentation displays and that will refer to the whole concept right across the board of marketing food for britain <e> <s> some of that may come from retailing places some from producers and some may come from co-operatives <e> <s> my noble friend is right to ask how much will actually go to the co-operatives <e> <s> however the answer is that it is quite impossible to say <e> <s> the whole purpose of this is that food from britain should be in a position to try to expand the sales of british foods wherever they come from of which that which comes from co-operatives will form a part <e>", "<cs> this seems to be a difficulty and we must be absolutely clear <e> <s> the noble lord said that if he understood me correctly whatever happened to food from britain commercially on the marketing side there would still be government funding for the co-operative side <e> <s> the noble lord is quite correct <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> says that here is a quango which is going to be drawing on public funds to the extent of million for the next five years and he asks why it is not made a compulsory <e>", "<cs> the critical approach is fine provided that the criticism is based on accurate facts and figures <e> <s> the noble lord should not be too greatly persuaded by some of the things he reads <e> <s> i do not know whether i may just tell him this and give one example a lot of agricultural food is processed <e> <s> potatoes are one particular example where a tremendous quantity of potatoes grown go for manufacture <e> <s> this becomes an international business and certainly a european business <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the noble lords reasons for proposing the amendment he explained them on second reading and tonight <e> <s> he is anxious to ensure that paragraph of schedule can allow committees appointed by the council of food from britain to include council members among their number <e> <s> i am glad to tell him that the bill as drafted allows that <e> <s> it provides for two types of committees the first would consist of people other than council members of food from britain and the second would consist of people other than council members of food from britain as well as council members themselves <e> <s> so both types of committee are possible under the present drafting <e> <s> i think it is right to provide for both types of committee <e> <s> as the noble lord suggests there may be committees where the presence of a member of the food from britain council would be valuable as a means of communication of policy and other committees might consist of co-opted experts of food from britain staff members <e> <s> we therefore have provided for both of those <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it is introduced in response to the grave concern of the pig industry about the spread of aujeszkys disease <e> <s> the detailed provisions relate to powers which are to be given to the meat and livestock commission in order to enable them to raise a levy whose proceeds will be used to pay compensation and other costs arising from the introduction of a control and eradication scheme for aujeszkys disease which is a viral infection primarily affecting pigs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie for his welcome to this bill and for saying that there will be no delay from his side of the house <e> <s> i greatly appreciate that <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak with the leave of the house the levy will be placed upon the pigs as they are slaughtered and of

the way they did to the statement <e> <s> lord john-mackie said there was always a delay into the farming year before price proposals were eventually fixed and he hoped that would not be so this year <e> <s> i share that hope and i can say no more than that <e> <s> lord thurso asked what progress was being made in the discussions and i can tell him that progress is being made <e> <s> as with a car it starts slowly and gets quicker and that is probably the best way to describe the position in regard to the talks <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to answer as clearly as possible the questions of the noble lord <e> <s> first he referred to butter and asked whether the monthly deferment will continue or will there be settlement he did not use that word but i think that that is what he intended to indicate <e> <s> the position is that the council of ministers agreed to the tonnes coming in last october but the french and the irish have not agreed to the implementation of this by the commission <e> <s> until their problems of export <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> my right honourable friend has always taken the view with regard to the cap price propsals that the proposals which have at present been put forward are unjustified being too high and that is the stance that he takes <e> <s> with regard to the imports of milk i think <e>", "<cs> it is too early to say <e> <s> local education authorities have only just been invited to submit formal proposals for projects to be funded under the scheme including their proposals for financial arrangements <e> <s> only when the projects have been selected on the basis of these submissions will it be possible to make an estimate of the amount of money to be spent under the scheme in the years mentioned and the cost per student <e> <s> the number of young people under the scheme over those years will also depend on the precise nature of projects selected but it is anticipated that each of the projects in the pilot scheme might eventually cover some young people over the whole age range <e>", "<cs> the manpower services commission will be providing resources to defray the additional expenditure local education authorities will incur in educating young people under the scheme <e> <s> it will be for those authorities submitting proposals to say how much of such additional expenditure they are seeking from the commission <e> <s> local education authorities will be encouraged to take advantage of any other resources for example from local industry which might be available <e>", "<cs> her majestys government consider that support for farming both through the common agricultural policy and nationally remains important to the economy as a whole and is a valid use of resources <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord john-mackie for what he has said <e> <s> i am glad that he approved of the launch of food from britain the other day <e> <s> i agree that it was a remarkable event <e> <s> it was the first time historically that we have ever managed to get the producers the manufacturers the processers and the retailers all together in order to try to promote british food <e> <s> that is something which other countries have done but something on which we in this country have been lagging behind <e> <s> it is good to think that this has now been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now passed <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual we have had a fascinating debate on this subject <e> <s> it has covered a very wide area <e> <s> i should like to thank the select committee for having produced such a deep-thinking report and to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for his chairmanship of it <e> <s> it was a

what i mean <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i do apologise for misunderstanding or mishearing the noble lord <e> <s> be that as it may the same argument applies that it is too early as yet to discover how successful it has been but it will certainly provide us with a lot of valuable experience to guide the production of future programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that has put the record straight <e> <s> my noble friend said first that he was convinced it had not been a success and went on to say that it had been a success <e> <s> all i would say to him is that if he would be good enough to wait a little longer we will be able to assess the implications of the whole project and see how we can take it from there <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are considering the question of strikes in essential services very carefully in the light of recent events <e> <s> we shall not hesitate to take any measures which we are convinced would be both effective and beneficial

"<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that other countries have their own organisation and their own statutes which apply to the circumstances of those other countries <e> <s> it may be that they will not as he says readily apply in this country <e> <s> however it is correct that we should take a note of what other countries do to see whether that could be applicable in this country

comes down in the end to what are essential services <e> <s> a lot of people fall into that category <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been laws to prevent strikes but the fact is that they have not been used very often <e> <s> that is why section of the act was repealed <e> <s> but i think that my noble friends imagination runs away with him <e> <s> we would all hate the hypothesis to which he refers but we hope that union leaders employers and workers will use common sense <e>", "<cs> my lords that really is going quite a long way down the road of one proposition <e> <s> i can assure the

baroness lady llewelyn-davies may have meant that all those who take part this afternoon also happen to be consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a debate which remarkable though it may seem has shown a considerable degree of unanimity if only a unanimity over concern as to the way in which the common agricultural policy is going and in trying to find the right way for it <e> <s> if i may i would commend the words of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls when he says that it is important to try to think of the success of the common agricultural policy and not always to look at the failures or the shortcomings of it because whatever stage of development a thing reaches there will always be problems attached to it and those problems are there to be overcome <e> <s> it is important to see how successful it has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble lord that it is a very depressing state of affairs where apprentices are made redundant but in a recession many very unpleasant things happen of which that is one <e> <s> the noble lord asked what are the government going to do <e> <s> we are providing training grants relating to young people of for any employer who takes on an unemployed person and trains him <e> <s> that same grant is available to employers who normally take on apprentices provided that they take on three additional unemployed young people for every two people whom they have as apprentices <e> <s> in that case both the additional three and the two whom they normally take on will be reckonable for payment of the grant <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly our intention to try to make certain that as many people as possible know the facts <e> <s> however as i am sure the noble lord will be aware the whole of the youth training scheme is designed to guarantee a full years vocational training to every -year-old school-leaver who cannot find a job <e> <s> the scheme also aims to provide though it does not guarantee months of foundation training for -year-olds who are already in employment and for unemployed -year-olds <e> <s> that is a very considerable step and about million is going towards it <e>", "<cs> my lords there are arrangements for training which are carried out via the industrial training boards and the manpower services commission makes grants to them <e> <s> but the point that i should like to make perfectly clear to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos is that where those employers who normally take on apprentices take on three additional unemployed people they will receive the grant for the additional three as well as for the existing two who without the three would not have been reckonable for grant purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the two will be apprentices the three will be from the ranks of unemployed but both groups will be reckonable for the same grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for that supplementary question since the whole purpose of this particular aid is to try to blur the distinction between those who were unemployed and those who are apprentices <e> <s> it is part of the governments desire to try to help the training of young people and i would only re-emphasise the fact that the particular grant to which i referred relates only to the first year of training <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the british fishing boats bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill is introduced in order to tackle a growing problem for the united kingdom fishing industry that of a large influx of foreign mainly spanish fishing vessels which have re-registered as british <e> <s> their motive in re-registering has been in order to circumvent the european community licensing restrictions <e> <s> a by-product of their action has been though a substantial and adverse effect on the interests of our catchers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those of your lordships who have taken part in this debate and for the views which have been expressed <e> <s> it is not surprising that in a debate of this nature the views of the two kinsmen the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and the noble lord lord john-mackie characteristically do not agree <e> <s> that is something to which we have become used and charming it is and very helpful <e> <s> it is also not surprising when there is a degree of urgency that certain views of apprehension have been expressed <e> <s> i should like to deal with that if i may because it is important <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not know whether the spanish government consider it a fiddle or not <e> <s> what i can tell the noble lord is that on occasions fishermen from these re-registered vessels can land their fish in spain without the import quotas which are presented when our fishermen land the same fish in spain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad that the noble lord was not condoning it although i think he was getting a little close to it <e> <s> he is quite right in saying that they were operating within the law <e> <s> i merely come back to what i said earlier that they were doing so and that is the reason why we wish to change the law <e>", "<cs> my lords because that is so under a different form of legislation which goes back i believe if i remember correctly to the aliens act but i may need to be corrected on that <e> <s> i may have that wrong but that comes under a different form of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the reason why we hope to have and indeed are having consultations with both ireland and france as to how mutually these problems can be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had answered the last part of the noble baroness question in my reply part of which i will repeat <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is a matter of personal preference <e> <s> if the noble lord lord jenkins of putney wishes to buy uht milk in england he can do so but he is very wise not to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a simile which stretches the imagination beyond desirability and i hope that that does not happen with uht milk <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that in the united kingdom the data collected recently by the milk marketing boards indicate that over per cent <e> <s> of milk which is produced in the united kingdom has a total bacterial count of less than per millilitre <e> <s> i understand that in france only per cent <e> <s> of milk reaches this standard <e> <s> certainly that was the case in <e>", "<cs> i must say that when i first saw this amendment had been tabled i was querulous of the seemingly unholy alliance between the noble lord lord john-mackie on the opposition front bench and my noble friend lord saint oswald from the benches behind me <e> <s> the amendment did come as something of a surprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend the assurance that the government will do what they can to encourage the use of cashless pay <e> <s> but there is no intention of compelling people to accept cashless pay if they do not wish to do so <e> <s> as regards the rights of spouses to inspect their other spouses accounts that is fairly wide of the original question but i think that the noble earl is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for those remarks <e> <s> he is aware that the government are at the moment in the process of consulting with both the tuc and the cbi and there is a measure of agreement that the existing state of affairs is not satisfactory how it is improved will of course result from those discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly very unpleasant but it is accurate <e> <s> i hope that it might be found to be a better phrase than what the noble and learned lord insinuates <e>", "<cs> of course my lords credit transfers would be even lighter <e>", "<cs> my lords as per cent <e> <s> of all employees in the country at the moment are paid by cash i think that the noble lord lord kennet would accept that there would be some difficulty over consulting all spouses <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be to the convenience of your lordships if i were to repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the welcome which they have given to this statement <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord hampton that it is very important that everyone in northern ireland should do his best to show and to encourage other would-be investors that northern ireland is in fact a good place in which to invest <e> <s> as the statement says the government are prepared to play their part in doing that but substantially much of this depends upon the conduct of everyone in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson for his welcome too <e> <s> he has needless to say asked me a question to which i cannot give him an answer which he would find wholly satisfactory because it is difficult to say exactly what the amount of the corporation tax relief grant will be <e> <s> it depends on the number of firms who take it up the amount of extra employment and the amount of extra productivity <e> <s> the derating i referred to as being worth million the energy conservation measures should be worth about million and with regard to the advisory service and the manufacturing services it is really too difficult at the moment to be able to say exactly what they will cost <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot for the reasons i have given give the noble lord a precise reply <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the question put by the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> this is not a new disease <e> <s> it has been around for some time from if i remember correctly the early s <e> <s> it has not assumed bad proportions until recently <e> <s> we in the ministry of agriculture have always considered that there are many other diseases which are potentially more harmful but where this disease does exist it can have very penetrating effects <e> <s> that was the reason why we suggested to the pig industry that if they wished to eradicate this the ministry of agriculture would co-operate in all ways in identifying and dealing with the disease provided that the farmers themselves financed it <e> <s> the noble baroness is quite correct <e> <s> the more intensive any form of husbandry becomes the more liable are the animals or plants to disease <e> <s> that is a fact of life <e>", "<cs> my lords the consequential loss will come from the levy but it will form a different part of the actual payment which the farmer receives <e> <s> he will be paid the cost of the value of the slaughtered carcase and then paid separately the compensation for loss of profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry i did not make that point clear <e> <s> i thought i had done so by saying that the greatest expense is likely to come during the first year <e> <s> but it may take two or three years at the p levy in order to refund pig disease eradication fund limited <e> <s> therefore it is not anticipated that there will be an increased levy <e> <s> it will merely mean that the receipts may possibly continue for three years although the greatest expense will come during the first year <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose of the scheme was to encourage the planting of those varieties which are in popular demand <e> <s> in fact coxs make up about per cent <e> <s> of the national dessert apple area and spartan about or per cent <e> <s> bramleys are per cent <e> <s> of the culinary apple area <e> <s> while a number of other varieties are grown it is very difficult to market those adequately or on a national scale although there may be some local demand as i suggested earlier <e> <s> it is possible to allow for that by planting these additional trees which anyway have to be planted in order to act as pollinators <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move these regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move these regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether there are any standing orders about advertising in this house during speeches but if there were i am sure <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might interrupt the noble lord only to correct him because he is always totally fair <e> <s> it would not be inadvertently that we were putting the government off-side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett and i wonder whether with the leave of the house i might just reply to the points made by the noble lord lord beaumont about cost-benefit analysis because i know there is a point of anxiety here <e> <s> i should like to try to make the procedure quite clear <e> <s> when an authority or an internal drainage board wishes to carry out some improvements which require grant aid it applies to the minister of agriculture for approval and my department considers the whole nature of the application <e> <s> the first thing to be done is to satisfy itself that where there is any environmental sensitivity the appropriate conservation authorities such as the ncc have been consulted <e> <s> thereafter it has to be satisfied that any scheme has passed three basic criteria <e> <s> first it must be sound technically in other words it is going to do the job it is intended to do and that means that the walls of the weirs or whatever it may be should be structurally and technically adequate <e> <s> secondly the cost must be reasonable and thirdly the whole exercise must be economically worthwhile <e> <s> that is a statistical calculation which is carried out and i am bound to say it is a very complicated one not designed to determine whether a proposed improvement is suitable <e> <s> it is in fact a prudent in-house financial check which many businesses may carry out in order to ensure that the expenditure of funds is not wasted <e> <s> that is only one hurdle which any scheme has to get through <e> <s> thereafter if there is any area of conservation sensitivity then the whole matter is referred to ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the noble baroness lady white to start with even though she has not spoken on this amendment she pre-empted it <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite see that <e> <s> i think that the two issues what the cost-benefit appraisal does and how it is to be effected are slightly different <e> <s> that will be considered by the departments concerned and this discussion will be considered by them as well <e> <s> but i am bound to give the house the view which obtains at the moment which is that when a minister gives a decision on matters of this nature it is done in consultation with his counterpart <e>", "<cs> my lords i long to be as helpful as i can to the noble lord lord melchett but i think there is a difference between the first two amendments and this amendment <e> <s> the letter that my noble friend sent to the noble lord lord melchett and which he <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may have the leave of the house once again i do not wish to abuse the leave of the house to reply to the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> he has been peculiarly hard over this <e> <s> i did apologise at the beginning for the fact that

thought that when the employment bill was going through the noble lord lord mccarthy said that i was the only person who had not read the gennard report that i and the secretary of state had not read

absence of any private funding of the soil survey what percentage of the staff of the soil survey would find their employment curtailed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord gowrie for having introduced this bill this afternoon <e> <s> i apologise to him for something which i daresay he did not notice which was that regrettably i was not here for the first few minutes of his speech <e> <s> i should declare an interest by the fact that in concert with about million other people i am a depositor and a user of a trustee savings bank <e> <s> i should declare an interest insofar as i was chairman of the trustee savings bank of eastern england <e> <s> i was a director of tsb trustcard and also of the central trustee savings bank <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> while he has been saying that he has been looking at me with a penetrating eye <e> <s> i actually said that there were a great many loyal people million of them <e> <s> i hope he does not think that i was assuming that there were not a lot of loyal people because i said there were a lot <e>", "<cs> it is always fascinating to hear the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> i think that i should declare an interest as i did on second reading <e> <s> i was connected with the trustee savings bank as chairman of one of the banks and also as a director of trustcard and the central trustee savings bank <e> <s> i am not now but like the noble lord lord houghton i am a depositor <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord is wholly right about that <e> <s> but of course he is perfectly right if he says that the current deposit holders have the benefit of the deposit <e> <s> what the noble lord lord houghton is saying is that they not only have the benefit of the deposits but they should also have the benefit of the capital of the banks so that they will benefit twice round <e>", "<cs> without wishing to prolong this debate too long may i draw the attention of the noble lord lord stoddart to one matter on which i think he labours under a considerable misapprehension <e> <s> he quite reasonably said that any organisation operates under venture capital that that venture capital is the part which takes the risk and that therefore those who provide it should take part in any benefits which that risk produces <e> <s> he said that in the case of the trustee savings bank those people are the depositors <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord he is at fault <e> <s> those depositors have put their money in <e> <s> those depositors can remove all their money and you are left with a rump <e> <s> that rump does not belong to the depositors who have removed their money and it is what to do with the rump which remains that is the problem <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord that does not belong to the depositors <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord boardman has done the house a great service this afternoon by introducing this debate because there is no doubt that of all the pressing and anxious domestic issues which face the country at present unemployment heads the list and from that follows the stimulation of employment <e> <s> i was delighted to hear my noble friend lord youngs speech in which he depicted the successes which have come about as a result of deregulating business <e> <s> i am sure that he is right <e> <s> i congratulate him on it and i hope he will continue that work <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the preponderance of scottish noble lords in the house this evening i should like to add my good wishes to the bill as it goes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to declare an interest as one who has been involved in agriculture and farming throughout my life and also as chairman of the british agricultural export council whose purpose is to try to encourage exports from firms ancillary to agriculture which supply input to agriculture <e> <s> i should also like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord plowden and his committee for their remarkable report <e> <s> it is clearly a result of a great deal of work and a thorough review of the whole problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for introducing this motion at a most opportune time and for the way in which he opened the debate <e> <s> the questions of public and private monopoly are being discussed at the moment and there are the prospects of takeovers <e> <s> they are all very much matters of importance at the moment <e> <s> i have never quite understood how it is that when takeovers are in the air they become infectious <e> <s> one company starts to take over another company despite the fact that hundreds and sometimes thousands of millions of pounds are involved <e> <s> but that seems to be the pattern at present <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not gone on long enough with this statement <e> <s> can my noble friend re-confirm that the whole purpose of the statement was to elicit more accurate information and more accurate statistics and that it has nothing to do with the state of employment or unemployment to which noble lords opposite are referring <e> <s> will my noble friend not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that takeover bids by foreign companies of united kingdom companies which are financed by an international consortium of banks the collateral for which borrowing is the asset to be purchased i refer in this case to elders bid for allied lyons in which i must declare a modest interest being a minuscule shareholder are undesirable and should not be encouraged especially when the british company is not in a position to make a takeover bid for the foreign company <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful for the three reports that are the subject of this evenings debate <e> <s> i congratulate the committees on their endeavouring to wrangle over the problem as i congratulate the two noble lords who introduced in such a clear and simple way a very complicated subject <e> <s> the noble lord lord gallacher reminded the house that the common agricultural policy is at the heart of the european community and that if the policy were to be broken the community might be broken too <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord was absolutely right to reaffirm that point and to remind the house of it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to an entertaining speech from the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> he showed us where he felt that hope lay and i am bound to say that i was momentarily encouraged <e> <s> but i did not really believe it and when the noble lord finally sat down i did not think he did either <e> <s> i thought he had momentarily and uncharacteristically distanced himself from this side of the house when he said that my noble friend was the only friend that he had on this side and then he recovered the position by saying on penal matters <e> <s> the noble lord has many friends on this side of the house <e> <s> i was deeply impressed that my noble friend had instructed the noble lord to speak and told him what to say <e> <s> that shows she is very effective at lobbying <e> <s> i was the recipient of neither such privilege but maybe because my noble friend thought i was both beyond hope and beyond help <e>", "<cs> the noble earl really must not accuse me of doing things that i did not do <e> <s> i kept my mouth tight shut <e> <s> i think that it was my noble friend who sits next to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor for having asked this question because many people would like to know what is the governments intention regarding the forestry commission <e> <s> i should declare an interest as i am a director of a firm which deals in private forestry namely the economic forestry group <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord walston especially when he says as he did at the outset that he is going to praise the government <e> <s> that is an occurrence of such rarity that i almost felt compelled to ask for a hearing aid <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend lord belstead for having introduced this bill <e> <s> i cannot help but feel a tinge of sorrow that adas is to be made to charge for its services other than those that are socially or environmentally important <e> <s> but at a time when increased production from agriculture is not now required it is difficult to justify the expenditure of public funds on showing farmers free of charge how to increase the efficiency of their businesses <e> <s> however i have a great deal of sympathy for the noble lord lord john-mackie when he says that there will be plenty of people who will want to go to adas for advice such as where do we go from here <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce is very persuasive in what he says but he has i think fallen into the trap of muddying the waters somewhat <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy for what the noble lord lord stoddart said <e> <s> i think the english is terrible <e> <s> but if the words are replaced with the words which the noble lord has on the marshalled list in fact what the minister will do is to be obliged to choose those who have the particular qualifications <e> <s> he cannot choose anyone who does not have those qualifications <e> <s> if the words used in the original drafting are continued with the minister may choose people who have those qualifications but he can choose others who have not <e> <s> i think lord stoddarts amendment considerably curtails who the minister can choose <e> <s> for all that i hope the english can be improved <e>", "<cs> may i put one point which i think is of relevance <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord stoddart seeks to make smaller the circle of people from whom the minister can make his choice <e> <s> if we go back to the words that he did not like <e>", "<cs> may i add to this obscurantism and perhaps throw a little clarification on it <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett has not said what he means by his amendment <e> <s> as i understand it at the moment the minister appoints the hill farming advisory committee from among those people who he feels are competent in hill farming <e> <s> what i think the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not only the climate of the western highlands of which my noble friend lord stanley seems to be ignorant with the greatest of respect to him it is also the practices and procedures of your lordships house <e> <s> he keeps on saying that he will have to come back to the matter on third reading <e> <s> third reading is not another committee or report stage <e> <s> it is supposed to be an occasion when the government can put forward amendments on points to which they have agreed and on areas in which they look forward to making improvements in the bill <e> <s> i respectfully suggest that it is not an occasion to re-run the arguments which we have all heard all over again simply because he may happen to have a fuller house then <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that there is a difficulty which the noble lord lord melchett has spelled out <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunt in a charming speech if i may say so pointed out how he had his wits sharpened <e> <s> he said that as night follows day the amendment should be accepted <e> <s> my night does not follow day in quite the same way as the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone is quite rightly concerned about conservation and particularly over the last few years an immense amount of work has been done and many steps have been taken to ensure conservation <e> <s> it seems to me that we have at the moment the national parks sites of special scientific interest areas of outstanding natural beauty environ-mentally sensitive areas and landscape special development orders and i would ask my noble friend to say when he replies whether he thinks there is some facet which is inadequately covered because it seems to me that we have so many of these things and if we are not careful we are going to have yet more and nobody will know where they are or whether any part of their land is or is not covered by some order <e> <s> while the conservation of the land and the countryside is quite correct and quite proper i think we have to be careful not to cover ourselves with such a multitude of bureaucratic regulations that nobody knows where they are or how they are going to be operated <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may be permitted one thought <e> <s> i think that everyone has a great deal of sympathy with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and the noble lord the leader of the opposition so far as the congestion of the timetable is concerned <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord harris has said there is nothing new in that it has happened constantly year after year whichever party happened to be in power <e> <s> however there is one significant difference and that is that in the past years the number of people who are members of your lordships house has increased very considerably and with that increase goes seemingly an obligation to participate which is wholly right <e>", "<cs> my lords i should declare an interest as i am a member of the council on the executive board of food from britain <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether he agrees that the ability of the individualistic factions of the industry not to make a total commitment to food from britain has been both irresponsible and debilitating <e> <s> does he also agree that it would be quite wrong if the council were to become a farmer-funded/farmer-managed organisation and will he ensure that it does not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords does that reply mean that the cracks that are found now were not apparent when the aircraft were looked at previously and is it safe to travel in aircraft with cracks <e>", "<cs> if amendment no <e> <s> a has been called surely it is not right that we should go back to an amendment which has already been passed <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will sympathise with the noble lord lord hacking but if we have moved on to a subsequent amendment it would be wrong to go back <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to be quite intent on making our last evening a long evening <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch has introduced a very important subject <e> <s> i intend to break the rule which i have always held which is that unless you have been to south africa you really have almost no right to express a view upon it <e> <s> i have not been to south africa and therefore i do not have a view upon apartheid that i would care to divulge or discuss because i have always been of the view that whatever opinion you may have about that particular regime if you went to south africa you would return with a different view <e> <s> it may be a stronger view it may be a more understanding view but it would be a different view <e> <s> what i am concerned with is not to speak about apartheid but about our reactions to it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the policy which was recently adumbrated by her majestys opposition to do away with nuclear power stations and revert to coal-fired stations will in fact add to an already bad situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house owes a great debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord harris of high cross for introducing this topic today on the matter of compensation which has been paid to companies taken over by nationalisation <e> <s> i am bound to say that i feel a certain tinge of sorrow for my noble friend lord lucas <e> <s> it fell to a conservative government the last one to administer a law which was passed under a labour government and to which the conservative party when it was in opposition and indeed later when in government was deeply opposed <e> <s> my noble friend will no doubt seek to defend what the government have done <e> <s> i am motivated to take part in this debate because there has been manifest unfairness and i should like to see that unfairness aired debated and rectified <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put a question to the noble lord before he sits down <e> <s> quite correctly he has addressed his mind to the fact that the price should be what a willing buyer will pay to a willing seller <e> <s> he has not addressed his mind to what is the price of a certain article which has no willing buyer and willing seller because it is not quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for giving way <e> <s> does the noble lord mean by that answer that he therefore considers it fair to pay million for million of cash and million of assets <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i crave your lordships indulgence because i have a long-standing engagement this evening which will i fear make me leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> i apologise in advance for having to do so <e> <s> i also take the opportunity to congratulate my noble friend lord derwent on what i thought was a quite outstanding maiden speech <e> <s> he provided not only experience but intellectual originality in what he said and i congratulate him on that <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how the inspectors who are to be appointed can chase up vat evaders when such people are paid in cash <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> my lords can i ask my noble friend the leader of the house whether the noble lord lord gladwyn was not out of order in asking three questions instead of one and reading the lot <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a privilege to hear the noble lord lord obrien <e> <s> unlike the noble lord i have not had the privilege of being employed by the banking system for years <e> <s> i am quite certain in view of what he has said this evening that he need have no worries as to the future <e> <s> i should declare an interest in that i am a director of an insurance company <e> <s> however it is not in relation to insurance companies that i wish to address my remarks this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords what kind of thermometer reads a temperature of million degrees centigrade without melting <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is dangerous ground when the bbc uses its influence to become a body of inquisition <e>", "<cs> my lords i had wished to make two points this afternoon but i am constrained to make a third <e> <s> i shall put the third first <e> <s> it is to refer to the speech of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i found it a fascinating speech one which i both enjoyed and respected <e> <s> with his customary intellectual clarity the noble lord asked a number of very pertinent questions on why crime is as it is and why the state of our society is as it is <e> <s> the questions that he asked ranged from matters of religion to problems of the nuclear age and of family life <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble earl because i did not think that he was going to get on to that subject <e> <s> i would merely say to him that although i admire greatly his courtesy and generosity towards my forebear he will understand that i take a view contrary to him on the subject which he has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider encouraging the community to accept a tax on nitrogen fertilizers to be applied across the community <e> <s> does he agree that if that were to happen it would help to deal with the nitrate problem to which he referred and it would also reduce the supluses in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies may i say that i have found his speech absolutely fascinating <e> <s> it has entered a whole sphere which i did not know about <e> <s> i did not know that children were in the habit of sliding through bunk beds and hanging themselves <e> <s> it seems to me quite extraordinary <e> <s> can my noble friend say how often <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord carter for introducing this subject which is of great importance <e> <s> when the noble lord refers to the needs and problems of disabilities most of us know what he has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am among those who are glad that the report did not suggest having a speaker in your lordships house <e> <s> that would be quite disastrous and alter the whole character of the place <e> <s> it would encourage endless points of order as it does in the other place <e> <s> therefore i am glad that that was not proposed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but you can always call order <e> <s> or you can say question or speech and if the noble lord goes on too long it is always possible to get up and ask the leader of the house whether he does not think that the noble lord opposite is abusing the procedures <e> <s> so there are a variety of ways in which this can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord carter for putting down the question <e> <s> i am particularly grateful because only last week i intended to put down a question along similar lines <e> <s> in looking through the order paper i found that the noble lord had already done so <e> <s> we are grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not actually say that i applauded the cuts in research <e> <s> i said that i applauded the cuts in government expenditure across the board in which research had to play its part <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend for a moment because she made quite an important statement <e> <s> i want to get it absolutely clear <e> <s> did my noble friend say that the government did not wish to see any reduction in the amount of work done by research and development and the amount of personnel involved <e>", "<cs> my lords had it not been for the debate in your lordships house yesterday it would have given me great pleasure to congratulate my noble friend on his maiden speech <e> <s> however as it was considered that it would be inappropriate for other speakers to do so i shall desist <e> <s> i should declare an interest <e> <s> i am involved in agriculture and forestry and i am a director of a forestry company <e>", "<cs> my lords that is fine <e> <s> the noble lord has it on both counts he gets what is in the bill and what is not in the bill so he should be well satisfied

my noble friend lord belstead on using those words <e> <s> it is those features which the bill seeks to conserve <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i did not misunderstand my noble friend <e> <s> i understood him perfectly <e> <s> i just disagreed with him <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that while it is entirely appropriate and in order <e>", "<cs> my lords if sas eats up bcal will bcal become a foreign airline <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to add a few comments as my name is associated with one of the amendments <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord winchilsea and i tabled amendment no <e> <s> only to find that the noble lords lord williams and lord morton had put down precisely the same amendment therefore we find ourselves in happy partnership <e> <s> the noble

want to push my noble friend unduly far <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend this question <e> <s> none of us wants to put him in an embarrassing position <e> <s> i accept entirely that he wishes to consider it although it worries me that he says he wishes to consider the principle <e> <s> but if he wishes to consider it will he let us know before the report stage the conclusions of his considerations <e> <s> otherwise we are bound to put down a similar amendment at report stage <e> <s> that is not the way in which to conduct the business of the house <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> without wishing to weary the committee i wish to give my noble friend time to compose his thoughts <e> <s> i should like to take up the suggestion that the noble lord lord williams made <e> <s> is there a possibility at a later date but at this stage of the bill of putting down an amendment on which my noble friend would be able to give his initial views <e>", "<cs> i was only trying to be helpful to my noble friend the minister but my noble friend lord mottistone is trying to be destructive <e> <s> all i said was that amendment no <e> <s> could be the vehicle by which the minister could get himself out of the hole in which he is <e> <s> in that respect i think my comments are helpful <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i want to ask my noble friend this question <e> <s> he says that there are certain areas that may be badly affected if this amendment were to be put forward and accepted <e> <s> who would be badly affected <e> <s> it seems to me that those who would be badly affected if this amendment is not accepted are so plain so obvious and so vast <e> <s> he has given us no indication of who would be badly affected if the amendment were accepted <e>", "<cs> it just shows how complicated the present situation is <e> <s> i can only wish the noble lord lord donaldson and his advisers the best of luck in finding out whether he is within or without the law <e>", "<cs> that comes back to the remark of the secretary of state when he said that this will be an additional tax <e> <s> my understanding is that the profit made on blank tapes is about three times that which is made on recorded tapes before the levy <e> <s> even if a levy were introduced the profit on blank tapes would still be almost twice that on recorded tapes <e> <s> therefore i do not believe that there is any likelihood of the cost of the tapes increasing <e>", "<cs> if that young lady and others like her were to create music and then found that the number of home copies was six times the number of records sold through the shops <e> <s> i think that there would be a legitimate cause for complaint <e> <s> these people would say here we are providing the music and the records and we are getting nothing for it <e>", "<cs> that entirely depends on the nature of the tape that is produced <e> <s> those tapes that are used for instance on dictaphones and recording machines which people use in their businesses would not be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is one of the easiest things in the world to say that something is in a parlous state <e> <s> is it not a fact that despite the requirements for the future more money is now being spent on the health service than ever before <e> <s> there are more doctors and more dentists and more operations are being carried out <e> <s> is it not a fact that one problem is that modern machines and equipment are progressively becoming geometrically more expensive <e> <s> is that not one of the difficulties in financing the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the case to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> he is quite correct in saying that mr patel came to this country <e> <s> he came on a temporary visit and having applied for a more permanent permission to stay required to have back his passport <e> <s> when he asked for the return of his passport he was advised that he would need to obtain clearance from the authorities in kenya before returning to this country <e> <s> he failed to obtain that clearance <e>", "<cs> my lords i must reassure the noble lord that it is not the medical condition which was the cause of mr patels rejected application it was the fact that he left the country and was warned that he would have to start the application process again <e> <s> he failed to do that and turned up without the correct clearance certificates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his kind welcome <e> <s> i feel a little like the rubber ball that has bounced back but i appreciate his welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be quite improper for me to say what points should be taken up by a member of another place whoever that is <e> <s> i can only assure the noble lord lord hatch that these matters are considered very carefully <e> <s> while there may be reasons about which the noble lord is concerned this gentleman was warned that if he went back and removed his passport the process would have to start again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether or not that requires a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully realise that this is a serious matter <e> <s> i think that my noble friend may be in error <e> <s> what i believe the judge said was that he would send a transcript of the proceedings to my right honourable friend <e> <s> that has not arrived <e> <s> it has not therefore been considered appropriate for my right honourable friend to reply to something on which he has not yet received any specific information <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be quite inappropriate for me to say what was in my noble friends mind when he put down his question <e> <s> in so <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise the problem and my noble and learned friend is quite correct to suggest that this is a matter which causes great concern <e> <s> it is correct to point out that of the two cases which were mentioned one man was given only three months parole at the end of a seven-year sentence for offences of robbery and he committed further offences while on parole which came to light only as the result of investigations into other offences committed after the parole licence had expired <e> <s> the other man to whom the judge referred committed the offence of rape for which he was given life imprisonment months after his last prison sentence had ended when in fact he was a free man <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord mackie of benshie inferred an unfortunate result from what i said it was not that during the period of this government parole was stricter <e> <s> what i said was that the facts referred to and <e> <s> they refer to all instances of parole and not necessarily those relating to crimes of violence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to that is that i am aware of what my noble friend considered to be the inference behind the question asked by my noble and learned friend and that asked by the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i should say this because it is important my right honourable friend is very concerned when acts of violence are committed by people throughout the country whether they are on parole or not <e> <s> he has set up a committee under my noble friend lord carlisle to undertake a review of the whole of the parole system <e> <s> that committee is at present sitting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for making his position clear on the issue <e> <s> but this is a matter of concern <e> <s> the parole board is doing an excellent job of work but my right honourable friend considered it prudent to review the whole of the parole system simply because people are rightly concerned when offences against the public take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i may be in danger of being a postbox <e> <s> i hear what my noble friend says <e> <s> i think that there is a great deal of virtue in what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made a serious point <e> <s> he is quite right to make that point and it is reflected by many people <e> <s> prisoners serving sentences of over five years for offences of violence and drug trafficking are not released on parole other than in very exceptional circumstances <e> <s> in only approximately per cent <e> <s> of those recommended for parole were recalled for committing further offences <e> <s> those are the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there would be great merit in changing the name of the act because the function remains an important one that we should be able to have protection in the event of a hostile act <e> <s> the fact is that arrangements now enable that act to be used for peacetime purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords there are plenty of protections available in the event of nuclear war but that has nothing to do with civil protection in peacetime <e> <s> the noble lord will agree that the precautions being taken against troubles which might occur in international war can be used for civil purposes <e> <s> i do not see that there is much point in altering that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his kind remarks <e> <s> i also congratulate him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should have used my words a little more carefully and should have said that there are plenty of preparations for defence in times of war <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord gladwyn that is no reason whatsoever for taking no protection measures against nuclear war <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly satisfied that there are sufficient powers for local authorities to make use of such protection as they require for these emergencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the number of people who have said that they wish to join this association but the noble lord will be aware that when there is a request for recognition one first has to go through certain channels of communication <e> <s> that is the process we are now going through <e> <s> we will make a decision as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords all matters raised by the noble lord lord mishcon are of interest and concern <e> <s> of course he is correct that those matters are being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> it is one of the considerations which will be taken into account <e> <s> however my noble friend will realise that the government have to satisfy themselves on such matters as financial viability independence and other industrial relations issues <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of a right of veto but it is necessary to consult them <e> <s> i would tell the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that the prison officers associations comments were received only on st january and those of the national union of civil and public servants on the home office trade union side have not yet been received <e>", "<cs> my lords they decided to leave the organisation of which they were members which used to be the governors branch of the society of civil and public servants <e> <s> that was then transformed into another organisation which they left because they felt their views were not being properly represented <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for having given us the opportunity today to debate this matter <e> <s> i should say at the outset that the government have looked forward to this and have looked forward to the opportunity of hearing your lordships views because the report of sir philip woodfield and his team is a document of the first importance for the future of charitable endeavour in this country <e> <s> knowing your lordships deep concern for charities it is appropriate that it should be debated for the first time in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl asks about abuses which occur when charitable funds go abroad <e> <s> he may be aware that the government took action against this in the finance act <e> <s> a certain amount of work has been done <e> <s> it is too early at present to assess whether more needs to be done <e> <s> we shall bear those points in mind when we are considering legislation for that part of the woodfield report which deals with abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords i can indeed say one word about scotland <e> <s> i had intended to say it had i not been caught by the clock and having attended yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords having attended yesterdays procedure committee which went on for approximately two hours about the length of speeches and about a suggestion that the clocks should change to different colours and that nobody must go over his allotted time i had the figure of minutes in mind and i realised that i was getting over the -minute limit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the two noble lords for the welcome even if partial that was given to the statement <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is ingenious if i may say so in asking me to give an undertaking as to what will appear in the governments white paper <e> <s> with the greatest of respect i suggest that it would be best if the noble and learned lord were to wait until the white paper arrives although his remarks will obviously be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all these matters are high in my right honourable friends mind but i merely remind the noble lord and indeed the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that what my right honourable friend was saying was no indication of government policy <e> <s> he was merely taking part in a public debate on a matter of public interest and indicating the kind of areas which the white paper might cover <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has put down a motion on the secret services for about a weeks time <e> <s> on the general point i would merely say that the government have been discussing and considering these matters since april last year and it is right that we should wait until the conclusions on those deliberations are available which should be in about june this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby gives the government credit for taking action whereas previous governments have not done so <e> <s> i can only tell him that he must wait until the white paper appears <e> <s> it would be quite wrong for me to prejudge it or to give the noble lord any assurance as to what will happen <e> <s> i can tell him that the matter is under acute consideration <e> <s> my right honourable friend is aware of the problems and hopes to put forward the governments view on how those problems should be overcome <e> <s> having done that it is of course up to parliament to decide whether or not those views should be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord annan is competing in the stakes of ingenuity with his other noble friends <e> <s> i hear what he has to say but i have no intention whatever of saying what will be in the white paper because neither i nor the government know <e> <s> they are still considering <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time <e> <s> i think i am acting as a conduit between the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and some other noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the reaction of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> as we know the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is a person who is a great expert on these matters having been a prosecutor at the nuremberg trials <e> <s> what he has said is of great importance <e> <s> when he said that these issues bring back painful memories he struck a chord which will evoke sympathy throughout the house and indeed throughout the country <e> <s> they are very painful memories indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mason that it should be a quiet low-key inquiry <e> <s> that indeed is what we hope it will be <e> <s> it will be necessary to wait and see the report of the inquiry before i can say in what way the results will be made public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry <e> <s> it was in fact in november <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very anxious to close any loopholes that may exist with regard to international drug offences <e> <s> i am surprised at what the noble lord lord harris said because the island authorities have been commended for the assistance they have given by for example the metropolitan police the american drug enforcement agency and the federal bureau of investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate and endorse the concern of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> we wish to see these loopholes if there are any filled as soon and as efficiently as possible <e> <s> i am bound to tell the noble lord that the bank of england does not have any authority over the banking systems in the islands <e> <s> however there are frequent discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only tell the noble lord that there is a problem in so far as jersey and guernsey are their own authorities making their own laws <e> <s> those laws will be compatible with ours but the noble lord lord harris will be the first to recognise that the drug trafficking offences act is a complicated piece of legislation which we are even now having to amend in the criminal justice bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to go too far down that particular line of thought <e> <s> i have explained at some length why the government took the action that they did <e> <s> the reason is because the government intend to produce a white paper when their own views are known which can then have the full panoply of discussion which the noble lord lord hatch is so anxious to see <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an operational matter and i do not propose to be drawn down the line of what we do and how we operate the security services of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i evidently misheard the important word not <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord kennet for correcting me over that and i apologise for having put words into his mouth which were precisely the reverse of those he used <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall take up the noble lord on his offer <e> <s> it is a question of detail and i shall find out the exact facts and write to him about them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord because i should not like him to be under a misapprehension <e> <s> i am enjoying his speech so much that i should not like him to confine his remarks to only one point because he has a quarter of an hour of the debate left <e>", "<cs> my lords in concert with everyone else i should like to thank my noble friend lord rodney for having introduced this debate this evening <e> <s> it has been of enormous interest and it is one which i believe has evoked the sympathy of the whole house <e> <s> it is a debate about which everyone is unanimous in their concern for the way in which young people are brought up and for the way in which people can inadvertently stray or be pulled away from what most of us would consider to be the straight and narrow path <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships who have spoken for the general support which has been given to this draft order <e> <s> the noble lord lord shackleton was kind enough to congratulate me on becoming deputy leader of the house of lords and to say that it was part of my business to ensure that your lordships are happy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is as usual courteous <e> <s> in fact the newspapers and indeed the bbc got it wrong <e> <s> what will happen is precisely what is happening now <e> <s> there will be legislation as there is now a similar kind of legislation but that legislation will be renewable every single year as it is now <e> <s> when the bill comes before your lordships then the whole panoply of the contents of the bill can be considered <e> <s> i really think that it is misrepresenting what is happening when the inference is that this legislation will be permanent and immutable <e> <s> even my noble friend lord colville i say even i should leave that word out <e> <s> my noble friend lord colville has said that it is unreasonable to assume that the problem of terrorism will go away <e> <s> if the problem of terrorism does not go away the government have a right and a duty to bring in legislation to protect citizens against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the noble lord for explaining that and for obeying as he puts it the convention <e> <s> i would rather have said that he was following the convention <e> <s> i shall certainly take account of the real points of concern which have come from all parts of the house this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look into it because it is a very important matter and these penalties are severe <e> <s> all i would say to the noble lord lord gifford is that we realise these particular difficulties <e> <s> we believe that it is right to continue these powers for the safety of the people as a whole but i realise that there are drawbacks to which the noble lord has reasonably referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for the welcome in whole and in part and in some cases in no part which you have given the bill this evening <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby was kind enough to apologise for not having been in his seat when i made my opening remarks <e> <s> he was not alone in that <e> <s> i was not in my seat at the appropriate time either because regrettably the previous business went more quickly than i anticipated <e> <s> i apologise to the house again for that omission of substance in which i take no pride <e> <s> the noble lord was not alone <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so and i do not defend it in the slightest but i am merely referring to the pictures to which the noble lord drew attention <e> <s> i do not think that the connection with alcohol was necessarily there <e> <s> however even if it <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case the operation of comic relief is controlled by both company law and tax law <e> <s> my right honourable friend is concerned to see that legislation is produced during the lifetime of this parliament further to control charities <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the requirement imposed upon the noble lord lord mishcon by his grandchildren <e> <s> he said that he was not wearing those facial additions <e> <s> i did not realise that he was not <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right to express concern about the position of charities in general <e> <s> she will probably be aware that sir philip woodfield carried out an efficiency scrutiny and made a report <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary has accepted that report and intends to introduce legislation during the lifetime of this parliament to cover many of the points about which the noble baroness is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord was wholly right in respect of his last point <e> <s> however i can tell him that certainly one of the matters which is being considered is how best that aspect should be dealt with in such legislation as may be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not yet been decided whether to issue a white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is likely to be published within the next few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us have found making a maiden speech in your lordships house a rather daunting experience some of us still feel daunted when making speeches <e> <s> however i hope that the noble lord lord jakobovits will not find it such a daunting experience today and we look forward to hearing what he has to say <e> <s> he will always find a warm welcome here not only for what he says but also for his presence <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever else this debate has produced it has been remarkable for one thing and that is the maiden speech of the noble lord lord jakobovits <e> <s> i said in my opening remarks that i for one and i know a great many other noble lords look forward to his future speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant to say that one might have been forgiven for thinking that <e> <s> i know perfectly well that the noble lord knows that there must be control over immigration <e> <s> i know that everyone knows that if only for the very reasons which the noble lord lord jakobovits put forward namely that we have to look after those who are here and that we cannot allow limitless immigration <e> <s> therefore the argument is not over whether there should be a control but on how that control should be exercised <e> <s> inevitably there will have to be criteria connected with that control <e>", "<cs> do not let him reflect too hard then <e> <s> he said that we were doing away with the right of appeal <e> <s> there is no question of doing away with the right of appeal <e> <s> perhaps your lordships are not aware of the sorts of problems which are encountered <e> <s> clause has been complained of as being too draconian <e> <s> that was a phrase which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones used <e> <s> the clause is designed to get to people who are already breaking the law <e> <s> perhaps i may give the house an indication of what may happen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always careful and clever <e> <s> if he will be kind enough to read what i say he will see that all the way through there is the possibility of appeal when compassionate grounds can be taken into account <e> <s> only at the final stage when it is a matter of deportation and every other hoop has been gone through is the question is that man here legally or not <e> <s> if it is decided that he is here illegally then perhaps he has been here illegally for up to seven years <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not surprise me <e> <s> well it does surprise me in one respect because that is a lot but it does not surprise me in another because i have seen the volumes of letters and the amount and procession of appeals that can be gone through in order to obtain a just and fair answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but he baited me just a trifle <e> <s> of course i was only saying that that was my own first reaction it was not my advice <e>", "<cs> my lords brevity is always a great virtue <e> <s> i admire respect and thank the noble lord lord mishcon for his example <e> <s> i wish that i were able to emulate it but were i to do so your lordships may think that i am treating the matter with truculence and so i shall be marginally longer than the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord said that both he and i because of our respective duties were fasting <e> <s> he is right <e> <s> i fancy that it is doing me more good than him <e>", "<cs> did the noble earl wish to say something <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case there is a marginal difference between the noble earl and myself <e> <s> i shall come on to explain why <e> <s> we should not get involved in a remark which was not as <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to explain to the noble lord the difficulty that is presented with the actual number of places to which prisoners can be sent <e> <s> it would be wrong for me to tell him that on no occasion would those cells be used <e> <s> what i have said is that we agree that they are unsatisfactory for any long-term use <e> <s> it is clearly in the interests of those who are responsible for prisoners to put them in places which are most suitable for them <e> <s> on occasion those which are not suitable have to be used <e>", "<cs> my lords it is necessary on occasion to use places which are unsuitable <e> <s> if we do not use such places we overcrowd other places <e> <s> the difficulty that presents itself to us is whether or not those cells should be used at all when not to use them may thereby overcrowd other places and whether it is better to use such cells for short-term uses <e> <s> i take the point which the noble lord has made and i shall see that the matter is looked into <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a complication here which i think that i should address to my noble friend <e> <s> there are two organisations one is reading matters limited and that is a charity the other is reading matters bookshop limited which is not a charity <e> <s> it is by no means clear whether either the charity or public money is involved in the publication or production of any literature or merely purveys it <e> <s> concerning the literature to which my noble friend has referred whatever one may feel about its contents it is by no means clear that it is provided out of ratepayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer to the observations which noble lords were kind enough to make in saying that i had got it wrong <e> <s> i say to them courteously that i think that i am right <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for having said that my manner of answering questions was acceptable <e> <s> i am much more concerned that the questions themselves should be acceptable <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords second question it is perfectly true that there have been no complaints against this charity until now <e> <s> a complaint has been made and the chief charity commissioner is inspecting it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a totally different question which the noble lord prosecuted on a number of occasions when we discussed the bill concerned <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it haringey council supplies the funds to pay for two full-time workers in reading matters bookshop limited <e> <s> the connection between reading matters limited and reading matters bookshop limited is a matter for the chief charity commissioner and he is looking into it <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter has been investigated <e> <s> we are not aware of any information which would suggest to us that the royal charter has been breached <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the concern that my noble friend has expressed and i accept it <e> <s> programme content is a matter for the bbc <e> <s> it is not a matter for the government to interfere in <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern which the noble lord expresses <e> <s> as i understand it the programme was a piece of fiction and was not depicting everyday life <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept entirely my noble friends reflections on the united states air force and the way that its members have helped not only this country but nato <e> <s> it is a matter of regret if programme contents of whatever nature are such as to depict facts which do not occur <e> <s> i repeat that as i understand it this programme was a work of fiction <e> <s> i know that your lordships will understand if i say that it is not the problem or the duty of the government to interfere in the content of bbc programmes <e> <s> if noble lords are concerned the correct person to write to about this is the chairman of the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for that supplementary question but i am not quite certain whether it was helpful or unhelpful <e>", "<cs> my lords what the united states puts on its television screens is a matter for the united states <e> <s> what is put in bbc television programmes in the united kingdom is a matter for the bbc <e> <s> the concern which i absolutely understand and which quite rightly has been expressed in your lordships house today on this subject is such that it might be helpful if i were to draw your lordships remarks to the attention of the chairman of the british broadcasting corporation <e>", "<cs> the problem is my lords that some people considered that it was related to reality <e> <s> programme content must be a matter for others and for ones personal interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not seek nor is it my duty to defend a programme which was put on by the british broadcasting corporation <e> <s> as i said it is not the duty of government to interfere with what is shown <e> <s> however i shall draw your lordships remarks to the attention of the chairman of the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for making that point <e> <s> it is helpful to know that the bbc will be informed of both sides of the argument by that council <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly take into account the representation which the noble lord has made <e> <s> with regard to the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the troubles when one draws attention to something that is undesirable <e> <s> many noble lords have expressed the view that this programme was undesirable and i should not dissent from their expressing that view <e> <s> however it is not right for the government to bring pressure to bear upon a broadcasting authority to determine what should or should not go into its programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i felt sorry for the noble lord lord hooson because all he did was to advise the government to proceed with caution and he then proceeded to get the stick <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his advice <e> <s> we are quite happy to take good advice from any quarter of this place <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i think that he must have misunderstood the nature of your lordships committee <e> <s> what i said was that the government said that this was a bill in which they did not seek to alter sunday licensing hours <e> <s> i said that i could not recommend that noble lords accept amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think noble lords should reject them because there would be difficulty in another place <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to provide another albeit limited exception to the general licensing hours <e> <s> bars and off-licences in the areas of airports which are open to the non-travelling public are subject to the controls on hours in just the same way as any other licensed premises <e> <s> if this amendment is accepted airport bars which are used not only by passengers and their friends and relatives but also by any other visiting members of the public will be able to serve alcoholic drinks from am to pm on sundays <e> <s> in other words there will be different licensing arrangements for these premises which can be frequented by the ordinary members of the public than there will be for licensed bars and pubs <e> <s> the restrictions on sunday trading at airports have been lifted and as a result of the licensing restaurant meals act restaurants may serve drinks with meals at any time of the day seven days a week <e> <s> to a significant extent therefore the needs of the airport authorities and the travelling public have been met <e> <s> i am not persuaded that a case has been made out for removing entirely the distinction between sundays and weekdays at airports as compared with anywhere else <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could persuade the noble lord of one thing before he thinks too heartily about having a division <e> <s> he says that the government do not trust people and that the travelling public are going to and from the airports <e> <s> it is perfectly true that on the air side of the airport the travelling members of the public can get drinks at all times of the day and night <e> <s> but ordinary members of the public who come and go in an airport can use the airport facilities in a way that they would not be able to use pub facilities <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord lucas for explaining his concern about drinking-up time <e> <s> however i am hound to say that i think that he is making one fundamental error <e>", "<cs> clause provides a safeguard against unforeseen problems which may arise from the afternoon opening of particular premises whether on-licence premises or registered clubs <e> <s> it is primarily intended to protect those who live and work in the vicinity of particular premises from the disturbance or annoyance which may arise but it also provides a locus for the police to prevent the occurrence of disorder which can be associated with particular premises in the afternoon <e>", "<cs> earlier on i had the audacity to thank and compliment the noble lord lord hooson on his wisdom in saying that the government should move with caution <e> <s> i hope that that compliment did not go to his head <e> <s> i fear i must say that he is wrong on this occasion <e>", "<cs> because if nobody in the locality thinks that the premises are disorderly making a noise or being in any way untoward it is the right of the licensee to be able to hold his pub open <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that this was a glorious occasion <e> <s> despite the fact that it is my noble friends amendment i should not have pitched it quite as high as that <e> <s> he refers to special hours certificates <e> <s> what his amendment refers to are essentially late night drinking licences <e> <s> they allow the sale and supply of alcohol up to two oclock sometimes up to three oclock in parts of the west end of london as an ancillary to music and dancing entertainment and to substantial refreshment <e> <s> the justices have no option as the law now stands but to grant a certificate if certain criteria are satisfied <e> <s> the existing provisions in clause give the justices discretion to grant or to refuse a certificate even though the criteria are met <e> <s> this will have the result that no longer will it be possible for the night club owner who finds his certificate revoked on grounds of noise and nuisance to nearby residents to apply at the next session of the justices for a certificate which then has to be granted as of right simply because the statutory criteria remain satisfied <e>", "<cs> i made no attempt to say that the amendment could not be accepted because the words of my noble friend were defective <e> <s> they may be defective in some small part but that is of no great difficulty <e>", "<cs> these amendments give greater flexibility to vineyards in respect of sunday hours <e> <s> they are not entirely without precedent <e> <s> registered private members clubs though they are required to take an afternoon break of at least two hours are otherwise free to fix their own sunday hours starting from noon and subject to a maximum total of five and a half hours ending at pm <e> <s> the amendments seek to extend a similar privilege to vineyards in recognition of the problems they face in catering for visitors and in view of the fact that they cannot normally take advantage of the evening opening hours allowed by law <e>", "<cs> clause provides that the licences shall be renewable as the noble lord lord morris said on a three-year basis instead of the existing annual basis <e> <s> to balance this and to provide a safeguard to protect the community from premises which give rise to serious complaints clause provides a new power which allows the licensing justices to revoke a licence at any licensing sessions on the same grounds as they may now refuse to renew <e>", "<cs> it has been explained that this amendment is designed to combat several problems associated with alcohol particularly those which arise at self-service outlets <e> <s> i think all of us are acutely concerned about where alcohol is abused and where it is used illicitly as the noble lord lord harris said or is purchased illicitly <e> <s> i should point out to the noble lord that this will not alter any illicit purchasing of alcohol <e>", "<cs> i find the argument of the noble baroness a trifle curious if i may say so <e> <s> both she and the noble viscount are concerned to ensure that young people do not drink when they should not and the bill is designed to strengthen that intention <e>", "<cs> of course the licensee would be able to show that he had exercised all due diligence although he thought that the person was under the age of and nevertheless sold him or her some drink <e> <s> it is up to him to try to find out <e> <s> however short of literally asking a question and possibly being given a wrong answer if he has shown all due diligence he is in the clear <e>", "<cs> although the law prohibits the employment of young people under in bars we have not thought it necessary to extend the same restriction to those employed in premises which happen to deal in wholesale quantities of alcohol or in off-licences <e> <s> in this matter we are supported by the working group on young people and alcohol <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i will ensure that if they are not so informed they are informed <e> <s> i realise that that is a very genuine and real anxiety and it is important that members of the security services should know that if they wish to avail themselves of the services of sir philip woodfield they may do so in good faith without fear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for pointing out the views of the nspcc <e> <s> i agree entirely with her that the availability of child pornography is totally obnoxious <e> <s> that is why we are endeavouring with our amendments to the criminal justice bill to make it an offence to possess as opposed to just to trade in pornography <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that the availability of pornography to children encourages those children unwittingly to become involved in pornography <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for that most helpful intervention <e> <s> i hope that all other amendments which the government intend to introduce not only on this bill but on all others will have the sympathetic consideration of the labour benches <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a happy position in which to be and in which i shall continue to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this is a question of a government putting pressure on another government <e> <s> it is a matter of the law being such that infringement of it can be enforced <e>", "<cs> my lords such research is always very difficult to quantify <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend this is not entirely the answer to her question that in the last two years people have been prosecuted for offences under the protection of children act and of them have been found guilty <e> <s> in that respect the amount concerned is not very large <e> <s> i cannot tell my noble friend of the total effect throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> i entirely agree with him <e> <s> that is the reason why we believe that the additions to the criminal justice bill will help a great deal <e> <s> it will now be an offence for anyone to possess any such material and not just to trade in it <e>", "<cs> that my lords is a totally different question <e> <s> i should be perfectly happy to answer a separate question if my noble friend would be good enough to take that course <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said that this bill was a matter of some complexity <e> <s> if such a distinguished noble and learned lord who is qualified in these matters finds it complex i still have hope <e> <s> it is a complicated matter anything that concerns immigration is complicated <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said that the clause was discriminatory and that by introducing the amendment which he has put down with a number of his colleagues from different parts of the committee the discriminatory nature of the bill as it stands would be removed <e>", "<cs> yes indeed it was the act <e> <s> i remember once being told by a civil servant the male embraces the female in the civil service <e> <s> i replied that i did not think you had to join the civil service for that <e> <s> it is of course true to say that in the normal course of events the two sexes go together <e>", "<cs> one of the great pleasures of being in this house is being able to hear good advocacy and we have heard the remarkable advocacy of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i say in all seriousness that it is a pleasure to hear it even if one may not agree with the conclusions or with the point which he is trying to make <e>", "<cs> that is all very fine but the noble lord did slightly sweep away the judgment of the european court of human rights because he said oh the government would say here comes the european court of human rights to solve all our problems <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the noble lord is suggesting that we add certain words <e> <s> i tried to explain to the committee that if we added those words we should not be eliminating discrimination but adding to it <e> <s> i made it perfectly clear why and gave the example of a person who was here in and one who was born later <e> <s> at the moment there is discrimination between the two <e> <s> if these words were to be added to the bill there would be discrimination between girls who were born before and after that time <e> <s> it really is not an answer to say that if we pass this amendment we shall all be in the clear that we would satisfy the european court of human rights and that there would be no discrimination <e> <s> there will be <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> of course sexual discrimination will be eliminated if we pass the amendment <e> <s> however this amendment will have other effects which will make it discriminatory <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon described the purpose of this amendment as a save-the-children fund <e> <s> i appreciate the reason that he has put down the amendment <e> <s> it puts us in difficulty because the amendment permits the repeal of section but it then adds extra conditions <e> <s> this would create a new category of people who would be entitled to come here freely

the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon puts one in considerable difficulty because he puts down an amendment to the bill and then argues about it on the assumption that the amendment means something different from what it actually means <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head in dissent but all i can suggest to him is that if he reads his amendment carefully he will find that it puts an obligation on every single adjudicator and every single tribunal to listen to all the facts of the case whatever those facts may be compassionate or otherwise <e> <s> there is an obligation <e>", "<cs> i sometimes think that i am rather like a puppet on a string <e> <s> before the noble lord sits down he always says i now listen to what happens and pulls the rope <e> <s> he

the person broken the law or not <e> <s> in all these cases running up to this the compassionate nature of the circumstances will be known and the adjudicator may take into account those compassionate circumstances <e> <s> it would be wrong to write in at this stage of a bill the fact that compassionate circumstances should be given merit equal to the fact that they have broken the law <e> <s> the compassionate circumstances will be known <e> <s> the point of clause is that the decision should be taken on the simple fact of whether or not a person has broken the law <e>", "<cs> i am not sure

committee that the adjudicator has the right to consider such circumstances as he wishes and that he can make recommendations should he wish to do so <e> <s> that is the position and i hope that the committee will agree that it is reasonable <e>", "<cs> nothing ceases to surprise me about this bill and the ramifications of immigration law <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord lord mishcon need worry because under the provisions of clause overstaying is considered to be one offence <e> <s> the offence is committed when a person first knows that he has overstayed and it continues to be committed throughout any period during which he is in the united kingdom thereafter <e> <s> there is only one offence although it will continue to be committed and therefore there can only be one prosecution <e> <s> i hope that satisfies the noble lord <e>", "<cs> that happy intervention from the noble lord lord mcnair prevented the puppet from rising quite as quickly as he normally does when

that the matter is as simple as that <e> <s> i do not think anything is as simple as that certainly not in this particular and peculiar area <e>", "<cs> if i am right in understanding the noble lord and i may not be right i believe that he is concerned with these amendments that the offence of overstaying is a continuing offence <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> in that case the position as the noble lord will know is that some doubt arose following two judgments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may again join in this happy debate now that we have got rid of the french and the latin and returned to english <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton behind me put his finger totally on the point <e> <s> if what the noble lords amendment did was to say as my noble friend did provided you have overstayed

ensure good relationships between the ethnic communities in our country and those people who have always been here <e> <s> he is quite right to say that we should do all that we can to encourage communities to settle and to feel as one that is what we want to do <e> <s> the noble lords concern was that clause works against that principle <e> <s> however i must say to him with the greatest of respect that i do not think it does <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has pointed out that he does not approve of illegal immigrants and i agree <e> <s> i think that there are two types of illegal immigrants <e> <s> there is the one who comes up the beach in the middle of the night tries to get in and deliberately avoids the immigration officer <e> <s> there was an example a short while ago where some people appeared in a van at dover <e> <s> they were welded into the van not just put into a back cupboard they were actually welded in <e> <s> they deliberately tried to avoid going through immigration and seeing the immigration officer <e> <s> we are all agreed that that type of action by a clandestine entrant is wrong <e>", "<cs> i think that there is some misconception here <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon is entirely right when he says that we are dealing with deportation orders <e> <s> we are dealing with illegal immigrants those who have come in illegally and those who have found that their stay is illegal <e> <s> the noble lord rightly says that there should be an appeal <e> <s> there will be an appeal but it will take place in the country from which the immigrant comes <e> <s> that is where the appeal procedure is considered <e>", "<cs> i wonder as the bullets go flying past whether we are not meeting up with each other <e> <s> we may be at slight odds here <e> <s> in explanation to the noble lord i would say that two matters are involved here <e> <s> one is where a person comes into the country who would not have been given permission to come in on the facts had it not been for the fact that he deceived the immigration officer <e> <s> that is one category of person <e> <s> to that category of person we say that when we discover the fact that he has been allowed in because of a falsity of information he should have the same treatment as if he had appeared and given the true information which would not have permitted him to come into this country <e> <s> therefore it is that moment when the deportation order is considered <e>", "<cs> i think that i understand the noble lords concern <e> <s> he has put it very fairly and very clearly <e> <s> i hope that i shall be allowed to consider what the noble lord has said and to see whether there are conditions which he may have identified which are extraneous to those which we believe have been identified <e> <s> i think that the conditions which we have in the bill are right but i shall certainly take into account what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment the noble lord lord bonham-carter said that he found an anomaly and he did not like anomalies and wanted to put it right <e> <s> perhaps we can see what the noble lords amendment proposes <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bonham-carter asked me to comment on the fact that we should be putting foreign nationals in a privileged position compared with british citizens which he thinks is unfair <e> <s> he referred to his little amendment and said that i had called the bill modest and reasonable <e> <s> of course it is modest and reasonable without the noble lords amendment which would make it unreasonable <e>", "<cs> i love such little short simple questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder knows perfectly well that within the community there are

can <e> <s> he was slightly provocative when he said that it depends whether the government are keen to allow people in or whether they want to place obstacles in the way of uniting families <e> <s> that is really going over the top if i might <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones says that this amendment goes to the root of the matter <e> <s> there is always the difficulty when one comes to affirmative and negative resolutions in deciding which is the more appropriate to use <e> <s> in drafting clause we have provided an opportunity for both houses of parliament to debate any regulations which are made <e> <s> we chose the negative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord invites me to comment and it would be churlish not to do so <e> <s> i do not believe that there is a point of principle here as regards charging because that has been done before <e> <s> that has been done under the british nationality act <e> <s> i can see that the concern of

should be asked to do so <e> <s> the carriers at least have had some involvement in that they brought the person here so it is not unreasonable that the expenses should fall to them <e> <s> that has been the position to date <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord airedale has asked questions about the holidays and the weather <e> <s> the actual question he put down on the order paper was about easter <e> <s> easter is a religious festival <e> <s> we think that it would be undesirable that the changing of the festival of easter should be undertaken without the agreement of the churches <e>",

the past years i never expected to find myself in this position <e> <s> my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> the method of calculating when easter should fall was established by resolution of the council of nicaea in ad <e> <s> it was given statutory authority in this country by the calendar new style act <e>", "<cs> my lords it is desirable that there should be agreement with all the churches of which the greek orthodox is one <e> <s> when my noble friend lord elton occupied this hazardous seat he wrote after receiving such a question from your lordships to the orthodox archbishop of thyateira and great britain to see if he could ask the ecumenical patriarchate in constantinople how matters stood on adopting a common date <e> <s> my noble friend was told in the reply that the second pan-orthodox preconciliar conference of the holy orthodox church was held in and considered the subject of the common celebration of easter by all christians <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> that occurs i believe because the holy orthodox church is still on the julian calendar whereas we are on the gregorian calendar <e> <s> we changed in and lost days in the process <e> <s> i understand that the holy orthodox church has been talking for some centuries about changing but has not yet decided to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a most appropriate note be it in the form of a question which the noble lord lord soper has addressed on this particular occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the point about changing the easter act is that it was suggested that this should only be done after we had had regard to the opinions officially expressed by other churches <e> <s> i am delighted if i may so put it that the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead did not succeed in changing it <e> <s> i am sure that he would agree that it is not for the government to change the date of easter it is a matter for the churches <e> <s> of course it is a complicated matter to know the date on which easter does fall <e> <s> i have done a little research <e> <s> i discover that it falls on the first sunday after the first full moon on or after the st day of march <e> <s> if the full moon occurs on a sunday easter day is the following sunday <e> <s> but the moon referred to is not the real moon of the heaven it is a hypothetical moon

my predecessors had been put by your lordships on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we want to start off with difficulties <e> <s> the noble lord lord leatherland says that the whole house will support the amendment and his noble friend lord ardwick says that the whole house will not support it <e> <s> that makes life very complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help

amendment to increase the pub hours from oclock to oclock <e> <s> the government did not accept that <e> <s> in committee i explained very clearly that the government had always decided that this bill should not interfere with sundays <e> <s> however a number of noble lords considered that it would be appropriate for family reasons to allow the sunday closing hour to be extended from oclock to oclock to enable people to enjoy their sunday lunches <e> <s> at that time i advised that the government could not accept that proposal but your lordships decided to do so <e> <s> my noble friend lord

wants another hour for clubs <e> <s> clubs can open until oclock on sundays <e> <s> therefore to suggest that they should be allowed another hour means that they should be allowed another hours drinking in the evening <e> <s> that is against the point of the governments bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this new amendment which the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has tabled is to allow good friday to be treated like any other weekday for the purposes of the licensing hours as applied to off-licences and not to on-licences <e> <s> it will not affect the hours on good friday for on-licence premises at all <e> <s> on sundays christmas day and good friday off-licence premises are permitted to sell alcoholic drinks between oclock and oclock and between pm and pm off-licence

right reverend prelate <e> <s> i am confused now not only by what i did not say but also with what i was trying to conclude as regards the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord brentford

was very much in favour of the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs said that we should adopt the principle if you drink you do not drive if you drive you do not drink <e> <s> that is a good policy to adopt but i do not think it is relevant to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has explained very fairly his amendment and i am grateful to him for doing so <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord sainsbury has supported it and has said that it would ease the position of the courts and of firms <e> <s> i understand that position but i do think that the transfer of a licence is in many ways analogous to the grant of a new licence and to that extent i think it is important that licensing justices should retain the right to ask applicants to appear before them <e> <s> this means that they can then retain a clear picture of who holds licences in their area which in itself is an important aspect of maintaining a proper control over all licensed premises in the district <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps with the leave of the house i may make one further intervention <e> <s> in considering the bill a large number of organisations were consulted including the police and magistrates <e> <s> it would not be correct for me to give the impression to the noble lord that they were both specifically <e>", "<cs> my lords before the question is put perhaps it might not be inappropriate as this is the last amendment with which we are to deal in the bill and this is our last business before we go away for easter for me to wish not only your lordships but everyone associated with this building a happy easter <e> <s> those wishes go not only to noble lords but as much to the staff the staff whom we see and the other staff whom we do not

even more confusion now because it appears that we are talking not just to his amendment but also to amendment no <e> <s> which deals with the asylum review board <e> <s> both amendments deal with

considered here and i think i am right to say was voted against <e> <s> anyhow the government withdrew it <e> <s> the noble lord will remember what then happened to stansted airport <e>", "<cs> my lords that clears up one little problem <e> <s> i had thought that had we taken the earlier amendments one by one instead of in threes and fours it would have been easier <e> <s> i also thought that had we taken the amendment of the noble lord lord hylton with that of the noble lord lord mcnair that would have been easier too <e> <s> but the noble lord lord mcnair said no he would just move his amendment even though he referred to the other one so i shall endeavour to address such remarks as i have to make to his amendment <e> <s> but inevitably the two are linked together and it is quite difficult to see how to separate them without leaving the amendment of the noble lord lord hylton totally unanswered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said that this was a simple straightforward and humane amendment and that he wished it to be given consideration <e> <s> of course one gives it consideration <e> <s> however i am bound to say that it would drive a coach and horses through the philosophy of clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt said that he wanted appeals to include not only on the facts but also on compassionate grounds and that the amendment was very reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely adopting a happy precedent which seems to have been part of this report stage in which we consider a number of amendments together <e> <s> i was not addressing my remarks specifically to amendment no <e> <s> but was merely saying that at committee stage the noble lord was concerned that those factors might not be taken into account <e> <s> however i shall leave that point and shall not make too much of it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he has already spoken to <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the noble lord lord mishcon thinks he sounds like i have never considered him to sound like a gramophone record <e> <s> he always manages to say something different and produces a different intonation on each occasion <e> <s> it is always fascinating to listen to him and i was delighted to hear him move the same amendment a second time but in different words and with a different inflection <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the permission of the house to reply to the noble baroness i would say this <e> <s> she seems momentarily to have forgotten that we dealing with people who have broken the law <e> <s> in the case to which she is referring they have been here for three years having broken the law <e> <s> we are saying that when their case comes up for appeal it should be only the facts that should be considered <e> <s> on the other hand if persons have been here for seven years having broken the law all that time and i shall continue to use that expression if i may graciously rub it in to the noble lord lord mishcon who makes the assertion that we are being most harsh about this and then it is found that they are overstayers they can have both the compassionate circumstances and the facts considered at appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords with equal brevity as we have discussed the question before even though it was discussed fairly shortly i hope that your lordships will not agree with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord mishcon should say that i put on a steely front <e> <s> it is not a natural posture <e> <s> it is merely that i have been unable to find myself in agreement with him <e> <s> i think that he has been not merely wrong but misguided <e> <s> for that reason i believe that the amendments he has tabled would not have improved the bill <e> <s> he was kind enough to quote what i said on the last occasion which was that i accepted what he wished to do and that i understood his wishes <e> <s> he was also generous enough to quote my remark that i would hesitate to put it in the bill <e> <s> i said that a provision which would require adjudicators to consider the possibility of making recommendations would be very damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend would not be mystified if only he saw the chink of light because then he would be able to see what was going to happen <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has accused me of being steely and of turning down every single amendment <e> <s> i have been obliged to do that but i am not sure whether turning down is the right expression because it is for your lordships to decide i can only advise how it is most appropriate to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage of the bill the house debated an amendment which sought to ensure that both the spouses and the family members of anyone settled here whether or not a british citizen could be admitted as readily as the family members of european community nationals exercising their rights under the treaty of rome <e> <s> the present amendment is more narrowly drawn <e> <s> it now concerns only the spouses of british citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> they all relate to the system of prescribing fees <e> <s> by amendment no <e> <s> the noble and learned lord wishes to have inserted into the bill the fact that no fees should be prescribed in respect of children under the age of and by amendment no <e> <s> the secretary of state should have the powr <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving the amendment the noble lord lord mishcon was kind enough to say that he would not press it <e> <s> if i may say so that is a welcome change of approach this evening <e> <s> it is what he would describe as a gentle shaft of light <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that <e> <s> the proposal is that the immigration carriers liability act should be repealed <e> <s> that act has been in operation since th march <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot do so without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall accede to the request of the noble lord lord mulley not to say that the amendment is not properly drafted <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for having put down the amendment <e> <s> i accept that there is a real difficulty here <e> <s> when a person is refused entry to the country for whatever reason and has to be removed someone has to pick up the bill <e> <s> for many years it has been accepted that that should fall upon the carriers for the simple reason that there has been a contract between the carrier and the person who has been carried <e> <s> at that point the united kingdom has not been involved at all <e> <s> its only involvement is when it seeks to prevent entry into the country by someone whose only connection with the country is his inability to qualify to enter <e>", "<cs> my lords in these amendments my noble friend seeks to enable the carriers to ensure that they will not have to meet the costs of the removal of people in two circumstances first where the people concerned have previously succeeded in deceiving an immigration officer into admitting them and secondly where someone arrives back in this country having been refused admission to another country and returned here <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> your lordships can take any decision and the government can only advise your lordships <e> <s> i was bold enough to advise your lordships in committee that the purpose behind this bill was to get rid of some anomalies to make life easier during the week and not to interefere with sundays <e> <s> the purpose of that was that we knew we would be in a very difficult position which is what we are now in because in committee your lordships decided to allow pubs to be open for an extra hour at lunchtime on sundays as a social convenience <e> <s> now my noble friend lord kaberry comes along and argues that because pubs can now open for six-and-a-half hours clubs should also be allowed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord dean of beswick is not entirely correct <e> <s> the clubs do not need permission provided there is a gap of two hours <e> <s> i see that the noble lord shakes his head but i believe i am correct in saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are now totally out of order <e> <s> perhaps i may have the permission of your lordships to speak yet again but if your lordships would prefer me not to do so i shall resume <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady masham does not know as yet that the government will not accept this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said that he could not understand the logic behind it <e> <s> he said that all that government ministers do is stand up and read out from a piece of paper <e> <s> i shall endeavour to refrain from doing that and probably get myself into more trouble by doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount says no i think he emitted the word no <e> <s> perhaps i may be permitted to depart for a moment from the advice of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton which was not to read from a piece of paper <e> <s> i shall read from a piece of paper <e> <s> it is not my brief but a piece from the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt <e> <s> i fear we may be getting out of order because most noble lords have spoken once and some have spoken twice <e> <s> i nearly made the same mistake too <e> <s> i do not wish to shut the noble baroness up <e> <s> that is the last thing one could possibly want with any form of courtesy <e> <s> i merely point out to the noble baroness the danger <e> <s> she could of course always say before the noble earl sat down since i sat down about five minutes ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i would only say that this is a fairly small bill but we think it is a fairly important one and it sets out to tidy up one or two items in our law which we felt were now in need of modernisation <e> <s> we have had a number of interesting speeches and a well-informed debate particularly earlier about the problems of alcohol-related abuse though i must say that the subject took a curious twist in connection with the last amendment we debated <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that the noble lord lord knights showed the absurdity of it referring to the colour of the carpet <e> <s> the noble and gallant lord lord carver also described the absurdity of it in an entertaining speech when he said that he was very nearly court-martialled <e> <s> the fact that one who was very nearly court-martialled ended up by being a field-marshal will give great encouragement to all the miscreants or potential miscreants inside and outside the army <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is very anxious <e> <s> i do not blame him but he will have to wait a little longer <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that he will have to wait longer because my right honourable friend said that he would have to wait until june when the governments proposals come out <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are remarkably expeditious in the way in which they deal with matters <e> <s> whether that speed is as quick as the noble lord would wish or whether it is greater than the noble lord had anticipated all i shall tell him i am grateful for his very courteous and generous remarks is that with the greatest of respect he will have to wait a little longer before the fruit is ripe <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have been speaking for minutes at least four of those have been because the noble lord and his friends have interrupted what i was trying to say <e> <s> since the noble lord and his noble friends want to know what the position is when i try to explain to your lordships what the position is i really think it is slightly unfair if the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i did not have such a tender heart the noble lord would have moved me almost to tears when at the end of that speech he told <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to finish because he was slightly provocative <e> <s> i do not blame him for that <e> <s> it is not much of an excuse if one does not have the documents to say that one should be allowed in <e> <s> the noble lord knows as well as all of us that immigration law is highly complicated <e> <s> he knows as well as all of us that there are people who will try to get round the immigration control law which is why it is so complicated <e> <s> if the noble lord were to take the view that we should allow in people who did not have those documents he knows full well that there would be plenty of people who would take advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hylton for intervening before i ended my speech which i thought that i had only just started <e> <s> i should not wish to detain him unfairly <e> <s> he and the noble lord lord mishcon know that every application is considered carefully before a decision is taken <e> <s> if appeal rights were granted to those applicants we should be faced with a welter of bogus applications <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain whether the noble lord is trying to oil his way out of his commitment <e> <s> i assumed that he made that quotation in order to support the view which he was putting forward <e> <s> all i was trying to do was to answer it and to show the noble lord that a great deal of effort has gone into making quite sure that the immigrants are correctly and properly looked after <e> <s> perhaps i can also tell him because he said that immigration is a necessary part of our life that people have been granted settlement here since <e> <s> there were about applicants every years and about appeals <e> <s> it is simply not true to say that we do not look after people <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to each police force to encourage that protection as much as they can <e> <s> the result has been successful <e> <s> we are greatly encouraged by the increasing willingness and commitment which that demonstrates on the part of the general public to become involved in the prevention of crime <e> <s> that is something for which we must continue to press <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord molloy wished to take part in any neighbourhood watch scheme i know that it would be appreciated if he would do more than put up a sticker in his window <e> <s> the noble lord has asked an important question <e> <s> i shall give him a few examples <e> <s> for instance in the west midlands in october there were schemes <e> <s> in october there were and residential burglary went down by per cent <e> <s> in west mercia in october there were schemes months later there were schemes and residential burglary went down by per cent <e> <s> in greater manchester there were schemes <e> <s> after months that figure went up to and residential burglary went down by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i offer my commiserations to the noble lord lord molloy on his very unsatisfactory history of unwarranted intruders <e> <s> i would suggest to him that he should not be put off his neighbourhood watch scheme <e> <s> perhaps he could invite others of his friends to display stickers and to be more co-operative over his efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any limit on what people may report to each other <e> <s> gossip usually has a good part to play in that <e> <s> but i do not think that there are any restrictions on the amount of effort that is required by the public to help the police in combating crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend the answer to that <e> <s> if he wishes to put down a special question about the farm watch scheme i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many statistics in the home office but i do not know whether that information would be among them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather wider question which has all sorts of ramifications <e> <s> there are some authorities where the police go around and help people to protect their houses <e> <s> there are certain schemes where that is done which have proved to be of great assistance <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind comments about my department which will be received with delight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord chalfont has introduced an important debate today in a characteristically forthright and impressive manner <e> <s> i am indebted to him for having given me notice of the points which he intended to make <e> <s> i think that we have had a very reasoned debate and one of great interest <e> <s> many noble lords have considerable knowledge and experience of the bbc and of the problems which it encounters <e> <s> we have had the advantage today of hearing the noble lord lord swann with all the experience and wisdom which he obtained when he was such a distinguished chairman of the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spent the last few minutes trying to explain that the applications have been opened <e> <s> however there was a concern that they might have been overstayers <e> <s> i am telling the noble lord that they are not overstayers under those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that was an intervention or almost another speech <e> <s> the noble lord kindly prefaced his words with before the minister sits down by which time i had already sat down <e> <s> as soon as the noble lord came out with those mellifluous phrases for which i am deeply appreciative i knew there would be a sting in the tail <e> <s> that is the noble lords custom <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a wide-ranging debate this evening <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon was very courteous in his remarks to me <e> <s> he chided me for saying that the order was uncontroversial as though i had said something terrible <e> <s> he then capped that by saying that he agreed that the order was innocuous <e> <s> i liked that change of stance within about seconds <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord make an intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what i thought that the noble lord said <e> <s> i was rather surprised that he said it <e> <s> in fact we do and we will <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon referred as also did the noble viscount lord bledisloe who conducted his speech with reference to that point and the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon to the use of article a <e> <s> that is an important point <e> <s> they asked whether article a was a suitable treaty base for the fourth directive <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon is always fair <e> <s> he was kind enough not to ask for an immediate response <e> <s> however he will receive an immediate response in so far as i shall of course ensure that the concern which has been expressed today is conveyed to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i would tell him that it has been put on record by what i have said that although we accept the use of article a on this occasion that does not mean that we shall not on future occasions challenge the use of article a if we think it necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the interests of scotland are always carefully examined and will continue to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only answer that question with the leave of the house because i think that i have already made more than my fair share of speeches <e> <s> i did not answer that point <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon is quite right <e> <s> it is of course a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> my noble friend may put down an unstarred question if he wishes <e> <s> however i think that there will be an opportunity to debate the matter after we have completed our consultation accepted views and put forward our proposals <e> <s> i think that would be the best time for a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the brighton bombings i understand that there are some cases still left unresolved but that the majority of them have been resolved <e> <s> with regard to publicity some leaflets will be produced later this month which will be available to people through the police and will tell them how to set about claiming compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords the police will be given certain guidance on how to inform victims who have been subjected to crimes of violence <e> <s> one of the ways in which that will be done is by producing a leaflet <e> <s> the police will also be able to advise people from their own knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords in the year before last the criminal injuries compensation scheme for great britain paid out over million <e> <s> it is provisionally expected that the figure for will be million and over million has been provided for this current year <e>", "<cs> my lords there are arrangements to ensure that the perpetrators of crimes are made to pay compensation <e> <s> the criminal justice bill gives the victims of violent crime a statutory right to compensation and parliamentary authority is provided for that expenditure <e> <s> under that bill it will be possible for those who have perpetrated crimes to pay compensation and if they cannot do so immediately they will have to pay in instalments <e>", "<cs> my lords there are special steps to help such people <e> <s> special facilities are being set up for victims of rape <e> <s> also under the criminal justice bill the protection of anonymity is given to the victims of rape <e> <s> that is extended from the moment at which an allegation of rape is made <e> <s> as i said in addition there are the special physical facilities which are being set up where people can be interrogated in places of relative peace and

lord brougham and vaux not left so quickly for his easter holiday he may have been present to have voted for the amendment <e> <s> however he took the precaution of having an earlier holiday so maybe that is his own fault <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for asking about an area in which she is in some confusion <e> <s> her interpretation is not correct <e> <s> the licence goes with the premises <e> <s> if the owner wishes to continue his licence and apply for a new licence he can do so <e> <s> if he wishes to sell the premises the new properietor takes them over with a licence and can apply for the renewal of that licence it goes with the premises <e> <s> however should the licence drop in other words should one proprietor sell a business with a licence and another purchase the business but decide not to continue the licence and should he then sell those premises to somebody else that person may not apply for the renewal of the original licence because it would then have lapsed <e> <s> i hope that that clarifies the position <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make another intervention with the leave of the house but we are getting rather out of order <e> <s> we may still be on the same speech but there have been many interruptions <e> <s> the noble viscounts premise is that because there are now so few garages which have licences attached to them they are likely to become a dwindling asset and will therefore become more valuable <e> <s> if that is so that is the fault of your lordships amendment <e> <s> if he did not want that to happen he should not have voted for it <e> <s> he voted for the amendment because he wished to curtail the use of alcohol <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble viscount whether it is likely to happen in five or years time or what the value of those properties will be <e> <s> under this amendment there will not be other garages which are allowed to apply for licences <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not have given it if it was not <e>", "<cs> my lords those are two questions fairly wide of the mark <e> <s> the local authorities have discretionary powers to inspect and register houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to know about inspectors he must table another question because the present question concerns guidance <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord stallard that this matter has taken longer than we had expected but i assure him that the guidance will be published this year <e>", "<cs> my lords it is basically because the legislation is different consultation has proceeded more rapidly and there are fewer people with whom to argue <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble baroness feels the gravest concern over something that has not yet been published <e> <s> i can only suggest that she is patient and awaits the terms of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> i am sure she will then find that she has no grave concern rather that she will be delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the support which he has been kind enough <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not wish for perpetuation of such conditions <e> <s> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord when the alterations will be completed <e> <s> however i can tell him that the government are most

perhaps i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i said that million has been invested in this connection <e> <s> some of the work has been undertaken or is in the process of being done in other words some of it has already been started <e> <s> if the noble lord requires a detailed breakdown as to how much has been started and on what particular projects i shall of course endeavour to find that out <e> <s> however i can only furnish him with the broad generalities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained that the government are acutely concerned about the state of the prisons which is why we have undertaken the biggest prison building programme this century <e> <s> by the mid-s there will be additional places which will case the problem in the prisons <e> <s> in addition prison refurbishment is taking place <e> <s> we are at one with the noble lord in trying to improve the prisons but he will know as well as i do that it is a difficult problem which needs a vast amount of money spent on

sanitation that would mean closing down a wing <e> <s> to close down a wing merely overcrowds everyone else <e> <s> as he knows at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern felt by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton over this problem <e> <s> i am sure he will accept that in undertaking this considerable prison reform and building programme the government are doing a great deal

in prison sentences <e> <s> those can only be carried out properly and effectively when the prisons are in a good condition <e> <s> far the best course is for us to conduct our lives and our society

many of my noble and learned friends utterances but not that one <e> <s> doubtless it has embedded itself in his mind as well as those of other people <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to the local authorities to decide when to prosecute and it is up to the courts to decide what laws operate <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> that is why i gave a somewhat short answer

old british passport <e> <s> the changes are being made so that the passport will have a common format with the passports of other community countries <e> <s> it is also being done in order to make the passport machine readable i am sure that the noble lord lord mishcon will understand exactly what that means and to prevent the very troubles to which the noble lord referred earlier <e>", "<cs>

sensitive to criticism <e> <s> he then went on to say that there was far too much sex and violence on television <e> <s> of course all we have done is to try to introduce a broadcasting standards council in order to respond to the very criticism that the noble earl made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i have misdirected my mind <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl will forgive me because he gave us a riveting account of his television experience of brothel creepers prostitutes masseuses and massage parlours and i am afraid that my imagination went into overdrive at that moment <e> <s> i was glad that he brought in his points about marriage because i too had forgotten that while he was reciting his experience <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will have to be a little patient to know the type of dentures if i may so put it that will be accorded to the broadcasting standards council <e> <s> it has been set up only recently <e> <s> it is a question of getting it going before it is given a statutory responsibility at present it has a non-statutory responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe there is anything particularly curious about that <e> <s> the cabinet has its various sub-committees and they consider matters of interest <e> <s> periodically people are spoken to and other people give their views <e> <s> there is nothing odd about that <e> <s> the noble lord will have to be a trifle more patient <e> <s> i have told him that a white paper will emerge when it does i believe that many of his concerns will be ironed out <e>", "<cs> my lords the police national computer is being replaced at the moment <e> <s> that will give it more capacity which should result in the quicker retrieval of information <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual the noble lord lord mishcon has asked penetrating questions of detail <e> <s> as regards automatic fingerprint recognition afr i can tell him that the home office and the metropolitan police are working on that project <e> <s> it is a pilot project for a national afr system <e> <s> so far as the electronic photofit system is concerned i applaud the noble lord for his detailed knowledge of those matters <e> <s> the system has been on trial with the lancashire constabulary <e> <s> we are considering whether the system will be suitable for use on the new police national computer <e> <s> as regards hand-held <e>", "<cs> my lords all forces are engaged in a considerable civilianisation programme for the very purpose which my noble friend has mentioned to put uniformed police on the beat <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to emphasise that point because improving the status and ability of the police to function properly is very important <e> <s> he would like to know that million was spent in on operational computer systems and very considerable work and expenditure are being put into computerising the police force <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one better than screenees to which one of the noble and learned lords noble friends was subjected yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for drawing your lordships attention to that fact <e> <s> the police national computer is a very considerable asset <e> <s> apart from containing the names of criminals and conviction details and information on stolen or suspect vehicles million inquiries are made into it each year and a day <e> <s> there are terminals connected to the computer so it has a major impact <e>", "<cs> my lords because of some change in the recording practice by fire brigades consistent information is available only from <e> <s> in the period to there were deaths in fires in the uk in detached semi-detached or terraced houses in multiple occupation and deaths in fires in hostels or similar institutions <e> <s> her majestys government will be issuing guidance on means of escape from houses in multiple occupation later this year <e> <s> we are considering the way in which means of escape from fire can be included in future housing legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the guidance will cover within its scope some per cent <e> <s> of houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> it will not have statutory force but it is anticipated that it will help to raise the standards of means of escape in many more than per cent <e> <s> of the houses in multiple occupation upon which there is a duty to provide means of escape <e> <s> a mandatory grant is available for up to per cent <e> <s> of the cost of the provision of means of escape from fire in those houses in multiple occupation which are required to have them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is very ingenious in putting his question but i believe that if he thinks about it again he will realise that it is far outside the scope of the present question <e> <s> i should be delighted to answer if he would be kind enough to put down a question specifically on electronic contact-breakers <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers specifically to houses in multiple occupation and to <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems which has been considered in drawing up the guidance is the connection between the home office the fire authorities and local authorities <e> <s> i think that the suggestion which the noble lord has put forward would have considerable resource implications but we are considering ways in which means of escape from fire can be included in future housing legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities can serve a notice under section of the housing act requiring the provision of means of escape from fire <e> <s> there is a duty in respect of houses in multiple occupation of three storeys or more and with square metres of floor area and there is a discretionary power for local authorities in respect of smaller properties <e> <s> at the moment the government are not convinced that further powers are necessary and no authorities have said that they serve notice only where the duty applies <e> <s> they appear to discharge their duties on fire safety as regards houses in multiple occupation outside their legal duty <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that they would have to live in separate apartments within the same building and that there would have to be more than two of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the operation of wheelclamping in london is a matter for the commissioners of police for the metropolis and of the city of london <e> <s> officers have been made aware of the need to ensure that the power to clamp is used with discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for having been generous enough to tell the house that he had an interest to declare and that he had only put down this question on behalf of others who had suffered a similar fate <e> <s> i am bound to say that when i saw this question and was apprised of the fact that the noble lord had been clamped i thought that he could well have been reminded of the prayer which he would have heard read had he been present for prayers which says <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true but towing away is a fairly draconian measure <e> <s> it is undertaken on certain occasions <e> <s> the number of wheelclamping operations which have taken place has risen considerably and this has been found to increase the rate of traffic flow <e> <s> there are occasions when a car that has been wheelclamped still obstructs traffic and it is then towed away <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an expression <e>", "<cs> my lords we all have individual examples of how things appear to be not part of the norm <e> <s> i am conscious of the anxiety caused by wheelclamping but there is a real and serious dichotomy in this situation <e> <s> on the one hand the police have to make sure that the roads are kept clear and where parking offences occur they should be properly penalised <e> <s> on the other hand that must be done with sensitivity because the mere fact of clamping alienates the people who very often are the greatest supporters of the police <e> <s> there is a delicate balance to be kept <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for putting that point so clearly <e> <s> perhaps i may say that he is quite right <e> <s> there is a perfectly clear distinction made between places where one may and one may not park <e> <s> nevertheless in all of us there is the element of the schoolboy and we all try to see whether or not we can get away with it <e> <s> if one does not get away with it one has really only oneself to blame <e>", "<cs> my lords the north report only recently produced has some very important recommendations <e> <s> there are a great many of them <e> <s> at present the government are considering them and will in due course decide what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the clamping time is very clearly laid down <e> <s> one is permitted to stop or to load or unload for up to minutes <e> <s> the courts have held that loading or unloading must be continuous <e> <s> the metropolitan police observe private cars for five minutes for signs of loading or unloading before a wheel clamp is applied and minutes is allowed for commercial vehicles <e> <s> should the noble lord lord mackie of benshie go to the city the city police observe for minutes and minutes respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to the point when i answer the noble earls original question <e> <s> when people are sent to police cells they are inspected and given medical attention where that is considered appropriate <e> <s> it is after medical attention has been given that the decision about priority has to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to the noble lord lord mishcon for not having referred to his important suggestion <e> <s> one of the drawbacks of the noble lord speaking in the position that he does immediately in advance of myself is that sometimes i find it impossible to write appropriate notes of all that the noble lord says <e> <s> i try to write some notes but i omitted that particularly important point <e> <s> of course i shall consider the suggestion and i shall ensure that the problem which the noble lord has identified is given consideration <e> <s> it would be unwise of me to say at this moment what the result will be but i shall ensure that the matter is considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that such volunteers are an integral and most important part of any civil defence or peacetime emergency <e> <s> of course the local authorities must make up their own minds as to how best they can use the volunteers in their region <e> <s> they can do this by keeping in touch with the voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord mishcon would not expect me to agree with his quite fallacious remark that the government are injuring the pride of local authorities <e> <s> we have always taken the view that civil defence and the protection of people in peacetime are very much matters for the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords some million is already spent on civil defence <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton if he will contain himself for half a moment will know that any requirements for civil defence can also be used for peacetime emergencies <e> <s> therefore the structure required is already there <e>", "<cs> my lordsit is most difficult for me to answer when the noble lord says that some local authorities regard civil defence as a joke whereas the noble lord lord mishcon says that the government ought to allow local authorities to do what they want in this connection <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> local authorities have a statutory responsibility to accept and train civil defence volunteers <e> <s> it is equally <e>", "<cs> my lords i know exactly what the noble lord lord mellish means and to what he refers <e> <s> however the great majority of authorities are responding well to their statutory obligations <e> <s> they include those which from time to time style themselves as nuclear-free zones <e> <s> i am not aware that any of those authorities are refusing to carry out their statutory obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly when any disaster occurs it takes some time to gear the necessary forces together <e> <s> dealing with such disasters is very much a matter for the emergency services <e> <s> we were satisfied with how the emergency services carried out their work during last autumns disaster to which the noble lord the leader of the opposition referred <e> <s> we have had a number of discussions <e> <s> i told the british red cross on nd march that we were looking closely at many proposals for improving the united kingdoms response to peacetime emergencies <e> <s> a discussion paper will shortly be circulated to seek the expert views of the operational emergency services both on their present abilities and on scope for improvements <e> <s> that consultation document will be circulated and we shall see what the professionals and others have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be pedantic but this is a second reading debate and therefore this is the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for raising that point <e> <s> we are considering the recommendations made by that committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not concede that my reply was not as considered as the noble lord kindly suggests my replies usually are <e> <s> it was a considered reply <e> <s> the problem with regard to aids is a national problem <e> <s> i accept that there are particular difficulties with regard to prisoners but we have found that the best way of dealing with this is for counselling to be done in the locality <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall consider what the noble lord says <e> <s> however i am not so sure that the setting up of a committee would provide the answer <e> <s> there are a number of problems which are fully known by the governors and the medical profession who deal with them <e> <s> if there are any reasons to think that a committee would help solve that i shall certainly consider them <e>", "<cs> my lords where prisoners are identified as being hiv antibody positive but have no signs of illness they are located in single accommodation or accommodated with other antibody positive prisoners <e> <s> they are not otherwise precluded from associating with prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that the prison officers acknowledge the concern of the home department over this <e> <s> however i am bound to tell him that we would be in difficulty for the reasons that i gave the noble lord lord mishcon about instituting compulsory blood tests <e> <s> if a person does not want to undergo a compulsory blood test and he is forced to do so that could constitute an assault <e>", "<cs> my lords aids is a recent highly regrettable and very frightening phenomenon <e> <s> the fact that it can appear in circumstances where a lot of males are gathered together is a matter for concern <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that homosexuality is a cause of spreading aids <e> <s> the fact that a lot of males are gathered together in a confined space can presumably add to that difficulty <e> <s> condoms are not among the items which prisoners are allowed to have in their possession and the government have no intention at the moment of supplying condoms <e> <s> to do that would be to condone behaviour which may amount to a criminal offence in so far as homosexual acts are legal only in private <e> <s> in prison they are not likely to be private <e> <s> it could also encourage behaviour which in itself might encourage aids <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord correctly he asked about the misuse of drugs <e> <s> that is slightly different to the matter of aids <e> <s> we have no evidence at the moment to show that needle sharing or any such practice is being encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite see the noble lords point and i apologise if i did not take it fully the first time <e> <s> there is no evidence in the prisons at the moment of needle sharing nor is there any evidence of intravenous drug use <e> <s> obviously this is a matter which is being kept closely under review and should there he that evidence we shall have to take such steps as are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord that but i shall find out about it and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble baroness that it is important <e> <s> everything is done that can be done to find out whether prisoners have aids but short of compulsory screening of everyone we cannot always find this out <e> <s> where a potential aids sufferer invites a test we will know the results but they can only be a reflection of those who have been tested <e> <s> there are hiv positive prisoners at the moment <e> <s> in all since we started monitoring this problem in march hiv positives have been identified <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall take into account the views of the noble lord and the representations that he has made <e> <s> however i am bound to tell him that if we were to go down the path which he suggests it might mean an alteration in the law because it is the law that states that compulsory testing would be an assault despite what your lordships may feel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful for that supplementary question <e> <s> i only hope that i was not the cause of the questions continuing for minutes but merely for about minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> however i looked round to make certain that i was hearing what he was saying <e> <s> it came as some slight surprise <e> <s> i believe that he will see in due course that it was a bit exaggerated <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord john-mackie said we have had a very interesting debate which has continued for quite a long while <e> <s> i thank your lordships for the courteous way in which this debate has been conducted <e> <s> there are a large number of wide-ranging views on the subject some of which are emotional and some of which deal with sport <e> <s> it is a quite right that all these matters should be considered carefully and closely <e>", "<cs> my lords let us not go down that track of having a new firearms bill <e> <s> this one is difficult enough as it is <e> <s> my noble friend lord portsmouth suggested that we should have a new firearms bill <e> <s> however that may be my noble friend lord ironside referred to the stun gun which uses plain old electricity i like that expression and is powered with ordinary batteries <e> <s> perhaps that is so but the effect of it is pretty shattering <e> <s> it may use only simple batteries but by the time those batteries have the capacity to knock a person out for a period of <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary has certain responsibilities which he must carry out <e> <s> it is up to him to try on behalf of the government to decide the right lines along which to go and then of course there are consultations <e> <s> i do not think that even my noble friend would consider that the interests he represents have the right to say what the law of protection in the country should be <e> <s> they have the right to say how their interests may be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are firing both barrels so to speak in opposite directions <e> <s> i was trying to tell the noble lord lord john-mackie what consultations there had been <e> <s> my noble friend came up on another point and complained that the consultations had not been early enough <e> <s> i think that we had better leave the matter there <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to do that <e> <s> i realise the anxiety expressed by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> one of the problems is to decide what is armour-piercing <e> <s> anything will go through tin plate but if we are dealing with six-inch thick metal the qualities described as armour-piercing would be somewhat different <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing would please me more than to do that but i think i ought not to take the suggestion of the noble lord quite that far just in case some other noble lords were not so magnanimous in their views as is the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a remarkable response to this scheme and we hope that it will grow <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been some research done on this subject <e> <s> one piece of research was carried out by dr trevor bennett and another undertaken by the university of southampton <e> <s> those researches concerned individual aspects of the schemes <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that neighbourhood watch schemes have had some considerable effect <e> <s> residential burglary is down by per cent <e> <s> on the figures for <e> <s> in some areas where these schemes have been instituted the difference has been remarkable <e> <s> for instance in the west midlands in october there were schemes and a year later in october there were schemes during that period residential burglary went down by per cent <e> <s> in west mercia in october there were schemes and a year later those schemes had increased to and residential burglary was down by per cent <e> <s> so there has been a considerable improvement <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> i think that any statistic can only give a broad picture but the figures throughout the country show that neighbourhood watch has proved to be beneficial <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is perfectly true <e> <s> the result has been much more cohesion between families and households <e> <s> as dr trevor bennett suggested it has also resulted in a decrease in the fear of household crime apart from the crime statistics themselves <e> <s> there is also a reduction in female fear of crime and an improvement in social cohesion which is important <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the problems that face securicor and those that face neighbourhood watch are basically different <e> <s> securicor is a commercial organisation <e> <s> neighbourhood watch encourages people in the fraternity to keep a watch for crime and criminals and also to get to know what is happening in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual the noble lord asks a number of penetrating questions <e> <s> if these schemes are related to wealthy neighbourhoods then there must be wealthy neighbourhoods throughout the country and that is quite a considerable number <e> <s> i agree that there is little that gives more confidence to the average person than to see the bobby on the beat <e> <s> most police forces have tried to ensure that among all their responsibilities that happens <e> <s> however for all that we have tried and we shall try to increase yet further the neighbourhood watch schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose it is up to individuals to gather their own information as to what happens to criminals who may have been in one area rather than another <e> <s> however i cannot provide the noble viscount with any statistics which show that because of neighbourhood watch schemes people who would otherwise have committed burglaries have gone on to the open streets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both noble lords for the welcome which they have given to this statement <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mishcon had prepared himself for a castigatory speech only to find that the statement was not quite as bad as he had expected <e> <s> in fact i think he would agree that it was agreeable to him <e> <s> it just shows that the newspapers are not always accurate even such papers as the noble lord reads <e> <s> however i am grateful to him for giving a welcome to the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for explaining that <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcons complaint related merely to the fact that that was not included i thought that the complaint related to the fact that there was no reference to it and that was why i drew the noble lords attention to it <e> <s> but as the white paper says it is a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to my noble friend lord whitelaw for having made that intervention not only because of his personal experience of having introduced the previous bill and of the problems which that ran into but also for the fact that he said that there must be a consensus on this issue <e> <s> inevitably not everyone will he satisfied <e> <s> if we are to remove the absurd position which exists at the moment we must move into a position which broadly speaking has the common accord of parliament both this house and another place <e> <s> if we do not do that the present position will remain <e> <s> that would be a great pity <e> <s> i wish to reinforce the view of my noble friend and say that i hope that we shall be able to get the future bill through with a reasonable degree of accord <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall be delighted to help the house <e> <s> i thought that it would be more convenient if those who wished to ask questions put their questions and then i would try to answer them one after the other <e> <s> that would prevent me from jumping up about six times <e> <s> but if the noble lord would prefer me to jump up six times i shall oblige <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been trying to write the questions down <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his sympathy because it is difficult to write to listen and to think at the same time <e> <s> but i am doing my best <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take up the kind offer of the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and answer some of the questions which have been asked <e> <s> otherwise not only shall i forget what has been asked but i fancy that the questioners may forget as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> there is a shortage here which we would wish not to see <e> <s> i understand that the joint negotiating committee which negotiates pay and conditions for magistrates court staff is collecting information on recruitment and retention and will take this into account when considering the pay settlement which at the moment is being discussed <e> <s> however the noble lord is correct that there are competitive forces at work <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the high quality of staff is essential <e> <s> that will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the position is worse in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am completely unable to answer that question <e> <s> if the noble lord will write to me i shall endeavour to ascertain what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that there are difficulties in that respect and obviously we are addressing our minds to ensure that those difficulties are as slender as possible <e> <s> i should inform the house that the number of staff who are being trained as court clerks has increased recently from to a year so more people are being trained <e>", "<cs> my lords that is slightly wide of the question on the order paper but i am sure that it will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware that at this time of the year the demand in applications for passports is at its greatest <e> <s> in fact it is up per cent <e> <s> on last year <e> <s> certainly when the peak season has passed there will be a more expeditious turn-around on applications <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord would like to know that it depends on the passport office to which he directs his application <e> <s> for non-urgent postal applications to london the average length of time is days in glasgow it is days peterborough takes days newport days liverpool days and in belfast it is three days <e>", "<cs> my lords of course these things are possible to anticipate <e> <s> that is the reason why the government are spending million trying to expedite matters by a programme of computerisation <e> <s> it is possible to obtain a quicker to -day service if one calls at the passport office in person but it means that the more people who apply in person the longer it takes to deal with all the applications <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has lunar house on the brain <e> <s> we are talking about a totally different place <e> <s> lunar house deals with immigrants we are dealing with passports <e> <s> one is in and the other is out <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be delighted to know that they are better <e> <s> this year the figure for london is days while last year it was days this year for glasgow it is days and last year it was days for peterborough it is days compared with days last year newport takes days whereas last year it took days and liverpool now takes days whereas last years figure was days <e> <s> belfast remains the same at three days <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i do not like to do so but i think that there might be a procedural complication <e> <s> we were discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and but not <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord dilhorne for his intervention and i am sorry if i disturbed him in his flow <e> <s> i was not surprised that he was not here to move his amendment because he tabled no less than four manuscript amendments today and even i had difficulty in obtaining the manuscript version <e> <s> i received it five minutes before coming into the chamber <e> <s> i daresay the noble lord was on his way here but did not succeed in arriving in time <e> <s> i am grateful to him for having explained his views about this matter <e>", "<cs> i shall give the note lord lord stoddart of swindon such advice as i can <e> <s> i start by telling him as courteously as i can that he is wrong <e> <s> we are dealing there with rifles <e> <s> the difference between a rifle and a shotgun is one of the distinctions that we must make in this bill <e> <s> it is easy with shotguns and rifles to get them confused in ones mind <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart said that he does not know much about firearms <e> <s> i can assure him that if he had had the advantage or disadvantage of studying this bill very hard as some of us have been obliged to do he would have ended up knowing a great deal more than at the beginning which has been my fate even though there is much to be learnt <e>", "<cs> it is perfectly fair of the noble lord to raise that matter and to say that people should be permitted to take various tests <e> <s> but i believe that he misses the onus of this clause which is that these weapons are considered to be so dangerous that they should not be available for use <e> <s> however that does not mean to say that there are not plenty of people who would be perfectly capable of using them because they would be in the right hands <e> <s> the thrust of this clause is to say that these weapons should not be available <e>", "<cs> the simple answer if one ever dares give a simple answer to anything of this nature is that bolt-action rifles are legitimately used for a number of purposes such as stalking and other pursuits of the kind that happen in the part of the world from which the noble viscount comes <e> <s> in those circumstances the weapons are quite legitimately used and will continue to be <e> <s> however pump-action rifles have very much quicker fire power and therefore their lethality becomes much greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked about pump-action rifles by the noble viscount and he asks why it is considered that this kind of weapon is more dangerous than one with a bolt-action <e> <s> i can tell him as a matter of factual presentation that it is possible to have a bolt-action rifle which one can shoot perfectly reasonably and perfectly successfully <e> <s> in the hands of the wrong person a pump-action rifle has a fire power far greater than a bolt-action rifle <e>", "<cs> my noble friends behind me say no but they forget the fact that a self-loading rifle <e>", "<cs> it is easy to confuse the use of these weapons by the army with their use by civilians <e> <s> the army has people specially trained in the use of weapons for certain purposes primarily against the enemy <e> <s> the use by the army and the use by civilians are different things <e> <s> when my noble friend lord rookeborough says that weapons can be held and brought out on special occasions i am bound to come hack to the point i made earlier <e> <s> in the hands of private individuals even though they are capable private individuals these weapons are considered to be so dangerous that in the interests of public safety it would be better for them not to he in private hands <e>", "<cs> i find it extremely difficult to get through to my noble friend the basis on which this legislation has come forward <e> <s> had he heard as i am sure he did the noble lord lord harris of greenwich he would have realised that there was great public outcry about the fact that these weapons were available <e> <s> whether one individual fired one round two rounds or eight rounds is relatively immaterial <e> <s> the fact is that these weapons were used <e> <s> they were dangerous and we are trying to secure a reasonable degree and it is only a reasonable degree of protection for society <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to rise more than i should but i feel that i cannot let my noble friends very courteous remark go by the board <e> <s> he said that the bill was brought forward as a result of ignorance and prejudice <e> <s> i suggest that he uses those words to the people around hungerford and elsewhere and see whether they think that that is so <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord wynford made if i may say so a very persuasive argument why these rifles should not be included in the section category if they do not have magazine capacities greater than four cartridges <e> <s> he put forward with some considerable feeling understandably the position of the disabled <e> <s> he said that there was a fierce determination of the disabled to compete <e> <s> i accept that entirely <e> <s> when a person has been disabled he has every intention of doing his best to overcome that disability <e> <s> for those who have up to now used self-loading rifles one can quite see how that has been of help to them <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs who asked whether the government would put down an amendment specifically relating to disability i remind her that we shall come to an amendment regarding disability later <e> <s> my view on that amendment is the same as it is on this amendment <e> <s> if these weapons are considered to be of such a dangerous character that they should not be used i think it is right that they should not be used even by disabled people <e> <s> that does not mean to say that one is not concerned about disabled people <e> <s> there is enormous concern <e> <s> my noble friend lord wynford gave four impressive examples <e> <s> but there is a saying that hard cases make had law <e> <s> that applies in this case <e>", "<cs> the noble lady is quite right <e> <s> that was a very hard case and that is the reason why we are taking action <e>", "<cs> all rifles which are of a self-loading or pump-action nature will come into this category <e> <s> they will not be used by schools <e>", "<cs> this bill has no bearing on military weapons used by the military <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is profitable to pursue this example <e> <s> however i shall certainly look into what my noble friend has said to see whether there is a point which i have missed <e> <s> there is certainly some slight confusion in my mind if not in my noble friends as he referred to a single shot self-loading weapon <e> <s> either it is a single shot weapon or it is self-loading in which case it is more than a single shot weapon <e> <s> that might be the cause of some of the confusion <e>", "<cs> i shall pursue that point and write to my noble friend about it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend for a moment <e> <s> he stated that he had specifically said that his amendment is restricted to certain types of people <e> <s> that may be what is in his mind <e> <s> however it is not what the amendment says <e>", "<cs> on the last point of my noble friend lord torphichen what goes into a section category is self-loading rifles <e> <s> they are those which can carry more than one burst or one burst at a time <e> <s> they will all be in the section category <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment perhaps i may clarify one matter <e> <s> i did not mean to smear anything that he said <e> <s> he said that these amendments add additional safeguards <e> <s> they add additional safeguards only once one has exploded the principle that these weapons should not be available to the public <e> <s> having destroyed that principle which my noble friend wishes to do he then puts in the safeguards <e> <s> i was trying to tell my noble friend that the amendment demolishes one of the central pillars of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for explaining the purpose of the amendment tabled in his name <e> <s> he seeks to make a date before which it would be perfectly all right to have such weapons <e> <s> several dates have been put forward for example there is one in amendment no <e> <s> the next one in amendment no <e> <s> refers to the st december and in an earlier one amendment no <e> <s> reference is made to the st january <e> <s> all those dates are inevitably arbitrary <e>", "<cs> that may well be so <e> <s> however the fact is that if it is considered to be undesirable to have self-loading or pump-action rifles because of the nature of the danger they pose then it does not matter whether they were made before or after <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot help my noble friend any more than that <e>", "<cs> that of course is perfectly all right <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says that he cannot understand my argument <e> <s> it was that many models of guns were manufactured from early in the century until the s with no change in their specification <e> <s> we are worried about whether they can he used <e> <s> the fact that they have not been used is of great advantage <e> <s> as regards banning such guns i should like to point out that if a bullet goes up the spout it will do so with the same speed and accuracy whether the gun was built before or after a certain date <e> <s> am bound to tell my noble friend that for that reason i find it difficult to accept his amendment although i understand his concern <e>", "<cs> i agree whole-heartedly with my noble friend lord nelson <e> <s> i wondered how my noble friend lord burton would be able to argue the amendment any better than he argued the previous one <e> <s> indeed he used almost the identical words <e> <s> he said that before only very few weapons were made and he used almost identical words in respect of as proposed in a previous amendment <e>", "<cs> an air gun is excepted from the certification requirements of the act

of foot pounds in the case of an air pistol or in excess of foot pounds in the case of any other air gun <e> <s> air guns which are especially dangerous fall under section of the act and an owner must obtain a firearms certificate <e>", "<cs> these amendments relate to clause ac which defines those self-loading or pump-action smooth bore guns which are to become prohibited <e> <s> both amendments seek to change the definition <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> proposes a lower maximum length for such guns for the purpose of prohibition amendment no <e> <s> proposes a cut-off date for prohibition <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord would like me to say something <e> <s> the noble lord said that i had not answered his point <e> <s> i answered the matter as best i could <e> <s> i did not answer the specific point which he raised because he has the advantage of a catalogue which i do not have <e> <s> however i shall certainly take the noble lords point into account and write to him on the matter <e>", "<cs> here we are of course dealing with smooth-bore revolver shotguns which are presently manufactured with a magazine capacity of up to rounds <e> <s> the dragon and the striker are two examples of that type <e> <s> our understanding is that they are used for riot control purposes by some countries overseas <e> <s> they are not used for any sporting purposes and the government do not intend to use them for riot control here <e> <s> therefore we have decided to raise them to the prohibited category <e>", "<cs> we have at earlier stages gone quite a long way to meet the concerns of the shooting community by exempting from prohibition those short-barrelled pump-action or short-barrelled self-loading smooth-bore guns chambered for rim-fire cartridges but i think that a distinction has to be drawn with revolving smooth-bore shotguns <e> <s> those guns are generally smooth-bore conversions of section revolvers rifles rather than purpose-built weapons and the availabilty of the more lethal bulleted rim-fire ammunition in addition to the shot cartridges which they are intended to be used with has led to their being used in crime <e> <s> we should therefore be hesitant about including them <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord dilhorne wondered whether the amendment might be fitted more felicitously that was i think the word he used in another part of the bill <e> <s> i am not sure whether that is the case <e> <s> my noble friend said that poachers use sound moderators and silencers which is perfectly true but so do farmers and other people who legitimately use shotguns fitted with sound moderators and silencers for vermin control <e> <s> therefore if the government were to suggest that they should be banned i fear that my noble friend might find even greater opposition than there has been to this modest amendment before us <e>", "<cs> i dare say my noble friend did not use the word banned but that is the effect of his amendment <e> <s> to use the word banned would put them into the prohibited category <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i think my noble friend said not moved to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we are now on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend lord dilhorne reacted to the prompting from my noble and learned friend because i thought i heard him say not moved <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord dilhorne said that he had a difficult wall to climb and i believe that he has <e> <s> i also have a difficult wall to climb because i have tried to persuade my noble friend that the governments view is that these weapons are of such a nature that they should not he in private hands <e> <s> that has not prevented my noble friend quite reasonably i suppose tabling such an amendment <e> <s> this amendment would give people the ability to use self-loading and pump-action firearms <e> <s> both amendments nos <e> <s> and propose that a shooter should hold a firearms certificate for at least three years and should meet certain other criteria <e> <s> those criteria are so widely drawn that more or less anyone who meets the three-year requirement would be able to make out a case for acquiring one of these guns <e> <s> as soon as one does that one undermines one of the central pillars on which the bill is based <e>", "<cs> i do not have the figures with me but even if i had they would not really be very helpful <e> <s> the whole point is that there is a requirement not necessarily by those who participate in the shooting lobby but in the country as a whole to tighten up the law in regard to weapons of extreme danger <e> <s> that is the whole purpose behind the bill <e> <s> the noble lord knows perfectly well that these weapons have been used on occasions <e> <s> the public are concerned that these weapons dangerous as they are should not be in the hands of private individuals <e> <s> that is why we have taken these measures <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord brain was kind enough to say that he tabled the amendment in order that i might assure him that it is totally unnecessary <e> <s> i can so assure him <e> <s> the amendment would specifically exclude from prohibition rockets or shells which are designed for use in pyrotechnic <e>", "<cs> the whole purpose of this part of the bill is to seek to ensure that pump-action or self-loading weapons should go into the category which prevents them from being used at all <e> <s> that is the whole philosophy <e> <s> my noble friends amendment does not alter that very much <e> <s> the whole purpose is that these kinds of rifles should not be in public hands because of their lethality <e>", "<cs> weapons which are of historic interest can he held in museums under a special museums licence but they cannot be held in private possession <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is concerned about how he can keep weapons which have been deactivated <e> <s> in clause he will see that certain processes can be gone through which would have to be agreed by a proof house to show that a weapon has been deactivated <e> <s> i cannot tell my noble friend exactly what the process is because it would depend on the weapon in each case <e> <s> but if weapons are taken deactivated and certified as deactivated then my noble friend will be able to keep them <e>", "<cs> i am deeply indebted to my noble friend lord burton for saying that he has some sympathy with the government <e> <s> i knew that there would be a turning point in his views <e> <s> i was not too certain when it would come but it has arrived <e> <s> the clause is essential <e> <s> it merely provides that the secretary of state can put into subsection weapons or ammunition which are not <e>", "<cs> with regard to the last point i think that substantial numbers means what it says namely that they are there in large numbers <e> <s> the whole purpose of the amendment is to cover things which are likely to happen after <e> <s> if it were to be found that there were one two or three already in existence before clearly that prohibition should not be excluded just because one or two were available before <e> <s> that is why we have suggested these words so that it covers only the new forms of weapons which might be used in the future <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for not having replied to that point earlier <e> <s> i had intended to do so <e> <s> we are not aware of any firearms currently on the market which would escape detection <e>", "<cs> i did not seek to suggest that crossbows could not do substantial damage <e> <s> i said that there was no evidence that their misuse was very frequent <e> <s> i think that the noble lady will agree that they are not the same as a self-loading rifle or a pump-action gun <e> <s> they are motivated by different forces and their ranges are different <e> <s> of course we keep crossbows under very strict control <e> <s> they have their own laws by which they are controlled <e> <s> if there is evidence that they are getting out of control we shall take note of it and take the necessary action <e> <s> but that is not the same thing as saying that they are equivalent to self-loading rifles <e>", "<cs> these amendments would empower the secretary of state to make orders to remove weapons and ammunition from the prohibited category in cases where controls under section of the firearms act were no longer considered necessary <e> <s> this power would apply not only to firearms which may be prohibited in the future but also to weapons which are already controlled under section such as fully automatic weapons and those which this bill will prohibit such as self-loading rifles <e>", "<cs> my noble friend puts his persuasive argument on this amendment very clearly <e> <s> he says that if we have the ability to put various weapons into a certain category let us have the ability to take them out <e> <s> with the greatest respect to my noble friend he has not addressed his mind to the likely circumstances that would permit a weapon which is considered so dangerous as to be put into a certain category suddenly to become less dangerous so that one takes it out of the category again <e> <s> if that were the case the government could always come to parliament and ask for permission to do so <e> <s> however i honestly think that that is not likely to happen <e> <s> my noble friend puts the amendment very attractively but i do not think that such power is very likely to be used <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend lord gisborough is misdirected in the matter <e> <s> what the amendment deals with is nothing to do with plastic guns or new types of weapon it is those weapons which have been put into a certain cateogory because they are so dangerous <e> <s> the amendment proposed by my noble friend suggests that there might be circumstances when they ought to be pulled out of that category and made widely available again <e> <s> all i <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to alter the new definition of a shotgun which is set out in subsection of clause <e> <s> this provides that a smooth-bore gun will be treated as a shotgun for the purposes of section of the act if it has a barrel not less than inches in length and a bore not more than inches it either has no magazine or has a non-detachable magazine capable of holding no more than two cartridges and it is not a revolver gun <e> <s> it is the second of the three requirements which my noble friends amendment addresses <e> <s> it has the effect that any smooth-bore gun with a detachable magazine or a non-detachable magazine of more than two rounds will in future be subject to section control <e> <s> my noble friend seeks to restrict this to self-loading and pump-action guns thereby excluding bolt-action and lever-action guns and allowing them to remain on section <e>", "<cs> i feel a certain sorrow for the noble and poor lord lord john-mackie because he has not found many adherents to his amendment this evening <e> <s> my noble friend lord burton asked that i should be as intransigent on this amendment as i have been on others but it is not a question of being intransigent but of trying to get it right <e> <s> on this occasion i am happy to find myself siding with my noble friends behind me lord swansea lord peel lord swinton and lord burton <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord peel has introduced an important amendment and i understand exactly what he is getting at <e> <s> he wishes to ensure that these weapons are properly kept in safe places <e> <s> there is no difference between us on that <e> <s> the government have already announced their intention to amend the firearms rules so that in future a safekeeping requirement will appear as a condition on the face of a shotgun certificate as it already does on a firearms certificate <e>", "<cs> the requirements for safe-keeping are as my noble friend will realise for the individual chief officers of police <e> <s> the way in which we hope to get consistency is by publishing as we are doing the memorandum which gives guidance to the police on what they ought to do <e> <s> that memorandum has not been previously published but it has been given out to police officers <e> <s> however to meet the points of concern of my noble friend among others we have decided to publish this guidance so that people may comment and criticise if they wish <e> <s> they will be able to see what the guidance is <e>", "<cs> that is one solution <e> <s> i have suggested that exactly how safe keeping should be achieved is a matter for discussion <e> <s> the shooting interests will he considered during these discussions and we shall therefore try to get the matter as right as we reasonably can <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may help the committee over this vexed problem because the government have taken many reasonable steps to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> that is the difference <e> <s> under the bill we wish to give a chief officer of police power to refuse a certificate unless he is convinced that it is being used for a reasonable <e>", "<cs> i am not certain that i have hoisted on board the problem to which my noble friend alludes unless it be that because certain uses are conferred in subsection b those which are not referred to are therefore explicitly excluded <e> <s> i do not believe that that is so <e> <s> if my noble friend were with his agile legal brain to read subsection b he would see that it says <e>", "<cs> before the noble lady withdraws her amendment perhaps i may say this <e> <s> she was concerned that there might be one law for the duke and another for the dustman <e> <s> it would be wholly wrong if that were to be the case <e> <s> there are certain <e>", "<cs> new subsection b in clause which sets out the new criteria for the issue of shotgun certificates makes clear that an application for a certificate is not to be refused solely on the grounds that an applicant does not intend to use the shotgun himself or lend it to anyone else to use <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> appears to be a paving amendment for my noble friends more substantive later amendments <e> <s> the words that he proposes are not in fact necessary but if i may i shall write to my noble friend about it <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that the bill is fairly complicated to understand in certain areas <e> <s> however that is nothing compared with the mental acrobatics that one is obliged to perform when listening to the professionalism and experience of my noble friends asking what happens when one cocks a certain gun in a certain direction or removes a breechblock and certain other things <e> <s> i prefer to defer taking part in such a debate for fear that i may become somewhat lost and as a result inaccurate <e> <s> i should prefer to address my few remarks to the substance of the amendment as we see it <e>", "<cs> i believe that some members of the shooting community are concerned that the proposed requirement for the details of shotguns held to be listed on a certificate will be used at a later date to restrict the number of guns that an individual may hold <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what my noble friend lord mountgarret said and also for the remarks of my noble friend lord brookeborough with regard to his experience in northern ireland <e> <s> i do not see any real problem because all we are trying to do as my noble friend has said is to list and record the whereabouts of shotguns <e> <s> if there are shotguns which do not have a number then they cannot be listed <e> <s> the noble lady lady saltoun makes rather a meal of this by asking what the computer will do if a gun has no serial number <e> <s> i do not suppose that it will be the first problem faced by computers or computer operators <e> <s> however to use that in support of the argument that there should be no listing of shotguns seems to me somewhat tenuous <e> <s> all we are trying to ensure is that where shotgun certificates are issued the numbers should be listed <e>", "<cs> i believe that the answer to my noble friends first question is yes and with respect the answer to the second question is no <e> <s> we have no intention of limiting the amount of shotguns which a person owns or can keep <e> <s> as far as i can see the bill does not imply that in any respect <e> <s> i believe that the bill as it is would cause no problems at all in that regard <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend will have to spell that out more clearly <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill which i have seen and i have looked at it carefully for the reasons which my noble friend suggests to make one believe there is any limitation <e> <s> i do not see that <e> <s> if my noble friend has any reason to believe that the bill imposes such limitations i should be grateful if he could explain <e>", "<cs> my noble friend puts forward an avant-garde suggestion that we should use between and extra policemen and he says that the figure can be worked out quite easily <e> <s> i do not know how he worked it out so easily if he was a factor of per cent <e> <s> wrong <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is concerned to ensure that there is no scope in clause for chief officers of police to impose arbitrary limits on the number of shotguns which may be held on a certificate <e> <s> i have explained that there is no intention that that should be done <e> <s> where subsection a refers to a certificate specifying the number of shotguns to which it relates we are speaking merely of the number of guns listed on the certificate at any one time <e> <s> there is no overall limit on the number of guns which may be held <e> <s> the certificate holder is free to increase them or for that matter to reduce them <e> <s> the number of guns on the certificate at any one time is at the choice of the owner of the certificate <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend does that perhaps i may be allowed to add to what i have said <e> <s> i realise that the committee feels concern about this matter <e> <s> i explained that it is the view of the government that there is no limit applied or suggested at all <e> <s> quite clearly the committee is concerned for reasons which i understand <e> <s> i accept entirely the principle that my noble friend has put forward but i wonder whether he would be good enough not to press this amendment tonight but to <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend he is getting the reins between his teeth a little <e> <s> i have given my noble friend an undertaking that i will consider this point again <e> <s> there is nothing between us as to the principle <e> <s> we believe that the wording in the act is right <e> <s> if i give an undertaking to look at the matter again it is a little churlish of my noble friend to say that despite that undertaking we should vote upon the matter <e> <s> if my noble friend wishes to do so it is a matter for him but i have told him that i will consider the point and consider it quite genuinely and sincerely <e> <s> i am prepared to do that <e>", "<cs> i quite see the view put foward by the noble lord lord irvine of lairg but the difficulty is that a shotgun certificate can only be granted under section of the act authorising the holder to possess a shotgun <e> <s> it cannot authorise possession of a gun for a specific purpose <e> <s> what my noble friend proposes in this amendment involves quite a fundamental change in the provisions of the act <e>", "<cs> i probably explained it extremely badly <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend for doing so <e> <s> the act gives permission for the issuing of shotgun certificates <e> <s> having given the owner a certificate it authorises the owner to possess a shotgun <e> <s> my noble friend is seeking to put on the certificate the purposes for which that shotgun is to be used <e> <s> in other words the certificate authorises the shotgun to be used for specific purposes <e> <s> what happens if on the shotgun certificate the holder states that he wants to use it for vermin control because he is a farmer and then he is invited by my noble friend to go to shoot pheasant <e> <s> he then apparently is using a shotgun for a purpose for which the shotgun certificate does not give him permission <e>", "<cs> the whole purpose of a firearms certificate is that it gives a greater degree of control because of the lethality to which the noble lord lord monson referred <e> <s> the whole purpose of a shotgun certificate is that it does not require that degree of control <e> <s> the noble lord lord irvine said that this is the dead hand of the act <e> <s> of course it is not a dead hand at all <e> <s> the bill is being built on to the act which is the basis of this legislation <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to have such encouragement from my noble friend lord burton <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich is right <e> <s> the noble lord lord irvine of lairg put his finger on it when he referred to the existing powers of a chief officer <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend feels that this clause is not very satisfactory <e> <s> it has been debated in much detail and its purpose is to try to tighten up not so much the control of shotguns but the knowledge of where they are and who owns them <e> <s> in doing this there is inevitably extra bureaucracy there is bound to be a certain amount of imposition on people <e>", "<cs> that would be for the chief officer of police to determine <e> <s> but if a person were to go to a chief officer and say please may i have a shotgun certificate because want to keep a shotgun in my house and to blow it off in the face of any intruder <e> <s> my guess is that most chief constables would say that that was not a proper reason for holding it <e>", "<cs> i think that this amendment would in fact add to the bureaucracy of the system rather than alleviate it because it complicates the procedure and there is a risk that more people would be dissuaded from complying with the requirement <e> <s> if the purpose is to notify a chief officer if there is to be a change of ownership it should not be necessary for a person to put that information on a special form <e> <s> indeed it ought to be adequate to send in such a notification by letter <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to extend the category of person who may purchase ammunition to a person who has previously produced a certificate <e> <s> the amendment is somewhat loose in that it does not specify at what stage such a certificate must be produced or indeed to whom <e> <s> a person who produced his certificate to a vendor years ago <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would insert an additional qualification in clause c which makes it an offence to sell ammunition for a smoothbore gun to a third party unless he produces the relevant firearm or shotgun certificate together with the certificate owners written authority to purchase on his behalf <e> <s> the amendment requires that kind of written authority to specify the calibre type and quantity of the ammunition to be purchased <e>", "<cs> in tabling the amendment my noble friend may have assumed that the special penalty in clause for shortening the barrels of rapid fire smooth-bore guns relates to the fact that once the barrels have been shortened the weapons will in future fall into the prohibited category under clause lac <e> <s> we are simply preserving the <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord brain demonstrates a concern that a firearms dealer may be committing an offence while undertaking the re-lining of a pistol or revolver barrel <e> <s> it seems to be based on the notion that for a period when the barrel is smooth-bored the dealer would be in possession of a smooth-bored short barrelled self-loading gun subject to section <e> <s> a dealer who did not hold an authority under section may therefore be committing an offence by possessing such a gun <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment would provide holders of smooth-bore short-barrel self-loading pump-action guns with an opportunity to obtain their weapons and have the barrel extended which would take them outside the scope of the prohibition in clause <e> <s> the amendment would cut across the governments policy on conversion <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect he will not have complied with the law because the law if it takes the present form will say that if a particular weapon was a section weapon then once a section weapon it is always a section weapon and one cannot monkey around with it and make it into a lower category weapon <e> <s> what one can do is have it de-activated <e> <s> if one has it de-activated and it is as the <e>", "<cs> because they are two different amendments <e>", "<cs> i think there really is a perfectly reasonable argument about this <e> <s> in my noble friends earlier amendment he tried to show that if one has a section category weapon and one does certain things to it one can bring it into a lower category <e> <s> what i said about that amendment was that once it was a section weapon it was always a section weapon because one cannot try to bring it down into a different category <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for making his point <e> <s> all i can say is that it is perfectly all right to allow rifles to be converted to shotguns because they are converted to a different type of instrument which is kept under a different category <e> <s> it is one thing to have a rifle in a section category <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord blease for explaining the purpose of his concern <e> <s> the rules which are currently in force are those of and they do not require an application for a certificate to be accompanied by a photograph of the applicant <e> <s> the act prescribes the form of a firearm or shotgun certificate so as to include a power to require such certificate to bear a photograph of the holder <e> <s> we therefore thought it was suitable to have two photographs and were not aware that it would be appropriate to have three <e> <s> i shall look into the position and i shall write to the noble lord about it <e>", "<cs> i understand the problem that has promoted the noble lord lord john-mackie to put this amendment down <e> <s> i am happy to say that i find myself however in agreement with my noble friend lord burton which is a happy position to be in <e>", "<cs> it

lord harris ringing in my ears i wonder whether the noble lord lord brain is speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble lord lord brain is concerned about how this will be dealt with but i think that his concern need not be as substantial as he has made it out to be <e> <s> if there is to be club approval the system has to be properly administered and monitored and if the public are to have faith in it there must be a way of independently verifying the clubs practices <e> <s> the police are the obvious body to do this <e> <s> there would be no point in having a system of approval if there was no way of ascertaining whether a club is complying with the requirements <e> <s> it is quite true that a police officer may be in uniform and in that case everybody knows who he is <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a difference <e> <s> that is that the cardinal principle upon which the bill operates is that firearms need a higher level of control than shotguns <e> <s> it is perfectly true that a person can come in with a shotgun he can use it here he can purchase one here and he can use it and he can take it away <e> <s> but a firearm is considered to be in a very much higher category <e> <s> that is the reason why the provisions in the bill at the moment permit people to come here and buy a firearm but not to possess one while they are here <e> <s> the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> lord john-mackie that it would be good for trade because a visitor can buy a gun would still stand but he can only buy it providing he exports it he cannot buy it and use it in this country <e>", "<cs> i think that the difference is and i come back to the fact that if a visitor comes to this country and purchases a firearm it ought to be on a firearms certificate <e> <s> that is what happens if you are a resident in the united kingdom <e> <s> you go along with your firearms certificate and you explain to the chief constable i want to have this firearm because it will be used for this that and the other purpose <e> <s> the serial number is then put on the certificate <e> <s> that is what happens when a resident makes an application <e> <s> when a visitor comes he has no firearms certificate and therefore it cannot be registered and so the police have no control over who that person is <e> <s> indeed there would he an anomaly if we were to say that a visitor should have an easier form of control over his firearms than does a normal resident in the united kingdom <e> <s> where the visitor has used a gun and wishes to take it away that may be a different matter <e> <s> he can still purchase one and have it sent abroad <e>", "<cs> i see what my noble friend lord burton is getting at but i am bound to say that my noble friend lord mountgarret is correct <e> <s> anyone who takes a gun with him has to take reasonable precautions <e> <s> if that person goes to a hotel it is perfectly reasonable for him to say to the hotelier do you have a safe into which i can put my gun <e> <s> if the hotelier says yes i have that is fine the weapon is kept in a safe place and the owner is vindicated <e> <s> if the hotelier says no i havent it is for the gun owner to find some other place <e> <s> if the only place is beneath his bed it becomes a matter of degree as to whether that is considered to be a suitable place <e> <s> if he is lying on top of the gun then perhaps it is <e> <s> if he leaves it in his bedroom and goes down to dinner it is not <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he prompted me to get to my feet and having been prompted i have now forgotten what i was going to say <e> <s> i remember now what it was <e> <s> he made a classic flaw if i might so put it <e> <s> i f he were to stay in an hotel and say to the hotelier will you look after my weapon <e> <s> he does not give the responsibility to the hotelier <e> <s> he may use the hoteliers facilities but that gun is my noble friends and he does not hand over responsibility for it to the hotelier <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might help the committee by coming back to the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i might say that i think my noble friend lord swansea was quite right it would be difficult to accept this amendment because in a number of places such as some states of the united states of america no form of qualification or authorisation is required to purchase or possess a firearm and in some cases even a shotgun <e> <s> thus the effect would be that if the noble lords amendment were to be included in the bill it would preclude large numbers of perfectly respectable legitimate shooters from coming here to shoot not only on private estates but elsewhere and in competitions <e>", "<cs> all these amendments seek to impose yet further conditions on people who come from abroad <e> <s> i should have thought that on the whole the committee would have felt that this was not necessary <e> <s> clause already provides a sensible level of control for visitors who wish to possess firearms or shotguns in this country <e> <s> there has to be an application <e> <s> that application has to be made by a person who is resident in this country to his local chief officer of police on behalf of the visitor <e> <s> the chief officer must be satisfied that the visitor has a good reason for possessing the firearm or in the case of shotguns for possessing purchasing or acquiring them <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord peel rather threw me when he put down the amendment or rather when he spoke to it <e> <s> my noble friend lord gisborough said that it was the most sensible amendment <e> <s> i am bound to tell him that i cannot accept the amendment because it has an effect which i think that my noble friend did not realise <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i had not taken that into account <e> <s> nevertheless that threw me when i saw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it depends on what the applicant asks for <e> <s> if somebody comes from portugal to stay with my noble friend lord peel he will ask for permission to shoot with my noble friend and that will be stated on the permit <e> <s> if on the other hand he wants to shoot all over the place then he will apply to shoot on any other land on which he has permission from the owner <e> <s> if that is stated on his permit he may do so <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend lord torphichen is not correct <e> <s> it will be for the sponsor to apply <e> <s> the sponsor will apply for the visitor to shoot where he wishes to shoot <e> <s> i can only assure my noble friends and i want to be as clear as possible because i know that this is a matter which causes concern that if a sponsor wishes to obtain a permit for a person to shoot on his land then he applies for him to shoot on this land <e> <s> if that person wishes to go and shoot in six different areas and knows that he will do so then the permit will list those six areas <e> <s> on the other hand if the applicant says i wish to be able to shoot anywhere in england on land for which i have the owners permission then that will be put on the permit <e>", "<cs> it is difficult for me because at one moment my noble friends say this is disgraceful because the applicant will have to go to every single chief constable for every place on which he wants to <e>", "<cs> of course i shall take account of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> however i should not have thought that it was necessary to put it in the bill if my explanation is accepted <e> <s> people are concerned that they should not have to apply for permission to shoot everywhere <e> <s> i am bound to tell the committee that there must be some form of control of visitors and weapons that come into this country <e> <s> did i hear a note of dissent from behind me <e> <s> i think that there must be some kind of control otherwise people will flood in all over the place with guns <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that he was disappointed with what i had said <e> <s> everyone in the united kingdom who owns a firearm or shotgun must have a firearms certificate or a shotgun certificate <e> <s> that shows that he has good reason to possess the firearm <e> <s> indeed in the bill the chief officer is allowed to reject an application if the person does not have good reason to possess a firearm <e> <s> it would be unfortunate if we were to permit foreigners coming into the country to have a position superior to that of people in the united kingdom if they cannot show good reason for holding a gun <e> <s> if we have no control anyone can come into the country with guns and rifles and say they want to go shooting and stalking <e> <s> we say that if a person wishes to come a sponsor may say i want this man to come and he will shoot with me or he is going to come and shoot on a variety of other places <e> <s> he would be able to shoot on any land in the country provided that he has the owners permission <e>", "<cs> i certainly take it back entirely if i misinterpreted what my noble friend said <e> <s> in that case there is nothing between us <e> <s> all the permit will say is that the person may shoot on land over which he has the owners permission in which case my noble friend and i are in agreement <e>", "<cs> it is always dangerous to give an off-the-cuff answer to a specific problem <e> <s> i think that i should be right in saying that if my noble friend wished to apply to come to this country and asked his son to be a sponsor to get a permit for him but said <e>", "<cs> they could go wildfowling in the same way as they could go shooting deer or pheasant provided that they had the appropriate authority <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend does that may i point out to him <e>", "<cs> i understand that my noble friends amendment is equivalent to a manuscript amendment at committee stage <e> <s> therefore my noble friend is entitled to move that amendment in the way in which he wishes <e>", "<cs> i shall be only too happy to assist my noble friend with clarification of the bill <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to substitute the word firearms for the expression weapons in paragraph a of clause <e> <s> however the use of the word weapons here is intentional <e> <s> paragraph a is referring back to subsection which deals with both visitors firearms permits and visitors shotgun permits and there is a risk that it might be construed as a reference only to the firearms covered by the visitors firearm permit <e>", "<cs> it would be a fairly rare occurrence for a firearm not to contain a serial number whereas <e>", "<cs> this amendment would dilute the controls too far <e> <s> it would give us the prospect of a person who does not hold a shotgun certificate using a shotgun in the presence of another person who may or may not have a shotgun certificate who in his turn is an employee of someone who may have a shotgun certificate <e> <s> there is nothing in my noble friends amendment to say that the employee supervising the guest must be a certificate holder or that he must be familiar with guns and how to use them safely <e> <s> there is little accountability <e> <s> the employee might even be a kitchen maid from some other country <e> <s> i do not believe that that is what my noble friend intends <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the clause as it stands at the moment is that by definition a visitor is someone who spends a short time in this country <e> <s> though permits will normally be issued only to cover single visits there is a provision in subsection for them to be issued for up to six months where a person is making a longer visit or where he or she intends to return for a second visit to the country within a short space of time <e> <s> that should be adequate to meet the needs of most visitors and i believe that it is <e> <s> however in view of the fact that there are one or two visitors as members of the committee have explained who come here for longer periods it seems that there will not be a great deal of harm done if we accept the amendment <e> <s> i am happy to do so <e>", "<cs> the government introduced the idea of a group application in recognition of the fact that where six or more visitors up to a limit of wished to come here for exactly the same purpose their applications could be dealt with by the police on the basis of the same inquiry and therefore at a reduced fee <e>", "<cs> i can see that my noble friend is trying to amend the figure <e> <s> all i was trying to explain to him was that for simplicity it was considered that it might be desirable for a number of people coming together to be processed on the same application <e> <s> my noble friend lord swansea said that it does not cost the police anything <e> <s> i would be surprised if he knew of any business that processed additional work without there being a cost <e> <s> the fee for each person would be <e> <s> if there are individuals it comes to <e> <s> the group fee is <e> <s> that is a considerable advantage <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to provide that a group permit should allow holders to shoot on one or more private premises <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that subsection already provides for that <e> <s> paragraph a makes it clear that the holders of a group permit may use their guns for sporting purposes on the same private premises during the same period <e> <s> it does not matter which private premises <e> <s> it may be any number of private premises on more than one occasion provided that it is the same private premises during the same period that is to say provided that everyone who holds a group permit shoots at the same place at the same time <e> <s> in view of the decision which was taken earlier i wish to consider whether this affects the amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that it does but i should like to consider it <e>", "<cs> the amendment provides that when a party of overseas shooters comes over here having made a group application for visitors permits a member of the group can drop out and be replaced by another and the police only have to be notified within <e>", "<cs> i understand that point <e> <s> but it is obviously difficult if someone arrives with guns and ammunition and someone elses permit <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be reasonable and understand that the police will check out that situation at the earliest possible opportunity <e> <s> that could well be within hours but i think it is pushing it a little far to make a statutory obligation forcing the police to undertake that check within hours <e>", "<cs> i wish to be as helpful as i can to my noble friends <e> <s> i see the difficulty that they are in <e> <s> i am concerned that if we write into the bill an obligation that on all occasions the police must issue or reject a certificate within hours we shall put an unreasonable demand on them <e> <s> it may well be that in many cases the police will say yes that is perfectly all right <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend concludes i wonder if i might just say this to him because i realise that he is concerned about this question <e> <s> in the majority of cases the police would almost certainly deal with the matter very quickly and there would be no trouble <e> <s> all that i am saying to my noble friend is this <e> <s> do not let us put an obligation upon them which it would he quite impossible in a few rare cases for them to meet <e> <s> there may be some occasions when they would have to check <e> <s> it is very unlikely but i think that we ought not to place that obligation upon them <e>", "<cs> there is no conceivable way that one could have listened to this debate on this clause without taking note of that <e> <s> i shall certainly take note of it and as i have told my noble friend i shall be only to happy to see whether there are any ways round the problems that he and his noble friends have adumbrated <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether or not that clarifies this for most people but i find that i am more confused than i was at the beginning <e> <s> i do not mean that to be in the slightest discourteous to my <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that i can help my noble friend very much on this matter <e> <s> he asks what is possession <e> <s>

does not possess my handkerchief <e> <s> it is still mine but i have loaned it to him <e> <s> i do not believe that i can take the matter much further because possession means having the thing <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that there is substance in them but i shall consider what members of the committee have said <e> <s> at the moment i do not believe that there is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help my noble friend because i do not believe he has correctly addressed himself to this matter <e> <s> the clause states <e>", "<cs> a person will not be able to take possession of a gun if it is on approval <e> <s> he either buys the gun or he does not buy it <e> <s> if he buys it he is in possession of it <e>", "<cs> of course i take the point <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will also take the point that where a dealer in this country sells a gun to someone whether in this country or abroad and it is to go abroad it is not unreasonable that for the reasons i have given the police should know where it is going <e> <s> there may be some occasions when other police forces will wish to know about it <e>", "<cs> in one sense my noble friend has made the clause too wide and in another sense too narrow <e> <s> the amendment goes too wide in referring to <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may interrupt my noble friend because he is dealing with the wrong amendment <e> <s> he is speaking to amendment no <e> <s> while we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i find myself in agreement with my noble friend lord swansea <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary announced on nd september last year his intention to prohibit certain types of firearm <e> <s> this bill which will give effect to this intention was introduced in another place on th december <e> <s> people owning such firearms had adequate warning about the governments intentions and it is our view that money should not be paid to those who chose to ignore this warning and to buy such firearms in the knowledge of the governments intention <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord lord brain will agree that the bill is right as it is <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to include within the buy-in scheme for firearms which will become prohibited those firearms which as the noble lord said have been converted to a lower classification under existing legislation but which will revert to their section status under the terms of clause of the bill <e> <s> we do not believe that any great numbers of guns which would generally be those converted from fully automatic to single-shot fire are involved <e> <s> however it is clear that shooters who lawfully held such weapons prior to september may suffer a degree of financial loss in the same way as those who hold self-loading rifles <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord burton is quite correct <e> <s> the amendment as drafted would mean the value which the guns would currently fetch in the market place <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary announced his proposals last september and since then the market value of those guns in the united kingdom at least has quite understandably plummeted <e> <s> we can see therefore that the payment under this amendment would be far less than the government are offering <e> <s> if the payments are to represent fair recompense we must consider the price which the guns would have fetched on the open market before my right honourable friends announcement had the effect of depressing the prices <e>", "<cs> the police will dispose of them <e>", "<cs> where the police normally dispose of such things <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord swansea said that the compensation arrangements were parsimonious beyond belief <e> <s> he said that people should be paid what they paid for the weapon in the first place <e> <s> i think that is really extending logic a bit far <e> <s> if my noble friend goes and buys a car and uses it for months or two years he cannot really be expected to be given the same price as he paid for the car <e> <s> he can expect to receive the price at which the car would have sold had he sold it <e>", "<cs> we are making a survey of the prices that these weapons commanded last summer to see what they were <e> <s> my noble friend will know that there are a whole host of weapons of all different types which could have compensation paid for them <e> <s> when these weapons are sent in we shall be able to find out their price <e> <s> it will be per cent <e> <s> of the price which pertained before my right honourable friends statement was made <e> <s> i do not believe that is parsimonious <e> <s> to give per cent <e> <s> of the retail price is a reasonable shot at the market price <e> <s> i accept that one will never get the thing absolutely per cent <e> <s> right but i think that is as near as we can reasonably get <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to make it totally clear <e> <s> dealers are entitled to sell weapons abroad which are legal abroad but which are illegal in this country <e> <s> they have access to the international market <e> <s> the police will not sell the weapons they take in <e> <s> those weapons will be smelted <e>", "<cs> it is always difficult to strike the right balance in any committee <e> <s> we do not want an arbitrary restriction on the size of the committee which might prejudice its ability to represent fully the various interests <e> <s> we want to strike a balance between a very small unrepresentative group and one that was so big as to be unwieldy and incapable of ever coming to a view on anything <e> <s> if we cut the committee down a number of interest groups would turn round and say it is not fair because they are not represented <e> <s> we have heard particularly at second reading that certain interests ought to be represented <e> <s> if we cut it down many of those interests could say that they are not represented <e> <s> if we make it too large it may be unwieldy

is to have a committee of reasonable size <e> <s> if one makes it fewer than i think that most people would agree that it will be too small <e> <s> all we say is let it be more than <e> <s> i cannot tell my noble friend at this moment whether it will be or or <e> <s> however it will not be unwieldy <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord swinton said that he did not want people on the committee to represent anything but that he wanted them to be people of broad knowledge <e> <s> yet my noble friend lord dilhorne said that he wanted a balance of interests <e> <s> it is difficult to get the balance quite right <e>", "<cs> i cannot help but find my noble friends argument quite amusing if i may say so <e> <s> a short while ago he said that he wanted the committee to be nice and small so that it could make progress <e> <s> he then said that people must not represent any particular interests <e> <s> he now puts forward an amendment that a particular interest should be represented <e>

written into the bill <e> <s> it is always possible to write anything into a bill but if that is done it is automatically assumed to exclude others <e> <s> i shall certainly consider this point because i realise what my noble friend is concerned about but i cannot give any guarantee that i shall come up with a magical answer because i believe that he might be guilty of putting into the bill just one section of people and specifying them particularly <e> <s> but i shall certainly look at it <e>", "<cs> in view of the governments position which i have already stated on the composition of the firearms consultative committee i do not believe that amendent no <e> <s> is necessary <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend were to look at the bill he would see that <e>", "<cs> i am hesitant to take

not the emasculated toothless animal which the noble lord lord morton of shuna believes it is <e> <s> one could hardly think of a more hideous description <e> <s> however i see what he is trying to get at <e>", "<cs> i believe that subsection a already adequately covers this point by allowing the committee to make such recommendations as it thinks necessary for the improvement of the working of

it is covered <e> <s> i do not know how i can help my noble friend any further <e> <s> the point that he seeks to make is covered in the bill <e>", "<cs> i believe that the need for this amendment is not so clear when subsection a already allows the committee ample scope to make recommendations in the working of the firearms control <e> <s> the sole purpose of subsection c is to enable my right honourable friend to seek the advice of the committee on virtually any matter connected with firearms control where he sees a need for it <e> <s> there may be a few areas where it would be inappropriate for the secretary of state to seek advice from the committee for the reason that there are areas where it is inappropriate for him to act whether by means of legislation guidance or advice or whatever <e> <s> one such matter is the operational discretion and control of a chief constable <e> <s> it would be unacceptable that the committee should be able to offer advice on matters on that kind <e>", "<cs> i see that point but i do not believe that it is a mirror image <e> <s> subsection b allows the committee to make proposals for amending those provisions <e> <s> subsection c requires the committee <e>", "<cs> the amendment would give the committee the added responsibility of preparing and subsequently revising a code of practice for firearms users which would be approved by the secretary of state and by parliament <e> <s> obviously the safe use of firearms should be encouraged <e> <s> but i am not sure that it would be easy to produce such guidance as the amendment envisages it is possible that this could end up in conflict with the guidance which has been given to the police <e> <s> if the code were admissible in court it could be construed as having the force of law and the committee might inadvertently be usurping the proper function of the government in putting forward law for approval by parliament <e> <s> it could conflict with the chief officers role

problem to him <e> <s> subsection bb provides <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i meant to refer to that point <e> <s> the answer is that i am afraid that the memorandum will not be published by the report stage <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment <e> <s> i shall take into account the point that the committee has made and look at the matter before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the government of the day would consult the committee which is after all a recognised body of experts on the administration of the act just as the government <e>", "<cs> with respect that is a different matter <e> <s> what i said was that i have no doubt that if there was a change or if the home secretary wished to change the law he would consult the committee about changing it <e> <s> that is totally different from deciding that the law should be changed <e>", "<cs> i think that the committee should be allowed to continue at the discretion of the secretary of

for a limited period initially in order to enable it to prove its worth <e> <s> it is right that its existence and its cost-effectiveness to the taxpayer should be kept under review <e> <s> i think the clause as it stands allows for a review every three years and i should have thought that that was reasonable <e>", "<cs> a right of appeal against a refusal by a chief officer of police to issue a

provisions of copyright licences and to provide for copyright licences of right following an adverse report by the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> the provision is subject to the qualification that the minister must be satisfied that such an order would not breach our international obligations <e> <s> it is premature as yet to include that because it has not yet been passed

be a little patient because we are as he will know only too well entering a whole wide field of possible alteration in broadcasting <e> <s> this will be one of the many things to be considered <e>",

statement is an important one <e> <s> i should have hoped that the noble lords lord mishcon and lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> might have given it a greater welcome <e> <s> however i think that they

he will willingly sit down if i would like to get up and answer <e> <s> i shall do my best to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend lord swansea thinks that the procedure is cumbersome i can only tell him that it is in order to protect the interests of the individual at every stage that the amendment is longer than he would wish <e> <s> he will know as well as i do that if the amendment had been shorter we should have been accused by him of steamrollering over the interests of the gun owner <e> <s> i do not think that the procedure is unduly cumbersome <e> <s> all we have tried to do

whole gamut of appeals disposal and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend must remove from his mind the word compensation <e> <s> what happens is that weapons are confiscated <e> <s> the case

my brother or my nephew <e> <s> or he may say i do not want these things i shall sell them <e> <s> it is up to the chief officer and the owner to decide how best to get rid of the weapons which the court has decided he should no longer have <e> <s> halfway through his speech the noble lord lord mishcon indicated that what he had said was an irrelevance because he was referring to another amendment <e> <s> i am glad that he said that because i was busily reading through the amendment to see what it was to which the noble lord was referring <e> <s> the noble lord was kind enough to give me advance notice of the points which he wished to make <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever happens to the noble lords suggestion it will not go into the wastepaper basket <e> <s> he is too much of a respected figure to have such treatment given to his suggestions <e> <s> i shall certainly give consideration to what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend suggests that the words to a substantial extent should be replaced by the words <e>", "<cs> my lords the words substantial extent are deliberately imprecise <e> <s> i think i said at committee stage that if you were to go to harrods and buy a firearm it would be wrong to say that they were not trading to a substantial extent just because it did not happen to form a very large proportion of their total turnover not that i know what that is but i would suspect that firearms do not form a very substantial part of it <e> <s> nevertheless they deal in that trade to a substantial extent <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it most people will sympathise with the noble lord lord mishcon for trying to tighten up the law <e> <s> it would seem that if these weapons and ammunition are sent around by mail order there appears to be a loophole <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord in this i am grateful for the help of my noble friend lord renton that we have not had any evidence to suggest that there is a problem with mail order sales <e> <s> therefore if we cut <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i rise on this occasion oddly enough not at the request of the noble lord lord mishcon it is usually his peroration to invite me to rise again but first to apologise to him for the grief which i have evidently caused by hypothesising him as being a criminal <e> <s> it merely helps to exemplify the position to sharpen ones mental aptitudes and to extend ones imagination even further <e>", "<cs> my lords i always respect the advice of a professional and i respect it even more when it comes as an amateurs advice <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that if my noble friend lord mountgarret speaks to his amendment now it would facilitate the procedure and we can then take all the amendments together <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene on a procedural matter <e> <s> we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if my noble friend wishes to move amendment no <e> <s>

that will have to be taken later <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this issue has in some ways become confused <e> <s> the amendment i put down was a simple one <e> <s> i shall do my best therefore to try to help your lordships over the problem <e> <s> the amendment tabled in my name was put forward specifically to meet the problem of the estate rifle <e> <s> in other words it was introduced in order to enable those people who were visitors to an estate to use an estate rifle which belonged to the estate owner even though that person himself did not have a certificate provided that he was in

granted such a certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am permitted to speak again <e> <s> i had rather hoped that the house would not give me leave to speak again <e> <s> however unless i hear to the contrary i shall do my best to answer my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has moved amendment no <e> <s> which would leave out subsection <e> <s> subsection is necessary because otherwise a person who borrows a rifle is not allowed to purchase any ammunition to go into the rifle <e> <s> if my noble friend thinks that that is curious and says that it is up to the estate to provide the ammunition i would tell him that without this provision it would be an offence for the visitor to pay the estate owner for the use of that ammunition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for tabling these amendments <e> <s> i shall try to explain the position <e> <s> under present legislation there is no facility for visitors to come to the united kingdom and then buy and take possession of firearms <e> <s> frankly i do not see any reason why this position should be relaxed <e> <s> after all the intention of this bill is to tighten rather than relax the law <e>", "<cs> my lords to be fair to my noble friend lord balfour he has seen that his proposed amendment does not match some of the controls which were built into our new clause on estate rifles <e> <s> i do not disagree with him <e> <s> his amendment would allow a servant of an occupier of any private premises to supervise shooting by non-certificate holders without requiring him to hold a shotgun certificate <e> <s> nor would there be any minimum age for the borrowing of a shotgun in such circumstances <e> <s> i do not believe that your lordships would wish to introduce legislation which for example would allow a person living on a housing estate and having a feet long back garden to leave some employee such as an <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should tell my noble friend that i understand his dilemma <e> <s> i shall have to look at it again before third reading but i think that at the very least the exemption will need to be framed in terms of both the lender and the servant being certificate holders and also restricted to sporting purposes <e> <s> however i will reconsider the matter if that would meet my noble friends approval <e>", "<cs> my lords a similar amendment was tabled at committee and i then explained that the government did not feel disposed to extend the scope of the buying scheme to include payments to firearms dealers <e> <s> the position of dealers is quite different to that of private individuals <e> <s> trading in any commodity or goods inevitably entails a certain element of risk and there is the rough and tumble of trading which must be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson has explained that as the governments proposals to prohibit certain types of weapon were announced by my right honourable friend the secretary of state on nd september potential purchasers of such weapons could not have known of our intentions until the evening of that date <e> <s> anyone who bought such a gun on nd september obviously did so in good faith and should be eligible for payments under the buy-in scheme <e> <s> the government on reflection accept that the noble lords argument is sound <e> <s> i am therefore pleased to be able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand that your lordships are concerned about compensation <e> <s> everyone is concerned about compensation when it crops up <e> <s> however i think there has been a misunderstanding over what is being offered and i hope that i shall be able to put the matter straight <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not want to involve your lordships in what would be a committee stage because it is not the right thing to do <e> <s> however if i were to have the leave of the house on this one further occasion perhaps i may just add a little on the subject as i have been invited to do by the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> it would be wrong for me to say that i shall look again at the matter <e> <s> we have tried to conclude what is a fair method of compensation <e> <s> i cannot possibly say to your lordships that in each and every case that that will be a precise figure which will be an accurate one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich because i agree with him <e> <s> none of us wants the firearms consultative committee to grow so large that it becomes unwieldy and ineffective <e> <s> on the other hand we must make sure that the benefit of the committee will lie in its ability to bring together the various interests of those who administer and enforce the legislation and those who participate in shooting for recreational and other purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained in committee that the government have always intended to include sporting and competition interests on the committee and that the wording in the bill is specifically drawn to permit this <e> <s> i therefore considered that the inclusion of such an amendment was not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords subsection of clause sets out among other things three distinct areas of concern to which the noble lord lord mishcon referred one or more of which

right that its existence and its cost-effectiveness to the taxpayer should be kept under review <e> <s> i believe that the clause as it stands should continue <e> <s> it allows for the committee to remain in place for five years and thereafter to be reviewed every three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that at a time when we are trying to tighten controls it would be very prudent to extend the life of certificates to five years before renewal <e> <s> obviously the longer the period of validity of a certificate the less likely it is that unsuitable people will come to notice <e>",

changed from being as it was orginally of a political nature to being rather more of an economic nature <e> <s> many people are leaving vietnam because they think and they find that the opportunities

understand that a great deal of effort has been made to use special constables <e> <s> however it is inevitable as the noble lord lord knights will know from his own responsibilities as a chief constable that different chief constables in different areas take different views on how best to employ special constables <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how many of those questions i can answer <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord this <e> <s> it is a factor that he may have inadvertently omitted from his calculations <e> <s> special constables are volunteers <e> <s> one cannot force feed volunteers into joining <e> <s> my noble friend is concerned to see an increase in police strength <e> <s> the strength of the police force as a whole has gone up by some people <e> <s> expenditure on policing has risen from billion to billion <e> <s> special constables are one small facet of this expenditure <e> <s> they are volunteers <e> <s> i shall certainly take note of the suggestions made by my noble friend <e> <s> if he would care to tell me how one can force a person to become a volunteer other than a person who is already in the army i should be delighted to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i could have sworn that it was minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords we are opposed to private citizens adopting a policing role except as special constables <e> <s> we are in favour of active citizens playing a full role by acting as the eyes and ears of the police but not as their arms and legs <e> <s> if the guardian angels act unlawfully or engage in conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace their presence will not be welcomed <e> <s> in that event they could not expect to be exempted from the ordinary processes of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords under prison rules a prisoner must be granted remission <e> <s> all or some of the entitlement may be forfeited for offences against prison discipline <e> <s> in this mans case he had done nothing to forfeit his remission <e> <s> therefore his remission was granted to him <e> <s> there is nothing in the rules to prevent that from happening <e> <s> the offence that he subsequently committed was when he was quite properly a free man <e>", "<cs> my lords what the learned judge thought he had given is a matter for the learned judge <e> <s> what he actually gave was seven years imprisonment <e> <s> while i fully understand my noble friends concern about this matter he will know that remission is granted under certain circumstances <e> <s> though he shakes his head those are the prison rules which come under the prison act and which are passed by parliament <e> <s> those are the rules and as they now stand there was no authority for that prisoner to have been retained further in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord chooses to tell my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is a matter between him and my noble friend <e> <s> i would not wish to be a postbox in that matter <e> <s> i have no doubt that my noble friend heard what the noble lord said <e> <s> however i am not sure that the noble lord is right <e> <s> i think my noble friend was saying that the rules themselves are wrong <e> <s> if that is so it is a matter of changing the rules <e> <s> but it is not a matter on which the governor was in error in letting taylor out <e> <s> i quite understand my noble friends anxiety <e> <s> it is an anxiety which i and everyone else shares when a person goes out and commits a horrifying murder <e> <s> he did that and he is now in prison with a life sentence and a recommended minimum of years <e>", "<cs> my lords remission of half the sentence is obtained if the sentence is months or less <e> <s> longer sentences have a one-third remission <e> <s> there is always the difficulty of how long to keep a person in prison and deciding when he should be allowed the right to become a free man again <e> <s> my noble friend asks whether this makes a mockery of sentencing <e> <s> to change it would involve a fundamental change in the system of sentencing that we have now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am overwhelmed that my noble friend should think that i am more usually right than the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> that is not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is not entirely correct <e> <s> the prison rules are made under the prison act <e> <s> they are made by statutory instruments which are laid before the house and are subject to parliamentary approval <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is not entirely correct <e> <s> perhaps i may put the house into the full picture <e> <s> taylor was imprisoned in for manslaughter and was given four years <e> <s> he was released on parole in april which was his first review point <e> <s> he did not breach his licence and he was released in july <e> <s> four months later he was convicted for wounding and two indecent assaults <e> <s> he was given seven years imprisonment <e> <s> he was considered for parole three times during that imprisonment and on each occasion he was found to be unsuitable for release on licence <e> <s> but he lost no remission and therefore he was released on his earliest date of release <e> <s> he was imprisoned for the third time in march for murdering a woman <e> <s> it is that crime for which he has life with a recommendation that he serves at least years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for saying at the outset that his generous contribution to the marshalled list is merely a device to omit part ii of the bill which deals with exclusion orders <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon on the face of it seems very reasonable and his explanation of it makes it seem even more reasonable <e> <s> i understand why he has tabled it <e> <s> he said that the bill as drafted turns the law on its head <e>", "<cs> of course i shall take great notice of what my noble friend says <e> <s> the point about this subsection is that it is a defence for someone to prove that he did not know <e> <s> if one is accused of something but did not have the slightest idea that what one was doing was having a certain effect it is a defence to say i did not know <e> <s> this is a distinction from the person who is accused of doing something and has as his defence that he had no reasonable cause to know <e> <s> if you can say i had no reasonable cause to know that you can get away with things <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might answer that point first <e> <s> my noble friend lord caldecote is quite right <e> <s> it is an imposition on the banks inevitably it is not in order to create difficulties for the banks but in order to be able to get hold of funds which are used for terrorism <e> <s> in order to do that the bill places obligations upon the banks greater than they have at the moment <e> <s> i can understand it if the banks feel that they do not particularly want to accept those obligations if that is what they do feel <e> <s> but if the result of this is that banks tighten up their procedures and as a result of that terrorists funds are found that can only be commendable <e> <s> that is the reason why my noble friend lord caldecote is right <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one short intervention <e> <s> my noble friend lord selkirk again expressed his concern about the defence <e> <s> he was concerned that the defence has to be beyond reasonable doubt and how could one know and that this is a criminal law with which we are dealing <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway said that the defence was the balance of probabilities <e>", "<cs> the amendment touches on a delicate and sensitive area and one which has been recognised by all members of the committee <e> <s> i am grateful to the committee for the understanding that it has displayed about the position in which we find ourselves over the judgment of the european court of human rights <e> <s> i shall resist the temptation of following the somewhat untoward remarks made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter about the european court and peoples views upon it <e> <s> if a judgment is made we wish as a government to see that we can accord with that judgment provided that it also meets the other difficulties in which we find ourselves <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon said that the amendment as he gently put it was the product of his humble mind <e> <s> it was a useful amendment upon which we could discuss this difficult problem <e> <s> i do not expect that the noble lord will seek to import the amendment into the bill <e> <s> i hope that he will not because it raises all sorts of questions <e> <s> my noble friend lord colnbrook put his finger on the pulse when he asked how a justice of the peace would know about the security service <e> <s> he said that if a justice of the peace were asked to give such an agreement he would not know what to do <e> <s> the point is also raised as to whether the justice of the peace is the right level of judicial officer to be asked to carry out that task <e>", "<cs> this is quite a difficult question to resolve <e> <s> i understand the concern the noble lord lord mishcon has about the special relationship of confidentiality and trust which rightly exists between a solicitor and his client <e> <s> i am conscious of the need to protect the traditional character of that relationship <e> <s> it would of course be undesirable if a solicitor were unable to represent his clients interests <e>", "<cs> we are once again in this difficult and technical area of legal privilege and the relationship between a solicitor and his client <e> <s> but i think the issue is rather different from the one we discussed in relation to clause <e> <s> it must be considered quite separately and on its own merits <e>", "<cs> the first debate we had this afternoon on clause stand part demonstrated the sensitivity and importance of the exclusion orders <e> <s> i believe that all that members of the committee have said on this amendment reinforces that view <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson of brompton expressed his concern about the effect of the orders and his general dislike of them although he supported them <e> <s> i cannot give <e>", "<cs> may i just finish <e> <s> the order dealing with exclusion would proceed similarly <e>", "<cs> the impatience of the noble lord lord henderson runs away with him <e> <s> i was just coming to that matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson said that he was quite sure that a skilful parliamentary draftsman would make the words much easier <e> <s> my simple understanding of these things is that when a matter which is quite simple is given to a parliamentary draftsman he usually makes it very complicated and to suggest that there shall be as the noble lord lord mishcon would say the law turning itself on its head in this case the parliamentary draftsman turning himself on his head and making something which is quite complicated very simple is a new concept but we live always in hope <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord puts this amendment to a vote if he wishes to with the greatest respect he has not adressed his mind to the fact that your lordships house has the ability as <e>", "<cs> the noble lord raises an important point <e> <s> i am fairly convinced that i can give him the assurance that he requires <e> <s> however it is an important point and i would rather take advice on it and write to him <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall certainly look into the matter <e>", "<cs> i understand why the noble lord has moved these amendments and we have considered them carefully <e> <s> however we do not believe they are necessary to achieve his purpose <e> <s> as the noble lord said this point arose in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords the article to which the noble lord refers is one which i myself have not read <e> <s> however if it gave the impression which the noble lord received it was in error <e> <s> the report has not been shelved we are considering it <e> <s> we have invited comments before deciding exactly what proposals to <e>", "<cs> my lords i can fully understand my noble friend having a somewhat proprietorial belief in his proposals <e> <s> we shall consider them and see what should be done about them <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining that the doubts we had about the system in the first place were confirmed <e> <s> he would be the first to understand that before introducing any radical changes even after such a distinguished report as has been received we need the comments of others <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord harris has explained he is only too well aware that this is a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> if he has been unsuccessful in pressing my noble friend then i can only suggest that he should press him a little harder <e> <s> i have no doubt that my noble friend has heard with accuracy what the noble lord has said but i cannot guarantee that there will be a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon always enjoys asking difficult questions <e> <s> i can assure him that there will be a response from the government <e> <s> whether it is sooner or later than the noble lord wishes must be a matter for him to decide when the announcement is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the government could only benefit from a discussion about my noble friends report <e> <s> i am bound to reiterate that when the discussion will take place is not a matter on which i could pontificate <e> <s> but i have no doubt that my noble friend the chief whip has heard the observations of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter as well as those of the noble lord lord harris <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will acquit the noble lord of moving an amendment in which he has not only a proprietorial interest but also a financial one <e> <s> the question is whether clause would penalise a solicitor who received his costs from his clients from what turned out to be terrorist funds <e> <s> i know that that alone would acquit the noble lord lord mishcon of any financial interest <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house i can only say that i cannot possibly tell the extent of the noble lords fears <e> <s> however i can say that my belief is that the noble lord shakes his head but he has asked me an impossible question <e> <s> he has asked whether i can say that his fears are unfounded <e> <s> i do not know what his fears are <e> <s> i can only tell him that what i believe to be his fears are in fact unfounded and that a solicitor who gives professional advice is entitled to be paid his costs <e> <s> only the funds that belonged to another person would have to be forfeited but a solicitor is entitled to his costs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has put down this amendment on the same subject as he did at committee stage <e> <s> the noble lord has struggled with the problem which besets us all <e> <s> he has genuinely tried to find a way round it and for that i am grateful to him <e> <s> he has admitted that there is a problem which indeed there is <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich agrees that it is an immensely difficult problem <e> <s> i do not want to underestimate the size of it nor would i wish to give to your lordships the feeling that the government are not taking it seriously or are dragging their heels over coming to a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter of detail <e> <s> the principle is important <e> <s> the principle which i have tried to explain to your lordships and it is one that causes concern is that under the amendment it would be necessary to explain not only to the judge but also to the defendants representatives the reasons for requiring further detention <e> <s> as soon as one has done so one has released to the representatives of the detained person information which is vital <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for explaining his concern <e> <s> he raised an important point in committee <e> <s> i have considered it and i thought that my answer was helpful <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that he thought my answer was helpful because i thought it was too <e> <s> i understood the problem so i thought which is not easy when dealing with insolvency matters <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord remains unhappy <e> <s> i could hardly say that his unhappiness is misguided because that would be churlish but i do not think that it is substantially founded <e> <s> however i will read what the noble lord said and i will again write to him after further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for the way in which the bill has been welcomed <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon reiterated his quite fair apprehensions and concerns about exclusion orders <e> <s> we respect those concerns <e> <s> we wish that exclusion orders were not necessary but we believe that they are <e> <s> the house has taken the same view <e>", "<cs> i should be delighted to assist the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> i was happy to do so earlier but the debate then went slightly down a siding <e> <s> the noble lord reasonably asked who would notify the fma of the convictions and so forth <e> <s> it will be the courts <e> <s> if the noble lord will be good enough to look at clause b he will see that it says <e>", "<cs> i do not know why the noble lord has said that it is clause <e> <s> i cannot read it all while i am on my feet <e> <s> a relevant offence is a relevant football offence <e> <s> that does not include stealing someones radio from his car <e> <s> that is not a relevant offence <e> <s> the offence must be one which is relevant to the scheme <e> <s> if the noble lord is worried about that point and wants to explain his worry to me afterwards i shall be happy to meet him <e> <s> i do not believe that it is a concern of substance <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham produced a persuasive argument <e> <s> he said that the government were trying to frighten people <e> <s> i think that what he said has even frightened the noble lord lord monson so much so that he rose to his feet <e> <s> perhaps i may explain the position because i do not believe that it is all that frightening <e>", "<cs> i should like to try to help the noble lord because he is concerned about the matter <e> <s> i do not want his concern to be misplaced arid i realise that the noble lord lord stoddart is also anxious <e>", "<cs> i do not have the slightest idea of the answer regarding the fire and safety regulations <e> <s> i am quite happy to find out the answer and to write to the noble lord <e> <s> however that is a totally different matter <e> <s> here we are concerned with making a scheme work <e> <s> we are then concerned with what happens if the people who operate the scheme deliberately prevent it from working and refuse to make it work <e> <s> i have tried to explain to the committee that the first penalty will almost certainly be a fine <e> <s> however if a person flagrantly disregards the law and believes that the club will pay the fine and therefore it does not matter then one has to have a higher penalty <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has introduced the interesting concept of what would happen if the computer system were to break down <e> <s> the obligation for the safe operation of a football ground is and should remain with the club or offical responsible <e> <s> the noble lord said that it would not be acceptable for it to be the responsibility of the football membership authority <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> it is the responsibility of the club operating the ground <e> <s> that is not to say that that type of person should not consult the police and listen to what they may wish to say <e> <s> in many cases they would do so as that is the sensible approach <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill to prevent them from doing so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham makes a serious point which is of concern to us all <e> <s> will the system work <e> <s> what will happen if it does not work <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for sport made it perfectly clear that the scheme will not be brought in until he is satisfied that it will work <e> <s> i agree with him that if the scheme does not work there will be chaos <e>", "<cs> the noble lord likes to ask quite simple questions and i shall give a perfectly simple answer <e> <s> i forgot to reply to that point simply because i was trying to answer the other point that he had made because i believed it to be one of considerably more substance <e> <s> we are aware of the concern of the association of chief police officers as regards this bill and the views that it has <e> <s> we shall certainly consult it before the next stage as to its views <e>", "<cs> i would not seek to minimise the difficulty <e> <s> the noble lord produced an example <e> <s> of course it is possible for these things to go wrong <e> <s> however if we follow up the noble lords analogy i wonder whether it would be the responsibility of the police to tell london transport to open up the turnstiles and let everyone in or whether it would be london transports responsibility <e> <s> i shall certainly look into the matter because we want to get it as right as we possibly can <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i did not give that explanation <e> <s> it was done merely in an effort to be accommodating to the committee and to be a little more hasty than perhaps prudence would have dictated <e>", "<cs> as to why we have gone from days to five the answer is because the government are flexible in their approach to these matters <e> <s> it is all very fine for the noble lord to laugh and i am glad he finds humour in what i say that is always encouraging for the ego <e> <s> however he and the noble lord lord harris have spent the whole time saying that the government are being obstinate and will not move at all <e> <s> we have shown that the original provision was a little excessive <e> <s> we had thought that the days would be generous because it would give everyone fair time to find the reporting agencies at which to register <e> <s> however we then realised that it gave the person who had been found guilty of a relevant offence the opportunity to spend the next days committing other relevant offences before he had even registered <e> <s> so we took the view that five days would be better <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord graham in his generosity will agree that that would be more suitable <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord is hard of hearing <e> <s> i tried to explain to him that i could not tell him the dates on which the consultations took place but i can tell him that we are aware of the view of the police <e> <s> i think that we are aware of the view of the probation service <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord would feel that is consultation <e> <s> i do not understand how one can be aware of somebodys view without having any consultation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris has made some interesting observations <e> <s> i do not know whether he specifically addressed himself to the amendment which states that whoever is to be the reporting agency it shall not be the police <e> <s> there are a number of points about this <e> <s> on part i of the bill i think the noble lord and i disagree as to the need for the scheme at all <e> <s> but on part ii it seems to me that there is an important job to be done in making restriction orders provisions effective <e> <s> the key to this is bound to be the reporting agency which is designated for the purposes of part ii to administer the arrangements <e> <s> where the offender does not register with the agency or does not report as directed or makes a false statement on an application for exemption he is liable to prosecution <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris was concerned about this <e> <s> he asked what happens if somebody does not turn up <e> <s> he is guilty of a criminal offence and if the noble lord looks at clause he will see that it states <e>", "<cs> i should be happy to accommodate the noble lord on any occasion that he wishes within reasonable bounds <e> <s> by that i mean that if he wished to see me i should be delighted to see him every day although that might be excessive <e> <s> however i shall be delighted to see him to discuss this matter if he wishes me to do so <e>", "<cs> as soon as i had mouthed the qualification that i put on seeing the noble lord i realised that it was an indelicate one <e> <s> i did not wish him to think that i was putting a constraint <e> <s> of course i should be delighted to see him with the noble lord lord knights and members of acpo <e>", "<cs> it will be not individual matches but the category of match which will be designated <e> <s> it will be up to the agency to communicate to the individuals who have to report which matches they are expected to report for <e> <s> that will almost certainly be done by post <e>", "<cs> the people who have to report will be told which designated matches they have to report for <e> <s> different people may have to report for different matches <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson is concerned that this power should not be retrospective <e> <s> i believe that i can satisfy his anxieties <e> <s> clause makes it clear that the courts consider making a restriction order only on conviction for a relevant offence <e> <s> it will be impossible to have committed a relevant offence before the introduction of the act which defines a relevant offence <e> <s> therefore i believe he will find that it is impossible for it to be retrospective <e>", "<cs> i am glad that i have satisfied the noble lord lord graham but i still have not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is not being at all dense he never is <e> <s> if the young man is abroad he cannot go to the reporting agency <e> <s> he must first go to the reporting agency and ask to be excused reporting because he will be abroad <e> <s> the agency will in its wisdom permit him not to report because he cannot do so in another country <e>", "<cs> if the person concerned will be on holiday he will have a reasonable excuse for not being there <e> <s> clause allows him to apply for exemption in advance <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for saying that he does not wish to press me <e> <s> normally i welcome that as i do on this occasion but the point which he makes will be met later by amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> suggests that the word may is left out and the word shall is incorporated <e> <s> had the noble lord contained himself a little longer he would have heard me say that i accept amendment no <e> <s> which makes that change in other words the position will then be as clause states <e>", "<cs> the penalties in the bill are there only as maxima as i explained previously <e> <s> the courts are always encouraged to sentence as lightly as they consider necessary in order to punish an offender <e> <s> of necessity the maximum must cater for the worst and possibly the most persistent of offenders <e>", "<cs> clause is in the bill specifically because it would be unfair to oblige someone who is not subject to a custodial sentence to report under this bill irrespective of circumstances on pain of a criminal offence in default <e> <s> for example the person concerned may have suffered a family bereavement and may have to stay at home to comfort relatives or to attend the funeral <e> <s> he may marry a wife <e> <s> i should not wish to advance the argument to the committee that he would commit the offence of failing to report if he devotes his attention to those other obligations provided that is agreed with the agency <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows the background to the matter is that we think there should be an effective means of preventing our hooligans from attending matches abroad which involve our teams because they have brought such disrepute to english football overseas <e> <s> indeed it would be quite indefensible to introduce a means of controlling our hooligans at home while at the same time allowing them to run rampage around the football grounds of europe <e> <s> the restriction order provision in part ii is the means by which the government propose to meet that objective <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the debate but i must tell the noble lord lord graham because i believe that he is wrong that if a person commits a relevant offence at a football match in england is taken to court sentenced to imprisonment and serves his sentence for five years he is not allowed to go abroad <e> <s> the noble lord says that that can happen in england but that if he commits the offence abroad and serves his term of imprisonment and returns to england unlike his english counterpart he does not have a restriction order for five years placed upon him and can continue to go to matches abroad <e> <s> the only purpose of the provision contained in clause is to make the offence committed abroad the same as it is in england so as to prevent people going to matches <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer that question from the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> there is a precedent because we already have provision for enforcing orders here which are made abroad in relation to drug trafficking <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord sudeley is concerned that the post office has not published a stamp to mark the quincentenary <e> <s> he will realise that that is the responsibility of the post office and not of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of carlisle for furnishing me with much information to which i was not privy before <e> <s> i doubt whether many other noble lords were <e> <s> the right reverend prelate has used this occasion to give a certain amount of publicity for what has been undertaken to commemorate archbishop cranmer and i am sure that the house is grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not but i now am <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to a service and whether the government should do anything about it we take the view that this is a matter for the church and not for the government <e> <s> i have no information that i can give to my noble friend about a possible statue <e>", "<cs> my lords the appointment of staff is a matter for individual chief officers of police <e> <s> the information which the noble lord requests is not kept centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i had a funny feeling that my noble friend would be disappointed with that reply but he will understand that chief officers are required to notify my right honourable friend the home secretary of the appointment of uniformed staff but not of the appointment of civilian staff <e> <s> therefore my right honourable friend does not know how many extra civilian staff have been taken on for these purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> when he rose i d id not expect him to say that he was firmly behind the government because that is not a familiar posture <e> <s> however i am grateful to him for that <e> <s> the firearms amendment act was introduced to try to preserve the peace and to take proper precautions over <e>", "<cs> my lords the fees for certificates and registration should be set at an economic level to recover the full costs of the licensing system <e> <s> the costs of increased manpower will be offset by an increase in the shotgun certificate fees which have not yet been set <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is right <e> <s> there will be as he puts it a small but modest increase in bureaucracy if by that he means the anticipated extra people who will be required throughout the country to process this <e> <s> i do not think that that figure is unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord reay for introducing this <e>", "<cs> my lords as i thought would be the case we have had a most interesting debate <e> <s> your lordships have endeavoured to contribute your views on a subject which concerns us all <e> <s> when the noble lord lord hooson said that he did not know the answer with his experience of the criminal law i can understand that very few of us think that we know the answer <e> <s> he suggested that a royal commission might provide the answer <e> <s> i rather fear that the royal commission may find the same problems as most other people have <e> <s> i do not believe that there is a simple answer to this <e> <s> we have to try constantly to seek a solution to it in what is after all a changing scene <e>", "<cs> my lords i see my noble friends point but as i tried to tell him at the time he put the question down his criticism is not so much over the regulations but the fact that in his view the sentence should have been longer <e> <s> he who gave the sentence knew perfectly well that the length of sentence given would include a certain period of time for remission <e> <s> my noble friend is perfectly entitled to believe that if he had been the judge he might have given a different sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has made his point <e> <s> i shall not pursue it any further otherwise your lordships will be denied the disagreeable experience of having me answer some more of your questions but i shall do my best <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend draws some peculiar conclusions <e> <s> i realise that he thought my answer was uninformative <e> <s> i have a funny feeling that when he tabled the question he knew that the answer would be uninformative <e> <s> the fact that we do not know how many shops are open on sunday is no indication of the sense of direction in which the government or the country should go in respect of sunday trading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham for that information <e> <s> it will be necessary to see the basis on which the information was requested in order to ensure that it covered all types of shops which are open on sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not agree more with my noble friend lord caldecote that the existing law needs clarification <e> <s> it has always been the view of the government that we should opt for deregulation on sundays <e> <s> however if parliament and others cannot agree on the matter the government have no intention of producing a bill only to find that it is rejected by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords we always come up against the problem of what the scots do on sundays <e> <s> all i can tell your lordships is that a sample survey of shops in scotland in showed that per cent <e> <s> of shops are open on sunday <e> <s> i do not know what that proves but it is a piece of interesting information <e>", "<cs> my lords my sympathies lie with the right reverend prelate in so far as everyone wishes to see sunday kept special <e> <s> on the other hand the law as it now stands is patently absurd and it is difficult for local authorities or anyone else to enforce it <e> <s> we wish to ensure that there exists a law which can be respected and adhered to <e> <s> the difficulty lies in finding agreement <e> <s> i invite the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester to discuss the issue with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in order to see whether they cannot find some accord which they can permeate through to their friends in both camps <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to work that one out <e> <s> it is all very well my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter persisting in asking questions of me and the right reverend prelate asking the same questions <e> <s> it would be much better if instead of trying to give the government a bloody nose over this issue they gave each other one <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens in respect of drinking on sundays is a peculiarly sensitive position so far as i am concerned <e> <s> i recall that your lordships and others are permitted to drink in a public house between pm and pm on sundays as a result of an aberration by a certain government minister <e> <s> i do not say that that is a suitable precedent to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord brentford considers that the rest proposals have a majority of support in this house <e> <s> i am not sure whether he can substantiate that <e> <s> they are fairly bureaucratic and many problems will be associated with them <e> <s> however i should be happy to consider the suggestion and i make the same request of my noble friend that he persuades some of his adversaries to agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain what the question was <e> <s> if the noble lord meant to preface his remarks by asking whether i agree the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords unusually for my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter he has drawn a red herring across the trail <e> <s> he is perfectly right that easter is one of the most solemn periods in the christian church and therefore we do not think that we should act in disregard of the views and the practice of important sections of it <e> <s> indeed if we did so we would have the curious situation whereby there would be one easter day for the united kingdom another for the western communion and a third for the orthodox church which does not seem very sensible <e> <s> the fixing of a may day bank holiday is another subject altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords there is good healthy disagreement over most matters and this happens to be one <e> <s> with regard to holidays i should point out that at present easter falls between nd march <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always at liberty to oblige my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for saying that there was some masterly erudition <e> <s> it was not of course from me but from his brother bishops in a different discipline <e> <s> i can assure him that it is not a question of government inactivity but of the churches inactivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to stand up to the noble baroness and tell her that i understand that the may day bank holiday is at present being reviewed by the department of employment and that the review is nearing completion <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that and i am grateful to the noble lord for informing us <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord glenamara that we should celebrate easter <e> <s> it is obviously a convenience if we can celebrate it mostly together <e> <s> as i explained the government are not inclined to make a move that does not have the agreement of the churches <e> <s> if we did that all we would do as i explained earlier is have three different dates on which to celebrate the one event <e> <s> that might cause more disharmony than harmony <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the question on the order paper to relate to whether the government would fix easter <e> <s> my noble friend shakes his head but he must be reading a different order paper from the one that i am reading <e> <s> my order paper asks whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i can quite understand that the noble baroness likes things as they were <e> <s> that is a good and progressive attitude <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that as she knows only too well this is a subject that creates a good deal of cross-flows and eddies of disagreement <e> <s> we are doing our best to solve the problem <e> <s> i realise that if we solved it in the way that the noble baroness suggested it would cause a good deal of confusion elsewhere <e> <s> but we are considering the may day bank holiday and at the moment we do not propose to implement the easter act <e>", "<cs> we have been concerned about whether or not the word serious should be inserted into the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon was as usual peculiarly persuasive in suggesting why he thought that the word serious would be an improvement <e> <s> i always have a certain hesitation when the noble lord lord hutchinson says as he did that this is only a simple and common sense amendment and that it is the kind of amendment which any broadminded person would accept <e> <s> there is another point of view <e> <s> the matter is not as simple and as straightforward as the noble lord puts it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made one speech in which he said that <e> <s> if he will be good enough to wait a little longer he will see that there is a reason for not accepting that word <e> <s> the point that i tried to explain to the noble lord is that in discussion it has been said that all these matters are considered to be serious matters <e> <s> the noble lord frowns but this is a fact <e> <s> we consider that disclosure of information is a serious matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> i suppose he realises that if the word serious were to be introduced there would then be two levels of test namely one where serious damage has been done and one where just damage has been done <e> <s> if the word was included in the bill we would in fact be saying that a person would be guilty only if serious damage was done but not if damage was done <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to the committee if i set out briefly how clause works <e> <s> a minister may only notify a person that he is subject to the same offence in clause as a member of the security and intelligence services if he is satisfied that two particulars are fulfilled <e>", "<cs> i hate to intervene in the dialogue going on between the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i do so because i wish to address the minds of members of the committee to the government view of the amendment <e> <s> just before dinner the noble lord lord mishcon told me that he did not understand the logic of the question which i had asked him <e> <s> i can tell him that i understand the logic of the amendment which was moved by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who described it as reasonable and helpful <e> <s> i can quite see the reason why he did so describe it <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord lord mishcon should fear that it is so difficult to get through what he described as the governments thick skin <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord withdraws the amendment i should say that i was merely trying to point out to him and to his noble friend who sits behind him that the governments skin is not quite as thick as it is sometimes made out to be <e>", "<cs> one of the dangers of saying that one will consider something which is a fairly modest description gives the noble lord lord mishcon the taste of honey <e> <s> he hoped that this amendment would also be given favourable consideration which was one rung up the ladder <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is particularly helpful to give examples <e> <s> i was trying to explain to noble lords that if one has to prove in law whether an action was lawful or unlawful it means that one has to prove that the work done was in fact lawful <e> <s> one therefore goes to a great deal of trouble to produce a whole lot of evidence evidence which should not come to the court in the first place showing precisely why the action was lawful <e> <s> that is done in order to show whether or not the work was lawful or unlawful <e> <s> that is why one discloses a whole lot of information about the security services which should not be disclosed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon fairly draws to the attention of the committee a matter about which he is concerned <e> <s> he says that we are entering a new part of the law which frightens him <e> <s> one must always bear in mind that the area of legal infringement has as a result of this bill been enormously reduced <e> <s> we are therefore left with only a small part of it where there will now be legal infringement by breaking the law <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said that what we are doing is creating a criminal offence and of course he is quite right <e> <s> the noble lord lord hemingford said that what we are dealing with here are civil servants and the criminal law and i think the inference was that we were treating them too harshly <e> <s> the whole bill is about where the criminal law bites and where it does not bite <e> <s> to use the argument that we are dealing with civil servants and therefore we should treat them leniently does not carry much weight because if they find themselves in a position of being accused of something they have the right of defence <e> <s> there are plenty of places within the bill giving them that right <e>", "<cs> the jury would obviously have clear guidance on what jeopardises means <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> the franks report recommended that it should be an offence for a crown servant to make an unauthorised disclosure only if he made it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon agonised over the spectacle of the learned judges going through this clause trying to find out what it means <e> <s> frequently i have sympathy with learned judges and indeed lesser learned mortals who have to go through acts of parliament trying to discover what they mean <e> <s> however that is because i am not a lawyer <e> <s> i shall try to illuminate the passage so that the noble lord will know at the end of what i have to say a little more than he did at the beginning about what the clause is intended to do <e> <s> i was grateful to my noble friend lord renton for his careful analysis of the clause <e> <s> he was quite right when he said that the government have to protect themselves against rather difficult and different circumstances <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord thomas with his distinguished and academic background has highlighted the natural and historical interest which <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord grimond is well aware that the whole concept of those who join the security and intelligence services is that they do so knowing full well that they keep what secrets they have and do not divulge them <e> <s> i shall come later to whether that should be done after or years <e>", "<cs> i did not do so because i did not think it particularly relevant to the subject <e> <s> the noble lord asked me to deal with a point but i did not think that dealing with the central intelligence agency was particularly relevant to what we are discussing <e> <s> we are discussing the future arrangements for the security services and the divulging of any information about them <e> <s> i have explained to the committee what the present position is and how the law operates <e> <s> i have explained how the law will operate if parliament approves the bill as it is at the moment <e> <s> other countries have their own methods of dealing with their own problems <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris is remarkable for one quality he tries to transpose one particular set of cirumstances or one particular set of laws from one country and say now let us use them in this country <e> <s> what the americans do about the cia and how they carry out their protection is a matter for them <e> <s> i have no doubt the whole series of the ways in which they operate is different from the way in which we operate <e> <s> we are trying to make it right for this country <e>", "<cs> the point which i welcomed in the intervention of my noble friend lord home was that he thought it was inadvisable to put too many pressures on a secretary of state in the statute <e> <s> i think that he was right over that <e> <s> the method by which permission is given is perfectly plain <e> <s> it is that the person concerned must go to the department in which he is employed and seek its permission <e>", "<cs> if a crown servant wishes to divulge information which he obtained during his time as a crown servant he refers to the department from which he came in order to obtain permission <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i forgot to answer that point of the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> during the second reading debate on stdecember the minister of state gave an account of the procedure which governs the position where a member or a former member of the security and intelligence services is considering writing a book touching on his work in the services <e> <s> later in committee when the issue was being specifically debated he made it clear that the policy was that authorisation for such publications would be rare and would be given only in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary subsequently confirmed that policy <e> <s> i do not think there was any change of heart between those statements <e>", "<cs> i shall try to take the steam out of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> the last thing i wish to do is to cause any dissension about a matter on which he and a number of other members of the committee feel strongly <e> <s> i shall not press the matter <e>", "<cs> these amendments relate to those who are separately prescribed under clause f or g of the bill because they need to be treated as crown servants for the purposes of the legislation but who do not come within the definition of crown servants given in the earlier parts of the subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord graham for having tabled the amendment even if for only one reason <e> <s> it appears to have propelled your lordships imagination into overdrive concerning a fairly modest amendment <e> <s> at one moment we heard the noble lord lord bonham-carter say that people would be put into prison for being in a cinema without a ticket <e> <s> that is about as extreme an example of imagination as one can get <e> <s> at another moment we heard the noble lord lord graham saying that those attempting to enter a football ground will have a short sharp shock of a months imprisonment <e> <s> in between we have heard a variety of examples including the noble lord lord airedale who always succeeds in putting forward matters of great finesse <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris is very good at making several speeches on report <e> <s> i was giving that merely as an example <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord now insists on making interventions from a sedentary position which is even worse than from a standing position we shall not get very far <e>", "<cs> my lords so is the other one <e> <s> both are most agreeable <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart said that the level fine was <e> <s> it is not it is only <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris quite rightly always likes me to reply to a question to which i have not replied <e> <s> i thought that the answer was fairly obvious although i did not actually reply <e> <s> if one steals a persons card one is guilty of theft <e> <s> i do not invite the noble lord to rise again but he merely makes a wagging dissent with his face by which i assume he means that he does not agree or does not understand <e> <s> if a person steals somebody elses card that person is guilty of theft in the same way as if he steals any other piece of property <e>", "<cs> my lords i make this intervention and i do so not as a government minister but merely one who is acting as leader of your lordships house <e> <s> we are going very far awry from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i would prefer the noble lord to take my interpretation of my words rather than his interpretation of my words <e> <s> from what he has said i think that he has gathered the gist of what i tried to intimate correctly <e> <s> in other words

<e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that acpo has been consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might have the leave of the house i believe if i may say so that the noble lord lord monson was transgressing the rules by making a second speech <e> <s> it has nothing to do with whether or not i have sat down <e> <s> the fact is that that is a separate matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the first of these amendments seeks to limit the range of football-related offences in respect of which a court might make a restriction order to those of violence only <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly correct when he says that football must continue to be enjoyed by people <e> <s> we are of course all entirely at one with that <e> <s> however i know the noble lord will realise that no restriction order will be placed on a person unless he has committed a football related offence <e> <s> it is not for a policeman to decide whether that offence constitutes a serious disorder or whether it constitutes merely a disorder <e> <s> the interpretation of the act that has been committed is left for the courts to decide <e> <s> it will be for the courts to decide whether the act of which the person is accused is one which has created serious disorder <e>", "<cs> my lords in part i of the bill we have provided a straightforward framework for disqualification from membership following conviction for a football related offence <e> <s> the standard period of disqualification under the bill is five years where the offender is sentenced to a period of immediate imprisonment or of detention in a young offenders institution and two years in other cases <e> <s> the court does not have to decide whether under the first limb four years would be better than five or under the second limb whether one year would be better than two years <e> <s> it is laid down in the bill <e> <s> it is clear and straightforward for the court for the offender and for the football membership authority which has to operate the scheme and enforce the disqualifications imposed under it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house to reply i shall do so by asking the noble lord whether assuming the bill is enacted and that the amendment is accepted it is reasonable for a <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to abuse the procedures of the house but with leave i shall speak again <e> <s> i believe that the answer that i gave was the correct and proper one <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff asks why we do not give the courts discretion <e> <s> we agreed that there should be a fixed limit in the first part of the bill <e> <s> if we have agreed that there should be a limit for offences committed at home it would be quite unreasonable to allow the courts to fix a different limit for offences committed abroad <e> <s> we should simply permit those hooligans who are of such a bad disposition as to have been disqualified from attending at home to go and ply their trade abroad <e> <s> that is why the offences must be the same in both parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments exclude fewer corresponding offences <e> <s> i listened to what the noble lord said <e> <s> we would be restricting corresponding offences to offences of violence at foreign matches <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help the noble lord with the leave of the house <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson said that there was nothing wrong with a person drinking alcohol on a train <e> <s> i think that he has forgotten the fact that he has to be convicted of a football-related offence <e> <s> the football-related offence is covered by these items in the schedule <e> <s> it is only if he is convicted of an offence one of which may be that he has been misbehaving because of alcohol on a train that the position would arise <e> <s> he has to be convicted of the offence <e> <s> the noble lord seems to have forgotten that <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think so <e> <s> forces have to meet requirements of national as well as local significance <e> <s> special payments have been made to police forces only in exceptional circumstances generally of an unforeseen nature

made in another place by my right hounourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statment is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and

views about all-seated accommodation and that a licence should reflect that <e> <s> the government are also thinking along those kinds of lines <e> <s> with regard to the methods of communication concerning crowd control between police inside and outside grounds that is obviously a matter which lord justice taylor will be considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly see that the point made by my noble friend is looked into <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his suggestions <e> <s> i think that anyone who saw the pictures of the events that occurred last saturday would have some sympathy with the feelings of the noble lord about people being in cages <e> <s> however i should just remind the noble lord that those fences were put up in order to prevent some of the other disasters which we had previously witnessed <e> <s> what very often happens is that when a disaster occurs one reacts to that and often that has another effect later on <e>", "<cs>

a position to consider those safety conditions if he thinks fit <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will contain himself i shall explain <e> <s> the inquiry is to be conducted by lord justice taylor who will have with him an assessor or more than one assessor in order that he may reach his conclusions as quickly as possible <e> <s> it is not the intention to have a whole range of individuals to assist him although he can call upon assistance and advice as he thinks fit <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite see the point of view of the noble lord lord taylor <e> <s> the statement states <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not those matters to which the noble lord lord hatch of lusby referred are fact will undoubtedly come out in lord justice taylors inquiry <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that when anything of such a nature happens the emergency services fire police and ambulance take the lead <e> <s> there are plans for dealing with disasters of this nature <e> <s> i have not heard reports which lead me to believe that i he situation was as the noble lord lord hatch has suggested <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the judicial inquiry has its own terms of reference <e> <s> they would enable lord justice taylor to cover those points if he thought it appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish for a competition as to how many times the noble lord or i will be wrong because i have a horrible feeling that i may not come out the winner <e> <s> the parliamentary nicety to which the noble lord referred had escaped me <e> <s> i thought that we were considering amendments nos <e> <s> and so on together but the noble lord wags his head <e> <s> i bow to that although that is what i had understood to be the position <e> <s> however those amendments all refer to a public interest defence and i agree with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby when he said that we do not need any more special defences and that common sense says that we should leave the thing alone <e> <s> common sense like that appeals to me and i support him wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend lord campbell managed to clarify his position on that point <e> <s> it might have dulled the enthusiasm of the noble lord lord mishcon again to try drafting on this subject <e> <s> i am bound to say that this is a matter of principle <e> <s> the house debated an almost identical amendment in committee and although the amendment has been slightly redrafted since then it does nothing to answer the principal problem which my noble friend the lord privy seal identified on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord renton has the uncanny aptitude of being right <e> <s> i would find it difficult to advise your lordships to accept this amendment <e> <s> we have already had a full debate on the principle of the public interest defence <e> <s> indeed we have divided on it <e> <s> i understand the concern of my noble friend in this matter <e> <s> however as my noble friend lord renton said the same issues which we discussed on the earlier amendment apply to this amendment too <e> <s> it is not a question of drafting it is a matter of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord renton was so carried away with the unanimity that occurred in respect of the previous amendment that i believe he hoped that it would continue with this amendment <e> <s> i find it a trifle disconcerting that both my noble friends lord renton and lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house to speak again certainly i shall consider what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i shall write informing him of my conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord mishcon has made the matter clear <e> <s> i thought that he did not intend to move his amendment <e> <s> he has now moved it and will later withdraw it so i understand <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a debate on exactly the same amendment at committee but unfortu <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only give the undertaking which i have given namely that people will have to ask permission if they are members or former members of the security services <e> <s> the situation will be considered on a case by case basis but permission has been given and will be given only in rare and exceptional circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities have a duty through registration under the nurseries and child-minders regulation act to ensure that reasonable standards are maintained <e> <s> people who are providing child care on a commercial basis have told the ministerial group on womens issues that they want to ensure that high standards are maintained by means of an expansion of provision <e> <s> the group recognises the need for a voluntary accreditation scheme which would provide information about availability and which would also guarantee the quality of care <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i believe a mixture of both considerations <e> <s> certainly it is important to ensure that children are properly looked after it is also important that when such children reach a reasonable age they should be given some education <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a variety of different ways in which children can be looked after <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that if one has a childminder who operates in close proximity to the childs home that can be of great benefit <e> <s> not all the people concerned are necessarily qualified but some are <e> <s> local authorities take into account the facilities which a person can offer before that person is officially called a childminder <e>", "<cs> my lords in there were fewer than children attending a nursery school class or primary school <e> <s> that figure has now increased to which is an increase of per cent <e> <s> i should tell the noble lord that in the time to which he referred million was spent on nursery education <e> <s> in that figure has risen to million <e> <s> therefore a great deal has been done in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a neat little political point upon which i shall not comment <e> <s> of course there are targets which have to be raised and which we try to reach <e> <s> time will tell whether such targets can be reached <e> <s> however i must tell the noble baroness that taking all forms <e> <s> of education care together the participation rate for three to four year-olds is over per cent <e> <s> indeed the figure may <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities already have a duty in respect of children in need <e> <s> the children bill extends that provision <e> <s> it imposes a duty where appropriate upon local authorities to provide day care services for children in need who are aged under five and who are not at school <e> <s> it also gives them a power to provide services for children who are not in need <e> <s> the local authorities will also have power to provide out-of-school and holiday play schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do quite a bit in the sphere of tax relief for employers but not necessarily for employees <e> <s> employees are taxed on benefits in kind <e> <s> that means that those who pay tax pay only about in tax for every of child care that is provided <e> <s> it would not be right to give a general tax relief for child care expenses <e> <s> it would cost a great deal of money <e> <s> at the moment it would cost about million to give relief to parents who go out to work <e> <s> the figure would be much larger if people were attracted back to work for the reasons that the noble baroness has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords children in need are defined as those whose development will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i feared that we might get on to the tax position and i realised that the topic would be complicated <e> <s> i hesitate further to complicate the issue <e> <s> child care facilities are a valuable benefit worth up to about a year <e> <s> it is not right to exempt such a benefit from the rule that income tax is payable on remuneration in kind as well as in cash <e> <s> employees are taxed on benefits in kind only when their salaries including the value of the benefit exceed a year <e> <s> basic rate taxpayers pay only for every of child care provided free by their employer <e> <s> parents who do not receive that benefit in kind have to pay the whole cost of child care out of taxable income <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that it is a penal provision unless one reaches the figure of a year <e> <s> if one has such an income whether one is a single parent or a member of a two-parent family it is not unreasonable that one should pay tax the same as everyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to all organisations to do what they think is appropriate for their employees <e> <s> i have no doubt that where firms and companies believe that it is desirable to provide such <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon says as he has said before that what he wants is freedom of information <e> <s> as he knows full well whenever we have discussed this we have always considered that freedom of information is different from official secrets <e> <s> it is true that a similar amendment was discussed on report <e> <s> a kind of record was achieved then <e> <s> having not much to do i instigated a little research <e> <s> as far as i know it is the first time at least in the last seven years that your lordships have specifically discussed the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not

and confirm the exact position in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i understand my noble friends concern <e> <s> i explained that if we were to accept the amendments there would be a much wider application than the specific application to which he refers <e> <s> its wider application would be detrimental <e> <s> we do not have a test of endangering the safety of british

to that point <e> <s> i said that this is a matter of reasonable technicality <e> <s> i have explained why i believe i am right and why the advice i have given indicates that the point is covered

have just started <e>", "<cs> my lords that is that <e> <s> i expected the bill to be difficult because the whole issue of official secrets is difficult <e> <s> the drafting of the bill is difficult because its nature is difficult <e> <s> however i had not expected the difficulty to arise on the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble viscount that the level of drunkenness is unacceptable <e> <s> a circular was produced only recently in february on inter-departmental guidance on alcohol misuse <e> <s> that recommends that local agencies work

suggesting that we remove two of the most important bills i should ask her to think again to make sure that her advice is quite as she expected it to be <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so but i am quite sure that if my noble and learned friend takes his mind back to the days when he used to practise he would never have divulged his views without having first read the brief <e> <s> all we suggest is that the government should have time to consider the law commissions proposals before they make up their mind <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord monson

one cannot introduce such a change wholesale across the country at once <e> <s> it has to be done gradually in order to allow the system to cope <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose is that under the limits magistrates courts will have days in which to produce a person to summary trial days if no decision on the method of trial has been reached within the days or alternatively days to committal <e> <s> in the crown courts it is days from committal to arraignment <e> <s> that is what it is proposed should be introduced and has been introduced <e> <s> if a case is not brought within

"<cs> my lords i could not agree more with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> of course we wish to see the matter dealt with as quickly as possible <e> <s> what i am suggesting to the noble and learned lord is that the system at the moment is highly congested <e> <s> one cannot alter it by simply altering a date one must ensure that the right processes and the staff are in place in

purpose of introducing the time limits <e> <s> i have tried to explain that they cannot be introduced all at once all over the country but that they will be introduced as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the bail act assumes that people will get bail other than in specified circumstances <e> <s> it is our desire to see that commensurate with proper safety as few people as possible are kept on

your lordships house he is concerned that standards should be high and i hope that it will be shown that these additional safeguards that have been introduced will achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter understandably misunderstood the long and convoluted statement <e> <s> i said that there would be an exceptional power for the home secretary acting on

care in any approach to public education on crack in order to avoid stimulating people to try it and use it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my honourable friend was quite right to draw attention to

of the dangers of a drug and by so doing stimulating them in their desire to know what it is <e> <s> the noble viscount is perfectly right that crack is a crystalline form <e> <s> when the smoke is inhaled it works almost immediately <e> <s> its lasting effects are very short whereas the effects of cocaine start later and last longer <e> <s> the danger of crack is that certainly in the united states it is relatively cheap <e> <s> but once a person is hooked on it he requires more and more and he requires quicker inhalations of it <e> <s> it therefore becomes more expensive and more addictive <e>", "<cs> my lords an enormous international effort is being put into this problem <e> <s> the noble earl will know that while certain objectives may be desirable it is not always easy to fulfil them <e> <s> throughout the world a great effort is being put into precisely the problems about which the noble earl is worried <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that inflation has hit this side

the united kingdom it costs between and <e> <s> the danger of that is that this market is therefore more attractive to the peddlers <e> <s> so it is with cocaine which in the united states costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but i imagine that it would make a great impression <e> <s> that just shows what a terribly insidious drug this can be <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the government are keeping an acute eye on this whole problem <e> <s> that is why a ministerial committee on drug misuse was set up <e> <s> my noble friend will also realise that there are regional drug squads which work very effectively and there is a co-ordinated effort between the police forces to crack down <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a rather unfortunate choice of words <e> <s> however there is a great co-ordination of effort between the police forces to deal with this terrible drug <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house i would not wish to prevent the

fact of there being overcrowding is bad in the first place whatever the weather and we are taking a great deal of action to prevent it <e> <s> with regard to the particular places that the noble lord

boyd-carpenter that as the government have been repeatedly chivied over passport delays we are spending million in order to prevent the very delays of which your lordships frequently complain <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole time <e>", "<cs> my lords the availability of passports is not limited to three or four places there are in fact six passport offices <e> <s> my noble friend suggested that one should be able to obtain a passport over the post office counter <e> <s> of course one can obtain a british visitors passport in that way <e> <s> however the passport itself is a uniquely important document it signifies a persons identity and national status <e> <s> therefore i think that other countries would expect passports to be subject to a reasonable standard of government approval <e> <s> that is why passports have to be dealt with competently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his last observation <e> <s> what he said does not always come over from the people who are frustrated at delays at the passport office <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness finds that computerisation strikes fear into her i can assure her that that happens on many occasions when computers are introduced <e> <s> people are frightened of them <e> <s> but on the whole they are necessary and improve speed <e> <s> the noble baroness shakes her head but when she sees and uses the new common format passport which is machine readable she will find that it expedites her going through the frontier controls <e> <s> i am afraid that i have now forgotten the other part of her question <e> <s> i assume that it was nothing of great moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord that passports should be abolished and he would not expect me to agree <e> <s> with regard to the activities of criminals of course they have methods of obtaining passports as they have of obtaining other things which they should not have <e> <s> however that is no reason for abolishing the passport <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is not on the list either <e> <s> the only reason i seek to make a very short intervention is not because the government have any views on this they do not but simply to thank the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce and his committee for what they have done <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway said that he found it a great privilege to serve under the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce <e> <s> i found it an enormous privilege to listen to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> his speech contained history

respect of special provision to local authorities to tackle disadvantages which are suffered by the ethnic minorities of commonwealth origin <e> <s> it is restricted to the payment of the cost of additional staffing to meet those needs <e> <s> the scrutiny report which was published in july made some recommendations in all for the improved administration of the grant <e> <s> it recognised among other things that legislation would be required to effect some of those recommendations including those concerned with the scope of the grant <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to say when the government will announce the results of the consultations until the consultations have been completed <e> <s> until they have been completed and the government have made up their mind as to what course of action should be taken it is difficult to answer the noble lord <e> <s> we must wait until the consultation is completed and the government have made up their mind as to what ought to be

why he is giving so much consideration to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition can be assured that the one week which my right honourable friend is spending elsewhere is not a pre-emptive move in his decision-making process <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that my right honourable friend is considering the matter carefully <e> <s> however the noble lord lord cledwyn will realise that a change of such a magnitude would make a very great deal of difference <e> <s> if sentences remained the same and periods in prison became longer that would have a considerable effect on the prison population <e> <s> if he makes alterations my right honourable friend would like to link them with various other criminal justice proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i fancy that the period may be longer than the noble lord the leader of the opposition would wish but shorter than he might expect <e>", "<cs> my lords that is obviously a point of great importance <e> <s> i can only tell my noble friend lord carr that the question of whether the matter can be dealt with without legislation will depend upon the length and breadth of the decision of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i should imagine that this point could be dealt with without legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i go along with the noble lord lord hunt on that point or that we should go back into history over it <e> <s> there was considerable public concern at that time that many people who had committed serious offences were being allowed out at a very early stage

views <e> <s> apart from anything else national referenda were foreign to the united kingdom until the labour party got into a muddle over its european community policy and decided to have one <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the noble lord has many qualities that were attractive to his constituents other than his views on capital punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would go along with my noble friends version of what mr disraeli said <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is perfectly entitled to put his view <e> <s> it is one held by many people in this country <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord <e> <s> st john of fawsley that what is most important is to catch the criminals who commit the offences to sentence them adequately and if possible to prevent them re-offending <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is much point in telling my noble friend what the noble lord lord mishcon has already told him <e> <s> i should simply like to correct the noble lords statement in a rare opportunity not frequently given to me and confirm that this subject has been discussed in another place five times in the past nine years <e>", "<cs> my lords that is always a possibility <e> <s> parliament decided accordingly in about <e> <s> i remember that in another place mr sydney silverman introduced the homicide bill which permitted capital punishment for certain offences and not for others <e> <s> i recall my noble friend the late lord conesford saying that if you wanted to dispose of your wife under the bill you must not shoot her or blow her up but if you stabbed strangled or poisoned her or set her on fire you would be all right <e> <s> parliament concluded that that was not the most satisfactory way of implementing the death penalty provision and that is why we no longer have it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> if a referendum is used and it has been used in this country more on local issues than on national issues it is on major constitutional matters such as devolution <e> <s> the result is then incorporated in a bill <e> <s> however a referendum can only give simple answers to simple questions <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that capital punishment is not a simple issue <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the drawbacks of a referendum is that it can go one way and the view of another place can go another way <e> <s> if that were to happen one would be undermining the authority of parliament because parliament is the voice of the people <e> <s> that is why referenda have not formed a major part of our constitutional process <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is delving into history a little <e> <s> she may be quite correct in saying that he would not be hanged with a silken cord in particular if he is not allowed to be hanged at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter because he reflects a view held by a great many people <e> <s> however if one is trying to achieve any alteration in the law it has to come about via parliament <e> <s> on a subject as complex as this so long as parliament decides in its wisdom not to change the law there is not much point in having a referendum which can give misguided views and can undermine the authority of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords all these issues create arguments <e>

was going to say that he was one of the two peers who was tried by his fellow peers <e> <s> i am glad that that changed on the way through <e>", "<cs> my lords the police have adequate powers to deal effectively with any criminal offence including disorderly behaviour which may occur at these parties but we shall be discussing with chief officers whether any extra police powers are needed to prevent or to stop illegal parties from taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn that these parties create a great nuisance and a considerable amount of noise <e> <s> there is already a requirement to give advance notice under the entertainment licensing laws but the trouble is that people do not do that <e> <s> the forces in the south-east have decided that a formal intelligence unit is needed to co-ordinate information about these parties <e> <s> the important point is to know when the parties are to take place and where <e> <s> the purpose of the unit will be to give forces better warning of the likely parties in their areas and to target the main organisers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is due to the kind of noise made by the music

the terminology acid having something to do with lsd <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord on being so up with the technological terms relating to these drugs <e> <s> however i should like to point out to the noble lord that i too was under the impression that ac id referred to lsd <e> <s> i am informed that it is not that but is the type of music that is played <e> <s> there are not drugs at

where numbers are large and we are trying to investigate that matter <e> <s> i remind the noble lord and the house that by the end of august the metropolitan police had closed down approximately acid house parties <e> <s> therefore attempts were made to hold more parties than the number which actually took place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will be able to continue his barn

of the water <e> <s> however i like to think that the length of time already spent has not been my fault <e>", "<cs> my lords the discussions are taking place as a matter of urgency because we realise

ideas for restricting these people coming in <e> <s> i inquired about the percentage of women in prison for drug offences <e> <s> on st march this year there were nigerian women and ghanaian in the prison system as a whole for drug importation of which nigerians and ghanaians were serving sentences of four years or more <e> <s> that compares with a total sentenced female population of <e> <s>

beginning i said that i had no intention of taking up a point of view on what the government will do because there are a number of matters that come into that consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so <e> <s> but i believe that the same principle stands <e> <s> we shall certainly consider those points <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how many times i must explain to your lordships that i am not adumbrating a new doctrine <e> <s> i have tried to tell the noble earl that a person may be given a life sentence which is reviewed and he is released when it is believed that the risk is sufficiently reasonable to let him out <e> <s> however if it is judged that the risk to public safety is not sufficiently acceptable of course he will not be let out <e> <s> that is the position at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for saying that the answer was at least slightly encouraging <e> <s> i thought that it was rather more than that <e> <s> i can tell him that up to for each of five new centres in each of the next four years has been allocated which allows a total of earmarked for visitors centres over the next three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the difficulties which surround the visitors centre in strangeways but the noble lord will realise that an emergency grant of was made this year out of a total of which was given in emergency grants to centres which were seriously short of funds <e> <s> i realise that the selcare trust takes an interest in the visitors centre as do the save the children fund and the local probation service <e> <s> one of the difficulties is that the cost of running strangeways visitors centre is a good deal higher than for most visitors centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that there is a great deal of ground to make up until we reach a position in which we can all take pride and with which we can be satisfied <e> <s> about prisons now have visitors reception centres and all new prisons have reception centres designed in them <e> <s> as funds and time permit we try to update the existing buildings when refurbishment is carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give my noble friend the answer to that question but i shall see whether i can find it out and let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> it is very important that prisoners should be able to keep contact with their relatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree that it is highly undesirable <e> <s> that is the reason why in all new prisons we are making arrangements for visitors centres to be incorporated in the buildings <e> <s> it is why we are trying to refurbish those existing prisons which are due for renovation and include within them visitors centres <e> <s> we are spending a lot of money on prisons <e> <s> about million is for new prisons and it is a question of whether one spends that money on visitors centres or on the care of the prisoners themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble lord that rehabilitation is very important <e> <s> but he will be the first to realise that visitors centres are outside the prison buildings <e> <s> they are centres used by the families of the prisoners <e> <s> while it is highly desirable to make them better we are doing all that we can to do so i think it is more important that government funds should be spent on improving the state of the prisons themselves for which the noble lord and many others have frequently criticised all governments <e> <s> we are spending our money on that and we are doing our best to incorporate the visitors centres as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord feels very concerned about this matter because <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord correctly he suggests that we should spend more money on visitors centres and less on refurbishing the prisons and getting rid of slopping out <e> <s> however that is what we have put our attention to <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that there are difficulties for those who are disabled particularly at the older prisons <e> <s> we take the needs of the disabled into account both when refurbishing the old prisons and when designing new ones <e> <s> facilities are improved as and when the opportunity arises <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour to answer some of the noble lords questions <e> <s> he asked whether it would be cheaper for the ambulancemen to do the job <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that that is not the point at issue <e> <s> it is that the ambulancemen for reasons of their own decided to remove an emergency service and because of the possible risk to life <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will stop wagging his head and listen to the answer it will help <e> <s> the emergency services were not available because of the action which the ambulancemen took <e> <s> as a result of that life was at risk <e> <s> as always the police provide aid when there is a possibility of lives being at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords the ambulancemen are part of the national health service <e> <s> ninety five per cent <e> <s> of those in the health service have accepted a settlement of around per cent <e> <s> that is per cent <e> <s> of those who have settled their claims <e> <s> it is within that context that the ambulance service is considered <e> <s> the noble lord asks why the ambulancemen are treated differently from the firemen and the police but he knows perfectly well that the police are subjected to brawls and fights personal risk and so on <e> <s> one really cannot take a comparison with the responsibilities of the police and the fire service <e> <s> it is frankly like discussing tuesday afternoon at piccadilly circus <e> <s> the two matters are separate <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend on the last point <e> <s> the police have a no-strike agreement which has been observed and which is not prevalent elsewhere <e> <s> we are in danger of trying to dicuss the issues at risk the issues of pay across the floor of the house <e> <s> that is undesirable <e> <s> i was asked a question on the relationship between the pay of the police and the ambulancemen <e> <s> i have explained that <e> <s> i would make only this point <e> <s> the reason that the police and now the army may be involved is in order to prevent the risk to life <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a possibility which can be considered <e> <s> however while an emergency service is not available the government must ensure that there is back-up service <e> <s> for that reason we have invited the police and the army to help <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can remind the noble baroness of what happened one year later when her government were in power <e> <s> they appointed professor clegg <e>", "<cs> i beg your pardon <e> <s> my lords if noble lords will be patient i shall try to explain what happened <e> <s> in professor clegg was appointed by the then labour government <e> <s> he rejected a link between the pay of the police and the ambulance workers because as he said and it is now a fact only per cent <e> <s> of ambulance workers time is spent on emergency work <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not helpful to have this kind of conversation across the floor of the house <e> <s> i have been asked various questions and i have answered them but i am anxious not to become involved with the details of a current financial dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows perfectly well that he is splitting hairs <e> <s> when the emergency services are not available it is up to the government to take the necessary action <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health discussed the matter with his right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence and they decided that it would be appropriate to ask the army to help <e>", "<cs> my lords all those matters will be considered by the government because they are anxious to see the situation come to an end <e> <s> an offer has been made of per cent <e> <s> in london and per cent <e> <s> elsewhere <e> <s> all the national health service employees who have settled have done so around that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i can quite understand the noble lords concern <e> <s> he will realise that these undertakings have to move in progression <e> <s> what we wish to achieve is to get the drainage work done first <e> <s> then it is our intention to have the sanitation work completed as soon as possible <e> <s> i cannot give a guarantee to the noble lord as to the method by which this will be done <e> <s> it is planned to start the integral sanitation once the drainage system at wandsworth which at present is being totally disruptive has been completed <e> <s> one of the problems is the necessity to decamp prisoners into alternative accommodation while the integral sanitation is being installed <e> <s> it is preferable that this should be done by closing a whole wing but that merely compounds the difficulty of prisoner accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that there are at least two black orderlies including the governors orderly <e> <s> the governor is now monitoring the employment of inmates and other activities in order to ensure that there is no discrimination <e> <s> allocation of work is now in the hands of a governor grade officer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to cover most matters in my response <e> <s> if i may i should prefer to leave that part of the report for the moment <e> <s> however if necessary i shall investigate the matter and write to the noble baroness accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for giving us the opportunity of this debate today <e> <s> his interest and expertise in charity matters is well known to your lordships and as he said before he sat down what happens will be of interest to quite a lot of people <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i heard my noble friend lord whitelaw say that they had not <e> <s> maybe they have not but perhaps i may tell him what the government are going to do because we are looking towards the future and not back to the past <e> <s> last year the charity commission was given million and this year it will receive i million <e> <s> next year it will have million <e> <s> so in two years the funds put at the disposal of the charity commission will have more than doubled <e> <s> i do not know whether that will satisfy the noble lord lord allen or my noble friend lord whitelaw but whether it does or does not i am sure they will agree that it is a very substantial improvement indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i used those metaphors knowing that that would be one way of retaining the noble lords attention <e>", "<cs> my lords as a number of noble lords said at the end of this debate we have had a most interesting discussion <e> <s> the government are very grateful to noble lords for what they said <e> <s> the whole purpose of the debate was to find out your lordships views and your lordships have not been slow to give them <e> <s> i was glad to hear that in the majority of cases your lordships approve of the governments initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords not to my knowledge <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord molloy we have been discussing this question for quite a long time <e> <s> i know that it was his question originally but i think that it would be appropriate and for the convenience of the house for us to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a debate on a most sombre subject <e> <s> if i may say so the concluding words of the noble lord lord irvine of lairg are most important when considering all these difficulties we must look to the future <e> <s> it is a fact that every speaker has spoken for himself in the matter <e> <s> moreover as one may expect the conclusions have not been unanimous <e> <s> however in my view it is a good thing that it has been so because there is a substantial diversity a perfectly justified one as to what is the right course of action to take if there is such a thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble earl lord winchilsea <e> <s> in fact the police negotiating board gave to the tribunal a problem <e> <s> the tribunal made a recommendation and referred a number of points back to the police negotiating board <e> <s> when the police negotiating board reaches a conclusion those recommendations will be given to my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> my right honourable friend took the opportunity of making it clear that he had certain reservations over the rent allowance and that it should not be assumed that the home secretary would always give effect to all the tribunals decisions <e> <s> that is to do with rent allowance and not the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to follow my noble friend in the spiral but i got lost <e> <s> i can only tell him that the community charge is based on different principles from rates <e> <s> it is a personal commitment and it is not a property tax <e> <s> as such therefore it has different effects in different places <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary has not yet made up his mind as to what should be done <e> <s> the reason he has not yet made up his mind is that he has not received any recommendations from the police negotiating board <e>", "<cs> my lords the rent allowance is tax free effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are always conscious of the need to recruit policemen and do not wish to see anything happening which will adversely affect recruitment <e> <s> my noble friend refers to the scrapping of the rent allowance <e> <s> this is in fact replacement of the rent allowance with a housing allowance <e> <s> in - that rent allowance alone was worth million <e> <s> my right honourable friend has said that her majestys government do not wish to see any officer receiving less by way of housing allowance after st march than he or she was receiving by way of rent allowance and compensatory grant on that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for the welcome that they have given to the bill <e> <s> i had hoped that this would prove a relatively uncontroversial matter albeit a very serious one <e> <s> as usual i am immensely grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for the courtesy which he always extends to me by letting me know in advance the points about which he is concerned <e> <s> anything to do with drugs is extremely important not only nationally but internationally <e> <s> everyone is concerned to see that we deal with the drugs problem as best we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that all improvements in performance are as a result of increased efficiency and no doubt increased pressures from different quarters <e> <s> but i should not like my noble friend to take upon himself the thought that it was his pressure alone that succeeded in making the results of the passport office as good as that <e>", "<cs> my lords it entirely depends on which passport office issues the passport <e> <s> some passport offices are geared up to issuing the new passport in which case if my noble friend applies to one of those he will receive a new passport <e> <s> if he applies to one of the offices which issues the old-style passport he will receive one of those <e> <s> in either case the procedure takes the same length of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for being so perceptive <e> <s> i agree that i did not expect my noble friend to be quite as gratified as he was <e> <s> the noble lord is right to this extent <e> <s> there have been problems over the speed of issue of passports but we have taken a number of steps to deal with them <e> <s> much of the procedure has been computerised and an extra permanent staff have been employed <e> <s> a combination of all these factors has resulted in the better results so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that it is rare that such a modest request comes through for the government to provide information <e> <s> very often the noble lord asking a question has a good idea what the answer will be <e> <s> i quite understand that on this occasion my noble friend was entirely nave and did not know what the result would be <e> <s> i am happy to pass on my noble friends suggestion to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> perhaps in future he will be kind enough to ask only questions to which he knows what the answers will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard the premise upon which my noble friend bases his question as totally offensive <e> <s> i can assure him that even he may find that after the age of his appearance is an improvement on that which went before <e> <s> whether it is or not it is an international practice that passports should last for only years <e> <s> in the case of the new machine-readable common format passport it is designed so that it has to be replaced every years for security reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that question <e> <s> i do not know whether or not the noble lord knows the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to have conveyed to the noble lord that i was answering these questions in a flippant manner <e> <s> i was merely trying to respond to what i thought were serious questions <e> <s> the figures i have given are for the maximum time at present <e> <s> obviously for those who need a passport in a hurry the passport office will do all that it can to accommodate them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to have taken a pretty good swipe at everyone <e> <s> i shall not give an undertaking that i will tell the government to treble the figure as he suggests but i shall see that his views are made known <e> <s> he asked me to ask the government to ignore the labour party and the conservative party <e> <s> the government do not ignore anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i was temporarily wondering who the spokesman would be <e> <s> i now realise that it is the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords had the noble lord made his views known a little earlier i dare say the noble lord lord wyatt might have taken a swipe at him too <e> <s> i shall see that his views are taken into account as indeed they are by my right honourable friend <e> <s> all views are taken into account because this is a very difficult situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the government will not be deterred from doing what they consider to be the right thing <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting thought <e> <s> i can assure the noble earl that the view that he puts forward is a consideration taken into account by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely the dilemma to which my right honourable friend is addressing himself at the moment <e> <s> it would be quite wrong for me to anticipate in any way what he will say <e> <s> of course he will take the noble lords views into account <e>", "<cs> my lords that is yet another point of view which my right honourable friend will also take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to get up to suggest that in due course we might move on but a cursory glance at the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for his final remarks <e> <s> the question he posed is as the noble lord lord mishcon said slightly outside the terms of the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord said that it was outside the competence of the home office <e> <s> the home office is a fairly competent organisation and i have no doubt that we shall be able to find the answer to his specific question <e> <s> i shall find the answer and write to him <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord for saying that he would reserve judgment on the amendment until he had heard what i have to say <e> <s> i have the fullest confidence that having heard what i have to say he will agree with it <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for drawing our attention to that point <e> <s> there are many issues here and i do not think that the noble lord lord mishcon should feel any sense of shame in supporting the bankers if indeed it is shame that he feels <e> <s> there is a real issue here and i can quite see why people are concerned about the matter <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised that my noble and learned friend asks such a question <e> <s> he might not have asked it had he been here on second reading but i do not blame him for that <e> <s> he had many other things to do <e> <s> it is clearly a matter of concern when the government introduce a bill and then bring forward a number of amendments <e>", "<cs> i am not certain whether that is a helpful intervention <e> <s> on the assumption that it is i shall take it as being so <e> <s> on reflection the noble lord might think that it was not as helpful as he intended it to be <e>", "<cs> yes clearly the changes have to be ratified <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that three other countries have done so already china nigeria and one other country whose name i forget <e> <s> we can consider that we are the first to give such detailed recognition and to alter our law accordingly <e>", "<cs> if the vessel concerned were within the territorial waters of the country we could take such action as we liked because it is within our territorial waters <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow the argument through <e> <s> if i have not answered the noble lords point then he can make that clear when i have finished <e> <s> if the vessel of another country were within our territorial waters then we could take action against that vessel because it was within our territorial waters <e> <s> it would be the same way as taking action against an individual in our country who infringes the rules of our country <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i realise that on this occasion he is asking a helpful question <e> <s> the answer is yes we can do so provided we have the authority of the other country <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not understand the point to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> i am deeply indebted to my noble and learned friend for giving me the answer <e> <s> i was about to give it had my noble and learned friend not intervened <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will be satisfied that that is the answer scottish law is very different from english law and the scots hold great store by the distinction <e>", "<cs> i have reason to be deeply indebted to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> however to make matters perfectly clear to the noble lord lord mishcon i should say <e>", "<cs> i was trying to explain that the only reason that i said that my noble and learned friend had provided the answer that i would have given was that when he said what he did i was reminded of what the answer might have been <e> <s> i might have forgotten that had my noble and learned friend not said it <e> <s> sufficient evidence in scotland means admissible evidence <e> <s> the two terms are intended to have the same effect <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord mishcon who i know is very well versed in these matters is satisfied with that answer <e> <s> if he is not he will no doubt let me know and i shall do my best to give him a long and detailed reply by letter <e>", "<cs> as regards extradition that functions automatically <e>", "<cs> by virtue of amendment no <e> <s> all the provisions presently contained within clause are to be transferred into schedule to the bill <e> <s> clause is therefore no longer necessary <e> <s> this is devised really to tidy up the bill <e> <s> i hope that the committee will approve of such tidying measures <e> <s> i beg to oppose the question that the clause stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i believe that that is probably a good reason for not naming them <e> <s> however it had escaped my notice that there is a definition of a colony in the interpretation act <e>", "<cs> i have little doubt that it means written evidence but i shall certainly look into the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mean to imply that it was the noble lords idea <e> <s> i meant to imply that he asked the question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the home secretary in another place about the final report of lord justice taylors inquiry into the tragedy at the hillsborough stadium on th april which is published today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful i suppose for what the noble lords have said <e> <s> this is a matter <e>", "<cs> it is all very fine my lords for noble lords to say oh oh <e> <s> i did not say that when i listened to the noble lord lord mishcon when he said that the government had been showing sheer blind obstinacy and referred to their inability to listen <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the points that the noble lord lord dean made <e> <s> he found it difficult to resist the temptation to rehearse some of the arguments that we used during the passage of the football spectators bill <e> <s> i do not wish to become involved in that <e> <s> obviously the question of a debate is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that <e> <s> i hope that football will be able to smile better as he puts it as a result <e> <s> i agree with him that the report should be read in its entirety and not one particular part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords it squares perfectly well <e> <s> the government produced a bill because they were concerned about the state of public order and the conduct of football matches where people were being subjected to the most terrifying things including death <e> <s> they brought the bill into parliament and the bill was passed <e> <s> parliament then had two other opportunities to discuss what was going to be produced when the scheme as it was was introduced <e> <s> parliament then had the right to give its views on that <e> <s> when a disaster occurred my right honourable friend asked lord justice taylor to consider everything <e> <s> lord justice taylor stated that he could not support this part <e> <s> the government accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard that as a frivolous interjection and nothing to do with the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie for at least saying that the government are being too generous in their treatment of the football situation <e> <s> i shall bear in mind what he said <e> <s> when i gave my reply about taxation i implied that it was a matter for my right honourable friend <e> <s> of course the suggestions of lord justice taylor will be considered <e> <s> i gave the overall view of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch seems to be momentarily unaware of the parliamentary processes <e> <s> a bill only reaches the statute book with the approval of both houses of parliament <e> <s> this bill had that approval <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> i am sure that if the noble lord wishes to pursue that he will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for two matters <e> <s> first he brought us back to a state of order <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon had slipped us out of such order wholly inadvertently <e> <s> secondly the noble lord lord harris was for once very concerned that he had got me into trouble <e> <s> that is a very easy situation for me to get into <e> <s> however i assure him that on this occasion it was not his fault but that of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon very kindly said that i was courteous and understanding in my approach to matters and i <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the reservations made by the other countries are not in the terms of the amendment <e> <s> they state that the four countries concerned will not assist at all in fiscal cases not that they would do so subject to dual criminality <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wish to clarify one matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon is always fair and i was not conscious of misleading the house <e> <s> he referred to a question <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of your lordships if i repeat a statement which is being made by my right honourable friend the home secretary in another place about the governments proposals for criminal justice legislation which we are publishing today in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the welcome which the noble lords gave to the statement <e> <s> i was particularly grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for saying that the aims must be right and that the protection of the public must be right <e> <s> that is clearly most important <e> <s> he was concerned to know whether the large prison population is likely to be reduced as a result of the white paper <e> <s> all i can tell him is that we hope that it will but it will take time to see how the changes work out <e> <s> the intention is that people who commit less serious crimes should undergo their punishment in the community and not in prison <e> <s> that should help to reduce the prison population <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his welcome of the statement <e> <s> i know that he has always been much concerned about the effects of crime <e> <s> i am glad that in particular he approved of the proposal that parents should attend court <e> <s> the purpose is to involve parents with what their children do not only for the purposes of rehabilitation but also when the children offend against the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that of all people the noble earl lord longford would have been pleased with the white paper because it does what he has advocated for a great many years namely that people who have committed offences should serve much of their sentence outside prison rather than inside it <e> <s> i could not resist a wry smile when the noble earl said that the fact that we had the highest prison population in europe was entirely due to the judges <e> <s> they are responsible for sentencing but those people who go to gaol usually do so because of what they have done not because of what the judges have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> it means a great deal to those who are in the home office that someone with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hunt for his welcome and the fact that he approves of the confirmation of the report produced by my noble friend lord carlisle and his committee <e> <s> he was concerned about the responsibility resting with the home secretary and whether those people serving longer sentences were to be released <e> <s> the philosophy behind the proposal is that those released into the community and the public hazards that might therefore be created are a responsibility for the home secretary who will of course take advice from the parole board <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble and learned friends doubt about whether a persons character can be reformed by depriving him of his liberty <e> <s> it is something that is always very difficult to discern <e> <s> however society has a right to be protected from those who commit the most serious crimes <e> <s> that is why such offenders have to be removed from society <e> <s> my noble and learned friend is entirely right to say that having removed them from society they then have to be held in conditions which are acceptable to both society and themselves <e> <s> that is desirable <e> <s> my noble and learned friend will realise as indeed will other noble lords that it is a vast <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i can assure him that the concern that he expressed has not been lost on the home office <e> <s> he and his committee have produced a report that has enabled us to find the right way forward <e> <s> we have accepted the majority of the committees recommendations <e> <s> quite clearly it will be necessary for some of the sentences to be lowered otherwise the prison situation will be even worse <e> <s> however that is a matter for the judges <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is a question of the sentence being acceptable to the government <e> <s> i understand the noble baronesss concern but i could not possibly give her an undertaking that the same amount of money being spent on the resettlement of offenders will be spent on the victims <e> <s> the two things are not necessarily comparable in money terms although i accept that they are highly comparable in human terms <e> <s> the way in which victims are compensated cannot be equated in monetary terms with what is spent for the resettlement of offenders <e> <s> however i understand the noble baronesss concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord hatch of lusby were concerned that there was not enough openness of government <e> <s> i think that there has been an astonishing openness of government <e> <s> it may not have gone as far as some people would like <e> <s> however when one thinks of what the earlier official secrets act covered and the number of people it covered most people were surprised when the present government came along with the official secrets act and loosened the bonds of the act to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to go over the whole business of what we discussed during the passage of the official secrets bill <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord hatch found difficulty in accepting the position <e> <s> but when he says that it is the government who have to determine what a secret is the answer is that it is because the government have their secrets and they have correctly to determine what those secrets are <e>", "<cs> my lords i have momentarily forgotten the first point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> but perhaps he will be kind enough to repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for repeating his question <e> <s> i was thinking temporarily of his second question <e> <s> the government consider what constitutes a secret <e> <s> if a person divulges that secret and it gets into the newspapers it is up to the prosecution to prove to a jury that that person had done relevant harm under the act <e> <s> the act states what the harm is when a disclosure is made and the prosecution would have to say that by divulging that information this person has caused a criminal offence by divulging harm which is relevant under the act <e> <s> it is then up to the defence to use as a method of defence the fact that he did not even know that when he divulged the information he would create harm <e> <s> as i have tried to explain that is a significant form of defence <e>", "<cs> the three bodies are prescribed under article which enables them for the purposes of the act to authorise or restrict disclosure and to direct the return or disposal of documents in one case <e> <s> i believe that i am right in saying that that case involves the civil aviation authority but if i am mistaken i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their remarks <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for saying that this is a common fight in which we are all participants <e> <s> that is so <e> <s> we shall continue i know on all sides to carry on this fight against drug trafficking and crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for the clarity with which he introduced the bill and for explaining exactly what it intends <e> <s> i noted that the noble baroness was happy to be in agreement with him i share that contentment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy for the house of commons home affairs select committee when it objects to endless paperwork and considers the situation to be a bureaucratic nightmare <e> <s> however the committee only reported on th february and we have already responded to its major recommendation for increased numbers of staff <e> <s> although the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter will ensure that those mellifluous words are passed on to his noble friend lord carlisle of bucklow <e> <s> however i do not agree with him that it is the most inefficient organ of government <e>", "<cs> my lords each noble lord has his own decision to take on that matter <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that there will be a great deal of competition in noble lords minds but none in the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords courts are obliged to award compensation and certainly to take into account compensation with regard to any major matters <e> <s> however if a case of criminal injury is passed on to the board it must decide whether that candidate is eligible <e> <s> that in itself can take a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked whether it would be worth while to bring in management consultants <e> <s> obviously when we deal with matters of this size there comes a time when one must review the method of operation <e> <s> as yet we have not found that the most appropriate thing to do <e> <s> although there has been a delay in dealing with claims one must remember that the criminal injuries compensation board which was set up in dealt in its first full year with claims and had only staff and that it now deals with claims and has staff <e> <s> it is difficult to deal expeditiously with all claims <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not necessarily follow that two-year-old cases have not been started <e> <s> the backlog which requires to be dealt with amounts to that large sum <e> <s> that is why we have increased the staff by the number that i mentioned <e> <s> one of the reasons for changing the limit from to was to keep out the relatively less serious injuries <e> <s> although they are bad for the individual their inclusion would have the reverse effect to that which the noble lord lord mishcon desires and would merely clog up the system even more <e>", "<cs> my lords we keep in close touch with the chairman of the board <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord harris that priority is given to fatal <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly take that point into account <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the noble lord lord molloy puts his question or indeed is able to put his question is a matter for the house <e> <s> i rather interpreted the view of the house that your lordships wished to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord donaldson was suggesting that the noble baroness would be the recipient not the donor <e>", "<cs> my lords this may have been only a short debate and there may not have been so many of your lordships participating in it but for all that i have found it most interesting <e> <s> i was deeply indebted to the noble lord lord birkett when he said at one moment that he did not want a reply <e> <s> i should have been happy to oblige but i thought that it would be discourteous if i took what he said at face value <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the noble lord waits to see whether he is lucky and wins before he comes up with such a speculative idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for the contributions that have been made on this matter which affects us all gravely and about which we all feel acutely concerned <e> <s> perhaps i may start my remarks by referring to the noble lord lord fitt who if i may say so made a speech which was full of feeling feeling which derives from his knowledge of northern ireland and his concern about the judgment made last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly give the noble lord details later exactly how it is proposed the arrangement will operate <e> <s> i should emphasise that it is not intended to have a full and complete recording of the whole interview because by so doing it is possible either that the interviewee may not give the information which he would otherwise give because it would be on the tape and might fall into the wrong hands or he may well find that he would prefer to be less open <e> <s> it is for that reason that a summary of the interview will be taped as opposed to the whole interview itself <e> <s> i note that the noble lord lord mishcon is concerned <e> <s> if possible i shall try to placate his anxiety in more detail later <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of the noble baroness about people who are homeless <e> <s> however prosecutions of those under under the vagrancy act have reduced in recent years from in to in <e> <s> of those there <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government are at the moment undertaking a review which includes all these different departments to try to see what can be done in order to help the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we had better wait to see what the review says <e> <s> it is an interdepartmental review trying to draw together the threads between each individual department <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend the answer to that <e> <s> we are trying to co-ordinate the efforts of the different departments in order to find out how best to deal with those who are homeless <e> <s> obviously if in the course of the review the information to which my noble friend referred becomes available that will be an added advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords there is clearly concern for fear that homelessness involves crime <e> <s> however i do not agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that it is a high percentage <e> <s> the question of the noble baroness referred to people under and the figures i have show that only about to per cent <e> <s> of those under are caught by the act <e> <s> clearly we are greatly concened to ensure where this can be done that those who are homeless are housed and that they should not be involved in crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> i misunderstood his question <e> <s> i quite agree that young people form a significant proportion in the crime figures <e> <s> whether or not that is due to homelessness is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter of concern that there is so much homelessness <e> <s> that is the reason why the government are reviewing what can be dons in order to find out the causes <e>", "<cs> my lords a great deal of information is being sought <e> <s> whether or not people have come out of care is a matter of concern <e> <s> i should just tell the noble baroness that at present we are involved in discussions with the health and social services authorities and the voluntary bodies in central london with a view to identifying practical steps to help people obtain the support they need <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously if that factor comes out it will be of great concern <e> <s> there are a number of different causes for people deciding to go out and sleep rough or to be unhoused <e> <s> it is our desire to try to find out the cause and how it can be rectified <e> <s> it is impossible to say that having discovered the causes we are able to remove the problem for ever <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not follow the argument of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff has a unique and mischievous way of suggesting statements that he knows perfectly well i have never made <e> <s> i said that the conditions in northern ireland were particularly unique and that those conditions made the system which operates there suitable <e> <s> i said that in my view and the view of the government it was not a suitable system to operate elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to my noble friend lord swansea for the opportunity of debating this order <e> <s> i too am grateful but not quite so grateful for the rather less than felicitous observations that he made concerning the government shooters and the governments attitude <e> <s> i know that he feels very strongly about this subject <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lords lord harris of greenwich and lord graham of edmonton for their support <e> <s> one of the curious things about anything to do with firearms in this house is that ones friends tend to fractionate out in directions slightly different to those anticipated <e> <s> however that is all part of the pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am merely discussing what is a practical reality <e> <s> if the noble lord believes that he can purchase an item now for the same price that he paid in he is a remarkable person <e>", "<cs> my lords under the ibas pension scheme pension increases in line with increases in the retail prices index are guaranteed up to a maximum of per cent <e> <s> those guarantees will be transferred <e> <s> the iba also has a discretion to make increases in line with increases in the rpi above per cent <e> <s> that discretion will be preserved in the new arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords in any transfer of personnel it has been made perfectly clear that existing arrangements enjoyed at the iba will be transferred under the new arrangements <e> <s> therefore there should not be any cause for worry <e> <s> the noble baroness asked why the cable authority is mentioned in particular <e> <s> the reason is that the itc will take over the cable authority and this does not involve any division of assets <e> <s> my right honourable friend has agreed to consider including in the bill a provision to give transferred employees continuity of employment in order to give them greater reassurance <e> <s> that is in the bill <e> <s> but the provisions dealing with pensions must be left to a scheme which will be devised since it involves the division of an existing pension fund <e> <s> it would not be wise to tackle such a complex matter within the timetable of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not <e> <s> if they go over to a privatised transmission company they take their pension rights with them <e> <s> therefore there should not be any concern about their being worse off <e> <s> but the broadcasting bill gives the secretary of state power to approve a scheme for the division of assets which is what the pension fund is concerned with including a provision to protect the employees existing rights <e> <s> the secretary of state will approve such a scheme <e> <s> it is quite complicated and the discussions about the scheme are taking place at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords lord mishcon and lord harris of greenwich for their reaction to the statement <e> <s> it is a most unpleasant statement to have had to make <e> <s> all of us feel a sense of great shame and indeed outrage at what has happened <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon asked whether there would be any wider inquiry into what has happened <e> <s> the best answer i can give is that in the view of the government the only inquiry is a criminal inquiry investigating who was responsible for the criminal acts which took place <e> <s> that is the main cause of the inquiry <e> <s> that is what the commissioner will be undertaking <e> <s> it will be up to the commissioner to make the inquiry as wide as he wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the equipment which the police have is extremely good <e> <s> it is always being updated <e> <s> of course there is an endless demand and there must be a limit to any amount spent on equipment <e> <s> however i have no reason to believe that the equipment which the police were given on saturday was anything other than totally adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass the remarks of the noble lord lord callaghan to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the anxiety of my noble friend lord gridley but i think what he asks would be impossible <e> <s> the organisers intended the demonstration to be a peaceful one but no organiser can be wholly responsible for those who attach themselves to something which they have organised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely happy to accept the strictures of the noble lords lord allen and lord callaghan <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the commissioner will be looking at the entire method of policing that demonstration to see what lessons may be learnt as well as there being a criminal investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that is a matter for the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for those remarks <e> <s> i shall see that they are passed on <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the concern of my noble friend lord nelson <e> <s> we are all concerned but i think that to say that nobody was surprised is overstating the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly make a note to listen to the programme <e> <s> i think i can only listen to a wireless programme and not see it <e> <s> if it were considered to be wrong it would not be for ministers to be the arbiters <e> <s> it is for the bbc to decide what programme to put on and what not to put on <e> <s> however what your lordships have said this afternoon indicates that those people are prepared to stand up and say such things <e> <s> that shows that there are people who are out to disrupt society and to ruin and abuse the police which is shocking <e> <s> at least <e>", "<cs> my lords the receiver of the metropolitan police will make available compensation in respect of houses shop or buildings or their contents under the riot damages legislation of within the area in which he is satisfied that the riot has extended <e> <s> he will issue guidance for potential claimants and notification of the intention to claim should be made to the receiver within days of the event <e> <s> claims should be made against insurers in the usual way even if a person believes that he may be eligible for riot damages <e> <s> under the act compensation does not apply to personal injury or damage to vehicles <e> <s> claims in respect of personal injury may be made to the criminal injuries compensation board in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clearly up to the commissioner to decide where the marches and so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to hide behind the commissioner <e> <s> however section of the public order act empowers the police to impose conditions on a demonstration such as the route and the number of participants <e> <s> their imposition is an operational matter for the judgment of the police <e> <s> under section of the act the commissioner may seek the consent of my right honourable friend to impose a ban on a march <e> <s> therefore it is for the commissioner to decide the route and not my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement about the violence at manchester prison on sunday st april which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords lord mishcon and lord harris of greenwich for their observations on the statement <e> <s> it is an unhappy day to have to make two statements of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the courts are aware of the position and are made aware of the position <e> <s> however i can confirm that my honourable friend the minister of state is correct <e> <s> on th march manchester had officers in post which included the principal and senior officers and specialists and the target staffing level was though that included three works posts which are not at present required <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly see what can be done about that <e> <s> all i can tell the noble lord lord dean of beswick at the moment is that there had to be emergency action in order to remove the prisoners <e> <s> it is quite astonishing what the prison service and the police have done in having moved so many prisoners so quickly <e> <s> clearly that throws a burden on other prisons <e> <s> we shall have to see what can be done to lighten that burden where possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with that last point first <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for referring to this matter <e> <s> it has been the thrust of the governments desire to get those who are more <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter is not quite as simple as that <e> <s> when a place is confined and in a state of turmoil the first thing that has to be done is to restore it to a state of order <e> <s> that is what is being done at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely right <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord lord mishcon for not having answered his point when he referred to copycat actions <e> <s> there is always that danger <e> <s> where this kind of activity is shown on television and there are television sets inside the prisons the <e>", "<cs> my lords i could tell the noble baroness what was being done by way of improvements in the establishment but at the moment i seem to have confused all the information that i had <e> <s> with it i would have been able to deliver with great clarity the information that she seeks <e> <s> perhaps i may let her know the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that cells at the establishment already have integral sanitation <e> <s> work had begun on the preparation for restoring integral sanitation for a further cells <e> <s> the work which involved taking only a few cells out of use at a time was due to be completed by may <e> <s> it was the first phase of a rolling programme for installing integral sanitation throughout the establishment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for those remarks <e> <s> she asked whether it is possible to expedite the work <e> <s> clearly the work going on is of extreme importance but it has not yet reached a satisfactory position <e> <s> of course there is still a great deal more to be done <e> <s> the government have embarked on the largest prison building programme this century <e> <s> there are new prisons in the total programme <e> <s> expenditure on the prison service rose by per cent <e> <s> in real terms between and <e> <s> the current financial provision is for million a year which represents a per cent <e> <s> increase in real terms over the figure of million <e> <s> current public expenditure plans show expenditure increasing to million in - <e> <s> we have always recognised that the success of the prison building programme taken with policies on diversion from custody may make it sensible to turn the focus of our attention more to refurbishing the essential parts of the existing estate <e> <s> that is what we shall have to try to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks about the prison officers <e> <s> they <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether there has been a reduction but i can say that prisoners have yet to surrender <e> <s> prison officers regained control of the four remand wings of the prison <e> <s> a number of prisoners have yet to surrender <e> <s> they occupy a part of the prison over which prison officers do not have control <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing attention to that point <e> <s> i do not mind admitting that it is something i did not realise until i took up my present office <e> <s> there is a great association between the prison officers and the inmates of the prison <e> <s> one tends to think that prison officers are just gaolers <e> <s> if that were so the chances of trouble would be much greater than they are <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had the same question to my certain knowledge for the past years <e>

whatever the noble lord may say regarding easter being the first outdoor bank holiday good friday and easter day are the most solemn dates in the christian calendar and it is a theological issue which transcends frontiers <e> <s> if the churches agree on a fixed date for easter then the government should be happy to consider incorporating the easter act <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i did not know that the patriarch of moscow had become a member of the supreme soviet <e> <s> if that is so i am sure that it will do the supreme soviet a great deal of good <e> <s> the problem is that the first ecumenical council of nicaea which was way back in ad had as one of the documents of the greek orthodox church said as its timely goal the bringing about of christian unity through the common celebration of easter <e> <s> i know that some time has elapsed since the date when the church first came to that conclusion but i lope that the inauguration of the patriarch of moscow into the supreme soviet will have some effect but i am not sure what the effect will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of sheffield on working out when easter falls next year <e> <s> i find it difficult to know when it falls in the current year <e> <s> i certainly hope that we shall have the weather that he hopes we will have <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what it is to do with because the greek orthodox church said in a document that all orthodox churches following the first ecumenical council were bound to celebrate easter on the first sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox <e> <s> that is the way in which the churches fix the date of easter and it goes back for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords the greek orthodox church is on the julian calendar and we are on the gregorian calendar <e> <s> the united kingdom changed from the julian calendar to the gregorian calendar in by omitting days <e> <s> your lordships may remember at least your lordships knowledge of history might remind you that there were then riots because we lost days <e> <s> the new year changed from th march and rd september became th september <e> <s> that is why we are now on the gregorian calendar <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but some orthodox churches have made modifications by adopting the new calendar and they observe the gregorian calendar for fixed feasts and the julian calendar for movable feasts <e> <s> for that reason the complications are even greater <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who is always having to answer questions suggesting

review of penal policy in this country <e> <s> that is why it is the governments intention and desire that a greater proportion of sentences should be served within the community as opposed to people

be entitled to do so <e> <s> i realise that that does not satisfy the noble lord lord mishcon so i assure him that i shall ensure that my right honourable friend knows of his concern <e>", "<cs> my

done in the future to prevent them <e> <s> obviously such consideration will fall within his terms of reference <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may suggest that we do not enter into a general debate on prisons <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that a great many more prison officers have been taken on recently and it is intended that more be taken on in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord the answer <e> <s> i assume that if the association wishes to make any representations it will contact lord justice woolf and indicate that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the conundrum in which we perpetually find ourselves <e> <s> not long ago the noble lord was giving the government stick for having an insufficient number of prisons <e> <s> the noble lord will not ask me to quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised by the noble lords response <e> <s> he said that the government have been timorous and incompetent <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has repeated that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has now repeated his view for the second time <e> <s> i do not accept it in the slightest <e> <s> he knows full well that the best way of dealing with the matter is to

out an impressive but disagreeable list <e> <s> until the incidents at strangeways the situation was improving <e> <s> there was increased capacity in the prisons a reduction in overcrowding and the re-establishment of punishment within the community <e> <s> the number of prisoners in a cell was being reduced and during the past years we spent million on capital expenditure <e> <s> all that was producing results but now we have experienced the recent fearful events <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord when the report will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in danger of the statement on pucklechurch remand centre turning into a debate on the prison system as a whole <e> <s> i have tried to explain what has been done and the fact that the government are seized of the real problems <e> <s> we have done a great deal but now is not the time to debate the genuine concerns of a general nature about the prison service <e>", "<cs> my lords simple questions are always the most difficult to answer <e> <s> i am sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord whitelaw who was a most distinguished home secretary <e> <s> he is right in saying that everyone connected with the prison service feels humble about what they can do to correct the situation <e> <s> members of all parties will realise that it is difficult and that we can only do our best <e> <s> it is too easy to say what should have been done and what is left to be done <e> <s> one docs not always realise what has been done to improve the situation <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend in saying that none of us can be proud of the position now or in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that it would be a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition and to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for what they have said and particularly for conveying their expressions of gratitude to the governor and his staff and also to the police and fire services <e> <s> they have all been under very considerable strain and i think we are all proud of the way in which they have carried out their task which has resulted in this outbreak having been drawn to a conclusion without any loss of life at all other than the two cases we know about <e> <s> that is something for which we can all be immensely grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that will be one of the matters to be considered because it is in everyones mind without question that the fact of being able to see this kind of thing happening on television does encourage others to carry out the same tactics <e> <s> therefore it will be necessary to address our minds to the question of how we can prevent that happening but i need not spell out the complications <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is perfectly correct <e> <s> the infuriating part is that a great deal had been done in manchester recently in order to give people more training to get them out of their cells and to give them some work to do rather than just sitting confined <e> <s> now all that has been put back but certainly we shall be considering that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends observations <e> <s> i congratulate him on the position that he has recently accepted <e> <s> he need not trouble about not having given me notice of his question because apart from one no other noble lord has and therefore he is in good company <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble baronesss concern <e> <s> it is not our present intention to use army camps for the simple reason that it is necessary to keep those who have been removed from prisons such as strangeways in secure accommodation <e> <s> army camps do not necessarily provide that <e> <s> we have not yet circularised the courts suggesting that they impose more lenient sentences and i cannot tell the noble baroness whether that will be done <e> <s> it is all very well to say that we should declare when a prison is full to capacity but had such an attitude been taken we might have found that a number of prisons which were regarded as being full had to take additional people <e> <s> the fact is that if the courts sentence people those people must be put somewhere <e> <s> i do not wish to widen these questions into a debate on the prison system but i point out that it is our desire to provide more prison places and build more prisons and that we have done in order to meet the concerns expressed by the noble baroness <e> <s> however if the courts sentence people to prison the prison system must take them <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the difficulties with any story which reaches the media is that it it blown out of all proportion <e> <s> what is shown on the screens is that which the transmitting companies concerned wish to show <e> <s> the result is that it has the effect described by the noble lord lord hunt it gives a bad impression of the relationship between staff and prisoners <e> <s> that relationship must be good and on the whole it is good <e> <s> the way in which we can recover the position must be considered and i am grateful for the noble lords suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord callaghan is entirely right in making that observation <e> <s> he expressed the concern which has been felt by everyone that the events continued for a long time <e> <s> from his experience as home secretary the noble lord knows that my right honourable friend must accept responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall inform my right honourable friend of the noble lords remarks <e> <s> in the final analysis as the noble lord lord callaghan said the responsibility is that of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> he has advice tendered from the governor the prison department and his officials and takes the advice in the light of his own views <e> <s> he took the advice and he takes full responsibility for it <e>", "<cs> my lords in the eyes of the noble lord maybe it is <e> <s> when a riot of such a nature takes place everything is considered <e> <s> but it is not all that easy

cannot say what that advice was and been successful everyone would have said how wonderful <e> <s> if he had overruled the advice and been unsuccessful he would have been roasted over a very hot fire

to conclude what i intend to say <e> <s> i was trying to tell him that when such an action occurs my right honourable friend takes advice from the governor and the deputy director of the prison service and acts upon that advice <e> <s> there are all kinds of advice floating about the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain that i get the drift of my noble friends question <e>

correctly i believe he means that people outside government were not aware of what the oda paper referred to <e> <s> i shall study my noble friends question but i am not quite certain how to answer it to his satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to see afterwards the evidence which my noble friend has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for admitting to a certain mystery concerning this question when he saw it on the order paper <e> <s> it is a mystery that i shared <e> <s> however i hope that i have been able to divest your lordships of that

sympathetically <e> <s> for instance there was a conference to discuss mitigating annual flooding in bangladesh and has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not answer the noble lords question correctly <e> <s> however i hope that i am capable of answering any of his questions even that one <e> <s> i can tell him that that particular point is being addressed by the new civil emergencies adviser who at the moment is concerned to find out exactly what all local authorities and local organisations are doing in order to co-ordinate effort at home <e> <s> when that is accomplised we shall also be able to co-ordinate effort abroad <e>", "<cs> yes my lords a great deal of work was carried out in that area not only by the private sector but also by the public sector <e> <s> various people from the fire brigade were also sent out to the area to give assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords at present about a year is being spent on work to prepare for disasters <e> <s> as regards actual disasters approximately million has been spent in each of the past two years on disaster costs <e> <s> there is no specific budget for this because it has to be dealt with on the basis of assessments made when the disasters occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> if one carries out a simple mathematical calculation of the amount which was spent during the first days together with the amount spent over the total number of days one will arrive at a certain figure <e> <s> however it would not necessarily be an accurate one because the police commitment altered from day to day <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that what took place was exceptional and unforeseen <e> <s> however it was not necessarily on such a scale as to threaten the efficiency of the force <e> <s> i should remind the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester that although there may be national conditions the government pay a per cent <e> <s> grant towards the running of the police force <e> <s> they also contribute considerably towards the local authoritys expenditure on policing by way of the block grant <e>", "<cs> my lords when the decisions were made as to whether to intervene they were taken on the basis of operational advice provided by the deputy director general of the prison service <e> <s> clearly there was a case on the second day when to prison officers were present who could have been deployed against nearly fresh and violent prisoners <e> <s> it was considered inappropriate to intervene on that basis because of the risk of possible danger to life and fatalities <e>", "<cs> my lords any outbreak such as the one we have witnessed is a national as well as a local matter <e> <s> my right honourable friend takes advice and acts upon it <e> <s> on this occasion he also took advice <e> <s> as i explained the greater manchester police authority has asked for a meeting with ministers and we intend to listen to what it has to say <e> <s> i should remind the noble lord that although it may be a national matter central government provide a very great deal towards the costs of police authorities in order to take account of the national element of their policing responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the way in which authorities are charge-capped is a separate issue although i agree that it may have a bearing on the matter <e> <s> i can only repeat that the government through central funds provide a very great deal towards the cost of policing <e> <s> they pay additional sums only where there is exceptional and unforeseen expenditure on such a scale as to threaten the efficiency of the force <e> <s> the only recent occasion on which that has happened was in relation to the hillsborough disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords there are at present approved bail hostels with places <e> <s> in addition there are approved probation/bail hostels providing places many of which are available to those on bail <e> <s> according to the latest information available just over per cent <e> <s> of available places in bail-only hostels were occupied compared with per cent <e> <s> of places in all approved hostels <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the question on drugs and alcohol there are issues which remain to be decided following the consultation paper which we issued on th february <e> <s> we expect to be able to make an announcement on the matter within the next few months <e> <s> we shall take into account the remarks made by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale about the privatisation of bail hostels <e> <s> however we consider that such hostels are best run as they are at present by the probation service <e>", "<cs> my lords the probation service has developed bail information schemes over a number of areas <e> <s> i cannot tell my noble friend whether there are separate hostels for young offenders but i shall see whether i can find the information and let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords consideration is being given to that point <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that we shall be spending over million up to on providing new places <e> <s> how those places will be allocated will have to be decided <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second part of my noble friends question it will be up to the independent television commission to decide the criteria on which licences are allocated <e> <s> it will obviously take into account the safeguards in the bill which are intended to ensure that religious broadcasting is carried out responsibly and is not open to abuse by religious extremists <e> <s> it will obviously expand upon these requirements in its code on programme standards <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be open to religious organisations if they so wish to purchase non-domestic channels for broadcasting <e> <s> if they abuse this position they will come under the scrutiny of the itc which in the end has the power to remove such rights <e>", "<cs> my lords those people can switch the television off <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the anxiety of the right reverend prelate on this matter <e> <s> that is something that everyone shares <e> <s> the itc is the body that must decide the criteria <e> <s> that is an important point <e> <s> that body must take into account the safeguards that the bill contains which are to ensure that religious broadcasting is carried out responsibly and is not open to abuse by religious extremists <e> <s> i hope that covers the point made by the right reverand prelate <e> <s> the itc will have to draw up its own codes of practice <e> <s> the position will be made clear when that happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that anyone was anticipating the second reading <e> <s> i answered the questions that were put to me and i believe those who asked the questions were perfectly entitled to ask them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is anything to stop anyone from putting over their viewpoints <e> <s> the anxiety that my noble friend has is whether or not religious organisations can own channels <e> <s> religious and non-religious organisations can own channels <e> <s> i am certain that many of the points which the noble lord opposite has in mind are fully covered in what is disseminated on television at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the point my noble friend makes is a fair one <e> <s> there has been a long tradition in british broadcasting which applies the concept of religious broadcasting in a way which reflects the range of religious views which exist in this country while giving proper weight to the tradition of christian belief <e> <s> i do not think it is easy to put that into a specific formula <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government do not try to control what is broadcast <e> <s> it is up to the independent television commission to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that is also a valid point <e> <s> the itc will have to produce codes of practice and rules which will have to be observed <e> <s> when producing those the very points which the noble lord refers to are bound to be taken into account <e> <s> however i cannot anticipate what the commission will state in the codes of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i daresay it might be <e> <s> i have no doubt that it would also have a certain amount of acrimony attached to it as these things usually do <e> <s> however that does not matter <e> <s> there is nothing to stop such a conglomeration of people getting together and purchasing a station <e> <s> i remind my noble friend that for the first time under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to consider the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> i should imagine that the criteria will be published but i prefer to reserve judgment on that point if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult enough to know what the law of this country is without knowing what the law of each individual community country is <e> <s> we agree that the present position is an absurdity whereby you can buy such things as my noble frend suggested yet you cannot buy other things <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so <e> <s> we have effective ways of enforcing the laws of this country too by going to the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too well aware of the noble viscounts view of what happened to the shops bill about four years ago <e> <s> that is the reason why the government have no intention of producing another bill until such time as it is likely to prove practical and enforceable and until it carries widespread agreement and a parliamentary majority <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a peculiarly graphic description of the bills passage through another place with which i have no intention of joining in <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting piece of information on which i would not seek to disagree with my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps one day that will happen in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the opposition which might be generated by complete deregulation <e> <s> the noble lord says that all european countries have restrictions <e> <s> i can confirm that there are restrictions on trading on sundays in belgium denmark germany greece italy luxembourg and the netherlands <e> <s> on the other hand it is absurd when you can sell a razor blade to cut corns but you cannot sell one for shaving and you can buy newspapers but you cannot buy toilet paper <e> <s> noble lords will recall that as i have said before you can sell tinned or untinned clotted cream and untinned unclotted cream but not tinned unclotted cream <e> <s> it is an absurdity <e>", "<cs> my lords the obligation is on the seller and not the purchaser <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for drawing attention to the points made by the church of england on this matter <e> <s> i should be reluctant to comment for fear that i receive a riposte from some other noble lord <e> <s> however i realise that that is one very substantial and important part of a diverse argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree that when a law is riddled with absurdities it is very difficult to make it make sense <e> <s> my noble friend will understand that he takes one view and the right reverend prelate takes another <e> <s> we have had this argument before <e> <s> until there is a parliamentary majority for any bill it is pointless to try to put the matter right <e> <s> if my noble friend lobbies vigorously the right reverend prelate and all those who take an opposing view to see whether some accommodation can be reached with his own view we may get somewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords one should not ask a question from this dispatch box but i was going to say so what <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought of many supplementary questions which the noble lord lord stallard might ask but i did not think he would ask anything about pensions <e> <s> the question on the order paper asks how many citizens of the united kingdom will qualify to vote under the -year rule and that is the answer i gave to him <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord stallard will table a question on pensions and people who vote overseas i shall be delighted to answer it but i do not think that the matter relates to this question <e>", "<cs> my lords the ability to vote in another country as an overseas resident is optional <e> <s> if a person wishes to take it he may do so but it is not compulsory <e>", "<cs> my lords if the resident takes the option to vote in this country then he may exercise it <e> <s> if the noble lord is asking about the voting systems in other

argentina ascension islands right down through to the philippines poland and portugal <e> <s> they all have different numbers of people who are entitled to vote in this country <e> <s> i am unable to give the aggregate <e>", "<cs> my lords there has always been the ability for people who went abroad for periods of time to retain their voting capacity in this country <e> <s> until the beginning of this year the period was five years but it was extended to years as a result of extensive consultation with the main political parties and local authority interests <e> <s> parliament decided that the right should be extended to people living <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the war crimes bill be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just heard a most moving speech from the noble lord lord mishcon which attained and indeed surpassed the heights which the noble lord normally achieves <e> <s> we have had a long debate <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that it has been an important debate <e> <s> it is not of ten we have over speakers and it has been a formidable list of people <e> <s> there have been many notable and powerful speeches <e> <s> there have been

often asked myself <e> <s> i suppose the answer is that the prisoners cannot get downstairs and therefore the easiest way is to get upstairs <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that in the rebuilding

those prisons to which quite understandably the noble lord refers <e> <s> i can assure him that such matters as internal sanitation and so forth will be put in the refurbished strangeways <e>", "<cs>

latter part of his question would continue elsewhere <e> <s> with regard to the question of prisoners in police cells it is of course our desire to get them down to the lowest possible number as soon

point that is constantly produced <e> <s> the miles per hour speed limit strikes a balance between fast convenient travel and safety <e> <s> the average motorways speeds according to the national speed survey of were mph for cars mph for buses and coaches and mph for lorries <e> <s> my noble friend may be surprised at those figures but apparently they are correct <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer my noble friend by saying that that is a question which i ask myself <e> <s> i agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that in fact that is so <e> <s> about per cent <e> <s> of our police force is engaged specifically on traffic work <e> <s> a number of other officers become involved in traffic work in the course of carrying out their responsibilities <e> <s> in states in the united states decided to raise the speed limits on rural interstate highways from mph to mph with the result that road deaths increased by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were to produce legislation to ensure that lorries kept to the correct speed we should have to ensure that motor cars did so as well <e> <s> as i explained it is a matter of enforcement <e> <s> police officers have to carry out enforcement as best they can <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord that it is a great hazard when one finds oneself behind a lorry as he puts it belting along the motorway at mph with water flying all over the place <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to a mechanical device which prevents equipment from going faster than it should do that is an idea which i shall consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> that is why chief constables and police authorities are always coming to me asking for more men to deal with road traffic offences and every other kind of criminal activity <e> <s> i agree with him that the presence of a police vehicle makes a great deal of difference <e> <s> however i give him one warning some police forces operate vehicles which are not evidently police cars and the noble lord may get caught out one day <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not surprise me that such support comes from the noble lord lord stoddart but views to the contrary might come from many vehicle owners and operators <e> <s> certainly the matter will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to hear the noble lord in agreement with the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> that event will have to go down in one of the annals of history <e> <s> the answer to his question is that the motorist in the right-hand lane doing mph ought to have been in the left-hand lane in order to allow others to overtake him should they wish to break the law <e>", "<cs> the proviso my lords is that anyone who is driving along a motorway is obliged to use the inside lane primarily the middle lane for overtaking and the third lane for overtaking after that <e> <s> drivers are not permitted under the law to hog the outside lane <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows perfectly well that the regulations and motorway practice require one to use the inside lane other than when one desires to overtake <e> <s> it is no defence to drive in the outside lane without any intention of moving over to the inside lane <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to explain to the house if the experience of the united states was anything to go by that when they raised the speed limit from mph to mph the number of accidents increased by per cent <e> <s> if that experience were repeated on motorways in

name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it might be helpful if i were to give noble lords the governments view of the bill <e> <s> however i should first like to congratulate my noble friend lord montgomery of alamein on his helpful and remarkably concise exposition of the bill <e> <s> the bill deals with detail but is nonetheless important <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i respond to such felicitations <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord was impressed <e> <s> so was i <e>", "<cs> my lords we have encouraged the use of community penalties whereby offenders can have either community service orders attendance-centre orders or probation orders <e> <s> all these provisions can be applied in order to keep offenders out of custody and make them work in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords there has to be a place for people on remand to be held in custody <e> <s> i can only tell the noble lord that the offences committed by to year-old offenders have decreased over the past year or so from in september to in september <e> <s> clearly the strength and severity of the offences have to be taken into account when deciding whether an offender should be remanded in custody <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that to hold people in custody is on the whole the most expensive way of dealing with them <e> <s> however sometimes that has to happen <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right in saying that custody brings young people into the company of more experienced criminals who in turn will influence others <e> <s> custody also removes the young offender from the positive influences of family school and job <e> <s> those influences are to be encouraged <e> <s> that is the reason why we have tried to find whether it is possible for some co-operation to be obtained between the probation service the voluntary sector and possibly the private sector <e> <s> that is also the reason why we have issued a green paper <e>

divide on a group of amendments <e> <s> she can divide on each amendment as we go through them <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls said that the principle of the bill was not involved in the amendment and that it was an amendment to protect the little man <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> we debated the concerns about the amendment last week when the noble lord lord birkett quite

bid part of the competitive tender revenue to be paid in equal instalments but in each case the instalments would be increased or decreased in line with inflation <e> <s> i understand the reasoning behind the amendments <e> <s> applicants who wished to make cash bids would have to make some kind of projection of their income and expenditure for the -year licence period <e> <s> part of that process would probably require them to estimate the inflation rate for that period <e> <s> my noble friend lord stockton said that that would be difficult to do <e> <s> i dare say that it might be but it was also said that by automatically taking inflation into account there would be one less element for applicants to have to estimate and accordingly such a change would introduce greater certainty into the bidding process <e>", "<cs> as one may have expected on such an issue we have had a debate full of interest and strongly-held views which go to the heart of peoples fundamental beliefs <e>

about what people feel <e> <s> however he brought us back to the reality that we must deal with what is actually put in the bill <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend looks at the bill he will see that it

paper <e> <s> it is an indication of what it expects the present licensees to adhere to and it is what it anticipates the independent television commission when it is set up will also expect <e>", "<cs> it is perfectly possible as the noble lord said for this requirement to be added to the long list of subjects that have to be televised and broadcast <e> <s> the amendment would add to the quality threshold for channel and channel licensees a requirement that a reasonable amount of time should be given to the broadcast of parliamentary proceedings <e> <s> many of the arguments which i listed in my response to the debate on amendment no <e> <s> a apply here as well <e> <s> there will be nothing to prevent licensees from showing parliamentary proceedings <e> <s> but we see no need for a statutory requirement on licensees to show them <e> <s> the public service channels bbc bbc and channel will continue to broadcast parliamentary proceedings <e> <s> i have no doubt that channel and channel licensees will wish to include broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings in their programmes not least because of the requirement on them to broadcast high quality news programmes <e> <s> however i suggest that we should not add a statutory requirement for them to broadcast parliamentary proceedings <e> <s> it is not a suitable requirement to include in the bill and i hope that the noble lord will agree <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth will not oppose the clause too hard <e> <s> i can appreciate that they have a different view of the working of the bill than the government <e> <s> we believe that the competitive tender is the fairest and the most transparent way of allocating licences for commercial television <e>", "<cs> it may be that it is something different <e> <s> however once the various applicants have gone through the quality threshold either it is the highest bidder who wins the prize as it were or someone chooses <e> <s> that is a subjective judgment about which people might have different views <e> <s> the whole point of the quality threshold is that it is designed to ensure that only those applicants who are capable of providing a high quality service are eligible to bid for licences in the first place <e> <s> thereafter i do not believe that there is a need to make fine distinctions on the relative quality of the applicants proposals <e> <s> that does not mean that all the proposals will be exactly the same <e> <s> if each applicant were given the right to broadcast it may be that the results would be different but the quality would be up to the proper standard <e>", "<cs> there is a balance to be struck in determining the point at which channel and licensees should be able to apply to have their licences renewed <e> <s> clearly licensees will need to have operated satisfactorily for an adequate period in order to demonstrate to the itc their fitness to carry on with <e>", "<cs> there is plenty of flexibility <e> <s> it is true that the presumption is that there should be a renewal provided the licensee has maintained a high quality and the itc does not intend to change the licence <e>", "<cs> there is an attraction in the idea of the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth <e> <s> however there are practical difficulties <e> <s> when i first addressed my mind to this i thought the same as the noble lord lord thomson four years seemed a long time and two years would be better <e> <s> however if we are to have a renewal of the licensing system the process takes two years <e> <s> we must then be able to evaluate it before the two years <e> <s> therefore we need to evaluate the licence possibly three years before the end of the licence period <e> <s> so we have said in the bill that four years before the end a licensee may apply for a new licence <e> <s> that gives time for the itc to consider how the applicant has done and evaluate it <e> <s> then if the commission thinks it necessary for the licence to undergo a new set of negotiations that can be done <e> <s> but that in itself would take two years <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that a few brief words of explanation would be most helpful <e> <s> however i am not so sure that i can provide them at the moment <e> <s> i thought we had discussed this amendment with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady macleod is concerned that there should be a twoyear period during which there would be a moratorium <e> <s> in practice that is what there will be <e> <s> the moratorium only begins to operate for a year once the broadcasting starts <e> <s> the broadcasting will not start until about a year after the licence has been granted <e> <s> so from the time when the licensee knows that he will have the licence in effect he has a twoyear period under the governments amendment during which he may not be taken over <e> <s> that is quite a long time <e>", "<cs> i quite understand that the noble baroness would be grateful if i gave that undertaking <e> <s> she is enormously persuasive when she says that it is a pity to spoil the ship for a haporth of tar <e> <s> it is hardly a question of a haporth of tar <e> <s> we are giving a oneyear moratorium from the time at which screening starts <e> <s> however the noble baroness says in the most charming way that she would like a twoyear moratorium <e> <s> a twoyear moratorium would mean in fact a threeyear moratorium we are agreed on this because there is also the period before screening commences <e> <s> the noble baroness is in fact saying that companies in the independent television business should have the privilege of a threeyear break from being subjected to market forces and that if any company wishes to take those businesses over it should not be allowed to do so during that period <e> <s> she believe s those companies should be isolated and insulated from such pressures <e>", "<cs> i go along with what the noble lord lord annan has said <e> <s> the people i know who have been subjected to takeovers have found it a most disagreeable business <e> <s> the noble lord is right to say that in such circumstances one directs ones energies to defending ones premises and ones organisation <e> <s> that is why we have said that there should be a moratorium <e> <s> it is obviously a matter of opinion how long the moratorium should last <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble baroness i do not believe that we were speaking to her amendment it was my amendment <e>", "<cs> i stand in sackcloth and ashes <e> <s> the noble baroness is quite right she was amending my amendment <e>", "<cs> it would be easier to deal with this amendment separately <e> <s> the noble baroness asked whether the government have carried out any research <e> <s> the department of trade and industry has conducted research in relation to channels and <e> <s> as a result the government decided to go ahead with channel but not with channel <e> <s> channel will be larger than any single channel company and there is no reason to doubt its viability <e>", "<cs> the noble baronesss amendment suggests that the itc should conduct the research into the technical and commercial feasibility of channel <e> <s> at the same time it requires it to set up channel <e> <s> the noble lord lord thomson said that he was glad that broadcasting remained in the hands of the home office <e> <s> i took that as being a somewhat backhanded compliment <e>", "<cs> that gets me into even greater difficulties <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble lord should compliment the home office in such a way <e> <s> i shall <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has given channel a pretty good spike and says that it will not <e>", "<cs> when i listen to noble lords opposite i begin to wonder sometimes where their spark of excitement and enterprise is <e> <s> the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth poured cold water on all the new arrangements for channel and said that they were perfectly awful <e> <s> along came the noble baroness and started on channel <e> <s> she said that it will fail and will not achieve an audience and will fade away <e> <s> the noble lord lord thomson turned round and said well i dont know <e> <s> it might be successful and if it is so successful it will cause all channel licensees to be in a muddle <e> <s> he then asked whether we were right to give channel people a blank cheque <e>", "<cs> i am deeply appreciative of the noble lords ever widening sense of understanding <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkins is always ingenious <e> <s> i paid tribute to the noble lord lord thomson because he had become so broadminded and had understood the point of view of the government

recall in what circumstances i said as the noble lord lord boston suggested that they would almost certainly have a controlling interest <e>", "<cs> that is a perfectly fair point <e> <s> if all those who were the owners of the per cent <e> <s> were collectively to gather together on some point they would overrule the per cent <e> <s> as nobody on the other side can own more than per cent <e> <s> the chances <e>", "<cs> the analogy with the late lord thomson is not relevant to this particular case <e> <s> our view is that here is an organisation which has been immensely successful <e> <s> we

birk and that is a somewhat happy and unusual position to be in <e> <s> this amendment is not quite suitable <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that this is an interesting initiative and we wish it success but that is completely different from imposing an obligation upon itc licensees to contribute <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble baroness would be pleased with the amendment instead of which she poured a bucket of cold water on it <e> <s> she said that we ought to have gone a great deal further <e> <s> all employment in large companies is covered under existing equal opportunities

general law <e> <s> however as this review is being carried out at the moment i think it would be a pity to preempt its outcome by trying to write a provision into this bill when the results of that review will cover far wider areas than merely broadcasting <e>", "<cs> the itc will not be numb over this <e> <s> if an annual report states that a licensee considers himself to be an equal

be at risk <e> <s> licensees are supposed to state what they have achieved in their annual reports <e> <s> if they were to come out with some bland statement it would not be unreasonable for the itc to ask for a more specific explanation <e>", "<cs> that is entirely a matter for the itc <e> <s> if in awarding a licence the itc stated that it wanted to know exactly what was being done on certain

is that it is difficult to be conclusive if one does not know who will be the licensees <e> <s> the whole point of the provisions is that when the licenses are granted and people know who the licensees are at that moment the licensees will be able to get together to decide on the network <e> <s> at the moment we do not know what that is and therefore there is bound to be as the noble baroness said a vacuum <e> <s> the reason there is a vacuum is that we do not know who the licensees will be <e> <s> but the mere fact that the present contractors have got together and worked out a system is most encouraging <e>", "<cs> a firm requirement is put on the itc to do it if the licensees themselves cannot come to a conclusion <e> <s> that is fairly clear <e> <s> if one accepts the principle that it is for the licensees themselves to decide how they will network then they will have to <e>", "<cs> i cannot give a commitment as to what certain noble lords may wish to do at the

local delivery licences to set the percentage of qualifying revenue at nil for any specified years <e>", "<cs> my noble friend never makes a point lamely <e> <s> i entirely understand the point that he has made <e> <s> if he has not understood what i said that was no doubt the part of my speech that was not drafted by my officials but to which i gave vent myself <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord

desire of the noble lord lord thomson or the noble baroness lady birk in moving this amendment to go back on decisions already made as the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls said <e> <s> i thought that it was an opportunity for the noble baroness and the noble lord to complain vigorously about a system for which they do not much care <e>", "<cs> this part of the bill deals with a completely different subject in that we now come to community radio <e> <s> before i turn to the detail of the amendments perhaps i may be permitted to outline the bills general approach to community radio <e>

operated by the iba in recent months shows that community groups can win against competition from applicants which are more commercially minded <e>", "<cs> i believe that there will be a considerable increase in both but in fact i was referring to community radio <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the noble lord lord winstanley out of his misery <e> <s> we discussed this grouping because the amendments related to community radio <e> <s> each amendment will of course be called separately and if the noble lord feels motivated to divide the committee and after hearing what i have said i am

give the radio authority the impracticable task of ensuring that the local services in any given area collectively included a long but somewhat arbitrary list of programme types <e> <s> the noble baroness says that the licensees in an area would be considered as a whole and that one need not subject each individual licensee to this process <e> <s> nevertheless i think it would be an impossible task to consider them as a whole in ensuring that they match up to the high quality standards suggested <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment is interesting <e> <s> it goes a little too far to be acceptable as it stands but i have considerable sympathy with the underlying thought that the radio authority should have special regard to the extent to which new local radio services would genuinely add something new and enhance the diversity of choice for listeners <e>", "<cs> though the noble lord addressed most of his remarks to amendment no <e> <s> was he also including amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with it or does he wish to confine his remarks to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for making that clear <e> <s> he said that he hoped that the government would look at the merits of the argument that lies behind the amendment <e> <s> i shall certainly do that <e> <s> the bill approaches this particular problem in two ways <e> <s> first it provides for stations to have a great deal more control over their expenditure by removing a layer of unnecessary regulation <e> <s> it also allows them to make their own transmission arrangements in future instead of having them provided by the iba <e> <s> that will give operators more freedom to determine their own outgoings <e>", "<cs> that is quite all right <e> <s> i realise that <e> <s> as the amendments were grouped on the list i was not absolutely certain whether the noble lord lord thomson was referring to the other amendment though i do not think he actually mentioned it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is on to a fair point <e> <s> i shall consider what he and other noble lords have said because the point they make is a real one <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bonham-carter said please do not brush aside the amendment because it really has something to it <e> <s> i should not dream of brushing aside any suggestion that the noble lord puts forward <e> <s> i should consider it carefully <e> <s> however i am bound to tell him of an observation made by the late archbishop fisher namely that there is no unreasonable argument that cannot be proved reasonable by reason <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord interested in decriminalising criminals <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply because the noble lord asked me one or two questions <e> <s> i admire the noble lord a great deal but periodically he goes around the course like a greyhound pursuing a hare <e> <s> he is blinkered and merely follows the hare <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that he is misguided over this matter <e> <s> he says that he wants to decriminalise the criminals the poor wretched people who have only set up a radio service which everyone enjoys and who should be allowed to continue <e> <s> those people are doing something which is against the law <e> <s> we have the law for a purpose <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friend i should say that this amendment was spoken to with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is wholly right <e> <s> i was in error <e> <s> i thought that it would leave out words which we had agreed to incorporate in earlier amendments <e> <s> because it was tabled in the name of my noble friend lady cox i am afraid that we went a little too quickly <e> <s> i was in error <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bonham-carter having gone one up a short while ago is now one down <e> <s> we are all square <e> <s> in fact i believe that this amendment was dealt with at the same time as amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> it is a pleasure to hear my noble friend lady young take part in the debate on the bill <e> <s> it was interesting to hear her views and the reasons why she tabled this probing amendment <e> <s> there will be three new national services <e> <s> one will be non-pop another will be speech-based and the third will be open to offers <e> <s> the chances are that it will be pop because often that is the most lucrative category <e> <s> however the bill deliberately leaves open the third option <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is right in saying that two categories of broadcasting have been allowed for <e> <s> one is a speech-based service and the other is non-pop <e> <s> that is because we did not want all three national radio services to be allocated to the category where the profitability is likely to be greatest that is non-stop pop or pop as a whole <e> <s> therefore it was decided that one broadcasting category should be non-pop and another speech-based <e> <s> we hope that the full range will be covered by the three systems <e>", "<cs> i thought i detected a minor flutter of irritation from the noble lord lord bonham-carter and the noble lord lord ardwick because amendments nos <e> <s> and are grouped together <e> <s> as they have spoken only to amendment no <e> <s> i am content to do the same <e> <s> nothing pleases me more than to make them happy <e>", "<cs> we are speaking essentially of licences for national radio <e> <s> amendments were made in another place to the procedure for licensing the national services <e> <s> that means that applicants will now have to offer some variety and be different from each other <e> <s> i do not believe that the case for a statutory requirement to publish illustrative guidelines is the same as for channel as the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth agreed <e> <s> the statutory requirement for channel is that it must cater for a wide variety of tastes and interests <e> <s> the requirement for national radio in this part of the bill is that there should be a variety of tastes and interests <e>", "<cs> it is all a matter of approach <e> <s> the noble baroness believes that the radio authority <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstanley is perfectly right <e> <s> it does not matter where the headquarters of any of the licensed operators exist because they will be connected to a network and therefore their position is relatively irrelevant <e>", "<cs> i can understand the anxiety of the noble baroness and of the noble lord lord bonham-carter to try to help musical performers by their amendment <e> <s> however it would be too onerous a requirement to stipulate that a minimum amount of live music should be broadcast by music-based services <e> <s> that could greatly increase their costs <e> <s> even in the case of the national services this would be a prime example of jeopardising the development of new services by placing substantial and in some ways unnecessary burdens on them from the outset <e>", "<cs> that is an ingenious device <e> <s> i do not understand how a local radio station operating in the south west can share a musician with a radio station operating in the north east <e>", "<cs> the debate is becoming more convoluted <e> <s> the noble lord lord airedale said that it is perfectly acceptable to play music that is recorded provided that one has employed the musicians who recorded it in the first place <e>", "<cs> that may well be so but these new enterprises have to be allowed to get off the ground without being inhibited too greatly <e>", "<cs> i quite see that <e> <s> however if the noble lord lord ardwick were the licensee of a radio station and employed the london symphony orchestra he would find it very much more expensive than providing a tape <e>", "<cs> i have enormous sympathy for them <e> <s> the noble lord lord ardwick is quite right to pursue their lobby on their behalf <e> <s> however there are two sides to the story <e> <s> the introduction of such a requirement would be very expensive for the new organisations <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness was about to withdraw the amendment if i did not stand up that gave me a very great incentive not to do so <e> <s> of course i shall take note of what the noble baroness said <e> <s> however i really cannot give her any indication that i am likely to change my mind even though i understand her philosophy <e> <s> in a way this is similar to the time when television came along and people said that all the cinemas would close <e> <s> however actors still find other work on television and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> there is a certain amount of confusion <e> <s> i shall do my best to try to straighten the matter out <e> <s> it is not a question of giving a blank cheque <e> <s> contrary to what was said by the noble baronesses we are simply trying to introduce uniformity <e> <s> the amendment follows exactly the wording of clause <e> <s> it makes clear that the same set of exceptional circumstances may occur more than once <e> <s> in other words it means that exceptional circumstances would not cease to apply in relation to applications for the third national service simply because the authority had invoked the exceptional <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ardwick says that it should be absolute and explicit that local broadcasters should carry news <e> <s> part iii deliberately avoids imposing any requirement on the radio authority licensees to carry news and current affairs <e> <s> i see no reason why say a jazz or country and western station should have to do so <e> <s> the indications are that many services will wish to carry news and some listeners like it <e> <s> but i do not believe that there is any reason to require the radio authoritys licensees to have to mirror the public service obligations of the bbc radio stations <e> <s> it is far preferable to base the radio authority licensing on what listeners want and on the extension of listener choice <e>", "<cs> it might well be an item of news but whether or not to broadcast it would be a matter for the local radio station <e> <s> the noble lord lord airedale wishes to place an imposition on the stations to broadcast all such news <e> <s> that is not right because there are many other avenues where such news will be broadcast <e> <s> it may be that the local radio station will wish to do so but we are discussing the proposal to impose an obligation <e>", "<cs> one would be adding to the consumer choice of the person following but i do not wish to go too far with that analogy <e> <s> the noble lord lord airedale expressed anxiety about whether the local radio station should transmit the fact that the road is blocked <e> <s> a commercial radio station might do so but the bbc would do so because it must provide news <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord thomson is mistaken <e> <s> an applicant might go to the radio authority and say i want to have a radio licence <e> <s> i shall be transmitting all the records and tapes that i shall receive from heathrow airport <e> <s> i shall collect them and bung them on <e> <s> however they would not be covering the variety of interests for which they must cater <e> <s> if that proposal were contained in the application but another application did not contain such a mundane attitude that other applicant would be awarded the licence <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to interrupt the vibes which appear to be crossing between the two opposition front benches <e> <s> i thought that i heard the noble lord lord thomson cajoling the noble baroness to take immediate action <e> <s> perhaps i may interrupt while they are making up their minds in order to refer to the point made by my noble friend lord moyne <e> <s> in agreeing with the noble baroness he is saying that every single radio station even if it were serving a small community within a radius of five miles should be obliged by law to carry news items <e> <s> that is going too far <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness does so perhaps i may explain that the silence from the benches behind me probably shows a generous desire not again to keep the noble baroness here until am <e>", "<cs> i readily concede that there is a certain attractiveness to the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bonham-carter and the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs said it should be open for all to know what the position is <e> <s> the amendment is concerned with the reasons for the decision and not with the disclosure of the applicants business or financial plans <e> <s> those would remain confidential under the bill <e>", "<cs> my immediate response is that it would be more helpful if the radio authority told those who had not succeeded why they had not succeeded rather than telling those who had succeeded why they had succeeded <e> <s> the trouble with the second course is that one would have to reply to more people than would if one took the course suggested by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bonham-carter for explaining the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> as i perused it beforehand i was not totally clear what the aim was given that the amendment appears to suffer from some technical deficiencies <e> <s> i acknowledge that there may be a case for saying that clause should be more restrictively framed <e> <s> it was put into the bill to solve an awkward problem which regularly arose under the broadcasting act <e>", "<cs> the position is that it will not be the ibas staff it will only be the transmission staff <e> <s> at present the exact arrangements have not been made <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly do the best i can <e> <s> the noble baroness asks a question of detail <e> <s> in the circumstances i think that it would be best if i were to write to her on the matter <e> <s> it is quite an important issue and i would not like to mislead her <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord annan for what he said <e> <s> i do not agree with his last sentence although i understand why he said it <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord breathed a sense of fresh air and realism into this debate on the broadcasting standards council <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is entitled to her opinion <e> <s> it is all very well for her and her colleagues throughout the proceedings on the bill to say that the legislation will result in the lowering of standards and quality <e> <s> when the government introduce an organisation which will home in on standards but not set them it will advise upon them the noble baroness says that it is a waste of time and money that the members of the council are gloomy gremlins and that it is a carbuncle on the broadcasting system <e> <s> in my view that is really going over the top <e> <s> however i am glad that the noble lord lord thomson said that that view is no criticism of those who serve on the broadcasting standards council <e> <s> the body has existed in a brief statutory form for over two years <e> <s> during that period its record justifies its establishment on a statutory basis <e> <s> i do not believe as the noble baroness said that it has shown itself to be a joke <e>", "<cs> i noticed that the noble lord deliberately omitted the ex-statutory liberal <e>", "<cs> i was trying to follow the noble lord down his path <e> <s> he said that the broadcasting standards <e> <s> council would simply take in its own washing <e> <s> how do you take in washing that you have not produced <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for having been kind enough to welcome the governments initiative in setting up the broadcasting standards council and for having applauded its work <e>", "<cs> it is true that the council may make arrangements and it has a statutory responsibility in that respect <e> <s> however if it wished not to do so i suppose that it could not be made to do so <e> <s> as the provision is written into the statute the chances are that the broadcasting standards council would do so <e>", "<cs> members of the committee have been very persuasive about their concerns on this matter <e> <s> perhaps i may try to allay the committees fears about the role of the broadcasting standards council <e> <s> the noble lords lord mcgregor and lord boston and to a certain extent the noble lord lord thomson portrayed anxieties about the role of the broadcasting standards council which are out of proportion to what i think will be the fact <e> <s> the noble lord lord annan said that this is a different point from what we were discussing earlier <e> <s> i do not think that it is <e> <s> the broadcasting standards council was set up specifically to act as a focus for concern about the portrayal of sex and violence and standards of taste and decency in all forms of broadcasting <e> <s> it stands to reason that this necessarily and obviously includes advertisements which are just as much a part of broadcasting and just as much a potential cause of offence as ordinary programmes <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will but that should come about only if the advertisements are of such a nature as to cause complaint <e> <s> if there are to be complaints and they are sent to the broadcasting standards council it must investigate them <e>", "<cs> we are almost coming back to basic principles here <e> <s> if there is to be a broadcasting standards council it should have the right and option to criticise programmes <e> <s> the whole philosophy behind that is that if programmes are of a sufficiently controversial nature as to require the matter to be drawn to the publics attention that can be done either as i have said by press release or press comment or eventually if necessary by asking the broadcasters to make it clear by broadcasting the findings of the broadcasting standards council <e> <s> that is inevitably part of the councils philosophy <e> <s> however if the council is to do that i do not understand how it can do so if it cannot receive complaints from people <e> <s> the right reverend prelate said earlier that he wanted there to be discussion to enable people to give their views <e> <s> that is the only basis on which the broadcasting standards council is enabled to come to a conclusion <e>", "<cs> i am not trying to be stubborn <e> <s> clause c provides that the broadcasting standards council is not obliged to pursue frivolous complaints <e> <s> however if the complaint is not frivolous and if there is some fearful programme that apparently contravenes various standards it is inevitably right that people should be able to write to the council and that it should look into the matter <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we are making unduly heavy weather of this <e> <s> so far as i can see noble lords shake their heads but i have not even been able to get out what i was going to say <e> <s> if members of the committee would be good enough to postpone the shaking of their heads a little longer i should be grateful <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris on this point <e> <s> i think that he may be under a slight misapprehension if i may put it that way <e> <s> i agree with him that at present advertisers have to put their proposed advertisements before the iba which determines whether or not they will be acceptable <e> <s> that is what happens now <e> <s> however that will not happen in the future <e> <s> advertisers will not have to put their advertisements to the itc <e> <s> moreover they will not be previewed <e> <s> the only previewing will be <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that is a different matter <e> <s> however it still comes under the same consideration namely that if the broadcasting standards council is to have the right to initiate its own findings on programmes it is not unreasonable that it should initiate its own findings on the advertising which is shown between the programmes <e> <s> i do not wish to be obstinate on the matter <e> <s> members of the committee have expressed much concern <e> <s> i should like to consider what has been said without commitment <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend has introduced an important subject <e> <s> he said that it sounds technical <e> <s> indeed it is fairly technical but it is nevertheless important for that <e>", "<cs> we are talking here about pirate radio stations <e> <s> offshore broadcasters have a colourful and romantic image <e> <s> they are popularly known as pirates conjuring up images of swashbuckling characters wearing black hats and scarves out to tweak the tail of the authorities <e> <s> they are seen by their supporters as we have heard this evening as harmless providers of a type of broadcasting which is not available elsewhere <e> <s> on that view the authorities who try to enforce the law against them are seen as my noble friend lord caldecote said as the sledgehammer to crack a nut or as the noble lord lord annan said earlier on bureaucratic killjoys out to break butterflies on wheels <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is always a little hasty in getting to his feet <e> <s> if he had waited a little longer i could have told him that the powers against drug traffickers onshore are far greater than those which we propose to use against pirate stations outside territorial waters <e> <s> enforcement powers have to reflect other factors <e> <s> they have to be sufficient to enable the authorities to prevent the criminal activity in question to obtain the evidence for a conviction and to bring offenders to book <e> <s> a law which cannot be enforced will not be effective <e> <s> the powers against offshore broadcasting reflect these practical points <e> <s> it will be necessary to board vessels search them and to bring them into port and arrest persons from time to time <e>", "<cs> i do not see that there is any connection <e> <s> this measure permits a state to take action against people on the high seas whose frequencies affect the frequencies of that state when an action is being taken against the international convention <e>", "<cs> i am conscious of the fact that it is after the witching hour of oclock <e> <s> i hope that i may write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt to help the committee <e> <s> on these occasions we stop at oclock <e> <s> it is already minutes past <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to move his amendments quickly that might be acceptable <e> <s> on the other hand if he wishes to have a more lengthy debate we should have to take them tomorrow <e>", "<cs> i was surprised at the speech of the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce because i should have thought that one who was so learned in the law would wish to ensure that the law was preserved <e> <s> pirate radio stations deliberately anchor themselves outside territorial waters and then transmit <e>", "<cs> i could not help feeling surprised at the remarks of my noble friend lord orr-ewing who referred back to <e> <s> he said that the arguments that were used in were just the same as the ones that are used nowadays <e> <s> however that was nearly years ago <e> <s> things have moved on in terms of telecommunications wireless and radio <e> <s> i was also surprised that my noble friend brushed off in such a cavalier fashion the remarks that i made about the effect on the safety of air services <e> <s> my noble friend was once himself a parliamentary-secretary for air <e> <s> i should have thought that he cared about what happened to aircraft <e> <s> my noble friend may find this difficult to believe but i can tell him that if one broadcasts on a frequency which one has not been allocated one may interfere with other frequencies inland <e> <s> further one may inadvertently combine with another frequency and mess up the beacons which helicopters in particular home in on <e>", "<cs> i am merely suggesting that if the noble lord were a commercial operator and he was offered that frequency he would say no thank you <e> <s> i would rather take another one <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest respect for the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce <e> <s> anything which he says commands the greatest respect <e> <s> i shall of course consider what the noble and learned lord has said and take further advice <e>", "<cs> i said that i would look at what the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce had said <e> <s> that would be irrespective of whether the committee voted on the amendment <e> <s> that should in no way give the committee the impression that i regard the amendment as acceptable <e>", "<cs> all these amendments amendments nos <e> <s> b to da seek to reduce the powers of enforcement in the bill <e>", "<cs> all orders which come up for negative resolution can be spoken to and voted on by both houses <e> <s> they have to pass both houses <e> <s> therefore if one house did not pass an order it would fall <e>", "<cs> i believe that it does <e> <s> for instance when the police go to a house they very seldom know that there will be evidence there <e> <s> they go to the house expecting there to be evidence and they might find that there is no evidence <e> <s> it is the same situation <e> <s> people who will operate this part of the bill when it becomes an act may go onto a ship or structure genuinely expecting to find certain evidence and in fact not find it <e> <s> in that case they would purport to be in exercise of their powers even though when they arrived they found that the expected evidence was not there <e> <s> in other words it justifies their act <e>", "<cs> we may easily return to the issue at report <e> <s> however perhaps i may help the noble lord in order to prevent him finding the necessity to do so <e>", "<cs> that is not right <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says that it does not wash <e> <s> i can only tell him that when one constructs an act of parliament it is necessary to cater for all problems <e> <s> the provision merely indemnifies a person who goes to carry out a task in the full belief that he is doing so correctly and suspects he will find something <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord orr-ewing said this is a desperately complicated position <e> <s> we sometimes think that it is perfectly simple but that is not the case <e> <s> however it is the subject of major public interest and controversy <e>", "<cs> as i understand the position the provisions allow a satellite broadcaster to outbid the bbc <e> <s> if it does so under the law it can have exclusive rights <e> <s> my information is that such broadcasters have not yet done so <e> <s> that is the answer to the noble lords first point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord airedale who is always ingenious has a vigorous imagination on this occasion <e> <s> if a satellite channel were to make an outrageous bid way above any bid that the bbc or itv would make does he say that wimbledon or the lawn tennis body should be denied the right to have that money for the use of its property <e> <s> is he saying that that amount of money could be bid for such an event but that the body could not have it <e> <s> that is the first issue <e>", "<cs> the questions that i asked the noble lord were rhetorical <e> <s> however i am delighted that he has taken the opportunity to answer <e> <s> he must be somewhat distanced from commercial reality <e> <s> the derby lasts for only a quarter of an hour and it is unlikely that half the population will run around buying satellite dishes in order to watch that event <e>", "<cs> i had a contribution to make but i shall not do so now <e>", "<cs> i am bound to tell my noble friend that the amendment causes the government a number of difficulties <e> <s> broadcasting legislation has never provided a statutory right for one broadcaster to include in its news bulletins clips of events covered and paid for by other broadcasters <e> <s> to introduce a statutory requirement now would not fit easily in a broadly deregulatory bill <e> <s> there has over the years been a series of voluntary reciprocal agreements between broadcasters in relation to news access <e> <s> such arrangements sometimes take the form of one broadcaster allowing another to have its own news cameras at an event <e> <s> alternatively broadcasters may make film coverage available to others <e> <s> these arrangements have worked well on the whole for many years <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead said that the national film archive has performed a tremendous service <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk asked what the phrase nominated body means <e> <s> that is a convenient phraseology in order not specifically to mention a body but it will almost certainly be the national television archive which is maintained by the british film institute <e>", "<cs> i dare say that it is but as the bbc archives its own material it is hard to expect it to archive someone elses material as well <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bonham-carter said that it is inferred that her majestys government have no confidence in the chairman of the governors of the bbc <e> <s> the noble lord must resist a constant temptation to be mischievous and misleading <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that the provisions in the bill do nothing of the sort <e> <s> of course the home office and the government have total confidence in the chairman of the governors of the bbc <e>", "<cs> there have been several bunches of amendments <e> <s> i should not like to guarantee exactly which bunch it was in <e> <s> however i expect that it probably was <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to give the details to the noble baroness now if she would like them <e> <s> i was hoping that i might have been meeting with the wishes of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that bouquet which was slightly unexpected <e> <s> i hardly dare say this to my noble friend because he is a lawyer but it is almost drafting <e> <s> we removed the henry viii clauses and replaced them with more specific requirements which met with his approval <e> <s> i am grateful for what he said <e>", "<cs> i find my noble friend enormously persuasive and shall be happy to accept the amendment <e> <s> however i must inform him that i shall have to table another amendment on report to delete the words and control <e> <s> that would have no substantive effect <e> <s> it would simply bring the wording into line with that in clause of the bill which is more suited to the proposed regulatory regime <e>", "<cs> my lords i anticipated many questions but not that one <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord what the answer is <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting slightly off beam <e> <s> there is no question before the house <e> <s> though this is a fascinating subject i think we are out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the views of the chief and assistant chief fire officers association but the statutory requirement to ensure the efficient training of fire brigade staff lies with the fire authorities <e> <s> we are confident that the fire authorities will meet that requirement in the future as they have in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords the view of the government is that the fire service college stands pre-eminent in the world for fire service training <e> <s> we have every intention that it should stay that way <e>", "<cs> my lords all the courses of the fire service college are enormously important <e> <s> the point is that in future fire authorities will be responsible for funding those who attend the college other than those attending the brigade command courses in order to become chief fire officers <e> <s> it is our intention to ensure that the funding of that is taken account of in the revenue support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord lord mishcon not for the first time that this results in cuts <e> <s> it is transferring the responsibility for providing the funds <e> <s> in the past the fire service college was funded mainly by the home office <e> <s> it will now be funded by local authorities via the revenue support grant <e> <s> the noble lord asks whether funds will be made available <e> <s> i point out that the manner in which local authorities dispose of their funds is up to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say to the noble lord that when the fire authorities and the local authorities have their funds to dispose of as they think fit it is up to those authorities to decide whether or not to send people to the fire service college <e> <s> i hope that prudence and common sense will ensure that they do <e> <s> they have an obligation under the fire services act to ensure that people are properly trained <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that difficulties have been caused for the noble baroness lady birk and indeed the noble lord lord thomson <e> <s> i am the first to apologise for any inconvenience caused <e> <s> inevitably we have been in some difficulties ourselves <e> <s> i wrote to the noble baroness during the recess saying that we were aiming to do all we could to table amendments of substance by th september that any drafting and minor amendments which could not meet that deadline would be tabled as soon as possible thereafter and that there would always be the possibility that further points would crop up during the summer <e> <s> in fact that is what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly believe that the independent television commission should take into account the kind of factors which are set out in the noble baronesss amendment no <e> <s> in determining the shape of the channel map <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a charming intervention by the noble lord and one which is enormously appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran as to the likely power of the itc over intellectual property rights and that intellectual property rights should be preserved <e> <s> i can assure him that the itc has no power to override or constrain private property rights including intellectual property rights under the provisions of clause <e> <s> no such power is given to either the itc or the radio authority under any part of this bill <e> <s> intellectual property rights can only be circumscribed where there is specific statutory provision to do so and there is none in the bill <e> <s> i hope that that assurance will satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord parry is peculiarly persuasive in his arguments <e> <s> i realise that together with a number of other noble lords he feels quite strongly about this <e> <s> perhaps i may explain matters this way <e> <s> the essential structure of the bill is to divide the different types of independent television services by reference to their means of delivery <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would enable the itc to impose licence conditions regulating technical standards for television programme services <e> <s> as my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden explained during the bills committee stage there are in fact strong commercial pressures for broadcasters to achieve high technical standards <e> <s> viewers in this country are used to high picture quality <e> <s> nevertheless we think it is sensible to give the itc power to impose conditions about picture quality coverage and reliability on the licences for the main services channels and <e> <s> clause provides for this <e> <s> in addition it places an analogous duty on the welsh authority in relation to sc <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course look at the matter again <e> <s> the noble baroness said that she wondered whether the government amendment met the point about which she was concerned in committee <e> <s> my understanding is that it does <e> <s> i said that one of the effects of the amendment would be that the restriction would bite in cases of participation where the participant in a licensee had less than a per cent <e> <s> interest but was nevertheless still in control of that licensee because there might be other shareholdings which were widely dispersed <e> <s> it is possible although rare for a person to have a controlling interest even though he has less than per cent <e> <s> the amendments were deemed to cover that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that many of the concerns of noble lords understandably arise because we have changed the system <e> <s> the system was previously based on a single contract which covered more than one frequency <e> <s> it will now be the number of channels rather than the number of licences which count for this purpose <e> <s> six was the limit for a contract which could cover more than one frequency <e> <s> at committee stage the system was changed so that the contract related to one frequency <e> <s> therefore it was considered that the figure of six was too low <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple answer is that it is up to anyone who wishes to bid for a licence <e> <s> i had expected mr murdochs name to arise at some course in discussions today <e> <s> i had not expected it to arise with regard to radio <e> <s> as i understand the position if mr murdoch were so minded to make a bid for a service his bid would be considered along with all the other bids <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may have the leave of the house which i do not wish to abuse because i have spoken for longer than i should have done <e> <s> i shall consider the points that have been made this afternoon <e> <s> i accept that this is a complicated area and i shall consider what has been said <e> <s> however i believe that the noble lords concerns will not prove to be justified <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord annan put his case as he always does particularly graphically and in a very understandable way <e> <s> i do not mind telling him that i have considerable sympathy with the point he put forward <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord birkett was concerned that large companies should not bully small composers <e> <s> that is a fact about which we are all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the point raised by my noble friend lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> it is a fact that the director general of fair trading considered this matter and concluded that there was no such practice which would require it to be referred to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> that is the independent judgment which he made that the practice being carried out was not such as to create a monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am hesitant to rise again because this is not a committee stage <e> <s> i explained the position as best i could to your lordships <e> <s> i can only say that in my view the concerns expressed are met under the powers already given to the itc <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been agreed that the amendments should be spoken to collectively but of course they will be moved separately <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the concerns of both the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth and the noble baroness lady birk are that you should not have contiguous licences being joined up in other words one company getting fat on the proceeds of another <e> <s> that is unlikely to happen <e> <s> the constraints on doing that are very strict <e> <s> i have explained that it would only be done in the first instance where the licensed area itself became unviable <e> <s> in other words if a licensee found the enterprise unviable and was going out of business the people in that area unless something was done would have no television <e> <s> when that happens the itc has to make sure that no other company will be interested in owning the licence either by takeover or by some other further competitive tender process <e>", "<cs> my lords the set of amendments which my noble friend lord stockton introduced deal with an extremely important and highly contentious argument which has surfaced at all stages of the bill <e> <s> we have heard again today the strong views that have been held on all sides <e> <s> one side says that what is happening at the moment produces variety <e> <s> the noble baroness lady blackstone says that this amendment would produce variety <e> <s> it is quite difficult to know how to marry together those two arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that your lordships feel strongly about this matter and i understand why <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness and others for welcoming the move that we have made in our amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will reconsider the word lobbying <e> <s> it was a colloquialism which i used in an endeavour to suggest that the amendment was being used to draw attention to something that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite see the problem that the noble baroness has described <e> <s> i was reluctant to rise to my feet because i was cogitating the request which she made to me as to whether it would be suitable to instruct the itc <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be difficult for me to instruct the itc because i do not think it would be appropriate for a minister to instruct such a commission <e> <s> however i am prepared to invite it to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the last of the questions asked by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a technical matter concerning spare space on lines already allocated which can be used at times of the night <e> <s> i do not profess to be an engineer <e> <s> one has almost to be an engineer to understand these wretched things <e> <s> that is why they could not come under the bill <e> <s> i shall certainly give the noble lord a more detailed and accurate assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords i stated the governments view about the matter when speaking to the earlier amendment with which amendment no <e> <s> is grouped <e> <s> i repeat that i understand the anxiety expressed by the noble lord lord birkett that companies should not bully composers <e> <s> there are some companies which have subsidiaries and others which do not <e> <s> it may well be that it is perfectly fair that people who compose for a company should put those rights through the companys subsidiary <e> <s> if it is fair there is no reason why it should not be done <e> <s> if it is unfair there are provisions in the bill for the independent television commission to correct that <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the desire of the noble earl lord halsbury to make explicit the central role of christianity in religious programmes to be shown on channels and <e> <s> i wholly agree that religious programmes on channels and should maintain the centrality of the christian faith while allowing opportunities for the views of other religious groups to be expressed as my noble friend lord whitelaw said <e> <s> i have no doubt that the independent television commission will see that this policy is implemented in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill provides for channel and channel licences among others to be awarded by the process of competitive tender <e> <s> we believe that that is the fairest and most transparent way of allocating licences for commercial television <e> <s> but we have always accepted that licences for channels and should be awarded not just on the basis of the money bid in the tender but also and most importantly on the basis of the quality of service being offered <e> <s> hence the requirement that applicants for these licenses should first pass a substantial quality threshold before they are eligible to bid <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> seeks to ensure that the body to which a channel licence has been awarded or transferred as well as the independent television commission is content with changes in its licence during the moratorium period before such a change can be approved <e> <s> this is unnecessary <e> <s> it is designed as the noble baroness fairly said to prevent a hostile takeover which the company wished to resist <e> <s> but the approval of the company in this context means the approval of its shareholders and if the majority of those were opposed to a hostile takeover they would presumably not sell their shares <e> <s> if they did they would presumably be content with the prospect of a takeover <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right to say that the chairman designate of the itc has not said that he is against these proposals <e> <s> in fact i said that he was content with the one-year moratorium <e> <s> obviously many people will think that a longer moratorium would be desirable <e> <s> no doubt the noble baroness will recall that originally the government thought it would be inappropriate to have such a moratorium and there were also those who wanted quite long moratoria <e> <s> we went some way in order to meet those concerns which had the approval of the chairman designate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for moving this amendment which as he said has been grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever may be the situation in regard to the programme to which the noble viscount lord hanworth referred i can assure him that the impartiality requirements in this bill already apply to all matters of political or industrial controversy or current public policy whether or not they concern matters at home or abroad <e> <s> therefore in so far as the noble viscount has tabled an amendment seeking to help the bill i can assure him that it is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it might be helpful if i were to intervene at this point not least because the noble lord the chairman of committees said that if your lordships were to approve this amendment he would not be able to call amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in my view that would be a pity <e> <s> for that reason if for none other i hope that your lordships will not approve the amendment of the noble baroness lady birk <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness made her speech and i shall do the best to make mine <e> <s> i shall respond to her intervention because it would be courteous to do so <e> <s> she asked why it was necessary to have the provision and said that it is a restriction <e> <s> i can only repeat what i have said <e> <s> i do not know how i can persuade the noble baroness to this view <e> <s> all this is is a series of subjects which have to be covered <e> <s> it is up to the itc to decide how to cover them <e> <s> it can include more subjects <e> <s> it is up to the itc to decide the ways in which the subjects should be covered and the severity or otherwise with which they should be covered <e> <s> that is the reason that lies behind the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will eventually come round to seeing that that is not a restriction but merely spells out the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that i had been courteous to the house by explaining as soon as possible the areas which we think might be suitable for amendment <e> <s> i hope that if your lordships were to agree to this amendment today we would make the amendments at third reading <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon frowns with concern <e> <s> the route that he suggested is certainly an option <e> <s> it is up to your lordships to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i intervene at this stage <e> <s> in doing so i do not wish to truncate the debate or to prevent any noble lord who wishes to speak from doing so <e> <s> however it may be helpful if i put another thought into the minds of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to move it only in order to reply to the points made by my noble friend lady cox at an earlier stage and to which i was unable to reply because the amendment was withdrawn <e> <s> having made that observation am i now permitted to withdraw the amendment or not move it <e>", "<cs> my lords i also do not wish to move amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that fact <e> <s> however i believe that my noble friend was merely asking a question about procedure <e> <s> unfortunately as a result of the unrest i was unable to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords the two amendments were grouped together for the convenience of the house <e> <s> although discussed at the same time they will be moved separately <e> <s> in the circumstances my noble friend can do as he wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord barnett does not have a great deal of confidence in me but i do not blame him for that <e> <s> i hope not to disappoint him unduly <e> <s> i shall deal first with amendment no <e> <s> which relates to the ombudsman <e> <s> it is important to remember that the itc is the regulator so far as concerns impartiality <e> <s> we must be careful not to confuse the roles by introducing an ombudsman <e> <s> the amendment indicates that a complaint to an ombudsman would not preclude the right to complain to the commission <e> <s> that implies that in some circumstances it would be in order for the ombudsman to investigate the complaint without the itc taking any action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord rea explained why the noble baroness lady masham was not in her place to move her amendment <e> <s> she also explained that to me <e> <s> if she could not attend as a result of a problem caused through eating sweets i rather fancy that she must have had a predilection for eating sweets in their own right because youthful though she may be i believe that commercial television was not available when she was a child <e> <s> therefore she must have indulged in eating sweets despite the lack of televised sweet advertisements <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see what the noble baroness is worried about and i shall do my best to satisfy the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> they are both concerned that channel should have a special character of its own <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for saying that she does not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to give her the satisfaction that she requires about the matter over which she is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boston is very enticing in the way that he puts his case <e> <s> one would expect that from someone who has the advantage of being a queens counsel <e>", "<cs> my lords i also never watch breakfast television but i understand from those who do that party political broadcasts do not operate on breakfast time television <e> <s> the point about the amendment is that the channel licensee might have the option of having only a breakfast time licence <e> <s> therefore it would be quite inappropriate that party political broadcasts should be going out at that time and that there should be an obligation so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i like to hope that all my remarks are encouraging and i shall do my best to be encouraging in this regard as well <e>", "<cs> my lords networking and the making of programmes is an interesting subject <e> <s> i understand the anxieties of my noble friend and the noble lord lord boston about the employment that emanates therefrom <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord thomson said this is a complicated and technical matter <e> <s> it is difficult to explain all the technicalities across the floor of the house <e> <s> i shall do the best that i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not be so cavalier as to say that i had already answered the noble lords points <e> <s> i shall try to give him clarification of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i too shall avoid referring to them <e> <s> i have given the explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply appreciative of the fact that both the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth and the noble lord lord boston of faversham feel that as a government we have helped them listened to them and have brought forward amendments to clarify the position <e> <s> in so far as the noble lord lord boston of faversham was generous enough to pass on his thanks to me i can only say that that is another example of the remark which my father made to me to which i referred earlier that you are blessed with the things that cost you nothing and cursed for the things to which you have given your all <e> <s> i shall see that the thanks which have been passed on go to the correct quarters as i am merely as they say the front man <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may by leave reply <e> <s> i may have misled the noble lord and would therefore prefer to consider what he has said <e> <s> i shall write to him later <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth is basically correct in what he has said <e> <s> he was worried about the continuity <e> <s> as he is aware when the bbc licence comes to an end in there will be the problem of privatisation if there is privatisation of the transmission arrangements <e> <s> a privatised bbc transmission will alter the picture <e> <s> i have no doubt that her majestys government will then want to review the transmission arrangements as a whole <e> <s> obviously one cannot commit ministers whoever they may be that far in the future <e> <s> clearly ministers will continue to have in mind the variation in transmission costs in different parts of the country <e> <s> while i cannot commit my successors they will obviously bear in mind the problems that we have borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes the briefest of comments as to whether his amendment is necessary i tell him that it is not <e> <s> if he wishes i shall be happy to give him an extenuated discourse as to why it is not necessary but i rather fancy that he will take my word for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is trying to pull a quick one at this time of night <e> <s> he wanted me to say something about the blind but my piece of paper is completely empty because i thought that this amendment had been taken with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i feel slightly nonplussed at the moment but perhaps i may consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am pretty certain that the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon would not expect me to agree with his analysis of my right honourable friends speech which i thought was a masterly speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon took up one specific set of figures relating to the last quarter <e> <s> one must be careful about taking one set of figures one should take the annual figures from months ago <e> <s> the percentage increase of violent crime is in fact lower than the percentage increase of all crimes which went up by per cent <e> <s> it is important to remember that much crime can be prevented <e> <s> nine out of crimes are against property <e> <s> car crimes amount to one-quarter of all recorded crime and per cent <e> <s> of all burglaries and all vehicle thefts are through unlocked and insecure doors and windows <e> <s> while i regret greatly the increase in the number of recorded crimes many of them are preventable by the public themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord donaldson puts his finger on a point on which the government at least go some way in agreement <e> <s> the courts will be encouraged to make a sharper distinction between serious and less serious crimes <e> <s> the serious crimes will attract long prison sentences which i believe even the noble lord lord donaldson will approve of with at least half the sentence being spent in custody <e> <s> we believe that punishment in the community is far more suitable for property offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on specific parts of the country other than to say that while these matters have to be reported sometimes people wonder whether the mere reporting of them stimulates action in others <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly look into that point but getting statistics to appear when convenient and moving the dates when statistics appear is perhaps like moving mount sinai <e>", "<cs> my lords in deference to the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn the answer is yes to both noble lords questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is an administrative point but i shall certainly look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords on a technical point the noble baroness lady birk said that she was speaking to amendment no i believe she meant amendment no a i see that the noble baroness signifies assent i join the noble lord lord bonham-carter in his observations about the late lord swann he was a knowledgeable expert on broadcasting matters he contributed considerably to the earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> we shall miss his interventions not only on the bill but on future broadcasting occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his helpful explanation of the way in which this amendment is intended to work and in particular for clarifying the changes which have been made to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that the bill does not refer explicitly to community radio should not lead people to believe that the services have been overlooked the green paper which was published in envisaged community radio as playing a full part in the expansion of radio services which is now beginning to take place <e> <s> we suggested then that there is no need to draw artificial distinctions between local and community services <e> <s> the governments view has always been that that would be harmful and counterproductive <e> <s> that is because there is no reason why it should not be perfectly legitimate for people to propose radio services that combine commercial and community elements <e> <s> in fact there are existing stations which do exactly that <e> <s> in our view there is no need to force them into being either a commercial or a community station and thereby putting them into a straitjacket <e> <s> in any case opinions quite legitimately differ on how the two terms would be defined <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i shall be delighted to discuss this matter with the noble lord who is the shadow chairman of the radio authority but what one discusses in conversation does not necessarily make for good statutory language <e>", "<cs> my lords i must interrupt the noble viscount <e> <s> he is wrong <e> <s> i said thump thump thump <e>", "<cs> thump thump thump my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i knew that we would run into the sands on this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord birkett said that he wished to goodness we did not have to define pop music <e> <s> my noble friend lord selsdon said the same and the noble lord lord jenkins of putney said that he could not understand it <e> <s> frankly we wish that we did not have to define it because we knew the trouble that it would cause <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly do my best to achieve that <e> <s> if i may use a midlands expression i shall have to make haste <e> <s> i shall do my best to see that that is done <e>", "<cs> my lords i always do my best to be as helpful as i can <e> <s> i can give the noble baroness some good news and a little bad news <e> <s> perhaps i may give the bad news first <e> <s> for reasons which i shall try to explain i believe that the good news is rather more significant than the bad news <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this amendment fairly fully with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am disappointed that the noble lord says that he wants to test the opinion of the house <e> <s> however he is perfectly entitled to do so if that is what he wishes <e> <s> we must be perfectly clear what he is doing <e> <s> he is suggesting that the radio authority should appoint a body of people who would work at the taxpayers expense to set up radio stations in places where the demand would not otherwise support a service <e> <s> these stations would operate without fear of competition since they would be securely funded by public money <e> <s> that would not be consistent with the authoritys duty to try to ensure fair and effective competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say in committee that the noble lord was on a fair point <e> <s> i have considered it <e> <s> the amendment would reintroduce a radio cross-subsidy system of a type which has proved unpopular even under the present legislation and which had been consistently opposed by much of the radio industry <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has explained that he wishes to withdraw this amendment and come back with a modified form of words on third reading <e> <s> we have no difficulty with the aim behind the amendment <e> <s> if a technically acceptable revised form of words is tabled on third reading which has the same effect as this amendment i expect that i shall have no difficulty in recommending acceptance of such an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will recall hat we were discussing the contents list which was to go into the itcs code of practice <e> <s> in the general flurry after that debate a number of amendments which were grouped together were not moved <e> <s> those amendments do not refer to the contents list of any code <e> <s> in other words the radio authority will draw up a code but there will not be a contents list such as suggested by the itc <e> <s> therefore amendment no <e> <s> which was withdrawn does not have a bearing on these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that when the noble baroness said that she was also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> she meant to include also amendment no <e> <s> as they are grouped together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord airedale drew some inspiration for the wording of his amendment from what the noble baroness lady birk said in committee although it threw me into confusion and i did not draw the same inspiration from it <e> <s> nor am i quite sure what the noble lords amendment means <e> <s> the concept of original productions is not a familiar one under the bill <e> <s> we all have a vague idea of what it may mean but the radio authority may not find it an easy concept to define in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what my noble friend said <e> <s> i do not deny that there is some force in his argument <e> <s> i know that as he said the radio authority favours this amendment <e> <s> we looked at this matter in some detail when deciding to extend the moratorium to national radio <e> <s> we concluded that the situation for local radio was different and that a moratorium would not be right <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bonham-carter returns to the matter of openness over licences <e> <s> he said that i found the previous amendment attractive and he has ingeniously altered this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs hoped that i would consider the matter in a more positive way <e> <s> i can assure her that i always look <e>", "<cs> my lords i became a little agitated <e> <s> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord with the leave of the house <e> <s> he referred to an applicant who can go to the radio authority and ask why a successful applicant obtained the licence <e> <s> the inference is that he asks why he did not obtain it <e> <s> the noble lord says that he is not talking about those who are unsuccessful <e> <s> but it will be those who are unsuccessful who will be inquiring why they are not successful <e> <s> one cannot make that distinction and pretend that unsuccessful applicants do not come into it <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes the radio authority to give the reason why the successful applicant was successful it could simply state that it was because he was the best applicant <e> <s> that would add nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the shadow radio authority fears that its duty to examine the likely viability of the applicants plans will be an onerous task <e> <s> but i believe that it need not be so <e> <s> there is no reason for them to scrutinise an applicants budget in fine detail using financial forecasts computer predictions or any other elaborate forms of economic modelling <e> <s> all that the bill requires in that respect is that the authority should have regard to an applicants ability to maintain his proposed service for the length of his licence on the basis of the information that the applicant has provided <e> <s> in other words it has to look at the applicants financial position and consider whether his future projections look reasonable <e> <s> this should not be a great burden <e> <s> but it has one of the key aspects mentioned in the green paper for the authoritys role in selecting licensees <e> <s> i believe it would be unwise to dispense with it <e> <s> it is surely the right policy for account to be taken at the licensing stage of whether the proposal looks viable and sustainable <e> <s> if the application is clearly financially unsound it is surely right that it should be weeded out <e> <s> that means that the radio authority will have to sift out the obvious duds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has led me into mild confusion because i had thought that the amendment was dealt with when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we must bear in mind that it is impossible to provide a complete and total coverage by local and independent radio services because the transmitters do not exist <e> <s> if they are to be built or if an imposition is to be put on the radio authority to guarantee a large coverage of various areas the services will never get off the ground <e> <s> we must try to allow them to do so with the facilities that already exist <e> <s> gradually the transmitting facilities will increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am immensely proud of the word licensable <e> <s> as the noble lord lord airedale said it is very much shorter than the words he suggested and if i may say so it is much more explicit than the words he suggested in his earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness and my noble friend raised some important points <e> <s> i accept as the noble baroness said that the iba does not believe the provision to be necessary and would prefer not to see it added to the bill <e> <s> as i said earlier it is well precedented in other privatisation statutes including the airports act the water act and the electricity act <e> <s> we have been careful to circumscribe the provision and there is nothing sinister about it <e> <s> its purpose is simply to ensure that we are in a position to honour our public undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe the noble baroness is wrong to intervene if she does not understand what i said <e> <s> it is an important point <e> <s> she is correct that the rights include the per cent <e> <s> or less whatever the rpi may be <e> <s> that is the right that continues <e> <s> the benefit is anything above per cent <e> <s> that is discretionary <e> <s> it is discretionary at present and such discretion will move over to those people operating in the future <e> <s> the right of up to per cent <e> <s> will be a right which continues <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may make a further intervention <e> <s> it is correct that the sale of the transmission will not require parliamentary approval though ministers may like to inform parliament regarding the way the sale is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to find a meeting point between the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord bonham-carter on the one side and ourselves on the other because they do not like the idea of a broadcasting standards council as they have made clear <e> <s> one sometimes forgets why the council was set up <e> <s> it was set up because there was genuine anxiety about the standards of taste and decency emanating from television <e> <s> the noble lord lord bonham-carter said that that was imposed self-censorship <e> <s> i can only say to him that if the broadcasters conduct themselves in such a way as to create enormous concern throughout the country it is not surprising that the government take some action <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble baroness whether there is scientific evidence but there is sufficient evidence throughout the country for the government to be concerned and to take some action <e> <s> all we are doing is to set up a council which will do no more than monitor <e> <s> if broadcasters broadcast programmes which keep within the reasonable bounds of taste and decency they have nothing to worry about <e>", "<cs> my lords because it is reasonable that any material that is broadcast be it via the bbc or itv should have a common denominator the body that considers whether complaints are justified <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is no concern then nobody has anything to worry about <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the broadcasting standards council and its role in relation to advertising is a matter which has exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to come to that i was going to say in the fullness of time but i hope that it will not be quite as full as that a little later on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord boston was generously nodding his head in dissent <e> <s> however i am quite happy to give credit to both noble lords for having raised the issue <e> <s> of course it is perfectly true <e> <s> if advertisers were obliged to put a note at the bottom of the screen stating that what is shown has offended the broadcasting standards council clearly that would be a fairly strong deterrent <e> <s> i have no doubt that they would ensure that this would not happen <e> <s> moreover according to the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris the standards are so high at present that that would not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson has a vivid imagination over these matters <e> <s> i assure him that the pace act code of practice will apply with the present drafting even if the powers are exercised outside the united kingdom or the united kingdoms territorial waters <e> <s> what is important from the point of view of the applicability of the pace act code is where the proceedings take place and not where the enforcement powers are exercised <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will be content with that explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to give the noble lord more reassurance <e> <s> i said that the pace act code of practice will apply with the present drafting even if the powers are exercised outside the united kingdom or the united kingdoms territorial waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell my noble friend that the amendment is both irrelevant to the broadcasting bill and unnecessary in copyright legislation <e> <s> the amendment is concerned with the definition of broadcast for the purposes of copyright legislation and not this bill <e> <s> i do not think it would be appropriate to amend copyright legislation here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friends lord jenkin and lord colwyn and the noble lord <e> <s> lord birkett felt reassured by much that i said <e> <s> i daresay that some of your lordships who are not deeply familiar with the intricacies of the subject matter which we are now considering might have obtained an equally clear understanding of the debate had it been conducted in ancient greek <e> <s> i accept that this is a complicated matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord clinton-davis castigated me slightly when he said that was the fault of the government because the amendments had been tabled late and there had been no consultation <e> <s> throughout the whole of the bill we have tried to consult as much as possible <e> <s> we have tried to take into account all the criticisms that have been made and i think most noble lords would agree that we have amended the bill substantially to take account of those criticisms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not familiar with those details nor am i familiar with the fact that attempts were made to speak with ministers but the ministers did not make themselves available for meetings <e> <s> so far as i know no one tried to contact me <e> <s> had they done so i would have been content to meet them <e> <s> i realise that a noble lord is trying to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should say that i am grateful to my noble friend for refreshing my memory of that incident <e> <s> those comments serve to refresh my memory further <e> <s> i recall that i also had meetings with my noble friend lord colwyn and others whose names i cannot recall <e> <s> however there were a number of them <e> <s> the noble lord lord clinton-davis was not among them <e> <s> however if he is being fair he will accept that he did not ask to see me about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that when we first saw the amendment we could see little connection with broadcasting or the subject matter of the bill <e> <s> the noble lords revision of the amendment has made it more relevant to the bill but i am afraid that it has not made it one that i can accept <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last paragraph i said that i hoped that what i had said was sufficient to satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as for the penultimate paragraph i shall try to use the same words but as i spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which my noble friend has moved is connected with amendments nos <e> <s> to a and <e> <s> my amendments nos <e> <s> and modify the table in clause to cover the interim period <e> <s> the other amendments to clause are essentially drafting improvements <e> <s> my amendment to schedule removes paragraph b of that schedule which gave the copyright tribunal power to award costs against a listings publisher who had set a less than reasonable figure for payment of the broadcaster <e> <s> its removal ensures that both publisher and broadcaster can be treated equally by the copyright tribunal in terms of cost <e>", "<cs> my lords you have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord peston felt so needled by the government as regards this amendment <e> <s> he was clearly distressed about it and distressed that as he said the government had not met their commitment <e> <s> my noble friend lord sanderson gave an undertaking that he would be prepared to consider this matter with the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston said that we on this side of the house had time to meet noble friends on these benches and not noble lords opposite <e> <s> i believe that he was being rather ungenerous over that <e> <s> i do not need to tell him the basis of lobbying <e> <s> if a minister gives an undertaking that he will see a noble lord and that undertaking can be given at a number of stages throughout the bill the onus is on the person to whom the undertaking is given to telephone and say that an undertaking has been given and that he wishes to see the noble lord concerned <e> <s> i am not aware that the noble lord lord peston asked to see me or my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing i wish to do is to impugn the noble lords honour <e> <s> i was merely making the point that i understood the noble lord to be saying that we had not undertaken what we had agreed to do <e> <s> however the noble lord lord willis complained that this is a late hour at which to take this amendment <e> <s> it is true that it is late <e> <s> he then said that that is the governments fault <e> <s> i do not wish to argue about this but i should point out that we had hoped to reach clause by the end of last thursdays debate and it was suggested by the benches opposite through the usual channels that we should go only to the end of clause <e> <s> we accepted that and therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked why we cannot go back to what we thought was the position <e> <s> i am saying that if one changes the law it has implications that one does not necessarily want it affects other people <e> <s> that is why i suggested that the matter is not quite that simple <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we take note of such observations <e> <s> the trouble is that views are held with a certain amount of keenness on both sides of the argument <e> <s> because of the strong feelings expressed against the idea in scotland and other places the government do not consider there is sufficient support as yet for an immediate change from the present system <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take note i have taken note <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one of those situations where one will never do the right thing <e> <s> a good many people are in favour of change and a good many people as has been expressed today are against it <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be one of the reasons but i should not have thought that it was the most important reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite see the connection between the erm and summer time <e> <s> i can only tell my noble friend that road safety is one of the many aspects that have to be considered in the light of possible change <e> <s> i quite agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords that is if i might say so another example of rare scottish wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so without being in any way patronising the speech made by the noble lord lord chalfont to which we have just listened was masterly in its presentation in its conclusions and in its brevity <e> <s> indeed it said everything <e> <s> we have had an exceedingly interesting debate this afternoon during which the sole issue has been the method by which we achieve impartiality <e> <s> we are all concerned to try to achieve that aim in the best possible way <e>", "<cs> my lords certain people can be advertisers they can purchase advertising or sell advertising <e> <s> the point is to get the right people <e> <s> for instance the rank organisation has argued that it could be held on analysis to be an advertising agent in connection with the provision of advertising space for cinema advertising <e> <s> the organisation argues that this should not prevent it from becoming a licensee <e> <s> the bill precludes any person who is defined as being an advertising agent from having a controlling interest or an interest of more than per cent <e> <s> in an itv licence <e> <s> the definition of advertising agent in subsection refers to subsection it should refer to subsection <e> <s> this is a printing error which will be amended in due course <e> <s> it does not need a formal amendment to make the change <e> <s> i hope that that clarifies the point <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may respond to that <e> <s> provided the rank organisation engages only in selling advertising space it would not come within the definition of the bill <e> <s> however if the rank organisation were to act as an advertising agent purchasing space in cinemas for persons wishing to advertise it would be caught by the provision in clause <e> <s> it would be right and we have felt it appropriate to prevent advertising agencies from holding a stake of more than per cent <e> <s> in any licensee because of the possible conflict of interests between the provision of the service and representing person who wish to advertise no matter in which media he might purchase space <e> <s> the close tie with the advertisers could result in a conflict of interest even though the advertising agent was not purchasing space on the broadcasting services <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords opposite are enormously persuasive <e> <s> however i shall try to explain the governments view to them <e> <s> our proposals for networking envisage that programmes will be commissioned for the network on the basis of value for money <e> <s> therefore there will no longer be any need for guaranteed quotas <e> <s> that is the underlying philosophy but i gather that in the past some itv contractors have found it difficult to obtain access to the network because of the quota arrangements which have been a feature of the network system up to now <e> <s> the new network arrangements should open up access to the network which will enable all licensees who choose to do so to offer programmes to the network and to have them considered on the basis of value for money <e> <s> i see no reason why all channel licensees should not benefit from that arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we have to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may intervene because i believe that the noble lord has unusually got out of cog <e> <s> we were speaking to amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord lord thomson was going to

what i said to the noble lord was that my officials were informed formally at four oclock on friday <e> <s> i understand that my right honourable friend the prime minister had a conversation about a number of matters with mr murdoch earlier that he said that the companies were in difficulties and that the possibility of a merger was in the offing <e> <s> but that was only a matter of informative

minister <e> <s> she never said anything about a blessing <e> <s> she was informed as a matter of conversation that the two companies were in difficulty <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness is mistaken <e> <s> it shows what a highly speculative business satellite broadcasting is and if as the noble baroness states it will result in less choice it would have resulted in even less choice had both companies gone bust <e> <s> i am bound to point out to her that schedule to the broadcasting act permits the existing dbs contracts to be replaced by a licence in <e> <s> the broadcasting act does not affect that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness can read what she likes into newspaper reports but i doubt whether the reporters were present at the conversation <e> <s> i was not and therefore i cannot comment on that issue <e> <s> the merger took place under the auspices of the broadcasting act and not the broadcasting act and therefore the companies were entitled to do what they did <e> <s> the act will begin to bite only in <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first of the noble lords questions is no and the answer to his second question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the subject arose during the course of a conversation about a number of matters <e> <s> when officially there was a likelihood of a merger sky television got in touch with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments with which i agree <e> <s> it is important to remember that the venture was highly speculative and that both companies were running into trouble <e> <s> if both companies had been allowed to go bust there would have been a loss of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy is mistaken <e> <s> perhaps i may explain the matter as succinctly as possible <e> <s> at present the two companies are contractors to the independent broadcasting authority <e> <s> under the broadcasting act they are permitted to merge provided that they have the approval of the iba <e> <s> that issue is governed by questions such as whether the company should be controlled by another company based outside the european community and whether there should be newspaper interests which have had or will lead to results that could be contrary to the public interest <e> <s> that is what the iba must decide and what it is now deciding <e> <s> the fact that the broadcasting bill has gone through parliament does not affect this merger at this time but it will when the company becomes a licensee in <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to that extraordinary unparliamentary guffawing noise from the opposition i can say only that the observation made by my noble and learned friend particularly the latter part was extremely apposite <e> <s> it would be bad to fish in troubled waters not that the waters are particularly troubled for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the iba is considering this matter as is the office of fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords the government framed the legislation particularly to deal with domestic satellite broadcasting which has five frequencies which are internationally allocated to the united kingdom and non-domestic satellite services which are totally different and which can number up to or even different services <e> <s> in the broadcasting act the government sought to set the scene aright so that those companies which wished to participate could do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the information of which i was not in possession <e> <s> i am unable to tell him of the cost <e> <s> my noble friend asks when the government will summon up sufficient courage <e> <s> i remind him of a fact that may have temporarily escaped his notice <e> <s> in we summoned up enough courage to produce a bill <e> <s> it was passed by your lordships but thrown out by another place <e> <s> quite frankly until another place is prepared to accept proposals it is unlikely that the government of the day will produce them <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest to my noble friend that rather than having a go at the government his efforts would be better directed towards persuading his friends in another place to reach agreement so that when a bill is introduced they pass it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for the government to enforce the law but the courts <e> <s> as far as i know the courts do their best to enforce the law as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting statistic but i am not sure what one draws from it <e> <s> however i am now aware of the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords it is surprising how with a little persistence peoples characters change during their lives <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will find his character changing and will discover that he has more power over those in another place than at present he suspects <e>", "<cs> my lords the magistrates job would be to carry out the law as it stands <e> <s> as the noble lord asked a hypothetical question i do not propose to give an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the courts to interpret the law as it stands <e> <s> it is a matter for the european court to decide its judgment <e> <s> whatever the law its enforcement is a matter for local authorities <e> <s> it is for them to decide how best to discharge their duties under section of the shops act <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true <e> <s> under article any court can seek further clarification from the european court in interpreting the treaty of rome <e> <s> of course the courts did so and to paraphrase the european court stated that the united kingdom law is not necessarily in breach of the treaty of rome <e> <s> it depends on particular circumstances whether there is a socio-economic justification for a law which would reasonably permit a reduction in imports in consequence <e> <s> the european court states that it is for the local courts to determine in each case <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked whether the information would be of help <e> <s> i can tell him that anything would be of help <e> <s> i am grateful to him for having produced that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think so <e> <s> company law requires that political contributions in excess of in any financial year must be mentioned in a companys annual report together with a note of the recipients <e> <s> the law does not define political parties and as such they are not recognised by electoral law only the candidates are recognised <e> <s> if parties are in receipt of gifts which are freely given i do not see that there is any reason to say where the gifts have come from <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think so at all <e> <s> people can buy shares in whatever companies they choose and they can remove their shareholdings <e> <s> if one is a member of a trade union one can remain a member of it and pay the funds irrespective of where they go <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting question indeed <e> <s> i do not think that i shall venture into that quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords the answers are no no and no to all three questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand the noble lord lord bonham-carter and not for the first time <e> <s> he said that i have not answered the questions straightforwardly <e> <s> i answered the last three questions with a no no and no <e> <s> i do not think that anyone can be more straightforward than that <e> <s> however coming to the substance of the question asked by the noble lord lord bonham-carter the answer to that is no too <e>", "<cs> my lords in deference to the noble lord lord bonham-carter the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord monkswell for having acknowledged that over the past years individual wealth has increased <e> <s> that is a very good reason why companies should give donations to the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords if noble lords wish to have a debate on this subject it is for your lordships to arrange it through the usual channels <e> <s> the position is absolutely crystal clear <e> <s> those companies which give over to a political party are obliged to say so <e> <s> any individual who wishes to give of his own money can do so quite freely <e> <s> there is no reason why these donations should be declared by a political party of any kind for the very good reason that political parties are not described or prescribed in law <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> money is one thing but actual work and dedication is another <e> <s> both of those factors are very important <e> <s> the party of which i am a member is very good at both <e>", "<cs> my lords if an individual does not like the way in which his company is dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked me a question <e> <s> if the noble lord lord molloy wishes to answer it he had better come to this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be an example but there is no reason to change the law <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely correct <e> <s> once one goes down that path the matter becomes extremely complicated <e> <s> it could be impractical to require political parties to declare all their sources of funding which include large numbers of small individual donations <e> <s> as my noble friend said one also becomes involved with paid employees as well <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly crime has increased and that is regrettable <e> <s> however i remind the noble lord lord molloy that the strength of the metropolitan police increased from to between and <e> <s> whereas million was spent on the metropolitan police in the figure has now risen to million <e> <s> seven hundred additional officers have been allocated to the police service as a whole in <e> <s> a decision as to the allocation between forces will be made before the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend i agree entirely with what he says <e> <s> for the police to operate properly they must receive the constructive help of the locality <e> <s> much has been done for example with neighbourhood watch schemes in order to encourage people to take part in the protection of their locality and to help the police <e>", "<cs> my lords members of the ethnic minorities were members of the metropolitan police on st october this year <e> <s> during the year officers were recruited from the ethnic minority communities <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble baroness how many were women either of those or of the non-ethnic minority recruits <e>", "<cs> my lords that was an astonishingly barbed question in a number of ways <e> <s> i gave the figures for because i thought that would be helpful and that was the period for which the present government were responsible <e> <s> i did not draw attention particularly to the rate which then operated <e> <s> the figures i gave were in money terms but there has been a per cent <e> <s> increase in real terms in the money spent on the police <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that nowadays policing tends to involve a lot of office work <e> <s> consequently the metropolitan police have been authorised to employ staff in order to release on to the streets those officers who are necessarily employed on work inside buildings <e> <s> they are authorised to employ staff but the civilian strength is <e> <s> however the general point that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that information without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the experience of most people as regards royal commissions is that they sit for a long time and they digest for a long time <e> <s> that may not be the best way to produce a solution to a matter that is of relative immediate importance <e> <s> the structure of policing is of course an important matter and it is being considered at present <e> <s> however i do not believe that a royal commission is the right way to tackle that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is any racial prejudice within the metropolitan police obviously from time to time there will be cases of racism it is a specific offence under the police discipline code and it is punishable with punishments ranging from caution to dismissal from the force <e> <s> certainly a number of officers from ethnic minorities were recruited <e> <s> the noble lord lord richard is right to say that some of them left <e> <s> the commissioner is committed to establishing a workforce which is more representative of the population of london <e> <s> in order to facilitate this process various steps have been taken such as the abolition of the minimum height requirement <e> <s> i am sure that will please the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> there is a pre-employment course for those promising candidates who nevertheless fail the police initial recruitment test <e> <s> a special research study is being conducted into why members of ethnic minorities do <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord how many officers have been affected by the sanctions as there are various disciplinary charges which cover racially discriminatory behaviour such as discreditable conduct <e> <s> however those offences do not require proof of racial motivation and therefore it is difficult to give an answer in terms of the number of people who have been convicted of offences which are racially motivated as such offences come under another heading <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true and that is why i said that the civilian quota allowed for over people <e> <s> it is important that those jobs which can be done by people other than highly trained policemen should be done by civilians <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the lowering of the height requirement because i believed it was of interest as some members of the ethnic minorities are smaller than some english men <e> <s> however if the noble lord lord molloy had wished to enter the metropolitan police force i can assure him that he would have had to surmount other hurdles too <e> <s> i say with the greatest respect to the noble lord that those other hurdles might not have been quite so easy to overcome <e> <s> as regards those who are capable of achieving the middle and higher ranks of the police force i should say that there is a higher proportion of graduates in the police force now than ever before <e> <s> i believe i am correct in saying that there are more graduates in the police force than in the army the navy and the air force combined <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like to interrupt the noble lord but we have been eight minutes on the first question <e> <s> after he has put his question perhaps we might move on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships
