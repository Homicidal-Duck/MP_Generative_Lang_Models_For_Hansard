first matter is in relation to the question of the cost of making up a road <e>", "<cs> my lords my response to that must be this <e> <s> in the kind of situation which has been postulated by the noble lord some construction has already taken place within the period afforded for the construction of the road <e> <s> as noble lords will understand the bond itself is for the full cost of the road

to the railways clauses consolidation scotland act and in particular section with which of course the noble lord will be familiar <e> <s> i understand that that defines separate minimum arch

<e> <s> it seemed to me that the noble and learned lord immediately opposite lord mccluskey fixed really upon only one particular clause in the bill as indicting the whole of it <e> <s> with respect to him i accept the train of his remarks generally as being a welcome to the remaining portions with the exception of that relating to criminal offences <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i took note of what the noble and learned lord said on this matter and i certainly will undertake to have a further look at it in the light of the remarks that he has made <e> <s> i hope that i have dealt with the various points that have been raised and in conclusion i would simply once again make clear my thanks and i think quite clearly the thanks of your lordships house to the scotish law commission for this very fine exercise in attempting to bring up to date the law of bankruptcy administration in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lords opposite for <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has stated these are amendments to a title of an official the interim trustee who appears in certain provisions of the bill <e> <s> i would suggest to your lordships that the expression interim trustee is the more appropriate expression in the circumstances <e> <s> it describes the person who is appointed by the court on the debtors estate to exercise the general functions described in clause pending the appointment of a permanent trustee <e> <s> i would add that it is a title selected by the scottish law commission when the bill was initially drafted by it <e>", "<cs> i am happy to assure the noble and learned lord that as regards subsection the intention is that a permanent trustee shall simply have regard to advice in the sense that he will consider it and will not be bound by it <e> <s> as regards subsection in a sense that is included in order to make quite clear that the report made under subsection shall be absolutely privileged if that is not already the case <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for drawing attention to this matter <e>", "<cs> i am now happily in a position to answer the noble and learned lord on this matter <e> <s> advice was taken from the public bill office and i understand that in these circumstances the form of words which appears in subsection is one which has received imprimatur and accordingly is printed for your lordships <e>", "<cs> i of course take note of what both the noble and learned lords opposite have said about making an exception in this case in the award of sequestration but there are sound reasons for such an exception not to be made <e> <s> i would draw the noble lords attention to the arguments which were adduced by the scottish law commission in paragraphs and of their report on this very matter <e> <s> it is pertinent to observe that they gave very detailed consideration to this very question and indeed to the arguments which are directed precisely there against what has been sought to be introduced by this amendment <e>", "<cs> i think sometimes special pleading and hard cases lead to bad law <e> <s> what the noble and learned lord opposite perhaps has forgotten is that of course there are other ways in which a person in the position in which he suggests persons may find themselves can deal with a matter of this kind by discussion with creditors <e> <s> of course as i said on the occasion of the second reading the questions of voluntary agreements are always open to a debtor in these matters <e>", "<cs> the purpose of subsection is to provide that there should be no delay in any appointment and to prevent trustees on the list of interim trustees from picking and choosing the sequestrations in which they wish to act <e> <s> there is of course provision that under clause the interim trustee may resign office <e> <s> that would seem to deal with the particular difficulty which the noble and learned lord opposite raised <e> <s> i should say that it is envisaged that in practice guidance is likely to be issued to sheriff clerks suggesting that prior to the award of a sequestration they should take informal soundings of a particular trustee as to the availability to act <e> <s> i think the noble and learned lord opposite suggested illness but one can envisage for instance a person being away on holiday <e> <s> it seems to me that a practice of that kind would really deal with the situation which he envisages <e>", "<cs> so far as the official receiver is concerned this is not a matter to which i can give a ready answer but if the noble and learned lord opposite wishes a response on that matter i should be quite happy to write to him <e>", "<cs> this subsection is derived as i think the noble and learned lord opposite is well aware from the scottish law commission bill <e> <s> the intention is to deal with the position where there is or is the likelihood of what is known as acquirenda that is to say assets that may become available to the estate after sequestration has taken place <e> <s> the problem in the amendment as i see it is that the words which are sought to be substituted have the effect of restricting the duty imposed upon the debtor to notify his sequestration to certain other persons and to do it in a way which i suggest is undesirable <e>", "<cs> this clause derives from a recommendation of the scottish law commission i refer in particular to paragraph <e> <s> the reasons for retaining the jurisdiction of the court of session as noble and learned lords opposite will know it had and has presently exclusive jurisdiction in such petitions for recall is that the scottish law commission considered that it remained the appropriate forum because although the petition for recall is not strictly speaking an appeal it will very often call into question the basis of the original award <e> <s> so it appeared to the scottish law commission and it is a point with which i am bound to say i am sympathetic that a petition for recall may effectively be an appeal <e>", "<cs> the bill was drafted on the basis that there was no need to confer upon either the interim or the permanent trustee an express power to appoint or remunerate a solicitor <e> <s> indeed as the noble and learned lord opposite will be aware there are subsequent clauses which imply that both the interim and the permanent trustee have this power <e>", "<cs> the intention of the subsection which the noble and learned lord seeks to <e>", "<cs> obviously in view of what i said just now i undertake to look at this among other matters and in particular to take aboard the points which the noble and learned lord has made <e>", "<cs> i am sure that if the noble and learned lord opposite were appearing for a creditor in the position which he has envisaged namely having been proved to have produced a statement of account which was false and then went on to show that it was a computer mistake he would be quick to fix upon the words <e>", "<cs> clause la read with paragraph of schedule alters the existing law under which a trustee may be removed only by a majority in number and value of the creditors <e> <s> the new proposal is that the trustee shall be removable simply by a majority in value of the creditors <e> <s> i trust that provides the answer which my noble and learned friend seeks <e>", "<cs> i strongly oppose this amendment and at the start may i underline again that the principle of crown preference is one that has been long established indeed the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> accepted that and is fundamental to the policy of revenue collection that has been pursued by different governments over the past years or more <e> <s> therefore it is something that is well known to all those who are creditors or potential creditors in the ordinary commercial case <e> <s> so far as scotland is concerned the preferences for crown debts became established during the th century and were brought together in the preferential payments in bankruptcy act just under years ago <e> <s> more recently they were brought together and restated in the predecessor to the present bill the bankruptcy act which gave the crown preference for <e>", "<cs> i recognise the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i can make clear to the committee the reason why there has been a change made from what was proposed by the scottish law commission so far as automatic discharge of a debtor is concerned <e>", "<cs> i think i have already indicated that i am prepared to look at all the questions of offences and penalties <e> <s> obviously i will take into account what has been said by the noble and learned lord opposite so far as this matter is concerned also <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should simply say that obviously i have listened to what the noble and learned lord opposite has said <e> <s> i should just make this comment so that it is set out clearly that the effect of limiting the jurisdiction for indictment to a sheriff court would inevitably bring the matter of imprisonment down to a term not exceeding two years <e> <s> i wish to make it quite clear as i did at second reading that there may well be certain offences which would justify a term of imprisonment exceeding that but this will have to be looked at in the general question of harmonisation of the law affecting insolvency both north and south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment conflicts with the views of the scottish law commission views which i may say the government share <e> <s> in their report the commission made clear that they considered that a persons earning capacity should be taken into account as well as his resources <e> <s> these would include for instance his actual earnings <e> <s> the commissions view was that earning capacity in the sense of a persons potential to earn money having regard of course to factors such as age health and previous experience as well as the availability of suitable employment or the need to care for children was a factor of some importance in the quantification of aliment <e> <s> this must be of particular relevance where it concerns the capacity of the alimentary creditor to support himself or herself <e> <s> it is surely reasonable when someone claims aliment that his or her ability to support himself or herself should be considered <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord wilson has in a sense compressed all that i was going to say <e> <s> it seems that the amendment by introducing an arbitrary period of limitation and thereby preventing persons claiming aliment where an obligation of aliment under clause l still subsists may produce injustice <e> <s> i would suggest that there is really no justification or necessity for a limitation of this nature <e> <s> i take the years as simply being a suggestion by the noble and learned lord opposite <e> <s> on the contrary the introduction of any such rule of limitation may have very undesirable consequences <e> <s> for example an economically weaker spouse who had entered into such an agreement would be penalised if she delayed longer than whatever might be the particular period suggested before seeking to vary the terms of agreement in court <e>", "<cs> i think it is proper to see these words in the general context of the bill <e> <s> your lordships will have observed that in clause there is provision for a decree granted for aliment to <e>", "<cs> this is a deliberate adjustment in the proposal that was made by the scottish law commission <e> <s> indeed i think the noble and learned lord opposite has indicated that the word serious does have some different connotation from the word grave <e> <s> i might have been seriously upset by some of the criticisms that the noble and learned lord made this afternoon but i trust i have not been gravely injured by them <e>", "<cs> these provisions are really following the recommendations of the scottish law commission who looked at this matter in detail <e> <s> they came to the conclusion in relation to what i might call the five principles which are set out in clause that conduct could be said to be relevant to them in different ways <e> <s> they took the view in relation to the first three that the question of the effect of conduct upon financial resources might be relevant <e> <s> but they recognised that different considerations could apply to conduct in relation to paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i should say that the present draft of the bill has been reached after consultations with the scottish law commission and it seeks to provide a more logical relationship between the provisions of this clause which of course relate to the circumstances in which the court may make an order for periodical allowance and the principles in clause to which these provisions apply <e> <s> i think that the noble and learned lord opposite will agree that the original subsection which is in the law commissions draft bill refers to the principles set out in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords according to its side note the proposed new clause i am sure unintentionally appears as a saving for the crown but it is nothing of the kind <e> <s> it curtails the crowns rights to set off in ways which i suggest are undesirable <e> <s> perhaps i may look at each of the paragraphs of the proposed new clause in turn <e>", "<cs> my lords this ground has in part been traversed already in our consideration of the bill in this house both at second reading and in committee <e> <s> indeed there is little i wish to add to what i have already said on this side of the house about the matter <e> <s> these amendments seek only to abolish the crown preference for assessed taxes and from what the noble lord opposite has said they accept the case for retaining crown preference for those taxes and duties which are collected by the debtor as agent for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the blandishments of the noble lord opposite i cannot commend these amendments to your lordships <e> <s> the preference period of months was originally introduced for assessed taxes <e> <s> when paye was introduced under the finance act it was then decided that the preference should similarly be restricted to the -month period in the interests of treating assessed and non-assessed taxes alike <e> <s> at that time i suppose the question might have been asked whether given the nature of paye it was right to restrict the crowns preference at all <e> <s> as i previously mentioned we are here speaking of money which does not and indeed never did belong to the employer and the noble lord lord ross has this afternoon accepted that that constitutes a distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps at this stage i might beg to move the privilege amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> perhaps i should simply say that i think as the noble lord has already suggested it is a printing error and will be corrected <e> <s> i am much obliged to the noble lord for having drawn it to the attention of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside for what they have said in recognising that this is an important piece of social legislation and indeed as the noble lord indicated based upon two reports of the scottish law commission <e> <s> i should like to endorse his views about the commissions recommendations which have given birth to this bill and again state my appreciation and that of the government to the commission for its most careful and most valuable study <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord selkirk for proposing this amendment <e> <s> it goes along with manuscript amendment no a which your lordships have dealt with recently <e> <s> perhaps i should simply repeat quickly what i said in relation to that amendment <e> <s> i am happy with the principle but would wish to consider the form of words suitable <e> <s> on the undertaking that these two matters will be covered in any appropriate amendment to be produced perhaps my noble friend will be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have obviously listened with great care to what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has said <e> <s> i certainly accept that when dealing with the bankruptcy scotland bill in your lordships house the government accepted arguments which bear a close similarity to those which the noble lord has just put forward <e> <s> indeed those arguments were presented during consultations on the draft bill attached to the scottish law commissions report <e>", "<cs> i take the point which my noble friend has made <e> <s> i believe that the phrase statement of affairs is one well known in the company world <e> <s> indeed it is a phrase that occurs in the corresponding english provision <e> <s> i would be loath to suggest when i am proposing in this part of the bill to bring receivership in scotland and england into line to have any divergence even on a matter of nomenclature <e> <s> with that explanation i hope that my noble friend will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> i should say at the very outset that i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for having brought this matter to the attention of the committee <e> <s> i trust that he will not think me ungrateful if i say that i should not like at this particular juncture to accept the amendment as it presently stands <e> <s> i take his point about the reference to occupations and it may be that the words and addresses is a perfectly suitable alternative <e> <s> i shall simply advise my noble friend that i shall look at this point and probably secure a competely different form of words which again will harmonise generally with what appears throughout the bill <e> <s> with that assurance perhaps my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i take up the last point made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it may <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i may have to disappoint noble lords who have spoken on this matter <e> <s> as the noble lord opposite has reminded the committee this is the third time if not the fourth we have debated this matter tonight <e> <s> on the last three occasions my noble friend lord lucas undertook to look at the matter again <e> <s> i would simply say that as regards scotland i fully endorse that aspect so far as the role of such a committee in scotland is concerned <e>", "<cs> i think that i can simply say like my noble friend lord lucas that this is a matter at which we shall look very carefully in the light of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i would simply say this <e> <s> the government feel that a limit of days is too small to make it feasible in all cases to summon the meetings which are referred to in this clause <e> <s> i should like to consider this matter again <e> <s> it seems desirable to retain a degree of flexibility <e> <s> i would simply ask the noble lord whether he will withdraw the amendment on the undertaking that this will be looked at again and if it is thought appropriate amendments might be brought forward <e>", "<cs> i assure my noble friend that that is in fact the intention <e> <s> i should say that the words to which he has called attention reflect the phraseology which is found in clause in the provisions applying to england <e> <s> i think that these are covered by the discussion that we had at an earlier stage of this debate on the whole matter of and i use the term again loosely the supervisory committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for speaking to this amendment <e> <s> that enables me to assure him that there is nothing in any sense suspicious about the terms of the schedule in this particular <e> <s> all that paragraph is intended to do is to simplify the wording of but not to alter the effect of subsection of clause of the companies bill <e> <s> i should say that what this amendment would achieve would be merely to restore that subsection in its original words but as i say the paragraph is intended to simplify the wording <e> <s> with that assurance i suggest that my noble friend might wish to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene at this stage for the convenience of the committee in order to set out the governments <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> that is the paragraph to which i specifically referred because it is covered by this amendment <e> <s> i should prefer to hear argument and debate upon this matter <e> <s> of course i accept that it is covered by the extent of the present amendment <e> <s> i am not closed in mind on this matter <e> <s> no i am reminded from another quarter that the concession which i made in regard to paragraph of schedule can also comprise paragraph of schedule which extends to local rates <e>", "<cs> i must disappoint your lordships and perhaps it should not surprise your lordships that i do so because i cannot accept this new clause for reasons similar to those which i set out in connection with a similar amendment proposed to the bankruptcy scotland bill <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to suggest that concepts of scots law should be rejected in this committee indeed in this house <e> <s> but i have to tell my noble friend that these words occurred in the act of the scottish parliament an act which it is proposed to repeal in schedule of the bankruptcy scotland bill which has just passed through this house <e> <s> in its place the word associate is introduced <e>", "<cs> i have listened to both my noble friend and to the noble lord lord wilson of langside <e> <s> all i

bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord opposite for the kind words that have fallen from him <e> <s> as i think was previously said by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in the course of the passage of this bill through this house this bill will have important implications particularly for many elderly persons in the country <e> <s> it will make a useful contribution to the way in which people arrange their affairs by enabling them by a relatively simple and cheap means to provide for the administration of their estates when they themselves are no longer able to do so <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as i have explained there is to be a new clause which will incorporate the old section of the companies act <e> <s> it is that to which attention is directed here <e> <s> in the new clause there will then be a reference to schedule to this bill which will contain the list of debts to which preference attaches <e>", "<cs> my lords i was certainly grateful to my noble friend for having raised this matter in committee <e> <s> my response to him must <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave perhaps i may explain that

the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i might deal with the two points that have been raised <e> <s> first in response to the noble and learned lord lord denning i think that i spoke to this in that when explaining amendment no <e> <s> i said that the intention is to deal with preferential debts both in the context of bankruptcy and of company insolvency within this bill and not to have it spread over the companies act and this bill <e> <s> for that reason i simply limited the amendments to which i spoke when introducing amendment no <e> <s> to the three of which this is the third <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously grateful to my noble friends who have spoken on this which is undoubtedly a highly technical matter <e> <s> the clause applies both in scotland and also in england and wales <e> <s> the purpose of it is to make in corporate insolvency an equivalent provision for that which presently obtains regarding liens in an english bankruptcy <e> <s> noble lords will understand what i said earlier this evening <e> <s> the idea is to harmonise the law on bankruptcy and corporate insolvency <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave perhaps i should answer simply to say that as i think i explained in what i said at the outset there is a division made in the use of resolutions of the house by virtue of the importance or lesser importance of the limits in the places where they occur <e> <s> the matter of the limits which are presently prescribed in the rules is of course being brought back to be dealt with by the secretary of state under an order made by statutory instrument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to those noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> the noble lord opposite said i had

matter <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend lord mottistone feels that it is appropriate in the light of <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the point was that a scots peer made bankrupt could

made reference to the recently published report by her majestys chief inspector of prisons <e> <s> that report emphasised that the regimes at glenochil were positive and purposeful <e> <s> indeed the report found no evidence of an oppressive regime in either part of the institution <e> <s> the inspector emphasised in the report that he found morale among inmates to be high <e>", "<cs> my lords i endeavoured to do so <e> <s> obviously any fatal accident inquiry must be properly prepared beforehand and no one will know that better than the noble and learned lord lord wilson expecially with his experience in these matters <e> <s> i am simply saying that i shall take steps to ensure that an inquiry is held with the appropriate information as soon as may reasonably he done <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am very grateful for the points raised by the noble lord and perhaps i may deal with them in reverse order to that in which he put them to me <e> <s> obviously i can do no more than repeat my assurance to the house about the holding of an inquiry <e> <s> so far as publication of any working party report is concerned that must be a matter for my right honourable friend and i can go no further than that before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot today give that information to the noble lord <e> <s> however i shall find out and let him know the answer <e> <s> as my right honourable friend stated in his answer the boy was due to appear at aberdeen sheriff court on th may to face further charges <e> <s> he was informed of these further charges on th april <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i am grateful for what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i think i can say simply that as i indicated earlier in the matter of sentencing to detention a person under the law provides that the court will not impose such a sentence unless it is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with the offender is appropriate <e> <s> in the forming of that opinion as i have also indicated a social inquiry report is obtained in order to place before the court the full information about the offender <e> <s> i think that that would seem to be the appropriate manner in which that information should be brought to the attention of the court <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i have taken note of what my noble friend has said on the matter <e> <s> i have no reason to think other than that staff will always be aware of changing circumstances in relation to a particular inmate and that they will make their dispositions accordingly <e> <s> however i think that all i should say is that these might be matters which will be the subject of investigation at the public inquiry which will be held in due course <e> <s> it would be wrong of me to say anything further on the matter with which this answer is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken on this matter <e> <s> it is ground with which we have become increasingly familiar and perhaps in some sense i can claim greater familiarity with it because i have spoken on it on two previous occasions when we were discussing the bankruptcy scotland bill <e> <s> i discussed this matter with certain of your lordships but not with all your lordships who are here today <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i accept that i may not have expressed myself very well <e> <s> i was taking up a point made by the noble lord lord meston about concern for the small trader which i fully understand and which has been voiced in your lordships house on other parts of the bill <e> <s> i am simply saying that the small trader with no security will not obtain any real advantage from the avoidance of this part of crown preference because any funds which would be freed of crown preference would immediately be made available to other preferred creditors <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i accept entirely what the noble lord lord bruce says about what may happen in certain cases <e> <s> perhaps i should merely plead that i am only a lawyer and not an accountant and therefore when it comes to figures i would defer to what would be the conclusions reached in certain instances where certain figures arise <e> <s> i can only plead that i did not state categorically that it would arise in every case i merely said it would arise in certain cases <e> <s> it would be very likely to enure only to the benefit of preferred creditors <e> <s> i can only say with the noble lord lord meston that that is by the by in the amendment with which we are now dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords i would simply respond to my noble friend by quoting if i may from a passage in the cork report which i think has been mentioned in previous debates <e> <s> it is in paragraph and it says <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to en bloc <e> <s> some of the amendments are of a minor nature but i think it is right to refer to certain of them in detail <e> <s> i do so first of all with amendment no <e> <s> which runs along with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the purpose of this bill which extends to scotland only is to effect desirable improvements and to remove anomalies over a wide area of scottish law <e> <s> to make efficient use of parliamentary time for many important changes which do not justify a bill of their own requires recourse to such a bill at certain periods <e> <s> it is needed also to enable effect to be given to certain unimplemented reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all those who have spoken on this bill <e> <s> first i wish to take up a point which the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside raised in regard to the form of the bill itself <e> <s> i am certain that from his own knowledge and experience of statute he is aware that in the past there have been similar bills which incorporated a substantial number of unrelated points of reform <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all those who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i recognise that there are always views upon the correct number for an increase but i take it from what was being said from all sides of the house that at least an increase is felt to be justified <e> <s> i am grateful to noble lords for accepting that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house since there has been a suggestion that in this matter there is a peculiarity of scots law perhaps it would be only right at this stage to make quite clear that the existing banks are covered by legislation which applies throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> as my noble friend lord gowrie has already made clear it is also an act which was passed by parliament in <e> <s> no doubt the force of that will not have escaped your lordships that the advice which is referred to by the scots counsel mr john murray was given in <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped to make it quite clear in what i had already said that the reason why i used the phrase preponderance of legal advice was that it was known at the time when advice was taken that contrary opinion already existed in the opinion given by mr murray in <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying to your lordships is this <e> <s> first i am not aware just now that more than one opinion was given by mr murray in <e> <s> i can only say that he appeared very recently as one of your lordships has remarked on behalf of the trustee savings bank in the present action <e> <s> the act deals with the question of the assets of the trustee savings banks <e> <s> that is of course the issue which is raised in the current action before the court of session <e> <s> it proceeds upon the terms of the act <e> <s> the government have taken legal advice on that matter <e> <s> they have formed a view already expressed by my noble friend in the full knowledge that a contrary opinion had been given in by mr murray <e> <s> that is why i used the expression the preponderance of legal advice <e>", "<cs> i appreciate entirely the concern which the noble lord lord morton has already expressed today and which was previously expressed at second reading by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> the issue is whether this clause should be amended to make provision for something which is not already there namely compensation for losses which may arise to a third party by the mere making of an application for a rectification order as opposed to the result achieved <e>", "<cs> i am obviously grateful to the noble and learned lord for tabling this amendment so that we can consider the situation as it arises <e> <s> i think i should make clear that section of the act to which this amendment refers at present requires that a non-entitled spouse that is a person who has no legal rights to occupation of the matrimonial home who is not in occupation of the matrimonial home must if denied entry to the matrimonial home apply to the court for an order enforcing her right to enter the matrimonial home <e>", "<cs> i assure your lordships that there was no drafting error in the original act <e> <s> it is important to realise that an entitled spouse and i include within that what is sometimes referred to in the act as the jointly entitled spouse is <e>", "<cs> i wish to make it clear beyond doubt that the government share the concern which noble lords have already expressed about the issue of violence in the home or indeed violence anywhere <e> <s> but i cannot advise the committee to accept this amendment though i fully accept that it is put forward with good intention <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that concern has been expressed about the terms of certain judicial interpretation of the legislation which was adopted at a very early stage but i think that recent authoritative decisions of the courts in scotland have made it clear that the courts now take a far more realistic view of when an exclusion order is necessary and i use the word which is in the act for the purposes of section of the act <e> <s> indeed i have read recent legal commentaries upon the working of the act which have made that very point <e> <s> it would appear to be quite clear that authoritative decisions have been given by which the courts now recognise the purpose of the act as interpreted from the words of the act itself <e>", "<cs> with respect i believe that in his argument for this amendment the noble lord has tended to blur a distinction that is clearly made in the act itself <e> <s> the court is empowered by section of the act to grant an interdict that is an order which restrains or prohibits any conduct against a spouse or a child <e> <s> that would cover precisely the kind of circumstances that the noble lord has mentioned where violence is anticipated may i say wherever it occurs <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the noble lords amendment appears to be to extend to both divorced women and cohabitees protection against violence which is similar to that afforded to married women by the power of arrest which is attached to a matrimonial interdict by virtue of section of the act <e> <s> as the noble lord has also spoken to amendment no <e> <s> i think that it would be convenient if i also answered in relation to both these amendments <e>", "<cs> i would place on record that the government are as concerned as anyone to ensure that the act provides the effective protection against domestic violence that it was intended to <e> <s> indeed i also accept that any protection afforded by a matrimonial interdict with an attached power of arrest will be illusory unless there is a satisfactory procedure for its enforcement <e>", "<cs> i cannot commend this amendment to your lordships for two grounds <e> <s> the first is a technical one but it is important <e> <s> the noble lord opposite has accepted that there is a deficiency in the form of amendment no <e> <s> in its reference to section it should state of the act <e> <s> but i should add that the further reference to paragraph of part i of schedule to the act is again otiose in the sense that that paragraph was repealed in <e> <s> but while recognising that the amendment is technically defective i should however accept the spirit in which it is moved and i would reply to it in that way <e>", "<cs> obviously i listen to everything that the noble lord lord kirkhill says particularly when it has a tinge of hell-fire in it <e> <s> but i undertake to explain why this clause is here and why <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friends who have spoken <e> <s> to deal first with the two points of my noble friend lord drumalbyn the first matter which concerned him was the financial limit for small claims <e> <s> i must make it clear that as yet no decision has been taken on this matter <e> <s> my honourable friend the solicitor-general in another place indicated that it was likely that the financial limit might be fixed somewhere between and <e> <s> at the same time he mentioned that the government might review the current level of which is the upper limit for summary causes within which of course small claims would fall <e> <s> the amounts will be fixed after we have had representations made as to the appropriate level <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> the limit for england was fixed as long ago as am not aware of any intention to raise that limit at present <e> <s> i simply make the point that we will consider this aspect in the light of representations made so far as our procedure is concerned <e> <s> obviously the kind of point which my noble friend has just mentioned will be a very compelling matter to consider <e>", "<cs> i should make it clear that what is provided for in the bill is done with reference to precedent <e> <s> for instance order-making powers which are similarly subject to the negative rather than the affirmative resolution procedure were granted for example in section of the divorce jurisdiction court fees and legal aid scotland act <e> <s> that act allowed the lord advocate to prescribe the class or classes of undefended divorce actions in which the rule requiring corroboration is not to apply <e> <s> there is further precedent in the litigants in person costs and expenses act where the negative resolution procedure for orders prescribing those proceedings other than those mentioned in the act to which it applied was also provided <e>", "<cs> i feel in the light of what your lordships have said that i wish to consider this matter further <e> <s> if the views which i have expressed were to change obviously that could be dealt with on report <e> <s> with that assurance perhaps the noble and learned lord will wish to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in the light of what he has said i shall think further about this before the report stage <e> <s> as i say there is precedent but obviously we do not wish to run foul of the <e>", "<cs> i shall just say to the noble lord that i have listened to what he has said and i shall be very happy to consider this matter further <e> <s> but i should put on record that the government took this step advisedly and perhaps i can briefly explain why <e> <s> the typical small claim will involve men and women who wish to deal with the case themselves without having representation by lawyers <e> <s> there may be lay representation as i think the committee is well aware and the procedure to be adopted is likely to be relatively uncomplicated indeed the bill expressly provides that the ordinary legal rules about the admissibility or corroboration of evidence are not to apply <e>", "<cs> i fear that in this case i cannot commend the amendment to the committee <e> <s> the special features of the small claims procedure which i outlined are a certain degree of informality and it is expected to be an exceptional case in which parties whose claim is over the financial limit at which the small claims procedure will apply will concur in wanting their claim to be dealt with as a small claim <e> <s> however it seems right to provide that if the parties concur the sheriff should be under a duty to order a remit <e> <s> then the procedure for doing so will be simple and not need the parties to attend before the sheriff to argue the grounds in which he should order a remit <e>", "<cs> i think the only response that i can give is that in those circumstances the parties will not be able to avail themselves of the relaxation on the rules of evidence that would have been available when it was treated as a small claim but they would have of course the opportunity to consider their position as to whether they wished to proceed as a summary cause <e> <s> i do not think i can do better than simply say that there will then be an opportunity to consider whether they wish to proceed as a summary cause when they elect originally to go as a small claim <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i accept that the provision had a long history going back to the days when the office of sheriff substitute as it was then was in the gift of the sheriff principal <e> <s> i can only say that this clause has been put in the bill because in recent years difficulties have been brought to the governments attention about the scope of the restriction in the act <e>", "<cs> in framing this clause the government gave careful consideration to how best temporary assistance could be provided to the court of session and to the high court <e> <s> they concluded that neither the employment of practising senior counsel nor indeed of sheriffs principal would be a satisfactory alternative to the recall of retired judges <e> <s> i wish to emphasise that the government in reaching this decision have taken the views of the lord president of the court of session <e> <s> it is on his shoulders that the responsibility a very heavy one of administering the business of these courts falls <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can be reasonably brief in reply <e> <s> the clause is intended to implement recommendations made by the noble earl lord jellicoe in his review of the operation of the prevention of terrorism temporary provisions act <e> <s> noble lords may remember that a provision along exactly the same lines was provided for in england and wales in the police and criminal evidence act <e> <s> it is for that reason that this clause finds its way into the present bill <e> <s> it is to take cognisance of those recommendations and to apply them within the scottish context <e> <s> unless the noble and learned lord wishes any further explanation which i shall certainly be happy to give him in writing if he would like to write to me about it i hope that he will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for having put down this amendment <e> <s> i accept that there is perhaps a matter which ought to be made clear <e> <s> i am not certain that the terms of the amendment itself achieve that in perhaps the best way and i should like to take this matter away and think about it <e> <s> in that way i also hope to satisfy the hellfire and brimstone sermon which i received slightly earlier from the noble lord lord kirkhill <e>", "<cs> i fully take the point that both noble lords have made in speaking to this amendment <e> <s> obviously i should like to ponder over what has been said in both cases but it is only right that i should explain why class a drugs are the only ones covered by the clause at present <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that in the controlled drugs penalties act which has passed through parliament this year the maximum penalty for trafficking in class a drugs was increased to life imprisonment although the penalty for trafficking in other controlled drugs remains at the previous maximum of years <e>", "<cs> the objective of the present section of the criminal procedure scotland act to which this clause is an amendment was to ensure that all children under convicted on indictment should be subject to a period of supervision after their release regardless of whether their release date fell within the sentence or at the end of it <e> <s> i think at second reading i explained that even if released one day before the end of the sentence the provisions there standing could take effect <e> <s> in fact the original provision did not achieve that intended effect in respect of those few children who were held until the end of their sentence and were not released on licence <e> <s> this clause simply seeks to remove that lacuna <e>", "<cs> obviously i shall read what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i would simply say that i have had regard to what is said in section in the reply which i made which i will hasten to add i think was not in the same words but was substantially different and longer than my reply at second reading <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this clause is to remove any doubts about what was intended by parliament when the act was passed <e>", "<cs> i seem to remember an old tag <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot advise your lordships to accept this amendment <e> <s> i fully understand the purpose of the noble and learned lord in proposing it and should say at the outset that i fully sympathise with his concern that there must be an effective procedure for the enforcement of the protection provided by matrimonial interdict <e> <s> but i find myself entirely in agreement with what the noble lord lord morton of shuna has said on the question of how it is best to deal with this situation and also and more particularly with the point which he makes and which i think he is repeating from the committee stage about the question of constitutional principle <e> <s> i have said before and i repeat today that the government are committed to ensuring that the act does afford the effective remedies against domestic violence that it was intended to <e> <s> it is for this reason that the government have commissioned research into the operation of the act in order that assessment on the basis of reliable evidence as to whether there is <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may respond to the points that have been raised <e> <s> may i deal first with the question raised by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i am somewhat at a loss to understand his reference to codes of practice but the guidelines are simply directions which the lord advocate has given to chief constables as to the manner in which the act as it is presently framed should be used by police officers <e> <s> it is on the basis of that too that instruction and training are given to police officers <e> <s> it would not be within my competence at this point to indicate whether or not that would appropriately form a <e>", "<cs> what i indicated was that the government have commissioned research into the operation of the act and the results of that research will be published <e> <s> as regards the point of my noble friend lord selkirk i do not necessarily accept that there is anything intrinsically wrong with the legislation <e> <s> like all these things it takes some time for it to bed down <e> <s> i should of course add that we are speaking about a power of arrest which arises in civil proceedings but a confrontation between man and wife may well give rise to criminal charges and that is apart from the matter with which we are dealing <e> <s> but i assure my noble friend that we are keeping a close eye upon the way in which the act is operated <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may be permitted to answer points which have been made by both my noble friend lork selkirk and the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i shall do no more than commend to them what i said in committee on these very matters <e> <s> i went into them very fully <e> <s> i should make it clear that the small claims procedure is not restrictive to party litigants but is aimed at permitting those who wish to appear on their own or who wish to enlist a friend to make use of a relatively informal procedure <e> <s> i have listened to what has been said by your lordships in respect of both the terminology of this bill and more generally about limits <e> <s> i shall certainly bear those comments in mind <e> <s> i remind your lordships that the draft orders will be subject to affirmative procedures and will be put before both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to

would appear from what has been said that a draft code is already in existence where that form is followed <e> <s> obviously as i have said already my colleagues and myself will pay particular attention to the criticisms that have been made about codes of practice in the past <e> <s> that seems to me a suggestion that is eminently sensible for those who will be responsible for drawing up codes of practice in the future <e>", "<cs> i think it is only proper since the government have adopted a position of neutrality to advise the committee that the government have no strong views on these amendments <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside has made clear what is the scottish law commissions present view in addition to that which was expressed at the time when the law <e>", "<cs> i did not address myself to amendment no <e> <s> but i had some discussion earlier with the noble lord about it <e> <s> it seems to me that while there can be no objection in principle to what it seeks to do it might be that he will wish to reconsider it because it seems to involve a slight difficulty <e> <s> it suggests that you have to prove that the step-parent had never lived in the same household as the stepchild and treated the stepchild as a child of the family <e> <s> if on the other hand he or she were to establish the first branch but not the second then it would appear that the whole defence which is available in the section would not be open to him and i do not think that that is what the noble lord intended <e> <s> he may wish to reconsider the form of the amendment though not necessarily the substance <e>", "<cs> the government must have a responsibility to ensure so far as possible that legislation which is enacted is effective workable and consistent <e> <s> i appreciate the fact that the noble and learned lord has obviously discussed this with the scottish law commission <e> <s> i can only say that in the report they made clear the fact that the consultation memorandum in which they put forward this proposal was one which provoked considerable comment all i underline the word all of which favoured making special provision to protect children in these categories <e> <s> i refer to paragraph <e>", "<cs> no my understanding is quite clear <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that it is not intended that this clause should in any way bear upon the section to which he refers <e> <s> that will remain untouched <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that we are seeking perhaps to deal with a slightly different <e>", "<cs> what i tried to say i obviously did not put it clearly and for that i apologise to noble lords is first that the crown would have to prove that the accused was in possession of the salmon and secondly that the surrounding circumstances were such that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the fish were illegally taken <e> <s> that could come from a whole variety of circumstances <e> <s> i have made reference to one or two of them already <e> <s> from that point if that evidence is led it throws upon the accused the onus of establishing that the fish were not illegally taken he has to overcome suspicion <e> <s> that is why i thought it might be helpful to noble lords to have the particular passage in the judgment because that puts it in a way which i think makes very much clearer the effect of suspicion <e> <s> obviously at the end of the day it must be for the court to be satisfied that there is ground for suspicion <e> <s> that is the way in which we have framed this clause and that in the same way is the basis upon which the english clause proceeds albeit it has taken its derivation from the english theft act <e>", "<cs> i recognise that there are difficulties in bringing to book a person who apparently has a <e>", "<cs> in fairness to the noble lord opposite i accept that the reason for advancing provisions of the kind that one finds in clauses and is not to deal with the individual poacher who takes one salmon on the odd occasion indeed i believe that such an offender is impossible to catch <e> <s> the provisions are meant instead to catch those who embark upon poaching very much more as a trade and those who assist them in that trade by continuing to accept salmon that they know to have been illegally taken <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am perfectly happy on behalf of my noble friend and myself to say that we are prepared to meet the noble lord to discuss this matter <e> <s> i accept that it is a technical matter which is perhaps not easy to explain fully in committee although i have endeavoured to put the scottish situation as has my noble friend so far as clause is concerned for england and wales <e> <s> certainly we shall be happy to meet with the noble lord and others who wish to join with him <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lady for her explanation but i must tell your lordships that the government cannot consider it appropriate to include provision for the removal of a licence as an additional penalty on conviction for the offence of illegal possession <e>", "<cs> in a sense my response to these two amendments must be along the lines similar to that which i have already given in answer to the noble ladys previous amendment <e> <s> the licensing boards in scotland have similar powers under the licensing scotland act to those of licensing authorities under the civic government scotland act that is to say they can suspend liquor licences for misconduct on the part of the holder of the licence <e> <s> therefore again i suggest that it might be inappropriate to give the courts additional powers in this respect <e> <s> i think it may be said also that the connection between liquor licensing and illegal possession of salmon is perhaps less than immediately direct and that any penalty of this nature therefore would be more appropriate in the licensing legislation <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for making that point <e> <s> i shall look at it and if it appears that perhaps the words which he suggested would be better then obviously we can consider it at report stage <e>", "<cs> i understand the concept that the noble lord has expressed <e> <s> perhaps i should make clear that the main purpose of this clause is to cover persons who are charged under section a which it is proposed will come into the act for instance with reset who might escape conviction by explaining away the suspicious circumstances by attributing them to a different unlawful act <e> <s> i think as <e>", "<cs> i think it is right to say that that is something which is to be found in other legislation <e> <s> i think there is statutory provision for it <e> <s> where a person is charged with theft if at the end of the day it turns out that the lesser offence of reset is made out the court may convict of reset although the original charge against him is that of theft <e> <s> this is in a sense analogous to that <e>", "<cs> i obviously recognise the concern expressed by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> we would certainly not wish to prevent local authorities issuing or funding publicity that promoted good race relations <e> <s> we recognise the duty which is set out in statute to which the noble lord has referred <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also respond to one point which was made by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> i should like to make it abundantly plain that we are not in any way intending to place a gag upon bodies such as local community relations councils <e> <s> if such a council wishes to put out publicity which directly attacks the national front this bill does not prevent it from doing so <e> <s> that is perfectly plain <e> <s> a council itself is free to produce such publicity provided that that publicity and that material is not funded by the local authority for that purpose <e> <s> that is a point which i wish to make absolutely plain <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i hoped i had made it clear why we considered that the amendment was unnecessary if what was being done was in pursuance of the duty under section of the race relations act <e> <s> what i was saying was that if the material about race relations which was paid for at public expense was used as a platform for a party political attack then however abhorrent are the policies of the national front and i think we are all agreed about that it would in the governments view be wrong to allow party political material which attacked the national front and which was produced at the ratepayers expense to be used for that purpose <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could make one or two remarks in view of the expanded debate that has taken place <e> <s> i think it is perhaps important once again just to bear in mind how the clause presently stands <e> <s> it states and i shall abbreviate <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he allow me to ask him a question on a matter of information <e> <s> he made reference to a document which was received from the commission for racial equality <e> <s> i made reference to that earlier and in particular to paragraph of that document <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> it has been a thoughtful debate which i found most constructive <e> <s> i detected perhaps a form of muted welcome for the bill and also that certain of the comments were more relevant to regulations which will be made under the bill than to the bill itself <e> <s> obviously these are matters of which my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state will take particular account when considering secondary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept the suggestion which is made by the noble lord <e> <s> the section is quite clear and i have given an explanation about it <e> <s> so far as the question of immunity is concerned my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general made quite clear what the position was about that and indeed my right honourable friend the prime minister made the matter even clearer in her statement of rd january in another place <e> <s> i should have thought that that would have been quite sufficient to allay any such fears as those suggested by the noble lord just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what the noble lord opposite has said was a matter of concern which was placed before parliament in the session of <e> <s> the difficulty has always been to find another broadly acceptable measure which defines the information which genuinely needs protection from disclosure <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the prime minister when questioned about this matter on th january in another place made clear that an attempt had been made to amend the act <e> <s> there had been considerable debate on the matter and although many people wanted change there was no agreement on what those changes should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the general public are asking that question <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect that seems to be going beyond the scope of this particular question <e> <s> i merely say that my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general said in another place on rd february in relation to the issue of prosecution of mr bernard ingham that after consultation with the director of public prosecutions and senior treasury counsel he took the view that his published guidelines would not be fulfilled by any prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords i make it quite clear and i thought that i had done so in the opening response which i made to the question that what constitutes authorisation in any particular case depends upon the circumstances of that case <e> <s> i cannot go beyond that matter <e> <s> that is a matter which any lawyer would fully understand <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house proceeds further it might be helpful at this time if i was to make known the governments view on the extension of the bill to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very useful debate and may i say at the outset that i am grateful to all those who have spoken on this matter <e> <s> i should like to dispel one or two concerns which noble lords have had and in particular the one given voice to by the noble lord lord home that is the concern about an obligation to explain where the fish came from <e>", "<cs> my lords guilty <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords who have explained the purpose of these amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord hughes gave notice at second reading that he would be seeking to extend the role of the board at that time i think he suggested in line with the recommendations of the royal commission on legal services in scotland <e> <s> i think that this is what this bundle of amendments is designed to do in the main <e>", "<cs> first i take the point which my noble friend lord selkirk made at the outset that this board should be independent and indeed that is the concern as much of the government as of those noble lords who have already spoken in debate this afternoon <e> <s> i will certainly look at what has been said by noble lords this afternoon bearing in mind that my noble friend indicated that he did not intend to divide the committee on his amendments <e> <s> however it is important that i should put certain matters before your lordships as a consideration in any future discussion of this matter <e>", "<cs> all i would say is that he had that power at present even under the existing administration of legal aid <e>", "<cs> when one has been working in a particular area for a fairly long time one is always conscious that familiarity breeds a certain i was going to say contempt but that would not be fair perhaps a blindness and that the fresh air which independent assessment can bring is sometimes welcome <e> <s> but i think i can assure the noble and learned lord that the fact that a report is received does not of itself mean that every recommendation once it has been looked at will necessarily be accepted it is advisory <e>", "<cs> we trod this path at second reading when i made the matter quite clear <e> <s> i was reinforced in my belief by the speeches of the only two lay members of your lordships house who then spoke that it would be appropriate to establish a board <e> <s> the reason that the noble lord lord morton fastened upon for opposing the clause was that there was a management consultants report but i have already responded to that point <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that it bears no legitimacy <e>", "<cs> i was concerned to find out from my noble friend what was the purpose of his amendment <e> <s> it is i believe important to have regard to the fact that clause deals with certain duties but that these have to be read in the light of what precedes it and in particular clause which sets out the general functions of the board <e> <s> that is really the area with which my noble friend is most concerned <e> <s> the board has the function of <e>", "<cs> i think that this amendment is otiose but i would remind your lordships that the secretary of state will be responsible for funding the board <e> <s> it is he who will be accountable to parliament for the boards discharge of its functions <e> <s> that is why it is proposed that the board should in the first instance report to the secretary of state <e> <s> however clause of this bill requires the secretary of state thereafter to lay the boards report together with its accounts and the auditors report on them before each house of parliament <e> <s> with that clarification the noble lord might feel able to consider his position <e>", "<cs> i spoke to this in response to the motion of the noble lord on the first amendment <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat in any detail what i said then <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is quite right to say that one should always look at the bill as a whole in determining the meaning of any particular part of it <e> <s> it is important to <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that once again this has to be read in the context of the remainder of the bill <e> <s> certainly my reading of this subsection is to the effect that the board must have a genuine regard to guidance but the guidance does not in itself constitute direction <e> <s> therefore the board is simply bound properly to consider the guidance but not to follow it blindly <e> <s> if the guidance offends against the restriction which is contained within this subsection in order to make it absolutely clear beyond peradventure that it is not to affect consideration or disposal of applications which the board has itself to consider clearly it is entitled by this subsection and by <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to take up noble lords time because in fact when i spoke to the first amendment that we considered this afternoon i dealt with this amendment in detail <e> <s> i simply make it clear that again i must ask the committee to reject it first of all because the second subsection extends the powers of the board beyond what is intended <e> <s> secondly so far as the first subsection is concerned the government would expect the board to monitor the legal aid system and make such changes in arrangements as are within its competence <e> <s> it would not seem appropriate to give the board a formal or general advisory role <e>", "<cs> reference has been made to the fact that in two reports which antedated the introduction of the legal aid schemes in both jurisdictions recommendations were made concerning an advisory committee <e> <s> but of course such an advisory committee has never been a feature of scottish arrangements <e> <s> while i do not suggest that we cannot learn from what has happened south of the border in this case i am not persuaded that that is the case <e>", "<cs> i listen to anything that the noble and learned lord says with very great care <e> <s> i wish first to make it quite clear that the reason why amendment no <e> <s> was opposed was because we took the view that the boards remit should be limited <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> went far beyond our objective and i made that quite clear <e> <s> already this afternn i have undertaken to consider what noble lords have said with regard to clause and in particular the manner in which the clause was criticised as to the composition of the board because i think that we are all agreed that the board should be independent <e> <s> if the board is independent it seems to me with respect that the argument that the noble and learned lord has just made to some extent is undermined and it is further undermined in my submission because of the fact that amendment no <e> <s> was directed to a completely different matter <e> <s> if that is what the advisory board is intended to do that is far beyond the range of the boards administrative responsibilities <e>", "<cs> obviously i would agree with the noble lord lord ross of marnock that parliament should be aware of the important aspects of the boards activities including those in its relationship with the secretary of state <e> <s> i am sure that if they are important they will be recorded in the boards annual report <e> <s> but i think that this amendment as it is framed would produce an impossible situation <e> <s> it will be quite inappropriate to record all the day-to-day contacts with the board <e> <s> this is not at present done in relation to the annual report from the legal aid central committee <e> <s> the amendment for instance would mean that any trivial or ephemeral request for information made by the secretary of state or his officials in the course of day-to-day business would require to be included <e> <s> indeed some of these matters may not even be recorded <e> <s> on the other hand guidance could be held to include such matters as advice from the scottish offices central services department on office machinery <e> <s> clearly the secretary of state should not be required to publish all such details in a report to parliament <e>", "<cs> perhaps before the noble lord withdraws <e>", "<cs> i have had some little difficulty in really appreciating the problem which the noble lord lord morton appears to advert to <e> <s> clause a repeats the provisions of existing legislation in references to scots law <e> <s> certainly so far as i am aware the present system works satisfactorily and an extension of it of the type which appears to be proposed would seem to be unnecessary <e> <s> scots law includes for instance those aspects of european community law which apply in scotland and under the present legal advice and assistance scheme advice and questions on the international private law of scotland are also covered as well as the scottish legal aspects of such matters as cross-border maintenance orders <e>", "<cs> at this state i am obviously not going to say other than that i will give consideration to the matter <e> <s> the point i was making was that it is perfectly possible under the present scheme for a scottish solicitor to say that the problem is one of english law <e> <s> he does so because he is advising as to the extent of scots law <e> <s> he then says that the person would have to apply to an english solicitor <e> <s> i understand that is what the relevant english cross-border legislation is <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has anticipated what my response will and must be <e> <s> the lower financial limits which are set in the bill are by and large linked to supplementary benefit levels and are therefore set on a great britain basis to apply in both jurisdictions <e> <s> the limits set out are the current levels which incorporate certain increases made only last november <e> <s> the limits are uprated in line with supplementary benefit changes <e> <s> the figures in the bill will of course be changed if any increase is made during its passage <e> <s> changes will continue to be made by regulation subject to affirmative resolution and your lordships house will therefore have a full opportunity to discuss the actual limits which will be applied on implementation <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> what i am saying is that the limits which are set in the present schemes both north and south of the border are figures which <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can do more than listen to what the noble lord lord hughes has said <e> <s> obviously i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services in particular to this matter <e> <s> but i make clear that it is thought by the government appropriate that these levels should apply throughout both jurisdictions and for that reason i must give the noble lord cold comfort <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just deal with the last point about which the noble lord lord ross asked me <e> <s> i do not have the answer immediately but i shall write to him <e> <s> i am advised that it is a fairly complicated equation but i shall be happy to tackle it <e>", "<cs> the purpose is to allow for the possibility that situations may arise where an on-the-spot decision is required during proceedings <e> <s> at present the only authority which would be approving applications for assistance by way of representation other than the solicitor giving it would be the board but it may be that circumstances could arise where it is best for a court or tribunal to have that power <e>", "<cs> no i think i would simply explain that it is to allow for example in a contempt of court case where a court is considering whether to bring a person before it on a contempt of court charge that that court may then grant legal aid for the purpose of allowing that individual to have <e>", "<cs> it might be for the convenience of the committee if i speak also to the amendments in my name amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> i also refer to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> obviously i shall read again what the noble lord has said but i think i have explained what i am intending in the amendments which are down in my name <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might give an example of the kind of situation which might arise in the future <e> <s> for instance if it proved possible to extend assistance by way of representation to certain tribunals including those dealing with supplementary benefit then its availability might be limited to persons who are in receipt of supplementary benefit or family income supplement <e> <s> it is to give that flexibility that the last part of paragraph <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can make the position clearer <e> <s> it is to give flexibility which could well deal with the case where persons are already on supplementary benefit but are seeking more <e> <s> i agree that those who are not in receipt of supplementary benefit may have to be considered and in that case the clause is flexible enough to cover them also <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it would be right for me to enter into a commitment that the secretary of state by regulation or indeed the board administratively will set up any arrangements for an appeal against a refusal to allow expenditure on advice and assistance to exceed the limit which is set out in clause <e> <s> i would say that it would appear to be inappropriate to make such provision as is proposed here on the face of the bill <e> <s> if arrangements were made under regulations they would be varied more easily to take account of changes in circumstances over time and would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny <e>", "<cs> i think i replied to this point when the noble lord lord hughes was speaking to his financial limits amendment earlier <e> <s> as i said then i have no reason to think that the current limit is not appropriate in advice and assistance cases which at present do not include representation <e> <s> we shall consider whether this limit needs to be adjusted either generally or in relation to assistance by way of representation in the light of information available at the time <e> <s> i have also noted what the noble lord has said in relation to england and obviously again i shall draw that to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> i am fully aware of what the limit involves <e> <s> in fact my information is that the english limit is though it is extended to a higher figure in some cases <e> <s> we seem to be at variance on our information <e> <s> but i do not think that i can go further than i have done <e>", "<cs> i think that there are always dangers in looking for analogies <e> <s> my information is that in england the situation is different in that such assistance can in general be granted only after approval by a legal aid committee whereas in scotland we are allowing for the possibility of that assistance being granted directly by solicitors <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the strict application of the rule regarding payments out of property recovered or preserved has given rise to claims of hardship from time to time <e> <s> we must all sympathise with those receiving legal aid or advice and assistance who find themselves in such a position <e> <s> i am aware too of the fact that there have been judicial decisions in england about that though i think that there is an absence of them north of the border <e>", "<cs> clause provides that certain items will not be taken into account in assessing an applicants means for the purposes of his liability under an award of expenses <e> <s> it is i think an exclusion <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> i made clear i believe in what i said in opening that the discretion that already exists in the legal aid central committee in regard to advice and assistance and the waiving of the rights of the legal aid fund regarding civil legal aid under existing regulations are matters that i would envisage being provided for in regulations of a similar character under this bill <e> <s> i can go no further than that <e>", "<cs> i made clear i believe that that is a situation that might even arise in relation to unassisted litigants <e> <s> the effect of the amendment to clause would mean that in relation to advice and assistance the solicitor would in no circumstances be able to claim any fees and outlays out of any property recovered or preserved for his client <e> <s> that would of course increase the solicitors claim on the legal aid fund <e> <s> for the reason that i have already indicated i cannot accept that that is correct <e> <s> the circumstances vary <e> <s> i have indicated that the discretion that at present exists in the legal aid central committee in respect of legal advice and assistance could well be carried over into the new system so far as the board is concerned <e> <s> that i regret to say is as far as i can go tonight <e>", "<cs> i shall take aboard what has been said tonight and these matters will obviously fall to be considered <e>", "<cs> in providing that legal aid means representation as set out in clause the bill merely repeats the formulation which is to be found in section of the legal aid scotland act <e> <s> it strikes a balance between the right of the assisted person to have proper legal representation and the need to ensure that unnecessary expenditure is not incurred from public funds <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i take note of what my noble friend says <e> <s> this is a phrase which has not so far as i know occasioned difficulty in the past <e> <s> however i appreciate that that is not necessarily the touchstone for the future <e>", "<cs> industrial tribunals have not been included in the list in schedule because successive governments have taken the view that this is not really necessary and if implemented would prove too expensive <e> <s> advice and assistance will of course continue to be available and that remains the present governments policy <e> <s> however in view of what the noble and learned lord lord wheatley has said about subsequent appeal processes i would say that a safeguard is provided in that legal aid is available for proceedings in the employment appeal tribunal to which a person dissatisfied with the industrial tribunals decision can appeal <e> <s> it would also be right to say that if circumstances were to change in future it would be possible to add industrial tribunals to schedule by use of the power which is contained in clause <e> <s> however i regret to say that for the reasons which i have set out i cannot accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i have indicated that the individual can obtain legal advice and assistance to enable him to present his case in person at the tribunal <e> <s> however i regret to say that as i have already indicated the governments policy is that which has been followed by successive governments at present this is the limit of the legal aid that can be granted <e> <s> i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> may i return to the prosaic <e> <s> i appreciate that there have been arguments of respectability put forward in favour of the removal of this long-standing exemption <e> <s> arguments against have been deployed so completely by other noble lords that there is little i wish to add other than to say that the kind of considerations to which both noble and learned lords have spoken still deserve to be <e>", "<cs> with the permission of the committee i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> these two amendments deal with the same general principle <e> <s> i entirely agree that a review of decisions to refuse legal aid should be for the board <e> <s> it is envisaged that regulations made by the secretary of state under clause <e>", "<cs> i think that i can answer my noble friend <e> <s> i said that it was envisaged that regulations made under clause <e>", "<cs> a number of points have been raised and perhaps i may deal with them in turn <e> <s> the first one is one on which i would again make it quite clear that the present arrangements which are to provide for the review procedure in regulations are indeed better even than the existing provision which was under a scheme not subject to parliamentary procedure <e> <s> the result of this amendment would be to leave it to the board to determine what method of appeal they should adopt whereas the review procedure which i am indicating is something which will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny <e>", "<cs> indeed <e> <s> thereafter if there is a plea of not guilty and the person is on hail his case is reviewed by way of an application <e>", "<cs> if he is not on bail the decision is made early on and he makes an application to the board <e>", "<cs> that is a matter which the board will decide <e> <s> it will decide the most suitable way of achieving expedition and consistency <e> <s> all i can say at the moment is what i said on second reading that there are one or two ways of doing that <e> <s> the board might use a local panel of individuals or it might prefer to use some other way <e> <s> all i can say at present is that the board will be well aware of the need to set up a system which will achieve consistency and expedition <e> <s> i cannot go beyond that as the noble and learned lord will appreciate <e> <s> that is the bills general intention <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might respond to what my noble friend lord selkirk said at the start by making it clear that we are here dealing with civil legal aid and not with criminal legal aid <e> <s> i fully accept that there may be greater difficulty in setting out factors to be taken into account in determining reasonableness than there may be in other circumstances in relation to the determination of the interests of justice <e> <s> but i suggest to your lordships that this is a useful power <e>", "<cs> i am fully aware of the views which noble lords expressed from various parts of the committee <e> <s> i am not prepared to accept this amendment at present but in view of what has been said i will consider this with my right honourable friend to see whether what is intended by this which i assure noble lords is not sinister can be obtained perhaps in another form of words which might be more acceptable to noble lords <e> <s> however noble lords will fully understand that i give no undertaking <e>", "<cs> the effect of the deletions and the substitution which is entailed in this amendment would be that there would no longer be an upper limit on disposable income or disposable capital and that all parties would be able to apply for legal aid with the sliding contribution system to which the noble lord has just referred <e> <s> he made particular reference to the recommendations of the royal commission <e>", "<cs> if i am wrong i shall write to my noble friend but i believe that there are existing regulations which set out a formula by which disposable income is calculated the same applies to disposable capital <e> <s> that is the basis upon which the assessment is made <e> <s> as i said at second reading the assessment will be one of the matters for which the board will take responsibility <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is referring to clause which uses the terms disposable income and disposable capital <e> <s> i gather that there are rules for computing for instance disposable income and that they are to be found in the legal aid scotland assessment of resources regulations and in schedule to those regulations <e>", "<cs> it is true that the circumstances in which a litigant who himself not legally aided has been successful against a legally aided party can obtain payment of his expenses from the legal aid fund are limited and always have been since the possibility of such payment was introduced in <e> <s> the amendment would remove some of these limitations in particular those which relate to the expenses of first instance proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is that i make the distinction that the material which is struck at here is material which is designed to affect public support for a political party <e> <s> on the other hand as i think the noble baroness is putting to me if one has a different intention in mind then that of course is not struck at although as my noble friend lord campbell pointed out it may be that there will also come with it some affect upon a political party <e> <s> however it is the intention which is important <e> <s> that is what the local authority has to look at <e> <s> that is what they know about and that is the test that the court will apply as my noble friend pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness opposite for raising these issues and i am very sorry as i am sure we all are to hear of the illness of the noble lord lord henderson and wish him a speedy recovery <e> <s> i was aware that the noble lord was concerned to have these issues raised for clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps with the leave of the house i may respond to that <e> <s> i think i made it plain that it acts in two particulars <e> <s> it can be both a safeguard in the circumstances which my noble friend outlined <e> <s> of course it is also directed to the other area where what would appear to be innocuous can when seen in full context be within the prohibition <e> <s> it acts in two ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what my noble friend has just said about bones <e> <s> of course there can be skeletons in cupboards as well <e> <s> there is one here and i think that it is important to draw your lordships attention to it <e> <s> it has already been alluded to by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> that is that there is provision in the local government finance act for ordering by the court of repayment of unlawful expenditure <e> <s> i think it is important to bear in mind that there is other expenditure which also breaks the law and is just as heinous as that with which we are dealing in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend and with the leave of the house perhaps i might reply by saying that the duty lies on the district auditor in the first place but if he refuses to do anything the aggrieved person may then apply to the court <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house my information is that it has been used on two occasions <e> <s> in the first instance the district auditor did not win the case <e> <s> the second case was a technical one and instigated with a view to the clarification of the law there was no question of a surcharge there <e> <s> so far these are the only cases which have occurred but i am not of course suggesting that the paucity of cases suggests that the existing law is not a useful deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may simply say this <e> <s> obviously the government will look very closely at what has been said today <e> <s> i think i would accept a point that i tried to deal with earlier <e> <s> we are aware of the problems of mounting a realistic and effective <e>", "<cs> i assure the committee that there is nothing new in what is proposed here <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilson reminded us of the fact that there is a parentage for this <e> <s> may i say where it starts <e> <s> it begins in in the first statute that gave life to legal aid in scotland <e> <s> in section of that act parliament provides this <e>", "<cs> i should like in as little detail as i can to put your lordships minds at rest about the intention of this subsection <e> <s> perhaps the best way to do it would be to deal in two ways with the position under summary criminal proceedings <e> <s> but before doing so perhaps i should make clear that this subsection is an important part of what we are intending in this part of the bill <e> <s> the arrangement whereby criminal legal aid shall not be available subject to regulations and to clauses and of the bill this is of some importance is that it is not until the conclusion of the first diet for which the accused has tendered a plea of not guilty that criminal legal aid will become available <e> <s> that is to assist in restricting the scope for abuse because the accused will have to decide whether to plead guilty or not guilty before he knows whether or not he will receive criminal legal aid if he pleads not guilty <e>", "<cs> i am advised and it was my understanding that this person will be able to go to a solicitor of his own choosing for advice just as is the case under the present legal advice and assistance scheme <e>", "<cs> in a sense i have already answered this in what i said about subsection <e> <s> the regulations which are made are those under subsection and the extent and form of those regulations are focused within subsection <e> <s> indeed as i am reminded the regulations can make legal aid available just as they might in certain circumstances be said to be restrictive <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i did not make it clear earlier but the terms of subsection make it clear that the regulations and sections and of the act so far as they apply to subsection will in fact extend or may extend criminal legal aid <e> <s> if one reads the subsection without those introductory words one finds that criminal legal aid shall not be available in connection with summary criminal proceedings until the conclusion subject to regulations made under this section and to sections and of this act <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has indicated this is a phrase which is common to civil and criminal legal aid <e> <s> i undertook to consider the wording with regard to civil legal aid <e> <s> i shall give the same consideration to this phrase <e> <s> it is right to say that it is a phrase which has appeared since <e> <s> i am not aware of it having given any difficulty in the granting of legal aid <e> <s> i undertook to consider the wording last time and equally i shall consider it this time as well <e>", "<cs> the bill as drafted is intended to achieve the result which the noble lord has indicated in this amendment <e> <s> i am generally confident that the terms of clauses and as they stand secure that result but i am perfectly happy to look again at the terms of the bill in the light of what he has just said and the examples that he has given <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept the desirability of the result which the noble lord wishes to achieve but in this instance i would reassure him that his amendment is not necessary <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> i have some difficulty in understanding this amendment as it is presently proposed because it appears in a sub-paragraph which requires a person to be in custody and to be being prosecuted under summary procedure where he has already tendered a plea of not guilty <e> <s> i suspect that what the noble lord probably had in mind was for this to be placed in sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> i accept that the automatic legal aid under clause should be wide enough to cover such appeals which derive from a section of the act which gives the right of appeal to the high court against a decision on a preliminary objection in summary proceedings <e> <s> it may be and indeed i would accept that clause as it stands may not achieve that result since as the noble lord has said an appeal can normally be taken only prior to the accused stating how he pleads to the charge <e> <s> that being so i should like to consider the position further <e> <s> i am not entirely satisfied that it would be appropriate to do it by the means which this amendment suggests and i will bring forward any necessary amendment at a later stage to make the matter clear <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to my noble friend and in so doing correct something that i think i mistakenly stated earlier because appeals of this kind are taken after the accused has stated how he pleads to the charge under the necessary act of adjournal <e> <s> it is one of the curiosities <e> <s> but that does not in any way cause me to change what i have already undertaken to do <e>", "<cs> i must ask the committee not to accept this amendment <e> <s> the view which i suggest is a proper one is that where there has been a material change in the reduction of a charge to summary procedure it is appropriate that the situation should be reviewed and decided in accordance with rules relevant to summary procedure <e> <s> it may be that such cases are among the comparatively serious ones which are dealt with by summary procedure but this will not always be so <e> <s> there is really no good reason why they should not be tested by the same criteria as apply in other summary cases <e> <s> these are primarily interests of justice and financial hardship <e>", "<cs> i can understand the reasons which are put forward for suggesting that summary courts should be given this reserve power <e> <s> we did consult the sheriffs among others on the desirability of including a power which would be similar to that in section of the legal aid scotland act <e> <s> they made it abundantly plain that they would not welcome it <e> <s> indeed they took the view that it would be quite inappropriate for them to be involved under new arrangements in considering applications for legal aid <e> <s> clearly this would prove particularly awkward in cases where an accused might with good reason have been refused legal aid by the board and in the event it would clearly be undesirable if two separate ways of applying for legal aid were practicable <e> <s> in general it seems reasonable that those who wish legal aid should have to apply for it in the normal way <e> <s> there is already on the statute book the section to which i have referred <e> <s> i understand indeed that under the present arrangements very little use has been made of it <e>", "<cs> my response to that must be a slightly different one <e> <s> if an accused person chooses to represent himself i remind the noble lord of the convention to which he referred earlier in debate this afternoon the court is not entitled to force representation upon him <e> <s> i understood the point that the noble lord was putting forward <e> <s> this matter has been discussed with the sheriffs and they are not willing to take it on <e>", "<cs> i am happy to give that assurance <e>", "<cs> i must make it clear that i cannot ask the committee to accept this amendment <e> <s> it follows on from clause and in the circumstances and as i have already made my position clear on that matter i ask the noble lord to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall follow the noble lord in speaking to all three amendments <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> may i respond to what the noble lord lord foot has just said <e> <s> i was trying to make clear that factors which would be relevant for the board to consider in relation to an application for legal aid will in fact be incorporated within the bill itself <e> <s> however allied to that would be a further provision for power to alter those factors by regulations which will be subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> i make clear that i have noted what the noble lord said about the factors suggested <e> <s> i have some criticisms of them but it is valuable to have them to study before my right honourable and learned friend considers his position in another place <e>", "<cs> in a sense i have already set out the governments position on this matter <e> <s> at present there is no appeal against the refusal of criminal legal aid and i am not aware of that fact in itself having given rise to concern <e> <s> the issue which has always been of extreme concern to those who have commented upon the consultation paper was that delays in the granting of legal aid should be avoided at all costs <e> <s> a review of procedure would be most likely to lead to delays even on the basis of a fairly rapid review procedure <e>", "<cs> i explained at second reading that there are some very significant differences both in criminal procedure and in the arrangements for criminal legal aid north and south of the border <e> <s> i cannot claim to be familiar with part ii of the legal aid act and the way in which it operates but it is quite clear that there would be dangers in seeking to import piecemeal elements of the english arrangements into the scottish ones or i suppose it might be said vice versa <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble and learned lord i thought i had indicated the principle upon which the scottish arrangements have operated in the past and will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> my mind wandered to an earlier part of this bill <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely right it is of course the courts <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what both the noble lord and the noble and learned lord have said <e> <s> the situation is that the indictment in the new trial may not be in precisely the same form as the indictment in the original trial <e> <s> i have personal experience of that where for instance a murder charge was to be fair reduced by the jury on conviction to culpable homicide and it was a charge of culpable homicide which was then on the indictment <e>", "<cs> i agree that a person whose case is referred to the high court by the secretary of state for consideration under section of the act should be eligible to apply for criminal legal aid as for an appeal <e> <s> it is not clear that the bill presently allows for this and i shall if on consideration clarification seems to be needed bring forward an appropriate amendment to clause at a later stage <e>", "<cs> the provision that the amendment seeks to delete merely repeats a provision already contained in section <e>", "<cs> it has to be borne in mind that like any criminal offence there are degrees of gravity of contempt of court <e> <s> i am aware of instances as no doubt the noble lord opposite is where the contempt may have been committed and <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that we gave careful consideration as to whether the board or the respective professional body should have the responsibility for determining whether a solicitor or advocate should be excluded <e> <s> i can assure the noble and learned lord on that matter <e> <s> i think that it would not be reasonable and would lead to practical difficulties for both the board and professional body to have this power <e> <s> for that reason we decided on balance that it was preferable since professional conduct was in question that the responsibility should rest with the professional body which dealt with disciplinary questions <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i understand it he simply desires an assurance that a solicitor who provides assistance privately before a certain stage in proceedings as regards which a legal aid application is thereafter granted will not be prevented from obtaining private payment for those preliminary stages <e> <s> that is not the intention of the clause <e> <s> obviously i would wish to look at it again to see whether it requires any adjustment to make the intention quite clear <e> <s> if it does require adjustment we shall bring forward an appropriate amendment at report <e>", "<cs> no the purpose of clause is simply to provide that what is called topping up should not take place that is to say a person who is in receipt of legal aid should then use his own private funds to obtain and purchase additional representation <e> <s> clause is dealing with the circumstances where the contribution actually paid by the client for the purpose of obtaining legal aid is then to be paid over to the solicitors <e> <s> perhaps i should make clear that this probably applies rather to civil legal aid than to criminal proceedings as regards which there is no contribution system anyway <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble lord opposite that i do not look upon this amendment with favour <e> <s> as the noble lord made clear this amendment derives from arrangements in england and indeed i think that their application is presently <e>", "<cs> in reply perhaps i may also speak to amendment no <e> <s> which i think goes along with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and have rather a suggestion of the tail wagging the dog <e> <s> there is no need for any formal provisions obliging the secretary of state to consult the board before making regulations since he would do this in any case on matters on which as the noble lord has suggested the board has special knowledge and expertise <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might write to the noble and learned lord on this matter <e>", "<cs> i would always be perfectly happy to write to the remainder of the noble lords or indeed put the letter in the library which would perhaps be the best way of making the matter clear to all <e>", "<cs> as i understand this subsection it commences with words saying that regulations made under this section may do certain things of which <e>", "<cs> regulations become a public document <e>", "<cs> so far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned i have considered this amendment and i am prepared to accept it on the basis that the bill will then give a clear indication that assistance in criminal proceedings is being looked at in the round with your lordships house being given a clear opportunity to consider the important changes in the arrangements in relation to assistance by way of representation as well as legal aid <e>", "<cs> i would simply say that my mind is not closed <e> <s> i shall bear in mind what has been said by my noble friend and by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> however i suggest from what i have said already that we are not dealing with new powers we are dealing with powers which are already in existing legislation <e> <s> but i shall look at this again <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to repeat what i have said already <e> <s> i spoke to this amendment when dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i made it quite clear why i could not accept it <e> <s> i stand by those reasons <e>", "<cs> i reiterate what i said last time <e> <s> i made it clear that i thought it was undesirable for all the boards views to be laid before parliament as these might refer to confidential matters <e> <s> for example the board might wish to refer to papers on individual cases which showed up defects in the existing regulations <e> <s> there may also be regulations on which the board has no expertise or locus such as those relating to fees <e> <s> it is for those reasons which i have stated that i cannot accept the basic premise of this amendment that the boards report should be laid along with the copy of the regulations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might speak first in relation to the amendment of my noble friend indeed the noble lord has anticipated me <e> <s> what we are doing is no more than retaining a provision which is already found in existing legislation in particular section of the act <e> <s> subsection of this clause repeats section of the act <e> <s> it is included on the basis that where people live together as husband and wife and use resources in common their joint resources should also be treated as one when assessing one of their numbers ability to take legal proceedings <e> <s> it will also be noted that there is a two-way process under clause <e> <s> if resources are combined liabilities including such joint items as taxes and rents as well as the maintenance of dependants are also taken into account under clause <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i should have made reference to that because that is repeating <e>", "<cs> my lords the important matter is to be found in the schedule to the bill <e> <s> there are circumstances in which certain conditions have to be satisfied before parties may marry <e> <s> i am looking at the schedule itself in paragraph <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say at this stage just in response to something that the noble and learned lord let drop that he brought a certain matter to my attention <e> <s> i will deal with this if i may in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> because i think the noble and learned lord has a point which i would hope perhaps the house might deal with even at this late stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that the brief i have been given accords with what i have just stated to your lordships house <e> <s> regrettably the rules do not provide for this at third reading although it may be done at earlier stages of the bills progress <e> <s> i can only tender my apologies to your lordships that this should have arisen <e> <s> it may require to be cured elsewhere <e> <s> i accept that it is unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> speaking simply to amendment no <e> <s> the intention here is to increase the number of members of <e>", "<cs> my lords we are perhaps going to go into that realm in a moment and i do not think that it would be appropriate at this stage to deal with the point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> i certainly intend to do so when i deal with the issue which will come with the next amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i would suggest to your lordships that a more proper course to take is to accept the amendment put down in my name <e> <s> the noble lord opposite is correct that i undertook to consider what was said by your lordships in committee <e> <s> the consequence is that in amendments nos <e> <s> and i have increased the minimum number of members of both the faculty of advocates and the law society from one to two <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may respond to my noble friend <e> <s> i think i have made it clear in relation to the last debate that in fact my right honourable friend has already been in touch with those two bodies <e> <s> i can simply say that certainly i understand it would be his full intention to consult with them on the suitable membership from those two bodies <e> <s> however as i said earlier i should like to make clear that he cannot be committed necessarily to selecting the names suggested by those bodies <e> <s> i would however confirm <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house perhaps i should simply say that i shall obviously take account of what has been said by your lordships today but i obviously cannot give any commitment so far as third reading is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i would suggest to your lordships that this amendment should not be accepted <e> <s> i think i explained at committee that the guidance powers which are intended in this clause relate essentially to the boards administrative and financial operations <e> <s> one matter which is pre-eminently suitable for guidance would be the way in which the board for instance conducted its financial transactions <e> <s> those are matters for it not in fact for the secretary of state as my noble friend suggested <e> <s> for example it would be important that the secretary of state should be able to issue guidance to the board in relation to its financial procedures and these are things which it would not be appropriate to cover in regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords that might be said <e> <s> i merely make it quite clear that in addition to what the secretary of state may cover in regulations he will also be entitled to give some guidance on matters which are not covered in regulations <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a matter suitable to be contained in the bill <e> <s> as i say it appears in another act <e> <s> i dealt with the position of consultation in relation to the appointment of members of the board which i suggest is a somewhat different topic <e>", "<cs> my lords notwith-standing appearing metaphorically to stand in a burning bush i remember that the advice given by the still small voice was i think accepted <e> <s> i have listened with care to what noble lords have said <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first of all with the point raised by the noble earl lord perth with regard to the publication of the report <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords i was saying that the advisory committee reports upon the law societys report and then its report independently is placed before the lord chancellor <e> <s> the two reports are then placed before parliament <e> <s> i was making the point that the law society does not itself have power to advise direct <e> <s> no doubt it would do so privately but it has no statutory power <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i have been making about the board is that it would be so broadly-based that one would be looking within its own confines to secure the objects for which it is appointed <e> <s> that is unlike the present position in england where i understand there is no such broadly-based administration of legal aid <e> <s> i accept that there may be lay members on the committee but i believe i am correct in saying that it is not as broadly-based as the board is here <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that of course but i observe it was still listened to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to my noble friend with great care <e> <s> i do not wish to traverse argument that has already been covered in committee <e> <s> i wish to make clear to my noble friend a problem that he has not perhaps fully <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment extends a point which i think we discussed as a result of an amendment by the noble lord opposite in committee <e> <s> i have considered what was said at that time and i accept that difficult cases will always arise where one party to proceedings is <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl lord perth has just reminded us we have already had an exhaustive discussion of the purpose of this clause in committee <e> <s> i simply remind noble lords of the principal arguments which i have already put forward in favour of the present formulation of the provision <e> <s> it is not a new provision <e> <s> indeed the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside reminded us of that in committee <e> <s> it is a repetition with one slight modification of a power which has been available to secretaries of state since in connection with civil legal aid and for criminal proceedings since criminal legal aid was introduced in <e> <s> your lordships have had therefore experience of the way in which secretaries of state have sought to use such powers and it has never been in the sweeping manner contemplated this evening <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that that will continue to be the case <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think i was trying to justify that <e> <s> if that was the impression i gave i am happy to correct it <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the power under subsection can be to exclude criminal proceedings before any court <e> <s> that is what is set out in subsection <e> <s> i am simply saying that it is a power to prescribe any class of proceedings or stage of proceedings that is in relation to proceedings themselves groups of offences or proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> i was simply saying that that power refers to criminal legal aid <e> <s> the power relating to abwor is to be found in an earlier part of the bill <e> <s> this provides the way in which the watershed is defined in relation to criminal legal aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will not think that i have been attempting to give any impression that on this side we consider that what is being set up will not be other than a fully independent board <e> <s> i make that quite plain <e> <s> i did not intend to give that impression in what i have said <e> <s> i do not think that anything i have said has given that impression <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord opposite has reminded the house i agreed to look at this matter <e> <s> there was no difference in policy between the noble lord and myself on this point <e> <s> as promised the wording of these clauses clauses to has been reviewed to ensure that it achieves the result that we both desire <e> <s> i am now advised that it does and in particular that appeals on preliminary points in summary proceedings which by virtue of the act of adjournal which governs procedure in these matters can only be pursued after a plea of guilty or not guilty has been tendered are appropriately covered <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this provision is to continue one which was inserted in the existing act of by the criminal justice scotland act <e> <s> it gives special treatment to someone who is facing prison or detention for the first time <e> <s> my noble friend is correct in saying that one of the circumstances may be when the person has failed to pay a fine when no time for payment is allowed and the court then considers a sentence of imprisonment or detention <e> <s> it also applies to the ordinary case where the court is considering such a sentence <e> <s> it is generally accepted that such a person is in a particularly serious situation and that he should have legal assistance if he wishes to put forward any arguments for an alternative sentence <e> <s> it is for that reason that the provision was first introduced in the act and was limited to the case when someone was facing imprisonment for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it right to remind your lordships as i stated when this matter was debated in committee that we consulted the sheriffs among others about the desirability of including such reserve power and they made quite clear that they would not welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords before dealing with the particular arguments which have been presented by noble lords may i thank the noble lord opposite for his point that he may have misrepresented the understanding between himself and myself as regards his amendment which was directed towards providing for a method of appeal in relation to advice and assistance <e> <s> i think i would wish just to make it clear that i promised to consult colleagues about the views expressed by the noble lord <e> <s> i have done so and they are considering the situation in the light of the committees views <e> <s> i can give no further commitment on the matter other than that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me just to put a point to him <e> <s> he referred to the legal aid authorities <e> <s> the only scheme which i have heard of is one to which the noble lord referred in committee <e> <s> i wonder whether that is the scheme to which he is referring because if so that was an outline scheme which was submitted on a personal basis and did not represent any official view whatsoever <e>", "<cs> it is covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given further consideration to this matter since the debate in committee when i did not respond to the point that is now being made that there should be an automatic grant of legal aid to someone who had originally funded his own defence and who after a successful appeal is subject to a retrial <e> <s> the government would wish to give further consideration to this matter and if they were to accept it to the wording of any provision which would give effect to their consideration <e> <s> it would obviously be more convenient if any such provision were to be included in an existing clause so that it attracted other relevant provisions rather than in a new separate clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place as the noble lord prayed in aid england as the reason for his amendment <e>", "<cs> and wales indeed as i am properly reminded by the noble and learned lord it is right to remind the house that the tests for the provision of criminal legal aid in england and wales are slightly different <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those who have spoken <e> <s> i shall deal first with a point that may be regarded as being wide of the mark in some sense but it was raised by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and concerns clause <e> <s> that deals with contempt of court which can be dealt with summarily by a court <e> <s> that being so that gives content to subsection <e> <s> indeed i believe i am correct in saying that it was introduced as a result of the contempt of court act <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can do no more than simply say that i have fully understood the points which the noble lord opposite has made <e> <s> i will certainly bring those points to the attention of those who are particularly concerned to see that these words fully express the intention of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i should make quite clear that what i said did not suggest i would be in a position to come forward with any clarification before the next stage <e> <s> but i certainly undertake that i shall bring the matter to the attention of my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords we have covered this ground in committee but i have since seen the comments of the central committee lay <e>", "<cs> my lords the formula which appears in this clause is one which was enacted as recently as with general support as i understand it from all parties <e> <s> it is now repeated in this bill <e> <s> i suggest that it is a much clearer exposition and one which your lordships should prefer <e> <s> under the present regulations relating to criminal legal aid fees the general principle is that there should be allowed such amount as may be determined in accordance with the regulations to be reasonable remuneration for work actually and reasonably done due regard being had for economy <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations under clause are designed to permit the secretary of state to provide for circumstances in which the expenses of the action are not to be a charge on property which is recovered or preserved <e> <s> they are a regulating power which is already found in section of the act and which is subject to negative procedure <e> <s> there is thus this precedent in existing legislation <e> <s> the power is one to relax in appropriate circumstances the normal requirements of clause which would otherwise be more strict than would be proposed in regulations <e> <s> in those circumstances i am not persuaded that the affirmative procedure would be appropriate <e> <s> in the light of those considerations i hope that my noble friend will agree to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i gave an assurance to my noble friend earlier when this particular point of consultation was raised <e> <s> i simply repeat what i said then about the generality of that matter <e> <s> however i would have to say that this amendment goes further because it deals with the position about laying reports before parliament <e> <s> i must say that such a provision would seem likely to give rise to difficulties because the board may well wish to back up its advice and of course it now has the power to advise generally with references to confidential matters <e> <s> moreover the amendment is quite general in regard to the reference to regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have felt more sympathy if the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping at least to respond before i sit down to the matters which the noble lord has raised <e> <s> perhaps i may leave that over <e> <s> i have not omitted it <e> <s> whether what i say will be thought by the noble lord to be a response is a matter for him but i assure him that i have not forgotten it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to say that i do not read the <e>", "<cs> my lords knowing my noble and learned friends wide catholicity of sunday reading i am sure that he will have read that article <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said my noble friend lord campbell also made certain points about clause <e> <s> in what i have said i have attempted to answer both the points that he raised and those raised by other noble lords <e> <s> my noble and learned friend will keep very much in mind the criticisms that have been made about the proposals and the fears that have been expressed <e> <s> i suggest that they are not merited but they are matters that are perhaps best discussed in committee <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have given a general welcome to what i suggest is a most useful measure of law reform <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen to acquaint the house that her majesty having been informed of the purport of the legal aid scotland bill has consented to place her prerogative and interest so far as they are affected by the bill at the disposal of parliament for the purpose of the bill <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite has spoken to amendments nos <e> <s> and along with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps i should make clear my attitude to amendment no <e> <s> first of all because it appears in a part of the bill that does not i suggest make it easy to add the words that are proposed in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considered this point again in the light of comments made by noble lords at report stage <e> <s> i said then that difficult and hard cases will always arise where one party to the proceedings is legally assisted and the other is not <e> <s> i must adhere to my original point <e> <s> there is a continuing need to make the best possible use of the resources available for legal aid and clause which merely restates the existing law as it is on both sides of the border makes a proper distinction in allowing the possibilty of a successful non-assisted defender obtaining his expenses from the fund but not an unassisted pursuer who in any case is in a sense in command of the action and may decide at any stage not to take it any further <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall respond to my noble friend <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i made clear on report that i would consider what had been said in particular by my noble friend lord selkirk on this matter <e> <s> it is only right to say at this stage that i have invited my right honourable friend to consider whether and if so how far there should be provision on the face of the bill for statutory consultations on regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords matters have been raised with regard to the undertaking which i gave on report <e> <s> i had thought i had made it clear that at that stage we were dealing with only an amendment to a particular regulation-making power <e> <s> there are others within the context of the bill <e> <s> i thought i had made it clear that i had a certain degree of sympathy with the views which were being expressed and that is why i have made quite clear as i did today that i have invited my right honourable friend to consider this very matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained at both committee stage and on report that there is indeed no right of appeal or indeed of review in criminal cases at present so far as legal aid is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this matter last week i said that the government were giving careful consideration to the suggestion that legal aid should be automatically available at least in certain circumstances in relation to new prosecutions which are authorised by the high court <e> <s> i explained then that we wished to consider not unsympathetically the need for automatic legal aid whether generally or in particular circumstances <e> <s> in any event we thought that the drafting was defective <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained i believe in some detail the primary purpose of these two subsections <e> <s> i accept that subsection is a power given to the board to arrange <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should say that the separate scottish legislation will be intended to give the scottish courts powers similar to those which under this bill are given to the english courts <e> <s> the purpose of the amendments to this bill is to allow english orders to become effective in scotland <e> <s> any separate scottish legislation would i am sure have similar cross-border enforcement for scottish orders so far as concerns assets which may be in england and wales <e> <s> so the two would i suggest we shall obviously have to wait and see the legislation which comes forward be able to run in train <e> <s> it may be that there will be one or two amendments and as to that i can give no undertaking at all at present <e> <s> but i have noted what the noble lord opposite has said <e>", "<cs> it is with some regret that i cannot accept the amendment of the noble lord <e> <s> the words execution of the recorded delivery are the reference to the certificate which is received at the time of posting <e> <s> the consequence of his amendment would be that that execution would be held for the purposes of subsection to be the day of intimation of the notice which would be complete nonsense because it would at that stage not even have gone out of the post office <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to do a discourtesy to the noble lord in not rising again <e> <s> i obviously will look at what he has said <e> <s> i have made plain the problem which i have outlined that there is no way in which effectively one can discover when the notice was intimated so that for instance a person who in perfect good faith may have given notice days before the commencement of the trial and the post has taken longer and it gets there days before <e> <s> that means that the prosecutor is cut off from his right because the first notice would have arrived there too late and the second notice would no longer be open to him <e> <s> that would mean perhaps that a difficulty could arise <e>", "<cs> i think i can satisfy the noble and learned lord that in accepting the advice he would not be acting with him the advice would be given to him and he would be acting as a trustee <e>", "<cs> obviously i take note of what the noble lord opposite and my noble friend have both said on this matter <e> <s> i have indicated the intention with which this new paragraph is brought forward in dealing with a particular problem <e> <s> my noble friend might care to consider again to whom we are looking in this matter of exclusion transfer agents and the like <e> <s> i shall study with care what both noble lords have said <e> <s> our minds are not closed as i have indicated and we should be happy to receive representations on this matter <e>", "<cs> i trust that when i opened the debate i made absolutely clear what was the purpose <e> <s> we think that putting the limit of per cent <e> <s> of the shares which have voting rights or per cent <e> <s> of the voting rights in all the circumstances is the right point at which to set the exclusion <e> <s> i have listened to what has been said in particular by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne who suggests that perhaps that might be made wider <e> <s> but we shall have to consider this further and that i have undertaken to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> your lordships will recollect that we had a lively discussion in this house on the guidance power in this clause <e> <s> that discussion was continued in another place <e> <s> as the government have frequently made clear guidance is intended to cover such matters as financial procedures but there is no intention that it should affect the consideration or disposal of applications <e> <s> however the government accepted in another place that this point could be made clearer and this is the purpose of the new subsection a of clause <e> <s> the new subsection does two things <e> <s> first it says in terms that any guidance given by the secretary of state cannot affect the consideration or disposal of applications in general as well as individual applications for legal aid or advice and assistance <e> <s> secondly it says that guidance cannot affect consideration or disposal of supplementary or incidental applications to the board <e> <s> this would prevent the secretary of state

two amendments fulfil the undertaking which the government gave in committee in another place to provide on the face of the bill for the establishment by the board of a review procedure in relation to refusals by the board of applications for legal aid both for civil cases and summary criminal proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> for the convenience of the house i should also like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have very much in mind what the noble and learned lord opposite has just said <e> <s> this amendment reinstates the subsection deleted in committee in your lordships house indicating in general terms on the face of the bill which summary proceedings for persons not in custody will be covered by criminal legal aid and which by assistance by way of representation <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential to that reinstatement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment results from our discussion of this point in committee when i promised to look further at it <e> <s> one of the reforms introduced by the bail scotland act was to enable the officer in charge of a police station to release a person who has been arrested and charged with an offence which may be tried summarily but to require that he give a written undertaking to appear in court on a specified day <e> <s> in practice as pointed out in discussion such undertakings usually require appearance within a very short time a day or two of the release and this may make it difficult for the accused to consult a solicitor in the normal way <e> <s> we therefore propose that in such circumstances he should be eligible for automatic legal aid in the same way as are persons in custody <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it describes exactly what is done <e> <s> it is a procedure in place of bail which is granted either by the court or in very exceptional circumstances i think i am right in saying by the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> again this amendment deals with a point which was raised in committee in your lordships house <e> <s> one of the innovations of the criminal justice scotland act was to enable the high court where an appeal against conviction was successful in some circumstances and where it was thought just to authorise the bringing of a new prosecution <e> <s> without this amendment the accused in such circumstances would have to apply for legal aid in the normal way either to the courts in solemn proceedings or to the board in summary cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have already spoken to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that

specific factor <e> <s> however i think it was pointed out then that a tailpiece of that kind might be a disadvantage to some applicants who might wish to say that because of their previous

i would be cautious but i suspect it is the letter in the alphabet <e> <s> if i am wrong about that it is perhaps a matter which i ought to have brought to your lordships attention earlier <e> <s> i

to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both my noble friends for what they have said in explanation of this amendment <e> <s> while making clear that i am happy to take it away to look at in the light of those remarks i should set out that the object of clause apart from providing a remedy for investors who are affected by the carrying on of investment business unlawfully is to impose some obligation on an authorised business to take care that none of its investment agreements arise because of the involvement of an unauthorised person <e> <s> thus for example if a business regularly uses introducers it ought to make sure that those who need to be authorised because of the nature of their business have secured authorisation <e> <s> i think my noble friends will understand that that is the purpose at which subsection <e>", "<cs> again the noble lord has raised a point giving more discretion to the court <e> <s> i think that i would have to say that i would be cautious in perhaps going along the road that he suggests of removing the words ought to have known from paragraph <e>", "<cs> i think that amendment no <e> <s> is a schedule <e> <s> it is unfortunate that on the marshalled list the schedule comes before the clauses <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i have obviously taken note of the remarks that have been made about the tabling of amendments <e> <s> i understand that the main amendments were tabled last tuesday and that briefing notes on the government amendments have been made available through the whips office <e> <s> the briefing note on this group of amendments has been available for some days and it spells out all the consequential and transitional provisions that are included in this group as well as the substantive provisions <e> <s> however obviously i take note of what has been said by noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> i obviously regret that the noble lord feels as strongly as he does <e> <s> his was a mild protest at the start and i merely took note of it <e> <s> certainly i regret that the noble lord did not have sufficient time <e> <s> of course these matters are dealt with through the usual channels <e> <s> i merely pointed out that we have endeavoured to assist by making the notes on clauses available <e> <s> however i take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assist the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i think the reason for what appear to be different remedies is that if one deals with clause one is dealing with an application by the secretary of state to enforce an order or a direction which he himself has made <e> <s> therefore it is appropri-ate as i understand it in english procedure to seek a <e>", "<cs> i spoke to the new clauses which are contained in amendments nos <e> <s> and a and in the light of those i beg to move that clause shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> in like manner i beg to move that clause shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> when this clause was amended in another place we deliberately did not go further say expressly to remove remedies which were available at common law <e> <s> i would suggest to the committee as i stated earlier that we would be going too far in doing this in regard to the recognised professional bodies <e> <s> there may be some doubt as to whether such remedies would be granted to an individual but it should be open to someone who is suffering loss as a result of a failure to notify for example one thinks of a member whose name has been omitted from the register of authorised persons to seek a remedy from the courts <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the noble viscount is echoing views expressed by his honourable friends in another place on this point <e> <s> i would suggest that the power that is sought is unnecessary for the proper function of the regulatory system <e> <s> it is expected that most businesses will choose to become authorised through membership of a sro <e> <s> indeed these bodies form the cornerstone of practitioner-based regulation <e> <s> those sros now in the process of formation are being created at the initiative of practitioners who are making their contribution to the development of effective regulation in their area of expertise <e> <s> these bodies with their strong practitioner input will be close to the market place <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble lord that it is important for changes in partner-ship to be notified to the regulator <e> <s> i would suggest that the powers already in clause that is to deal with notification regulations will enable just that end effect to be achieved <e> <s> the secretary of state or the agency will be able to make regulations about notification of specified events and i would certainly expect changes in a partnership to be covered by those regulations <e>", "<cs> obviously i cannot give an undertaking <e> <s> as i have said i would expect that regulations would require notification of changes <e> <s> what has been said in committee tonight i have no doubt will be noted in other quarters <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lord opposite regards this as a probing amendment <e> <s> clause fulfils a european communities treaty obligation <e> <s> it provides that a person from another member state is authorised to carry on investment business in the united kingdom on a services basis that is a person from another country without a permanent place of business here provided that he is authorised to carry on some or all kinds of investment business by his home state and provided that the law under which he is authorised affords investors in the united kingdom protection at least equivalent to the bills provisions concerning the granting and revocation of authorisation <e> <s> i think that that explains the first point about the phrase of any kind <e>", "<cs> i know that this is one of the contentious issues in the bill <e> <s> although the noble lords opposite have not spoken i think it is only right that in what i say now i should cover the whole of the governments case both as regards this amendment and generally on the matter of lloyds <e> <s> the case is quite simple <e> <s> in essence it is that it is not only wrong to make a judgment on lloyds before sir patrick neills inquiry is complete but that in any event this bill is ill-equipped for the task of regulating lloyds <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief because i have already spoken on the general matter to which the noble lord opposite addressed himself <e> <s> i listened as i always do to the noble lord opposite to find out why he was suggesting that lloyds should be brought within the provisions of the bill other than as an exempt person <e> <s> i listened throughout his speech and by the end of it i had not heard one ground from him to suggest that there was any good reason for bringing lloyds within the bill <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the noble lords wish to have a proper scrutiny of additions to the list of exemptions in chapter iv but i think that the bill as it stands meets his point <e> <s> the majority of additional exemptions to be considered under this provision would i expect fall into one of two categories <e> <s> first they will add to the list of miscellaneous exemptions as in clause <e> <s> thus they will concern persons who perform a function under another statute part of which may be regarded as investment business <e> <s> additions may be necessary for instance to take account of changing legislation changing titles or changing functions <e>", "<cs> i can go no further <e> <s> i did say that the majority of the additional exemptions to be considered would fall within one of two categories <e> <s> the affirmative resolution procedure is where there is a restriction and there i do see that it would be proper to have the affirmative procedure <e> <s> i feel that there is however a difference with additions as opposed to subtractions <e> <s> it is for that reason that the balance has been taken here <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having raised this point <e> <s> i am aware that there has been much concern about the question of extra-territoriality <e> <s> we have to face the fact however that modern communications mean that persons situated in overseas territories are able easily to transact business with investors in the united kingdom and equally since one of the objectives of the bill is to establish the united kingdom as a clean place to do business in we do not want to exclude from the protection of the bill foreigners including those located overseas who transact business with firms situated in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i am happy to look again at what the noble lord has said and see whether there is some way in which this might be taken into the bill though i give no undertaking that it is possible <e>", "<cs> it is appropriate to advise the committee that certain representations on the precise wording of clause have been received from the law society and from others involved in advertising <e> <s> i ought to tell the committee that in the light of those comments i expect that amendments to the drafting rather than to the substance of the clause and to those clauses related to it will be brought before noble lords at a later stage in our proceedings <e>", "<cs> i regret that it will be too late to deal with them in committee and that is why i have given the information i have on clause stand part <e> <s> the amendments will obviously be presented on report or later <e>", "<cs> i can only say to my noble friend that i shall have to take advice and perhaps i may write to him to let him know what is the position <e> <s> as i said amendment no <e> <s> was spoken to with an earlier amendment <e> <s> i understand that it just includes clause after the reference to clause <e>", "<cs> i have taken note of what the noble lord said but i think that i should make clear that the purpose of a disqualification direction is not to punish the individual but to protect investors <e> <s> if an individual has been shown not to be fit and proper it is difficult to say when he will become fit and proper or indeed whether he ever will be fit and proper <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving the amendment <e> <s> we were concerned to make sure that where an investor for example failed to realise a profit to which he was entitled the use of the phrase <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this point <e> <s> i shall make just two comments <e> <s> the right of action which is given by the clause is given to a person who suffers loss as a result of the contravention or is otherwise adversely affected by the contravention <e> <s> the problem is that the investor here is envisaged as taking the action with regard to misconduct by the other party or parties <e> <s> it is difficult at least at the moment to see how there could be any basis for suggesting that the claimant should bear some share of responsibility for such a contravention as is set out in clause <e>", "<cs> this is a matter on which i should like to think again <e> <s> judging from the way in which the clause is framed if the person who <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> perhaps i may say at the outset that there is no gaming act for scotland and accordingly the common law has not been ousted there and that gives rise to the distinction between the two laws <e> <s> the view which is taken and the advice which i have been given is that the common law in england and wales has been ousted by the gaming acts <e> <s> the bill as a whole provides the statutory basis for regulation of business involving investment agreements and in clause specifically provides for the circumstances in which such contracts may be unenforceable and the consequences that would follow <e> <s> it is therefore i am advised inconceivable that any court in england and wales would attempt as a matter of public policy to apply a rule of common law to an investment agreement governed by the provisions of the bill instead of seeking to apply the appropriate statutory provisions and so the amendment is in effect unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i shall look again with those who advise us at what the noble lord lord hacking has said <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord opposite i think i was perfectly well aware of what he was intending in amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> all i would say is that under paragraph the question of whether a contract is or is not made for investment purposes will of course be determined at the time at which it is made and on the terms which are expressed in it at that time <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just reply to the point which the noble lord opposite asked about amendment no <e> <s> as he asked for a response from me <e> <s> i am advised that neither of these examples will be covered by the bill as amended <e> <s> the second will be excluded because it would not fall within the definition that it has to be advice as to the merits of an investment <e> <s> i am advised that if the first were to fall within new paragraph it is almost inconceivable that the directors or the company which they represent would engage in this activity <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps with the leave of the house i may respond to the noble lords last point <e> <s> i would say that so far as the second paragraph of amendment no <e> <s> is concerned if it were directed to taxation and so on that would not be about the merits in a persons capacity as an investor <e> <s> that is a point which i would put <e> <s> i am bound to say again that we are talking about something which happens to be a business <e> <s> i have said already that i think it is almost inconceivable that this situation would arise and with all due respect to the noble lord opposite this is not really a grey area <e> <s> i would suggest that his amendment would perhaps be unfortunate because of what it would do generally to this paragraph <e> <s> in the circumstances i think i have made my position clear on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no

purchaser <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to say this i do not think i was disputing that certain takeovers might not be covered <e> <s> i was merely saying that the takeover code

spoken on what all of us recognise to be an important matter the question of authorisation <e> <s> i have to say however that i am not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for raising these points <e> <s> i recognise the concern that he has expressed in relation to them <e> <s> i am advised that the existing wording of the bill in relation to paragraph of schedule one of

noble lord has made it plain that it should be and i think i would agree with him <e> <s> without giving an undertaking i shall certainly bring this to the attention of my right honourable friend who will be responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of the noble lord opposite in these matters <e> <s> it is already possible under the bill for a person to hold certificates issued by more than one rpb so long as each of those rpbs ensures that the conditions in paragraph of schedule are met <e> <s> for example if both the english and the scottish accountancy institutes were to be recognised professional bodies they would be able to issue a certificate to a partnership which consisted of members of both institutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the spirit in which this amendment is moved <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will come with me through certain other parts of the bill and i hope that <e>", "<cs> my lords i turn back to page of the bill to schedule which relates to the requirement so far as concerns the rules <e> <s> these rules as regards the carrying on of business must <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the spirit in which this amendment was put down <e> <s> i think that it is fair to say that the amendment as it stands at present and i accept it as being a probing amendment is related both to guidance issued and any recommendation made by a body to all or any class of its members <e> <s> i have to say that so far as concerns recommendations we have here to take account of the provisions of the restrictive trade practices act which for services supply associations and they could well include professional bodies provide that the agreement for the constitution of the association may include any specific recommendations whether expressed or implied which members have agreed to comply with <e> <s> i think that the noble lord opposite will understand that it may be in those circumstances that recommendations may not be made in writing and for that reason the words in writing were not incorporated in this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may explain why there is a difference between the self-regulating organisations all of whose members will be carrying on investment business and what is intended by this part of the bill dealing with rpbs <e> <s> the reason why discretion has been retained for the secretary of state or the designated agency to refuse to recognise a professional body even if it meets the specified criteria is that it is possible to think of an application from a professional body where very few members of that body will be carrying on investment business <e> <s> i do not say that that necessarily will happen and i should have thought it is unlikely to be so <e> <s> nevertheless it is something which could happen <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might make it clear <e> <s> i am not suggesting a profession <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i respond to that <e> <s> i would simply say to the noble lord that over the bill as a whole we have taken the view that it is undesirable to have an unnecessarily large number of regulators each with its own rules <e> <s> thus with regard to self-regulating organisations there is the ability to refuse recognition <e>", "<cs> my lords again i appreciate the point being raised <e> <s> i would simply say to the noble lord opposite that there are two things that must happen here <e> <s> the rules must give the protection which is set out in paragraph which would obviously involve them containing the elements which are to be found in the clause to which i have referred <e> <s> that would include the manner of carrying on business <e>", "<cs> my lords i have endeavoured to answer the first point and i cannot go further <e> <s> as regards the second point concerning membership the professional body must look to itself <e> <s> i am simply pointing out that the rules look to the protection to be afforded to investors <e> <s> if the professional body in seeking to come forward for recognition considers it appropriate to protect its membership by limiting the individuals however it wishes to do so who are able within its rules to carry on investment business that is very much a matter for the profession <e> <s> i am simply saying that paragraph of schedule properly within the policy of the bill is aimed at the protection of investors <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply first to the latter point and simply say that if one puts amendment no <e> <s> against amendment no <e> <s> it becomes quite clear in amendment no <e> <s> in its reference back to paragraph a which goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not aware of any pressure from rpbs for such an amendment <e> <s> i am not convinced that the amendment adds anything of value <e> <s> i should not expect the secretary of state or a designated agency to use powers under this clause unless discussions with the rpb concerned had failed to achieve the desired result <e>", "<cs> my lords the first amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> if the noble lord turns to subsection he will find that it provides that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps i ought to acknowledge at the outset that noble lords opposite in this amendment have apparently moved some way towards the governments position <e> <s> that must be at least to some extent gratifying but noble lords i think still have some way to go before they complete the way to damascus <e> <s> i would hope to complete their conversion this evening and persuade them to arrive at their destination <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should first say that what we are doing here is dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think i can give the clarification <e> <s> in reading clause with clause it is apparent that <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i give that assurance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this matter and to noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> my noble friend lord marshall and the noble lord lord graham made powerful points <e> <s> as my noble friend lord kimball said my honourable friend in another place recognised that there was genuine concern about the potential for abuse <e> <s> he asked the board to consider what had been said during the debate on report in another place <e> <s> that has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend because he has said most succinctly what i was going to say at perhaps more length <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would place upon the prosecutor the onus of establishing dishonesty dishonesty is a term which does not itself appear in this clause for good reasons <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord roskill in his commissions report on fraud and i refer to paragraphs to identified the existing problems which the courts had found when they were asked to consider what was meant by the terms fraud and acting fraudulently and the synonymous concept of dishonesty <e> <s> the purpose here was to provide a clear and direct description of the offence avoiding the confusions which the noble and learned lord described <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with the last question that the noble lord lord grimond put to me <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord williams also asked about this <e> <s> the deletion of subsection will have to be read in conjunction with what is proposed in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord grimond will there find a restatement of the provisions with regard to advertisements issued outside the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that we are at one in seeking the maximum flexibility which is compatible with the general policy <e> <s> perhaps i may just answer the noble lords first point <e> <s> obviously it will be for the regulations themselves to draw the line but i would point out that there is a power for any exemption to be made subject to conditions <e> <s> so there one has a form of flexibility <e> <s> the regulations themselves will as i said be subject to parliamentary scrutiny so the kind of point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have indicated what i intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i caution your lordships against accepting the amendments of the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> perhaps i should say at the outset that i did him the discourtesy of failing to mention his helpful comments in the debate in committee <e> <s> these were matters to which we also had regard in bringing forward our amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords clause contains powers to prohibit persons from disposing of or otherwise dealing in any assets and the powers may be used when it appears that their use is desirable for the protection of investors or if it seems that an authorised person is not fit to carry on investment business of some kind or that he has contravened rules under the bill <e> <s> an obvious example of the use of powers would be to prevent a person who owed investors money or who held money on their behalf from disposing of assets which might otherwise be used to settle his debts or liabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord opposite has indicated this appears in the regulatory part of the bill <e> <s> i should say at the outset that it is difficult to see any point in making regulatory provisions and rules if they can be ignored without attracting any sanction <e> <s> as noble lords opposite know i would point out that knowingly furnishing false information is normally not just a regulatory breach hut of course a criminal offence <e> <s> in our opinion these amendments would seriously weaken the effectiveness of the regulatory structure because after all ignorance of regulatory rules and requirements can cause as much damage as knowing contraventions <e> <s> perhaps i may give an example a firm which ignorantly fails to maintain proper books and records or to segregate client money can harm it clients as much as one which deliberately cooks the books or defrauds them <e> <s> ignorance is thus dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise merely to show that we on this side of the house are not stony-hearted and that an occasional drip may strike home <e> <s> therefore i am happy to accept the amendment <e> <s> as regards what the noble lord lord graham has said obviously i have taken note of it <e> <s> i do not think i can properly respond at this time but i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to his remarks tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not think it necessary to provide for access to the tribunal where a direction is given under clause to a unit trust manager or trustee <e> <s> the role of the tribunal is essentially to safeguard against the possibility of a person being unfairly deprived of the opportunity to carry on investment business or to be employed on investment business <e> <s> the tribunal will also cover the use of the extensive powers under chapter vi of part i which can for example be used to restrict business or to vest assets in a trustee <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble lord perhaps i may set out in a little detail the reasons for this part of the bill and why i would suggest that your lordships should not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to recommend that the house accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords several of your lordships have made it clear that we are still in an early stage of discussion involving sib and interested bodies <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the sib has suggested they are not decided that in the area of insurance and unit trusts there should be a clear polarisation of insurance intermediaries so that an investor will know if he is dealing either with a fully independent adviser or with a company representative selling the policies of a single company or group <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps with leave i may respond <e> <s> i did not suggest that i did not recognise the concerns expressed by noble lords this evening <e> <s> a debate of this kind is extremely helpful in formulating the discussions that ought to take place <e> <s> i do not think i can go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords this provision is evidence of the governments belief that there ought to be a broadly similar approach to this question across the field of the financial sector <e> <s> there is already a similar provision in the building societies act <e> <s> the government intend if parliament agrees that there will be such in forthcoming banking legislation and there is similar provision for investment business in the bill <e> <s> there is in principle no reason why insurance companies should be treated differently <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of points that i could make <e> <s> i shall mention one namely that article of the listing particulars directive explicitly imposes a requirement to provide investors and their advisers with the information necessary to make an informed assessment of the prospects of the issuer <e> <s> we therefore have no alternative <e> <s> i suggest that the noble lord opposite might withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have obviously looked at this amendment and i have listened carefully to the noble lords explanation i have to say that i see no risk of confusion <e> <s> i think the different senses in which require is used in each of the separate subsections are quite clear from the context <e> <s> the distinction drawn between the requirements of the clause and the requirements and expectations of investors and advisers is a false one as subsection equates the two <e> <s> the amendment would add to the length of the clause without aiding comprehension <e> <s> i recommend your lordships to reject it although the noble lord will i am sure on reflection withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to commend these amendments to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the concern which the noble lord has voiced <e> <s> i should say that i do not consider that this subsection goes wider than the companies act <e> <s> indeed the advice i have received is that in this context it is clear that the companies act covers authorisation of part of a document only <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> i have in fact gone too quickly <e> <s> in moving this amendment i should speak to amendments nos <e> <s> to and in the name of my noble friend and also to amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly this amendment represents a significant widening of private companies ability to advertise their securities <e> <s> it could allow them to advertise certain securities to the public at large <e> <s> subsection already goes some way towards easing the restrictions on offers of securities by private companies <e> <s> this is to give them more scope to raise capital <e> <s> to reduce further the fundamental distinction between public <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have made our position clear as regards the last amendment to which my noble friend responded <e> <s> as i understand it that is the extent of what has been agreed <e> <s> i do not think i can suggest that noble lords should accept this amendment <e> <s> it runs further than the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at the outset that the purpose of this subsection is to cover the necessity to have on the statute book a clear criminal offence which outlaws market manipulation <e> <s> subsections and of clause in the form in which they have been committed to us by another place are intended to give a clear message to the practitioners in the financial markets that the deliberate undertaking of an act or course of conduct which gives a false or misleading impression which deceives investors as to the price or value of any investments will be prohibited <e> <s> these subsections are intended to provide those responsible for enforcing the law with a better means to raise a successful prosecution where markets have been manipulated and investors have been deceived <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think in a sense i answered him when i was trying to set out what the prosecution would have to prove in respect of subsection <e> <s> it is not just the question of his intention for the purpose of creating the impression <e> <s> the subsection goes on of thereby inducing another person to do certain things <e> <s> it is the whole act <e> <s> leaving aside what i have said already that would not be apt to apply to a journalist <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the purpose of these amendments <e> <s> i would draw his attention to the fact that under the existing defence in subsection it is open to the accused person to show that he reasonably believed that his actual course of conduct would not create an impression that was false or misleading as to the market in or price or value of any investments <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly share the concern of the noble lord that listing particulars and prospectuses should be truthful and not misleading but from that point i am afraid that i cannot agree with him that the particular criminal sanctions he proposes are necessary or desirable <e> <s> i see no reason to attach the sanction to registration of the listing particulars rather than to inducing investors to acquire the securities <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that i have been persuaded entirely by what the noble lord said in the latter part of his speech on report rather than by the first part but i think he and i are agreed that the record is not accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to this amendment i shall also speak to the government amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i wish to make clear at the outset that i shall be inviting your lordships to accept that amendment and not the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> when we discussed this subject briefly at report stage i set out the government view on the matter <e> <s> i take up a point made by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> we are talking here about an extension of the principle of immunity <e> <s> the point from which the government have always worked is that there should be no immunity unless the government have been satisfied that the public interest requires it and there is no other course open <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that the noble lord has raised an extremely important point <e> <s> the bill is intended to provide investors with the protection they deserve <e> <s> against that background it will be understood that the government thought long and hard before concluding that the organisations involved in providing this protection should be immune from actions for damages brought at the suit of investors <e> <s> nonetheless we concluded on balance that such immunity should be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords reasons for returning to this matter having raised it initially in committee <e> <s> perhaps i could just put the record straight <e> <s> i think that my noble friend who was called upon to respond at that time indicated that the onus of proof of the offence will lie upon the prosecutor the person who brings the charge <e> <s> i am glad to say and i give my noble friend out of for this that he was absolutely correct as concerns proving that the partnership has committed an offence <e> <s> but i do not think that answers the point which the noble lord raised about the position of individual partners <e> <s> indeed i think my noble friend indicated that he would like to take further advice on the matter and i now find myself here to answer the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to accept the clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the noble lord has put right the clear error in the amendment as printed i am glad to say that there is nothing between the noble lord and myself in terms of ultimate objectives <e> <s> i believe however that as it stands the subsection achieves the outcome we both want <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the points that the noble lord has put forward <e> <s> i would correct him only in one regard in his lengthy quotation <e> <s> the textbook to which he referred is in fact by weinberg and not by weinberger and blank <e> <s> that may indicate the source of his text <e> <s> the government cannot accept these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to minors contracts <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor i beg to introduce a bill to enable the united kingdom to ratify the convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition which was signed on behalf of the united kingdom on th january <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill he now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for both interventions <e> <s> i can assure the noble and learned lord lord simon that it is not a matter of drafting that gives a rise to my using the child abduction and custody act as a guide it is merely to say that there were administrative provisions in the convention which were omitted for that reason <e> <s> that is the point that i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords the second matter about which the noble and learned lord asked related to business trusts <e> <s> business as well as ordinary family trusts are covered <e> <s> article c specifically refers to the place of business of the trustee <e> <s> i hope that that may be of some assistance to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that the motion standing in my name on the order paper the maximum number of judges scotland order which was laid before the house on th november this year be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate and generally for the welcome that they have given the bill <e> <s> obviously i look forward to the committee stage <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord morton recognised that some of the matters he raised were ones which could figure in committee <e> <s> i was a little amused at one point where the noble lord made reference to the exemptions in clause observing that as he was no doubt well aware the bill is based on the draft which the law commission itself proposed <e> <s> i think he will find that that clause is in almost exactly the form in which the law commission put it forward <e> <s> but as he said the law commission may be wrong so we may talk about refrigerators sideboards and cupboards in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will take the inference from the figures <e> <s> i was merely indicating that these are the most important figures <e> <s> for that reason i continue to advise your lordships that the law commissions views are the appropriate way to provide in this bill for the most humane method of securing the interests of both the creditor and the debtor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased on behalf of the government to have an opportunity to declare the governments support for this bill <e> <s> my noble friend has indicated in his very clear introduction to the bill the purpose of it as simplifying and clarifying the existing law on civil liability in relation to animals in scotland <e> <s> indeed he has made it clear that the bill is not intended to make any changes in the existing law of negligence or indeed of nuisance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish to give more than my personal opinion which is not to be regarded as a legal opinion <e> <s> my recollection of the ordinary rules of negligence is that if the gate was amply secured and plainly intended to be kept closed and if the owner could establish that it was not he who had opened the gate he could not be said to be in breach of a duty of care and therefore could not be liable <e> <s> however i hesitate in that i am giving an opinion off the cuff and i am no longer in private practice <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> indeed that is the purpose of subsection which states <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for setting out the reasons for moving the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord has obviously touched on matters which i think we will debate in due course and with which i would not wish to deal at the moment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i see a possible difficulty arising in this case <e> <s> i am not sure that the form of words which he has used is necessarily the happiest way to deal with it but i should like to reflect further on the matter and if judged proper deal with it at report stage <e> <s> on that undertaking perhaps the noble lord might like to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> a slight blast of trumpets from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> a later amendment amendment no <e> <s> is aimed to take out what might be described as the most infelicitous phrase in this subsection <e> <s> my noble friend lord beaverbrook will be replying to that but the indications are that he will give it a fair wind <e> <s> if that infelicity were taken out one would find that the subsection would approximate to what i was attempting in an earlier debate to indicate was the purpose of expressing in this part of the bill what we thought the directive was seeking to achieve <e> <s> i said then that we wanted to use words which were known and precedented in our statutes <e> <s> that is exactly what we have done in relation to the general thrust of this subsection especially the use of the words without prejudice to <e>", "<cs> i had not anticipated such an interesting and extensive debate on this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for putting so clearly the points to be answered <e> <s> as regards the first point so far as pharmacists are concerned and i use the word pharmacists advisedly that is covered by the directive itself <e> <s> i read from the first paragraph of article <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord opposite i do not know that we are talking about jurisdiction in quite the same way as he was suggesting <e> <s> nevertheless i accept that the noble lord has made a point regarding the general principle that lies behind the proposed amendment <e> <s> however if we were to make the express provision in the bill which he seeks we must obviously try to work out the practical consequences <e> <s> in particular we would have to be sure that we were not inadvertently extending or overturning legislative policies enacted on the assumption that they were dealing with torts delicts or quasi-delicts which are based on fault <e> <s> i understand that a search has revealed that there are well over references to tort alone on the statute book <e> <s> no doubt there will also be a considerable number of references to delict <e> <s> i assure the committee that we shall be considering these as speedily as we can <e> <s> i expect that we will be able to complete the exercise before report stage and that we shall be able to bring proposals before your lordships at that time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is correct because he has already read out the relevant passages <e> <s> he started off with any person and i emphasise the word any <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not make the matter clear <e> <s> the noble lord is correct <e> <s> as i should have gone on to say the words in brackets make quite clear the chain along which you proceed <e> <s> if we take it that the person who supplied the product to the person who suffered damage responds by saying i received it from somebody else who was the supplier and if that supplier is then asked he is under the same duty to respond back along the chain until eventually the question elicits the response which meets what is required under subsection or it gets no response at all in which case the buck stops at that point so to speak <e> <s> i hope that is sufficient for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> that as is always said is a matter for the court <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of response <e> <s> i have given the committee the advice that i have received that that is the intention of article and that if one looks at it in the light of the whole directive the intention is to deal with design a design which however may be one which has been the subject of instructions given to the manufacturer of the component by the manufacturer of the product <e> <s> as i say it is upon that advice that i have to advise your lordships that this clause is framed as it is <e>", "<cs> with respect i think the amendment has already been withdrawn and the noble lord is therefore out of order <e>", "<cs> i have made it quite clear that the advice i have received was from those officials who advise in these matters <e> <s> it is upon that basis which i have indicated to your lordships that the article is translated as it is into the bill <e>", "<cs> i recognise that this is an important point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> in regard to death or personal injury claims i think the noble and learned lord lord denning extended this to the other kind of damage <e> <s> i should say that the bill is framed to make it clear that as the directive intends for property loss it will simply be the loss or damage to the property that is covered and no economic loss resulting therefrom <e>", "<cs> let me come back to say that this is why i was very careful at the outset to make clear that what i am talking about in my undertaking relates only to that part of the clause which deals with death or personal injury <e> <s> we read the directive as making it clear that so far as property damage is concerned it does not extend beyond damage to property to other economic loss <e>", "<cs> i invite the committee not to accept the amendment <e> <s> i do so for a number of reasons <e> <s> the principal reason relates to the directive <e> <s> i accept that if one goes through the directive one finds many places where it does not fully work out the consequences of the provision contained in article which provides that a product may include products incorporated into other products <e> <s> this is one of those places <e> <s> we take the view that the reference to the defective product in article b is reasonably and rightly to be construed as including any product in which a defective component is comprised <e>", "<cs> i understand that to be the case <e> <s> i shall certainly be happy to try to obtain a copy for the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i would simply say that the memorandum is not contradicting the directive <e> <s> it makes clear the commissions view and it will be the commission at the end of the day which will be ensuring that the directive is implemented as to the effect of this article <e> <s> obviously all member countries will be taking that into account when they are drafting their legislation based upon this directive <e> <s> that is the reason why i thought it was extremely pertinent to quote it in some length to the committee to make it quite clear why it is that we have taken the view that we have done about the effect of this article <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> i assure the committee that we are attempting to represent in words which the courts have been accustomed to use the concepts in the directive <e> <s> perhaps i may take each in turn <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that applying my own legal knowledge and this is a personal view i see the ambiguity which has been discovered in the directive on one view of it <e> <s> it is plainly a view which may be wrong <e> <s> in an attempt to translate the concept in the directive a description of property is very much better than putting in the word type which leaves the ambiguity there <e> <s> i assure the committee that this has obviously been the subject of very anxious consideration by parliamentary draftsmen in particular and i would certainly accept their advice that that represents what the directive is seeking to achieve <e>", "<cs> in response to the noble lord opposite i am going to say something <e> <s> i think the words or other are otiose <e> <s> if one looks in relation to the noble lords first question at the words of article it would have the strange result that if you purchased something and it were to injure you before <e>", "<cs> all i shall say is simply that i have listened to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am not persuaded by his first point about the continuing loss because one has to start with a defect in a product <e> <s> one has to find out what the product is and the defect <e> <s> perhaps the question of being subjected to asbestos dust in ones employment is a slightly different question <e>", "<cs> it would be for the covenience of the committee and of the noble lord if i were to say that i am entirely persuaded by what he is about to say <e> <s> if it would save time i indicate now my acceptance of this amendment <e>", "<cs> clause provides as i understand it that part i will not apply to northern ireland <e> <s> the result will be that it will have to be regarded as being applicable only to the other parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> that includes the part providing that so far as consumer safety is concerned it will not be regarded as a transferred matter for the purposes of the northern ireland constitution act but will be a reserved matter that is a subject to be legislated upon on a uk basis <e> <s> this is consequential to extending part ii to the whole of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting i hope that nothing i have said so far suggests that the directive does not apply to northern ireland <e> <s> it is simply the manner in which it would be brought into effect <e> <s> the provisions of part i are not extended to northern ireland as i said because the material is similar to the law of negligence which is a transferred subject <e> <s> therefore a separate order will have to be made for northern ireland <e> <s> that i hope makes the matter clearer than i perhaps have been able to make it previously <e>", "<cs> it would be wrong for me to suggest i think that it would be in exactly the same words as part i if there is to be an order in council for northern ireland it would take account of the law as it applies there <e> <s> certainly the directive applies <e> <s> the means by which it will be brought forward will of course be by way of an order in council <e>", "<cs> this is an offence which follows upon the preamble as it were in subsection where safety regulations require any person to give information and so on <e> <s> it says that a person would be guilty of an offence if he fails to do certain things or then gives information which he knows to be false or recklessly makes a statement <e>", "<cs> we agree <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord with his experience as a solicitor was not aware that in sections and of the sheriff courts scotland act as amended there is already statutory provision for an appeal from a decision of the sheriff in a summary application to both the sheriff principal and the court of session <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite correct in saying that these are provisions which were enacted only last year and at that time parliament was satisfied that it was appropriate that the powers should be taken <e> <s> nothing that the noble lord has said suggests that there was any reason why the arguments then put forward were in any way improperly based <e> <s> indeed the results of his researches from the th century to the present day are dealing with a somewhat different topic <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside for reminding us of a matter in our scottish criminal justice system namely that there is no right to compensation for an individual <e> <s> it has to be borne in mind that there are many cases in which compensation would be entirely inappropriate for example where a person by his own actions brings reasonable suspicion to bear on himself or when an accused is acquitted on purely technical grounds <e> <s> this was the kind of point the noble and learned lord was making <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the point that the noble and learned lord has just put to the noble lord opposite <e> <s> i noticed in passing that he failed to make any reference to the terms of section of the drug trafficking offences act which i understood was a bill supported by his party <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> as set out in the marshalled list appears to be an amendment to clause but it should be an amendment to clause <e> <s> in those circumstances it may be appropriate that the noble lord the deputy chairman of committees should put to the committee that clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am delighted on this occasion that there is unanimity of view about the amendment that is before the committee <e> <s> i take the point of the noble lord opposite about the use of power <e> <s> i would anticipate as i am sure he would that sheriffs would not simply use the opportunity given by an increase in their power of sentence to increase sentences in particular cases before them <e> <s> equally i imagine that all sheriffs would be conscious of the reasons why there is the power to remit and would use it when they think the circumstances so justify <e> <s> that was precisely why parliament thought fit to give them that power for their use <e>", "<cs> i am entirely confident that the sheriffs would carry out their judicial office properly <e> <s> i certainly did not intend to suggest otherwise <e> <s> i do not think that i did and i do not think the noble lord opposite was intending to make that point <e> <s> i believe what he was saying was that he would expect the bench wherever it be to approach each case properly in exercising the judicial function and that the fact that there has been an increase in sentencing power should not and will not have any effect upon their approach in individual cases <e>", "<cs> obviously i have listened with interest to what the noble lord has said in support of the two new clauses which he proposes <e> <s> i do not think this is an appropriate place in which to rejoin battle with the noble lord opposite as we did as counsel in the case to which he referred <e> <s> as he has made clear this is a legal point on which a body of case law has been built up and more particularly very recently built up <e> <s> i am not yet convinced that it would be advisable to project a legislative intervention of the kind which he proposes into this arena <e> <s> but i should like to reflect upon what he has said and perhaps i could let him know what view i reach at least in the near future and perhaps before report stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord opposite for bringing these two amendments forward <e> <s> they provide an opportunity for me to state the governments position with regard to the recommendations of the scottish law commission in the report to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> as the commission indicated in its report there were considerable differences of view as to the possible advantages of a general aiding and abetting provision <e> <s> those differences caused them some difficulty since i think that the groups holding opposing views were about equal in number and each contained consultees whose views always carried great weight <e>", "<cs> i think that the answer lies in the fact that the bill was introduced in september last year <e> <s> at that time it would have been <e>", "<cs> i am only too aware that it is but a short time since an anniversary of robert burns birth <e> <s> while i do not think this amendment has any substantive effect and nor is it necessary to enhance the bills clarity i should like to look at it again though i give no undertaking whatsoever that i shall come back with any alteration <e> <s> as i believe the noble lord opposite accepts it is important from the point of view of scottish practitioners for there to be a separate paragraph for scotland <e> <s> his argument was directed perhaps to a slightly different target because he has what he needs <e> <s> obviously without giving an undertaking i shall consider this again particularly in view of the fact that some support was given by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to attempt to satisfy the noble lords curiosity <e> <s> in clause one starts off with a general reference to accommodation and facilities but the purpose of clause is to deal with the extent to which this part applies to real property that is the provision of accommodation which involves the creation or the transfer of an interest in land <e>", "<cs> the abuse to which i referred and perhaps i should have dealt with it earlier is that in relation to new homes or what i might term starter homes <e> <s> these were being increasingly marketed in much the same way as any other product and typically there were offers made free in relation to such homes <e>", "<cs> i think with respect that the noble lord may have misunderstood my definition of a new home <e> <s> it is of course that in the bill <e> <s> it is a new dwelling which means any building as referred to in subsection <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to the words main or only and that point was dealt with during the debate we had as a consequence of his noble friends amendment <e> <s> i am going to look at that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord opposite for having made clear the reason for his query <e> <s> i think that it has always been recognised that in relation to legal proceedings there is a special privilege that attaches which does not attach in general to other communications between advisers <e> <s> i believe that the best thing i can do this evening is to say that i shall take note of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am not persuaded that there is in fact any similarity in the matter of privilege between what is covered here and the privilege which may attach in commerical dealings between an accountant for instance and his client when it comes to legal proceedings <e> <s> i make that absolutely plain <e> <s> however i should like to consider the matter further since the noble lord has raised it and perhaps i may write to him <e>", "<cs> the schedule is of course being considered at its proper time as was explained at the outset of the committees discussions <e> <s> let me say that while i appreciate the reasons why the noble lord raises this matter it is as well to see where the provision falls which his amendment seeks to amend <e> <s> it is of course in section of the act <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware from his study of that act section reads as follows <e>", "<cs> the noble lord started with an irrelevancy and proceeded to deal with a matter that is not of course strictly before the committee tonight with regard to the discretion in scotland <e> <s> however i take the serious point that he made <e> <s> he asked me why this discretion is given in england <e> <s> article of the directive which deals with the matter of limitation provides that <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord recognises from what he said that there is no real distinction to be drawn between the liability and obligation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i apologise to him because i had meant to cover that point as he spoke to this amendment with the previous one <e> <s> the view is that reference in the directive to instituting proceedings would allow a provision to be made for the interruption of prescription by the making of a claim in appropriate proceedings and even in bankruptcy <e> <s> however it is doubtful whether the execution of dilgence which is also referred to in section of the act could be described as instituting proceedings and it has not been included in the definition of relevant claim for the purpose of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is always difficult particularly in the light of the deputy chairmans ruling to decide whether to dangle the carrot now or later <e> <s> were the noble lord in due course to move amendments nos <e> <s> and i would have little difficulty in accepting them <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> i recognise that he has raised two important points <e> <s> the first concerns the test of a claimants constructive knowledge <e> <s> the amendments follow a test set out in the act as amended <e> <s> to explain the governments thinking i have to say that what is set out there is in somewhat different terms from article of the directive which refers merely to the date on which the plaintiff should reasonably have become aware and so on <e> <s> as drafted the schedule was considered to be safer in giving effect to the directive in that it followed the wording of article rather than attempting to gloss its meaning by adopting the test which was in the act <e>", "<cs> i merely say <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord opposite that the fact that this was not put in was not through inadvertence <e> <s> at the time it was felt that is was unnecessary by reason that if liability would be enforceable under section of the act as his amendment has it then it must almost by definition be actionable and therefore it would be unnecessary to include that <e> <s> having said that there is a problem which can arise for instance the question of whether or not the defect was of such a nature as to give rise to liability under part i i am bound to say that it would be proper that we should give further consideration to that question <e> <s> it may be that at the end of the day something very akin to what is already in the act as amended may be brought forward <e> <s> if such provision is required i shall certainly come back to your lordships on report for that purpose <e> <s> on that understanding perhaps the noble lord may feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that my sympathies were with the noble lord when i first saw this particular part of schedule but i am advised that it is necessary because it is a drafting device to ensure that the new part ii of the prescription and limitation scotland act whose provisions to which we have already referred in our discussion earlier is inserted immediately before part iii of that act which seems to be a suitable place for it to be <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is unfortunately i have to say correct <e> <s> we must move from one horse to a second and that being so i shall take note of what the noble lord has been kind enough to say and that will form the basis of an amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have set out already i had reason to believe or reason to suspect from the information originally brought to my notice that an offence had been committed in scotland and indeed as the petition sets out in glasgow <e> <s> the noble and learned lord knows well that the investigation of a suspected offence in scotland is undertaken in the first place by the procurator fiscal of the district within which such an offence may have been committed <e> <s> he acts under my authority and as the house will know he is a legally qualified officer one who is independent of the police i hasten to add <e> <s> in this case he had responsibility for the district where it was considered that an offence under section might have been committed in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the noble and learned lord has asked me a question and i certainly accept it in that frame <e> <s> i make quite clear to noble lords that the warrant is of course granted by the sheriff <e> <s> it is not one which is the doing either of myself or of my official the procurator fiscal <e> <s> i put forward through my local prosecuting official a petition and adjected to it a crave which invited the sheriff to grant a warrant in certain terms <e> <s> the sheriff was of course perfectly entitled to restrict it if he felt that the crave went too wide as the noble and learned lord will know <e> <s> i have to say that he did not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware in general that warrants have been obtained in england in relation of course to a different statutory basis under i believe the police and criminal evidence act <e> <s> that of course does not obtain in scotland <e> <s> i was satisfied when i was advised of the basis upon which suspension was being sought that in order to make the matter clear beyond doubt it would be appropriate to seek a fresh warrant to allow the original warrant to be suspended and to include in the crave not a reference simply to an offence under the act but a reference back specifically to the said offence under the act <e> <s> that referred specifically to what was in the body of the petition and had been in the initial petition as much as it was in the subsequent petition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for having asked that question <e> <s> i do not think that there is any disparity between what my right honourable friends said yesterday in another place <e> <s> i have of course read what they said <e> <s> however i make absolutely plain as i think i have done in answer to these questions that i was aware of the source of information that i was aware of the nature of the inquiry and in what direction it was going <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood his answer it may be that i have misread it he was not suggesting that the lord advocate personally is to draft the terms of the petition and the crave for the purposes of securing a warrant <e> <s> he is saying as i understand it what the general responsibilities of the lord advocate are <e> <s> my lords when the matter of challenge was brought to my attention then i was bound to have regard to that and give instructions as i did in relation to the preparation of a fresh warrant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i would entirely agree that while the act remains upon the statute book it is proper if information becomes available to prosecuting authorities that there has been a contravention of it for that matter to be taken further forward by the appropriate prosecuting authorities <e> <s> i make no comment upon the question of whether or how it is to be replaced <e> <s> as i understand there have been debates in the course of an earlier parliament when an attempt was made to do that and that failed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that the government was in a sense distancing itself in one regard from the matters that were being asked in another place in the last two days <e> <s> it is perfectly true to say and i have read what my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state said on monday about this that he made quite clear in another place what his role was <e> <s> he also said as i recollect it that the application for a warrant had proceeded under my authority <e> <s> that is my duty as a law officer as a prosecuting authority responsible for prosecution in scotland in which i am totally independent of the government and of any question of being influenced by the government <e> <s> if there had been any question of that your lordships may rest assured that i should have known what was my duty in the matter <e> <s> there was no question of the intervention of government in this matter <e> <s> the ministerial responsibility is simply mine as lord advocate responsible for prosecution of crime in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was considering these matters no <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was made aware of i have already indicated in response to earlier questions <e> <s> what i say is that i was aware in general of the fact that there had been warrants granted <e> <s> the material which was to go forward for the crave of a warrant in scotland proceeded upon a petition which was based upon information given to the procurator fiscal by police officers and which was sworn to before the sheriff by a police officer <e>", "<cs> my lords what i will do is to make arrangements for the terms of the petition upon which the crave for the warrant proceeded to be placed in the library of the house <e> <s> that will set out what was the basis for the crave for the warrant that was placed before the sheriff <e> <s> i think noble lords will fully understand that it would be inappropriate for me at this stage to give any further reference because of course the sheriff was guided by what was placed in the petition itself <e>", "<cs> as he explained in this amendment the noble lord opposite is attempting to remove an exemption for rates and certain tax debts from the time to pay arrangements <e> <s> i hasten to add that the amendment does not remove the exemption for summary warrants so it will apply only to ordinary court actions for the debts concerned <e> <s> that is an important point to bear in mind <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the subsection concerns vehicle licences <e> <s> it is dealing with a specific form of tax that is due as i recollect it on new cars <e> <s> if i am wrong about this matter i shall certainly write to my noble friend but i am quite clear that it does not refer to vehicle excise licences which i think is the point to which he is referring <e>", "<cs> in indicating that i do not think it is necessary to have this amendment and that i cannot accept it for the reason upon which i will now expand i must ask the committee to have regard to subsections and of clause <e> <s> interest is always payable on court decrees for payment of a principal sum of money as i am sure the noble and learned lord lord wilson and the noble lord opposite are fully aware <e> <s> but under the bill it may only be recovered under a time to pay direction if the creditor claims it in accordance with subsection of clause <e> <s> that is to say the creditor must claim it before a prescribed date and he must specify the amount claimed <e> <s> he must serve notice of that on the debtor so that the debtor is fully appraised of what the creditors claim is under a time to pay direction <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what i am saying yes <e>", "<cs> i believe as has already been said that this matter is not one of party politics and i would accept that at the very outset <e> <s> the government recognise the general desirability of attempting to find ways of dealing with the problems of multiple indebtedness <e> <s> however i wish to make it clear that perhaps in certain comments that have been made today i am thinking in particular of what the noble lord lord carmichael said we are straying into a different territory and that is the question of consumer credit restriction <e> <s> we are not dealing with that today <e>", "<cs> this limit was recommended by the scottish law commission following comments on their consultative memorandum no <e> <s> published in october <e> <s> i think the noble lord opposite will know that that memorandum proposed a limit of <e> <s> i accept that that was in <e> <s> nevertheless the report put forward the figure of <e> <s> i believe that report was published <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to what has been said on this matter in different parts of the committee <e> <s> perhaps i may take up the issue of credit with which the noble lord lord carmichael has just dealt <e> <s> as i made plain in response to an earlier debate we are not dealing with that issue this evening nor do i understand it to be suggested that warrant sales should not remain as a last resort <e>", "<cs> i am bound to express a certain degree of surprise at the noble lord putting forward this amendment particularly in view of what he sought to do in his last amendment <e> <s> we are dealing here with a clause and that part of a clause which provides for articles which are to be exempt from poinding <e> <s> as my noble friend lady carnegy pointed out <e> <s> the refrigerator has now become accepted i think as almost standard equipment in most houses <e> <s> it seems to me absolutely correct that where one is dealing with a subsection which says equipment used forstoring food <e> <s> it should he made plain that a refrigerator if it is to be found there will he exempt unless it can he said that it is not reasonably required for use in the dwelling-house <e> <s> it makes plain that one refrigerator as a rule is certainly to be so regarded <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> i am saying that under this the refrigerator would be exempt but if in addition it can be shown that the freezer was reasonably required for use in the dwellinghouse in addition to the refrigerator then that also may be exempt <e> <s> it is simply the way in which this clause is framed <e> <s> it starts by saying <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble and learned lord that i have put champagne quite successfully in the deep freeze <e> <s> it has a remarkable effect it cools it much more quickly than if it is put in the refrigerator <e> <s> from their expressions i am glad that other noble lords have had the same experience as myself <e> <s> i am not suggesting that simply because of that i can necessarily say that in my household the deepfreeze is reasonably required for use in the dwellinghouse of the person residing there or a member of his household <e>", "<cs> i do not suggest that we will not look at this matter again in view of what noble lords have said <e> <s> i think that i have set out the governments view which is that one refrigerator should be regarded as an article exempt from poinding <e> <s> it may be that there is more than one but if they are reasonably required for use in the dwellinghouse it could be included <e>", "<cs> i am happy to consider this matter and come back on report with an amendment to cover the point being made <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely persuaded that it is necessary to obtain the consent of all the occupiers but i see that there is a problem over what is meant by the term occupier <e> <s> i should like to look at that matter and take account of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> with that undertaking he may wish to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty because i have already moved this amendment <e> <s> it being moved i cannot withdraw it but in the circumstances i shall bear in mind what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the reason for this amendment <e> <s> as i said at committee we share his concern that this provision should not strike at a person who does something unintentionally that prejudices an investigation <e> <s> but i have to say to the noble lord that i think his amendment is unnecessary first because as he well knows the prosecution would have to prove <e>", "<cs> my lords i move it now formally <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i made it quite clear that i would be moving the remaining amendments formally <e> <s> since it was only this amendment that was called it was only in relation to that that i made the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords they are before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook to reflect on the amendments which the noble lord tabled in committee <e> <s> having done so i have to advise him that i cannot suggest to the house that these amendments should be accepted <e> <s> i do so on grounds of principle <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i think the noble lord has moved on to a slightly <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has now made the thrust of his argument more clear i assure him that i shall certainly consider it <e>", "<cs> i cannot think what gave the noble and learned lord that impression <e> <s> i am happy to say that i recognise that from time to time certain matters are reserved for personal decision by the law officers <e> <s> i am persuaded to accept that such a step is appropriate in this case <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has pointed out that this echoes the phraseology in the english bill <e> <s> to that extent it is desirable that the two bills should go hand in hand <e>", "<cs> while i recognise the noble lords concern i am bound to say that the amendment proposed would in my view emasculate the bills provisions <e> <s> i noted what the noble lord opposite said when he spoke about the ordinary witness and spoke about the right to silence <e> <s> what he would leave in would be the power of a nominated officer to require the person whose affairs are to be investigated to attend <e> <s> he would however take out curiously enough the persons whom he had reason to believe had relevant information that is to say the witnesses <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been good enough now to direct me to the particular part of my right honourable friends reply and i would simply say that in the light of that i should certainly be prepared to consider this because i do accept that the phraseology and the framing of this clause and the powers contained in it should be equivalent north and south of the border <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept the burden of the noble lords argument on this matter <e> <s> it is important perhaps to see to what this amendment is directed <e> <s> it proceeds in relation to clause and a notice in writing requiring a person to produce certain specified documents <e> <s> subsection a provides that <e>", "<cs> i think that in the circumstances i would have to look at this again <e> <s> i am bound to say that this is a matter which arose under the last debate we had <e> <s> at this stage i would not wish to answer the matter further other than to say that obviously a question may arise if for example this clause were to be limited to the person whose affairs <e>", "<cs> i am going to consider this matter but i am bound to say that i would not be disposed to accept an amendment which made it part of every warrant that the terms were to authorise a named constable to be <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the noble lords explanation of this amendment and would observe that this subsection has a fairly respectable lineage <e> <s> in fact it is to be found in not dissimilar terms in section of the companies act and again in section of the financial services act <e> <s> i think that subsection is of some importance <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to what both noble lords have said <e> <s> i feel a sense of <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was indeed good enough to give me notice of this point and that is why i anticipated his intervention to speak as i did <e> <s> i always find it difficult to deal with essentially hypothetical cases <e> <s> i think in the case which he instanced even if and i should have thought it highly unlikely the crown were to have proceeded against the bank there would be no doubt that the bank would have a defence under subsection b <e> <s> but i am grateful to the noble lord for raising the matter <e> <s> obviously since i have undertaken to consider the point raised by the noble lord in his amendment no <e> <s> this is something which i can again consider in that context <e>", "<cs> i have to say that at the present moment i am not disposed to advise the committee to accept this amendment for the reason which i suggested <e> <s> that is that it would seriously weaken the effect of the provisions in clause if a person were able to refuse to answer questions or to <e>", "<cs> no i am not departing from that <e> <s> i undertook to deal with an earlier amendment which the noble lord opposite proposed in clause which was to take out words in clause in relation to any other person that is to say a person other than the person whose affairs are to be investigated whom he has reason to believe has relevant information <e> <s> it is in that context that i was prepared to look again <e> <s> that was consistent with what my right honourable friend said in another place <e> <s> i make clear that i consider that it would be tilting the balance too far to provide that he should be entitled to refuse to divulge information <e>", "<cs> i am happy to assure the noble lord that we have it in mind to be in line with the english bill in this matter <e> <s> he is right in suspecting that i am not happy with his drafting and i think that it could be improved upon <e> <s> an amendment will be brought in another place <e> <s> in the light of that i hope that the noble lord will be able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the equivalent provision of the english bill is that such information may be disclosed <e>", "<cs> it seems to me entirely proper that the lord advocate or one of the nominated officers who acting in the public interest has obtained certain information in the course of investigations into serious or complex fraud should be able to bring that information to the attention of professional or supervisory bodies who also act for the protection of the public and have a legitimate interest in the conduct of their members <e>", "<cs> i am happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> no my lords the inquiry still continues <e> <s> i have to remind your lordships that the material which was removed was so interwoven that it was not possible immediately to disentangle one kind of material from another <e> <s> indeed that was the information given by the bbc to the police and reported to the procurator fiscal <e> <s> it was confirmed by the police on examination of the material <e> <s> much of the material relating to the five programmes other than that on zircon has since been returned to the bbc as a result of a sifting out operation carried out by the police <e> <s> the police investigations continue and at the conclusion of the investigations the police will make a report to the procurator fiscal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am satisfied that the proper procedure for obtaining a search warrant was followed in this case involving as it did an application by the procurator fiscal to a <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it quite clear when i made a statement to the house that this is a matter for the law officers and not for the government <e> <s> in this they act independently of government and that was also the case in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the police at the request of myself sifted through material as quickly as they could in order to be certain of what could be returned properly to the bbc as not being relevant to the investigation they were making and continue to make <e> <s> the police examination continues but obviously at this stage i cannot give any indication to the house when it will be completed and when a report will be made to my procurator fiscal <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to answer hypothetical questions of the kind which the noble lord has just asked <e> <s> however i am bound to say that this case is only a precedent for showing what is perfectly ordinary procedure namely that where a report has been received of an offence of a serious nature having been committed which the prosecuting authorities are bound to take up and investigate the use of search warrant procedure is a due process of law which it is perfectly appropriate to use as it was used in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> i should have expected a law officer of any government to have taken the same independent outlook that i have taken <e> <s> such has been the case in the past and the outlook is one that any holder of my office takes in this kind of matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the warrant that was issued was not a general warrant and no writ has been received from the bbc by any party so far as i am aware <e> <s> as regards the warrant noble lords will be aware that the bbc took action in the english courts in relation to the showing of the zircon film but that was a civil action relating to an injunction <e> <s> i think that the noble lord will be aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to respond to that point <e> <s> i take note of what the noble lord has said and i think that it is a point which i answered on the last occasion <e> <s> we still remain of the view that the use of the words the person is quite apt to cover the persons who would act for or with him in putting forward a request <e> <s> for example in the case of a disabled person unable to deal with the matter by himself his curator as the noble lord is well aware would we consider be entitled to put forward the request as being equivalent to the person <e>", "<cs> my lords i did set out in committee the reasoning behind this part of clause <e> <s> i then pointed out and i do so again that there is in the directive a clear distinction to be drawn between personal injuries or damage to other property caused by a defective product and self-destruction or lesser damage to the defective product itself <e> <s> the former that is to say personal injury or damage to other property is properly covered by the directive <e> <s> the latter that is destruction or damage to the product itself is a matter for legislation dealing with the quality of goods <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously very grateful for what has been said by noble lords which we shall certainly take aboard <e> <s> perhaps i may just reply to the noble lord lord airedale and say that i regret it is necessary to make reference to tort for the very reason which the noble lord lord morton identified when he spoke in committee as regards jurisdiction <e> <s> i simply say to the noble lord opposite that this matter has been considered <e> <s> certainly i have listened to what he has said and obviously will look at it again <e> <s> but in turn he may like to bear in mind what is said in schedule part ii of the bill <e> <s> in particular on page of the bill the new section b which is there set out describes the obligation under section of the act as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite knows perfectly well where the directive is to be found in the official journal <e> <s> his amendment however provides <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house i suspected although the noble lord opposite did not make this part of his original submissions that he might refer to the civil jurisdiction and judgments act <e> <s> we were there dealing with something entirely different <e> <s> that was a separate convention between the member states on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments which is not in the terms of section of the act an instrument or other act of the communities or any community institution <e> <s> as the noble lord opposite is well aware unlike this bill which translates into part i the directive for the purposes of our law the act did not in fact do any such thing <e> <s> what it said in section was that the conventions shall have

provision was designed to allow an applicant to apply for a second hearing where the board had excluded at the first hearing an issue which the applicant wished to be considered in the determination of his case <e> <s> indeed the ability of the board to hold a hearing which only goes to certain issues such as eligibility is a feature of the current scheme <e>", "<cs> i am content to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord opposite has indicated paragraph provides that where <e>", "<cs> i accept as regards court proceedings that the noble lord opposite may be correct in saying that at times a single judge may be wrong <e> <s> the point i was making in my earlier answer is that refusal of an application is not refusal forever and a day and the claimant may come back with further and better particulars <e> <s> in that sense i say that matter is vastly different from a court case <e>", "<cs> i do not think i accepted that there was no provision which would allow the dissatisfied applicant to seek judicial review <e> <s> i should have thought that that would lie anyway <e> <s> i am saying that we do not provide within this bill a specific right of appeal of the kind which is <e>", "<cs> i have made clear what our position is here <e> <s> indeed the noble lord has confirmed the very point which i was seeking to make previously <e> <s> judicial review lies in cases where the board may be seen to have acted wrongly in saying that a matter is outwith the scheme when it is truly within the scheme <e> <s> that remedy still lies and for that reason we do not feel it necessary to add an additional provision that would give a general right of appeal <e>", "<cs> obviously as with any proceedings in this committee i shall look at what has been said <e> <s> however i have indicated the present view of the government <e>", "<cs> i am aware that as the noble lord opposite has reminded us the board has followed a practice in the past of not making awards while related criminal proceedings are pending because of the possible effects on its own proceedings or the possibility of prejudice to the criminal proceedings <e>", "<cs> it is estimated that the board pays out about a year to compensate those who have suffered a loss of or damage to their clothing as a result of a crime of violence <e> <s> while this may be praiseworthy the cost and administrative effort expended by the board in verifying such claims is considerable <e> <s> as a result a significant amount of the boards time and funding is being deflected from the fundamental aim of the scheme which is to compensate for personal injury or death <e> <s> instead it is trying to gauge the value of partly-worn clothing with very little means of checking its age condition or value <e> <s> the average payments made are in the region of to which must be little more than the cost of the arrangements for checking the claim and making the payment <e>", "<cs> the provision as it stands reflects the recommendation of the working party that the board should pay the cost of private medical treatment but only where such treatment is essential and the cost is reasonable <e> <s> we believe that that is the right approach and that the provision for treatment to be essential is the right test to apply before public funds are disbursed to pay for private medical treatment <e>", "<cs> i have resisted giving an answer <e> <s> all i am saying is that that would be a matter for the board in the light of the circumstances which are produced and the arguments placed before it <e> <s> i am simply saying that we think that the recommendation of the working party in relation to this is correct and that the board would require to be satisfied that the treatment was essential and the costs reasonable before it would allow public funds to be disbursed to pay for private medical treatment <e>", "<cs> i think i made it clear that the test is one of essentiality and reasonableness of the cost <e> <s> that is what i put and that would be a matter for the board to be satisfied about on the material placed before it <e> <s> i think perhaps i should resist any blandishment to give an opinion upon any particular case <e> <s> if i appear to have done so then perhaps i should make it clear that i do not do so in this debate other than to say that the governments view as to the test is quite clear <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having tabled the amendment <e> <s> there is a government amendment with regard to the waters referred to in clause e <e> <s> that in part meets what is proposed in the noble lords amendment <e> <s> however he goes further and wishes to include the territorial waters adjacent to scotland and ships aircraft or hovercraft registered in or operating from scotland <e>", "<cs> the noble lord opposite is correct in saying that the provision stems from a recommendation made by the interdepartmental working party <e> <s> it felt that although the scheme should not in any general way be looked to for the maintenance of the child it would be appropriate nevertheless for the scheme to recognise in a more limited way the particular difficulties faced by a woman in those circumstances <e> <s> the scheme itself of course provides entitlement to compensation in respect of the general physical and psychological effects of this heinous crime upon any woman <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the noble lord says <e> <s> i think actually that the matter will be clear once these amendments are made <e>", "<cs> i think that it is right to point out that amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend if accepted will correct the omission and transfer the provision of compensation for funeral expenses to clause <e>

point <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is unfortunate that the noble lord took a tilt at the treasury <e> <s> the working party gave clear reasons for its view <e> <s> not only victims but the public in general expect those who have suffered from criminal injuries <e>", "<cs> the present scheme allows pension rights and insurance benefits to be disregarded only where they accrued solely as the result of payments by the victim or a dependant <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> i made clear what the scheme at present has been <e> <s> it is quite clear that the scheme allows only pension rights or insurance benefits to be disregarded where they accrued solely as a result of payments by the victim or a dependant <e> <s> that would cover the payments to which the noble lord has just referred <e> <s> however i shall look at this again in the light of what the noble lord has said although i cannot give any undertaking that we are persuaded by that argument <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can say that <e> <s> i made quite clear in the other case that i would reflect upon what was said and that for the present the governments view was as stated by me at this box <e> <s> that remains the case so far as the present amendment is concerned <e> <s> however i shall look at what has been said <e>", "<cs> the inclusion of gratuities arising from a persons employment reflects the position of the present non-statutory scheme <e> <s> it was supported by the interdepartmental working party <e> <s> they considered that benefits provided by an employer as a result of the applicants injury including gratuities should properly lead to a corresponding reduction in the amount of award paid by the board <e> <s> i concede that this provision may act as a disincentive to some employers who wish to act benevolently towards employees injured by criminal activity <e> <s> nevertheless it remains the case that in determining an applicants loss of income it is relevant and reasonable for the board to take account of all payments which accrue from the applicants employment <e> <s> if gratuities were to be excluded it would be very difficult for the board to have to differentiate between those payments from employers which were totally gratuitous and those which resulted from some legal or moral obligation <e> <s> we have concluded that in the absence of a workable solution and to avoid the potential for abuse there is only one practical means of dealing with gratuities paid by employers <e> <s> that is to regard all such payments as benefits arising out of employment which should be taken into account by the board when assessing compensation <e>", "<cs> i recognise the force of the point that the noble lord has put forward <e> <s> at an earlier stage of this legislation before the general election there had been a government amendment to cover the circumstances to which the noble lord alluded which was omitted in error from the current bill <e> <s> we would wish to consider this amendment with a view to improving the wording and look at any consequences that may have on the remaining provisions of the bill <e> <s> i hope with that undertaking that the noble lord will see fit to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps to assist the noble lord let me say that i would accept this amendment if he moved it <e>", "<cs> the reason why subsection is there is to assist in eliminating uncertainty at the borders of the scheme <e> <s> the committee will understand that this is a statutory <e>", "<cs> i understand that in england the offence is called arson <e> <s> in scotland we describe it in a slightly less oblique way <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether there is any disagreement in principle between the noble lord opposite and myself as regards what we are attempting to achieve in this part of the bill <e> <s> i should like to remind the committee that the subsection that we are considering was included in the bill when it was being considered in another place before the end of the last session in response to an opposition amendment <e> <s> it was included because attention had been drawn to the cases of train drivers who had suffered nervous shock when someone committed suicide by throwing themselves in front of a train or by someone who was trespassing on a track and was knocked down and killed by a train <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those members of the committee who have spoken further on this matter <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord irvine of lairg the amendment as i indicated does not quite cover all the cases that were intended to be covered with regard to train drivers <e> <s> to the noble lord lord grimond i can say that the purpose of the scheme is to deal with crimes of violence to the individual and not unfortunately however it may be seen to deal with those who may subsequently come upon the scene to deal with the aftermath <e> <s> such people may be firemen ambulance-men and the like <e> <s> they do not come within the terms of the scheme <e>", "<cs> i indicated earlier that it was thought proper to make clear where difficulties were perceived on the margins of the general description of conduct which would fall within the terms of the scheme <e> <s> i will deal first with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is an offence to carry a firearm <e> <s> that is part of our criminal law <e> <s> the question arises as to whether there should be compensation for personal injury which is caused by any conduct which would fall within the terms of paragraph f <e> <s> no difficulty surely can arise with regard to the possession of a firearm with intent to injure <e> <s> no difficulty surely can arise with regard to use of a firearm to resist arrest <e> <s> no difficulty surely can arise with regard to a personal injury arising from carrying a firearm with criminal intent or carrying a firearm in a public place or trespassing with a firearm <e> <s> it seems to me perfectly appropriate that we make it plain within the terms of this clause what are the circumstances in which a criminal injury arises <e>", "<cs> i think i undertook in regard to the act to draw the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> obviously i shall do likewise with regard to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> we must try to get the matter absolutely right <e> <s> i accept that and i am not suggesting that our formulation is necessarily ideal <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why committee debates of this kind are so helpful <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not think that the governments mind is closed on the matter <e> <s> however i think i have indicated the difficulties that we see in the amendments with which we are dealing <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has raised a point which i answered in committee earlier <e> <s> but so far as his first point is concerned this is a matter of how it will look when the bill is finally reprinted <e> <s> i think he will therefore be satisfied that we can look at it again then <e>", "<cs> i am aware of the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> it might be described as an attempt to improve the elegance of the wording of the present sub-paragraph <e> <s> i take the point that perhaps we ought to look to see whether we can improve sub-paragraph ii of paragraph b <e> <s> the intention is that it will take into account the circumstances which are referred to in the first sub-paragraph namely that there may be only one person or more than one person responsible for causing the injury <e> <s> these amendments would not <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first say that the exceptional risk part of the sub-paragraph has been part of the non-statutory scheme since a report published by an interdepartmental working party in <e> <s> i have heard nothing to suggest that the board has had substantial difficulty in dealing with the matter <e> <s> however i should like to explain that the reason for the introduction of the question of exceptional risk was that the working party felt that while accidental injury was deserving of public sympathy it was questionable whether compenation from public funds for all injuries incurred by accident was a proper purpose of a scheme designed to compensate the victims of violent crime <e>", "<cs> i detect from the views that the committee have placed fairly forcefully before me that there appear to be two elements <e> <s> the first concerns those who actually assist or may themselves as civilians attempt to assist in the apprehension or attempted apprehension or in the prevention or attempted prevention of an offence <e> <s> the other element concerns the bystander to which the noble lord lord morton referred <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the members of the committee who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i must make plain at the outset that it is not correct to suggest that the government are in any way reneging upon an undertaking which they gave at an earlier stage in this legislation as to what they intended to do about train drivers <e> <s> the noble lord lord irvine is absolutely correct that that is in part related to this problem <e>", "<cs> i assure the committee that the circumstances to which the noble lord alluded will be covered under rules made under paragraph b of schedule and therefore the amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> i should just like to make clear that this will be a matter for the rules and i suggest that that is the proper place to deal with it <e> <s> but i take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> i am not unattracted by the purpose of the amendments <e> <s> a difficulty arises as they stand <e> <s> we should like to consider further in consultation with the board a generally acceptable alternative if such can be devised <e>", "<cs> we do not feel that we can accept the amendment <e> <s> the subsection gives the board discretion to refuse to make an award <e> <s> we think that it is right that that discretion should be limited to the circumstances in sub-paragraphs a and b <e> <s> and not widened <e> <s> i take the point about a child becoming aware in due course of the reasons for which the compensation may have been awarded <e> <s> these are rare and arguable cases <e> <s> it is accepted of course that in the case of a young child who has been injured the board can delay payment <e> <s> when payments are made at the age of to children injured at a younger age it should be possible to do so in a way that would not go into unnecessary details of the offence <e> <s> that seems to be the better way to deal with the matter <e> <s> we should be unwilling to extend the boards discretion <e> <s> it is only right and proper that this provision should be seen as a counterpart to the discretion which apears in clause b <e> <s> for that reason i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i would be happy to consider the point the noble lord lord irvine mentioned about a parent living away from family as a special case which might be considered within the context of the bill <e>", "<cs> we take the view that the time limit proposed here is unusually long <e> <s> perhaps i may refer to magistrates courts <e> <s> the appeal there by way of case stated is days <e> <s> other tribunals have varying time limits some of only days and others of days <e> <s> the claimant will be present at a court hearing in most cases i should have expected and would have the reasons for the boards decision explained at the time <e> <s> therefore days was thought to be a reasonable period <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lords who have spoken because it renders my task almost otiose <e> <s> in deference to the excellent arguments put forward by the noble lord lord irvine which i fear are incorrect i shall simply say that our understanding is that once the board is established on a statutory basis hearings before it will attract the same privilege as hearings before other statutory tribunals <e> <s> i refer the noble lord to the speech of the late lord diplock in <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not suggesting that but what i am saying is that it can go no further than the drafting and not to policy <e> <s> certainly as i understood it when it was under the chairmanship of the lord chancellor it went beyond drafting to policy <e> <s> but notwithstanding what i have said i would be happy to draw what has been said today to the attention of my noble friend the leader of the house who would be particularly concerned with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i should have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome given to the bill <e> <s> i appreciate the points made by the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> unfortunately the parliament act is on the statute book <e> <s> what we are doing here is combining in one act acts which have been put on the statute book over a period of years <e> <s> as noble lords will recognise in consolidation a bill must obey the natural law of conservation of mass <e> <s> it is as i say pure consolidation as noble lords have already pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord opposite and to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside for the welcome that they have given to this bill <e> <s> i can say to my noble friend lord ailsa that we did not proceed with this lightly as the noble marquess will understand <e> <s> it proceeds upon a carefully argued report of the scottish law commission and as i think i explained in opening upon comments and criticism received both by the law commission and by myself <e> <s> i can recommend to my noble friend a reading of the law commission report which i think would still some of his fears about the value of hearsay evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords we take the view that in principle the board should proceed to deal with the claim as soon as it is made while matters are fresh and not keep a claimant out of compensation <e> <s> we do not consider that the board should delay its determinations solely because of the fear that its determination might prejudice some future proceedings <e> <s> in practice we do not believe that any determination by the board is likely to have that effect <e> <s> provided the board is satisfied that evidence exists to support a claim then it should proceed to a determination <e> <s> of course in any case where the board has doubts about the validity of a claim or where evidence before the board conflicts the board will have the power under the existing wording to defer their determination until it has the opportunity to consider the evidence given in criminal proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard the noble lords opposite but in this bill we are putting on to a statutory footing a scheme which exists to compensate innocent victims for personal injuries caused by crimes of violence <e> <s> the fact that loss or damage to clothing but not loss or damage to other property has been the subject of compensation under the present scheme has long been recognised as an anomaly <e> <s> when an administrative scheme is to be put on to a statutory basis it is surely the right time to review the scope of the arrangements and to remove obvious and recognised anomalies <e>", "<cs> my lords as it presently stands the paragraph is intended to secure that the board should have a discretion to pay the reasonable costs of private medical treatment but only where it is satisfied that such treatment is or was essential <e> <s> that was the conclusion of the interdepartmental working party <e> <s> it was a conclusion which in our view was correct <e> <s> we feel that the board should not normally be expected to pay for private medical treatment and that the payment for such treatment should only be made in exceptional circumstances and where the costs are reasonable <e> <s> the board would have the opportunity as the paragraph is presently framed to apply its judgment to the particular case in the light of the medical evidence as to whether the treatment is essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm to the house that it is the intention that the appropriate law shall depend in the first instance on the place where the injury is sustained <e> <s> thus if it were in england wales or english territorial waters then english law would apply <e> <s> equally where the incident occurs in scotland or within scottish territorial waters the matter would be governed by the law of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords let me just explain to your lordships who may not be entirely familiar with the part that this plays in the assessment of compensation that this is an area in which we are dealing with calculation of loss of support that may arise following injury <e> <s> the normal course is for the board to consider how long it is likely that the injury will play a part in preventing an individual who has been injured from returning to full employment <e> <s> to do that it requires to do two things first it requires to take a figure for his earnings and secondly it then has to muliply that by a figure which it considers to be the appropriate multiplier expressed in years <e>", "<cs> my lords the present scheme allows pension rights and insurance benefits to be disregarded only where they accrue solely as the result of payments by the victim or by a dependant <e> <s> the noble lord lord irvine of lairg inquired during debate in committee on identical amendments whether it was intended that the statutory scheme like the present scheme should exclude arrangements to which an employer had contributed <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> the inclusion of the words wholly or partly in both instances would allow the claimant or his dependant to avoid a reduction being made by the board in respect of his private insurance or pension arrangements where part perhaps a large part of the contributions had been made by some third party <e> <s> we believe that arrangements of that kind which are not wholly private arrangements should be taken into account by the board in the future as they are now <e> <s> therefore i cannot accept the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords this sub-paragraph is here to cure an anomaly which arises under the present scheme <e> <s> i shall just explain briefly how it arises <e> <s> where a spouse is killed the survivor is entitled to damages which are based upon the proposition that the society of the spouse has been lost and lost for good <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord has made what is perhaps a different argument and one at which i should like to look again <e> <s> i assure the house that the purpose of the amendment is to cure the anomaly as i indicated at the outset <e> <s> we have obviously gone beyond that <e> <s> i should like to consider the matter further <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter was the subject of debate at committee stage and we undertook to look at what was said then <e> <s> having done so we are not persuaded that the board when determining an applicants loss of income for the purposes of an award should not take account of all payments made by an employer as a result of the applicants office or employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord and to my noble friend for making points more succinctly than i could have done <e> <s> we debated this in committee and i explained the reasons for the use of the terms in subsection aii <e> <s> we still hold the view that it is necessary to provide wording which makes the scheme specific in order to eliminate uncertainty at the borders <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning has pointed out how unspecific is the phrase which appears in this amendment <e> <s> that of course has been the subject of comment in the divisional court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid it has gone beyond the playing fields of eton and spread to scotland <e> <s> it simply describes a form of general public disturbance which may involve fighting in public with a number of persons involved hence the word mobbing <e> <s> i hope that brief explanation is sufficient for my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any difference between us in what we are trying to secure here which is that a train driver who suffers nervous shock as a result of running down someone on a railway line should be entitled to make a claim under the scheme <e> <s> as noble lords opposite will know and as was explained in committee this part of the bill arises from an opposition amendment in committee in another place during the last session <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of the subsection is to deal with the case where some form of insurance provision is already in existence whether this be the normal motor insurance arrangements or in terms of the two agreements of with the motor insurers bureau and the secretary of state for transport concerning the victims of uninsured and untraced drivers respectively <e> <s> it is the boards current practice not to consider any case that falls within the scope of insurance arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> in the governments view what is presented in the amendment is the proper way to go forward <e> <s> we have never shut our minds to looking at other circumstances that may be close to the line <e> <s> i cannot give any undertaking <e> <s> however these matters are being considered <e> <s> i shall obviously draw the remarks made by noble lords in committee to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary at the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised two points in his amendment <e> <s> the first relates to the loss of society award which is one peculiar to scotland <e> <s> we had hitherto thought that the right to claim it was implicit in the scheme as set out in the bill <e> <s> if there is doubt upon it it is prudent that the matter should be put beyond doubt <e> <s> i should be very happy to consider this matter in order to secure that result and the best way to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed amendments to the same effect in committee <e> <s> i indicated then that we were generally sympathetic with the purpose behind those amendments <e> <s> i regret that in the time available the government have not been able to bring forward amendments to the bill though we intend to do so in time for third reading <e> <s> one question which may yet arise relates to what the noble lord called contributory negligence <e> <s> this arises in that one of his amendments constricts the boards discretion by removing the reference to a person being to any extent responsible for the injury in subsection aiii <e> <s> there may be merit in retaining that provision as well as conduct connected with the injury <e> <s> we are considering this as i said we would in committee <e> <s> perhaps with that assurance the noble lord might withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe we went over this course in committee <e> <s> in the bill originally we had days and that was increased to days after discussion in another place when the bill was before parliament in the previous session <e> <s> it is as well to bear in mind that under subsection the time is to be days beginning with the day on which the board notified the claimant of its determination <e> <s> in many cases the claimant will be present when the board gives its reasons for the decision and those will be explained at the time <e> <s> in other cases he will be notified subsequently and the appeal time of days does not seem to be unreasonable <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to members of the committee who have spoken <e> <s> without this subsection the bill would be silent on the admissibility of a statement purely as evidence of the fact that such a statement was made regardless of the truth or otherwise of that statement <e> <s> i cannot pretend to the committee that its deletion would represent a major inroad into the bill <e> <s> but on the other hand i do not regard its presence there as being a disfigurement <e>", "<cs> this subsection was initially included in the bill so as to ensure that the apparently general admissibility of statements in clause b did not prejudice the existing law providing for affidavit evidence in certain categories of proceedings such as for instance the simplified divorce procedure <e>", "<cs> i wish simply to say that i am fully persuaded by what the noble lord opposite has said <e> <s> i should be happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i do not cavil at all with the drafting of the noble lord opposite <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment provides a useful clarification to the bill by including the reference to undertaking and extending it to any local authority <e> <s> let me remark that the reference to any is notable since it ensures that the bill in relation to proceedings in scotland also covers the records of local authorities outside scotland as well as those within scotland <e> <s> that is entirely appropriate since the bill deals with the records of businesses and is not limited to businesses within scotland <e> <s> i therefore commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> in these matters concessions come from both quarters or both halves i should say <e> <s> i have been very happy in what i have been able to achieve today on this bill <e> <s> i hope that it might be an augury for the approach which the opposition benches will take to the criminal justice bill and indeed to the patents bill next week <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that my noble friend opposite will accuse me of not playing cricket when i tell him that i am not minded to accept this amendment <e> <s> in some sense his reference to fowler underlines the point that i was trying to make in committee and on report when he tried various synonyms out on me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord said <e> <s> i pay particular tribute to him and to other noble lords who took part in that debate as being a spur to the provision of the guidance which is now in the library of the house <e> <s> i take the point that the noble lord has just put to me and indeed he has referred to the very bill that we are looking at this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would be slow to give the noble lord advice on the drafting of indictments <e> <s> i can simply say that i should look to the offence provisions to find the means whereby any offence is to be set out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would he slow to be drawn further than what i have said already this afternoon despite the blandishments of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> what we are dealing with is what the trigger clause will say and that will make quite clear what the legal effect if any is to be of the code of guidance or code of practice to be issued under it <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministry of defence has certain rights under non-competitive contracts which enable the ministry to review the price charged under a contract after its completion and to secure a refund if the information on which the price was based turns out with hindsight to have been inaccurate <e> <s> it was that process which was followed to enable refunds to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords in one particular matter inquiries by the ministry of defence police are continuing and the investigating officers have recently sought and received advice from the crown prosecution service fraud investigation group <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not imply that <e> <s> it is fair to say that in one other case a report was submitted by the ministry of defence police to the crown prosecution service <e> <s> it was the decision of the crown prosecution service that there was insufficient evidence to institute criminal proceedings <e> <s> however that is the only investigation of which i have any knowledge which has at the end of the day come to the notice of the crown prosecution service <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have before me the information the noble lord seeks and it does not fall directly within the ambit of this question <e> <s> i shall be happy to respond to the noble lord but all i can say as i said earlier is that where allegations are made to the crown prosecution service it will be for the service to determine whether there are grounds for taking the matter further by way of prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> that is what i was endeavouring to state but i did not do so as forcefully as did my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter to which i referred in response to the noble and learned lord is one in which the ministry of defence police and the crown prosecution service together are continuing investigations <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware these were matters which the ministry of <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the second part of the noble lords question such decisions are taken by the procurator fiscal <e> <s> they will depend on the particular circumstances of the case and whether he considers such a disposal rather than a prosecution to be appropriate in the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given certain instructions as regards the circumstances under which the power of an offer of fixed penalty may be used <e> <s> my concern is to ensure that it will be used correctly <e> <s> for that reason the present provision is monitored involving procurators fiscal clerks of the court and scottish office statisticians <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord can be certain that procurators fiscal are well <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards road traffic offences this scheme has been in existence for some time <e> <s> i believe that fixed penalty offers were made in and that there was a per cent <e> <s> take-up <e> <s> of course noble lords will be aware that if the offer is not accepted the matter is taken to court by way of a prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords one consequence certainly is that no conviction will be recorded against the offender and at the end of the day that means that there will be no publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords as in any other case it will depend on the circumstances of the particular report <e> <s> however i assure my noble friend that the value of the goods would be one of the circumstances of which the procurator fiscal would take account before determining the proper disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not have any such information <e> <s> i have no doubt that the government will watch the operation of the scheme in scotland as a successful means of having an alternative to prosecution which may at the end of the day find a response south of the border as well <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships on behalf of the government i shall endeavour to sum up some of the themes that have run through this extremely important and thoughtful debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the noble baroness and she made the point that control came through unemployment but the governments view is that unemployment is affected by the process of wealth creation and we have seen the success of that policy over the past three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not forgotten them <e> <s> i was going to deal with those matters in a moment <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister undoubtedly runs a strong government and she has a strong cabinet <e> <s> it was suggested that she now has only three out of her original cabinet <e> <s> but she has been in office now for nine years and it is perhaps not surprising that during that time it was appropriate to allow for a certain number of changes in high office <e> <s> i should have thought that noble lords who have far more knowledge than i of government would agree that there should be changes at times otherwise the system whereby a party draws support from its members becomes stultified <e> <s> it has already been pointed out that those who have cabinet experience have now made their appearance here <e> <s> i should have thought that they were a most welcome addition to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the matter of appointments which she has to consider are for instance the appointment of senior civil servants judges and bishops and any other persons whose appointment requires the approval of the prime minister <e> <s> that being so at the end of the day these must be matters which are for her to decide <e> <s> i hope that gives the response to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look at what we have said and if i may i shall write further to him on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i dealt with that in my earlier speech <e> <s> i do not accept that ministers have taken additional powers <e> <s> we have established certain independent bodies to whom we have given powers but they remain independent of government <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord he ought to read the report <e> <s> my recollection is that the report included the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to deal with some of the points the noble baroness had put to me <e> <s> the first one concerned the official secrets act <e> <s> we on this side of the house accept the need for reform of the act <e> <s> as is well known my right honourable friend the home secretary has announced that proposals for reform will be set out in a white paper which it is hoped will be laid before parliament in june this year with a view to early legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords if that be so then i am sorry that i have not been able to supply the noble baroness with any further information <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that i had not sat down <e> <s> i have made the matter perfectly plain and i can go no further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords in effect with leave of the house i wish to make it clear that i am answering the question as put down this evening <e> <s> i have made quite clear that these were matters debated on an earlier occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment is necessary to enable a two-tier prospective cost limit to be set for advice and assistance including assistance by way of representation <e> <s> at present the amount of work which a solicitor may himself authorise without requiring

differentiated so that in particular circumstances and subject to particular conditions a solicitor may authorise himself beyond and up to a further limit to be set at <e> <s> the facility is again an important part of the improvements to the administration of legal aid discussed with the law society of scotland and the scottish legal aid board <e> <s> i commend it to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment provides that the scottish legal aid board will meet its own rates bill instead of the government making a payment in lieu of rates <e> <s> the existing provision has resulted in an unnecessarily complex arrangement for the payments of the boards rates <e> <s> the change will make the provision consistent with that applying to other major scottish non-departmental public bodies <e> <s> there are consequential adjustments to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke to this amendment when moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> as that case came within my jurisdiction i say to my noble friend that it was an exception which was the cause of a prosecution <e> <s> that merely proves the general rule <e> <s> the police dispose of weapons which come into their possession through forfeiture or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments may be said to approach the ideal <e> <s> they are of a technical nature <e> <s> they raise no new issues of substance or policy and perhaps most importantly they are few in number <e> <s> i think that is a tribute to the very constructive debates which took place on the bill during its consideration by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive <e> <s> the amendments made to this consolidation bill in the other place were passed without opposition and have been approved by the chairman of the joint committee on consolidation bills <e> <s> the main amendment concerns section of the court of session act <e> <s> the original view of the scottish law commission was that this whole provision had been rendered obsolete by the abolition of the bill chamber in <e> <s> however recently the section was founded on in litigation before the court and on this being brought to attention it was appreciated that the provision was not wholly obsolete and that a part of it should be retained <e> <s> accordingly in the other place the provision was repealed and in part re-enacted <e> <s> this was to ensure as is proper with consolidation bills that the law was restated but not altered <e> <s> the other amendments are minor or consequential <e> <s> i beg to move the amendments <e>", "<cs> as i understand the justification for this series of amendments it is effectively to preserve the existing role of the education authority in these appointments <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove referred to ultimate accountability and public accountability <e> <s> i do not understand the logic of the case put forward nor indeed do i see the force of it <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear from paragraph b that it is an equal number of persons who are nominated by the education authority and the school board <e> <s> in addition it is the head teacher of the school who shall be chairman of the committee <e>", "<cs> it is not stated in the bill because the bill does not deal with that <e> <s> it deals with permanent appointments <e>", "<cs> i do not detect in the noble lords utterances and the strength of his arguments the usual note of confidence and i am not entirely surprised <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for making clear the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> let us consider the manner in which schedule is set out <e> <s> if the kind of considerations that he has put forward are material as regards certain functions requested by school boards and as to whether they should be delegated they would have two bites of the cherry <e> <s> first under paragraph of this schedule they are able to put their reasons for refusing the request before tie parents <e> <s> the parents are then able to see the counter proposals and to vote upon them <e> <s> if a majority do not support the reasons for the authoritys refusal the matter has to go before the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> this amendment is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and that of the noble lords lord morton of shuna and lord macaulay of bragar <e> <s> however the debate has opened somewhat wider than amendment no <e> <s> and it takes in the purpose which amendment no <e> <s> which is in my name also covers <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to that amendment and to the related amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps he will confirm that nothing in this subsection will derogate from the common law so that if an individual was able to show an interest he would still be entitled to use the remedy of interdict if that were appropriate <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for looking at it again <e> <s> however does he really think that either the court of session or the sheriff court can interdict a committee or a trust <e> <s> the only way that can be done is to interdict the trustees or the individual members <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i too may put two questions to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> he mentioned further offences in the bill particularly those in clauses and <e> <s> clause simply makes a criminal offence of what is plainly a contempt of court <e> <s> the civil courts have a speedy way of dealing with those who fail to comply with any order which has been made <e> <s> it seems to me to be otiose to add a criminal sanction as well particularly as that would involve the necessity of raising further proceedings rather than dealing with the failure to obtemper the order in the particular civil process in which the failure appears <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord advocate can set out whether the government in the regulations proposed for accounts would have in mind following the spirit of the statement in the white paper <e>", "<cs> i am not going to press the matter <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord might wish to consider the matter <e> <s> we are making provision for legislation which is to cover all kinds of <e>", "<cs> i shall read what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i simply observe that clause provides for the preparation by a recognised body of three things two of which are concerned with accounting and the third of which is a report on the activities of the body having regard to its charitable purposes <e> <s> it would seem unfortunate that that should be exempted <e> <s> i can understand the exemption in relation to accounts <e> <s> however i do not take the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the noble and learned lord will consider this <e>", "<cs> i am happy and i have no doubt that this can be put right at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the positive way in which he has replied <e> <s> i have reservations as to whether this can be done by the promise of administrative action in a regime intended to be statutory and intended to continue to be in force even if for example the scottish council for voluntary organisations is no longer in existence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> he has obviously taken the point on board <e> <s> i will look at what he said <e> <s> i am also grateful for his offer to reconsider the substance of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the lord advocate replies perhaps i may also raise one or two further points which occurred to me having been given a copy of the proposed principles on which the government were intending to bring forward a possible amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat reassured by the attitude of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am sure that he will read what my noble and learned friend and i have said about small charities <e> <s> i am not entirely sure that he has hoisted aboard the point about the local gala day which may not be held for a purpose that would be regarded as charitable under the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am perfectly content with what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> in the circumstances i am happy to seek the leave of the house to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord has considered the scenario that a trust may see and indeed obtain leave to reconstitute itself so that new purposes come into effect and a new trust then comes into being and some years later those purposes become incapable of being fulfilled <e> <s> the problem i have is that as presently drafted the words that first appear are original purposes of the trust <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i disagree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i should have thought that the word instructions is capable of being read in various lights according to the relationship between the client and his solicitor or that between the client the solicitor and the advocate <e> <s> i can conceive of a situation where a client may give general instructions to a solicitor to appear for him in a matter which involves criminal proceedings <e> <s> i should have thought those instructions would be covered by the word that appears in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however if the word were read as narrowly as the noble and learned lord suggested there could be problems but i am bound to say that i would not read it as narrowly as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble and learned friend on this matter <e> <s> at first blush it seems to me that there is no necessity for the provision <e> <s> having read through it again like my noble and learned friend i still fail to understand why it should be there when the only persons to whom it could possibly relate are the two persons whom he identified <e> <s> i can see no other identifiable person <e>", "<cs> my lords i take a somewhat different view about the clause from that which was adumbrated by the noble and learned lord lard mccluskey <e> <s> we tend to forget that in many legal proceedings within our jurisdiction lay persons represent other lay persons successfully <e> <s> they make use of their own training which includes law <e> <s> it might be said that there is a case for allowing representation for instance within the lowest courts the courts as opposed to tribunals <e> <s> i instance the district courts <e> <s> it may well be said that if in a court martial a defendant can be represented by his divisional commanding officer there is no reason why within a limited tier of courts the same principle should not apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add to what my noble and learned friend has said <e> <s> is it necessary to define practitioner in subsection having regard to the definition which appears in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always been a firm believer in the adage that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush <e> <s> i must commend these amendments <e> <s> they seem to add an important and sensible new provision to this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in understanding that clause inserts a new clause in earlier legislation namely the act where the body has to be referred to in the plural although in part i fortunately we have regard to the body as a singular person <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey it is important also to have regard to subsection of the new clause because that imports that e lord president shall do something once he and the secretary of state are satisfied about the draft scheme <e> <s> i must say that i cannot see how the lord president can find out that the secretary of state is satisfied with the parts with which he must deal unless he has consulted with him <e> <s> equally if the secretary of state is not satisfied with the scheme then the lord president is to refuse under paragraph b of subsection <e> <s> i cannot see how that can be done without consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend seems to have a point here <e> <s> certainly the spirit of the amendment is sensible as regards any consideration which the lord president and the secretary of state should look to when considering a draft scheme because it must fit into the functions of the court or courts <e> <s> in that as in other matters i should have thought that the promotion of the proper and efficient administration of justice is a first and foremost principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the governments desire to limit evidence to that of one witness <e> <s> i refer to the new schedule in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in sub-paragraph of paragraph of the schedule it is plain that one of the failures is a failure satisfactorily to carry out any instructions which he has been given by the supervising officer <e> <s> it is unlikely that that officer will necessarily have any corroborating witness present at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also add my voice in support of this amendment particularly since i am aware of a case recently in which it was debated at some length as to whether the existing law was sufficient <e> <s> the court decided that it was not <e> <s> however i should be grateful if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could explain why it was felt necessary to use the word request in this amendment rather than the direction which i believe the scottish law commission recommended <e>"]
