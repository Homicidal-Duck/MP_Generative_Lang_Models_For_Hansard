["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him or perhaps her majestys

for endangered species evidence produced purported to show that the mv sierra which is insured by lloyds of london is at the present time involved in the indiscriminate slaughter of whales <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend the minister whether it would be of any assistance to him if i sent on to him for the consideration of his department the report which i have in my hand <e> <s> i understand that the evidence of this report has today been given to a committee of the united states congress or house of representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend the minister for his reply may i ask him whether it is not a fact that under an informal ministry and airlines animal dealers agreement at heathrow live animals are being imported through heathrow to transit sheds or cargo sheds and not direct to the quarantine station and that thus they are for many hours under no supervision at all <e> <s> does this not invite abuse of the rabies order <e>", "<cs> my lords in september this year at the invitation of the public services association of rhodesia i was invited to salisbury to address the members of that association <e> <s> its membership comprises some black and white africans <e> <s> they are not political they have given an undertaking to serve loyally any

bishop muzorewa months ago offered a cease-fire <e> <s> is not the essence of the difficulty now that if <e>", "<cs> my lords before i proceed to develop my speech this afternoon i should like to comment on some of the previous speeches <e> <s> as i said in the debate on the southern rhodesia bill i was in rhodesia during the lancaster house conference <e> <s> i met and <e>", "<cs> my lords i have discussed that very point with many of the civil servants of rhodesia and i would say this <e> <s> perhaps what is not known in this country and it should be known a little more clearly is that the public servants of a country or any administration are bound to give their loyalty and support to any government in power <e> <s> they do not strike and they never have struck in defence of any disagreement with that policy they are not allowed to have a policy at all <e> <s> they merely have to serve the government in power <e> <s> i am not defending udi <e> <s> many of the public servants

about the public officers agreement would he write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer and while appreciating that the government cannot give an exact or precise breakdown of the projects affected by the cuts may i ask whether an indication can be given of the countries most likely to be affected <e> <s> will the government give an assurance in regard to future years that grants in respect of aid are maintained at the highest level <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene for a few brief observations only <e> <s> i would not interpolate into any of the difficulties mentioned by other noble lords which have arisen in rhodesia since the governor lord soames took office <e> <s> may i pose this as a thought for some of us <e> <s> i cannot conceive of any more difficult a position for anybody to take up than that of the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> over our many years of experience in these matters when we were about to hand over independence to an independent government we always did so when we were satisfied of the situation of stability and that the moment was ripe to do so <e> <s> i would pay tribute to all members of your lordships house both of the opposition and of the government that over the years we appear to have succeeded in bringing two warring factions together to carry out elections in rhodesia for a new government in that country <e> <s> i think that that is a most remarkable achievement and one that we shall do well to remember <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her answer <e> <s> however is not this instruction rather hard to understand <e> <s> if public-spirited people such as the parents of children in schools and in industry out of their own pockets are prepared to offset cuts in grants in these difficult times in order to purchase books and school equipment should not they be praised and thanked rather than discouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords in further support of my noble friend lord selkirk may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that there is widespread public concern in this country about the danger of the extinction of the rhinoceros and that this is being made manifest by the large amount of public subscriptions which are being made to a charity the peoples trust for endangered species in order to save the rhinoceros from extinction <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly to say that i find it difficult to support the amendment <e> <s> i was chairman of a board of governors although it happened to be a girls school which i found very interesting and i should have thought that when one was considering the appointment of governors to the governing boards of schools it would be unnecessary to stipulate to education authorities the provisions they must take into account when making the selection <e> <s> i should have thought and it is my experience that they do think that it would be of importance to select a governor with special knowledge of educational matters certainly they would look at the desirability of having somebody with relevant links with the school itself and one would equally certainly look for a person who was living in the immediate neighbourhood <e> <s> i therefore cannot see that it is relevant to suggest that the amendment should be passed for i sincerely feel that these considerations are borne in mind by the education authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i am wondering whether anybody who has spoken here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on

lives to the service of freedom <e> <s> is he further aware that out of a total population of whites <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the foreign secretary if he is able to give this confirmation for what purpose the financial assistance is being given to the civil service in rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend be a little more specific <e> <s> to what projects is this aid to zimbabwe to be applied and how is the amount of necessary aid calculated <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend the minister of state for employment for his answer may i ask him three short questions first whether this action which is called for on th may is not political in essence <e> <s> secondly has not the national demonstration one purpose a purpose which is not connected with parliament or the ballot box which has already been stated by some trade union leaders and is to deter or defeat the government in respect of their economic policy the policy of a lawfully elected government <e> <s> i would also ask my noble friend this question if parliament is to mean anything should not this action on th may be stated clearly for what it is and in a conciliatory sense should not the tuc in the interests of all of us as well as in the interest of themselves be invited to withdraw the action which they have contemplated <e>", "<cs> my lords following the previous question may i ask my noble friend that it should be carefully borne in mind that to my knowledge many of these students who have come here attain a scientific training in engineering and so on and they go back to their own countries and probably bring orders for british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest respect to the speeches of the noble lords lord brockway and lord hatch <e> <s> i should like to support the government proposition that there should

people of that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister of state for employment for his answer but may i draw his attention to one fact which is illustrative of my question <e> <s> would he concede that in the case of fords the year saw them virtually free of strikes and industrial unrest an important factor in the all-time record pre-tax profit of that firm for the year <e> <s> does not this underline the desirability of avoiding strike action on all occasions except as a very last resort <e> <s> perhaps this example might be brought to the attention of those trade union leaders who have responsibility for trade union matters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the cause of freedom is not greater than the wish of any competitor to compete in the olympic <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider that we in your lordships house owe a great debt of gratitude this evening to my noble friend lord kimberley <e> <s> before i state my opinion on these issues may i refer to the speech of the noble marquess lord tweeddale <e> <s> he feels that our athletes have every right to go to moscow but i wonder whether he has ever experienced personally what it is like to lose his freedom <e> <s> some years ago i lost my freedom when a country was overrun <e> <s> i hope the circumstances in which i and many others suffered are not suffered by the noble marquess <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble marquess wishes me to answer him on that point i equally am keen on ones freedom and attach value to it but i think that sometimes one has got to make certain sacrifices like not going to the olympic games in order to preserve ones freedom <e> <s> that is my answer to the noble marquess and i hope that we shall go away tonight and think about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the noble marquess this before he sits down <e> <s>

authorities in fife made a gift of ratepayers money of to the russians in support of the olympic games <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend lord trefgarne whether it is really reasonable to expect us to wait before anything is done in order for approaches to be made by the ugandan government <e> <s> is it not a fact that the most frightful conditions are applying in uganda at the present moment <e> <s> can this business really wait bearing in mind the possibility of more deaths and events of that nature <e> <s> should we not initiate some action in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to his last answer may i ask my noble friend about help for the disabled <e> <s> can he tell your lordships specifically whether that help will apply to those who have suffered disability in war or as a result of war and whether it will apply to a different category of disabled people who have suffered during peace <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether there is no power within the british government to bring some influence to bear on other countries to get the international red cross to go back to afghanistan and carry out some duties there <e> <s> may i ask him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend this question on policy would he inform the house what right is possessed politically for labour-controlled boroughs or councils to use ratepayers money to thwart which is what it amounts to a facet of the foreign policy of her majestys government <e> <s> have they any remit from central government that they may act in this manner <e>", "<cs> my

<e> <s> i have one problem in trying to assimilate what he said about some of the great difficulties that he sees facing the british government and indeed everyone generally in coming to a satisfactory solution of the situation in south africa <e> <s> he made certain assumptions that i found very difficult to follow in statements about the reactions of the prime minister to certain situations and reactions to what has been going on in negotiations with other territories <e> <s> he may have a great deal more knowledge than i possess <e> <s> it seems to me that such difficulties would be known to those people in the foreign office currently engaged in the business of dealing with the south african situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which might be considered fairly reasonable as far as it goes <e> <s> but does it really cover a huge concern like the overseas service of the bbc <e> <s> in particular has he seen the comments made by the director general michael checkland in the bbc annual report for - in which he states that in order to bolster the power and safety of the bbc in the coming decade it will be necessary to establish a tv world service as well as providing the ordinary bbc broadcasting service that goes out <e> <s> those remarks were echoed <e>", "<cs> by some of his directors <e> <s> if this service is unable to be funded can my noble friend say what is to be done <e> <s> i understand that funds have been created but the government are unable to use them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> has not this fine financial achievement by the government brought confidence to the people of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i would submit with due deference to the noble lord lord bonham-carter that in asking this unstarred question on the report death on the rock by the noble lord lord windlesham and mr rampton qc he is asking the government and in particular sir geoffrey howe qc the foreign secretary whether sir geoffrey was not profoundly wrong originally in refusing thames television his permission to broadcast the programme and secondly he is saying that what is written in the report justifies thames televisions decision to go ahead with its original television programme and to ignore the foreign secretarys requests that it should not do so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it seemed a little odd <e> <s> what distressed me personally about the programme were incidents which followed directly from the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the demand for beds may depend on the state of health of the nation or on an epidemic at any one time <e> <s> does he also agree that it is extremely difficult to make a comparison concerning the demand for beds or for treatment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but is it not a fact that the social services budget now stands at some billion and that a sum of billion was earmarked for special expenditure by her majestys government for next year <e> <s> does that not represent greater investment by her majestys government in that connection than has been made on previous occasions <e> <s> should that fact not be noted and agreed with <e>", "<cs> my lords in making my contribution in this debate to take note of whether it might be appropriate to institute a war criminal trial in this country i do so with no pleasure since i suffered under the japanese kempetai in singapore during the occupation <e> <s> i do not take part in this debate this evening out of any sense of reflected glory to myself <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening my speech i should first like to express my appreciation to the noble lord lord bonham-carter for the motion moved by him and also great appreciation for the maiden speech made by the noble lord lord sharp of grimsdyke <e> <s> it is a great example of the assistance that can be given in your lordships house and of the people of his calibre and experience who come here to give us the benefit of their experience in such situations as we are considering today <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister saw the notices which appeared in various parts of london prior to the date of the march inviting the public to attend and saying that it would be peaceful <e> <s> in view of the fact that it turned out not to be peaceful perhaps i may ask my noble friend whether it has ever been considered that the organisers of marches of that type should be asked to give a guarantee before the march takes place that the march will be peaceful so far as they are able to do so <e>",

minister agree that the national economic development office forecast that an investment of million will be made this year or an increase of over per cent <e> <s> on the figure <e> <s> does he agree that that is a wonderful testament to the way that the government operate their regulations in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords for a number of reasons i support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord campbell <e> <s> so far as i am aware my noble friend and i and later the noble lord lord kagan are the only three peers in your lordships house who were in occupied territories during the last war <e> <s> we became accustomed to the actions of the secret police <e> <s> i in malaysia through the japanese kempetai and my noble friend who was in germany because of hitler <e> <s> when victory was achieved hitler would have stood as a war criminal if he had not acted quickly to prevent that by taking his own life <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s>
