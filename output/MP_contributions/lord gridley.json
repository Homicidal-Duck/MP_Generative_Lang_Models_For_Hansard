["<cs> i intervene briefly to say that i find it difficult to support the amendment <e> <s> i was chairman of a board of governors although it happened to be a girls school which i found very interesting and i should have thought that when one was considering the appointment of governors to the governing boards of schools it would be unnecessary to stipulate to education authorities the provisions they must take into account when making the selection <e> <s> i should have thought and it is my experience that they do think that it would be of importance to select a governor with special knowledge of educational matters certainly they would look at the desirability of having somebody with relevant links with the school itself and one would equally certainly look for a person who was living in the immediate neighbourhood <e> <s> i therefore cannot see that it is relevant to suggest that the amendment should be passed for i sincerely feel that these considerations are borne in mind by the education authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i am wondering whether anybody who has spoken here <e>"]
