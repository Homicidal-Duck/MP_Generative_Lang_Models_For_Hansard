["<cs> my lords i have just been experiencing the acute tension of waiting to make my maiden speech coupled with the extreme frustration of <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me particular pleasure as the last of the back-bench speakers to congratulate my noble friend lady blackstone on her excellent maiden speech <e> <s> she and i were colleagues at the london school of economics some years ago <e> <s> we went our separate ways <e> <s> i went on to found the economics department at queen mary college and my noble friend took a more circuitous route ending up as master of birkbeck <e> <s> perhaps more significantly like so many good academics our paths converge again and we now appear together in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i start on a slightly personal note <e> <s> may i say what a pleasure it is for me to follow the noble lord in this debate <e> <s> he does not know it but some years ago i was a very junior economist in the treasury when he was a very senior minister <e> <s> i fancied myself as a forecaster in those days as i still do but i should never have forecast that both he and i would sit together in your lordships house <e> <s> i suppose that if i had been able to forecast that i should also have forecast that he and i would sit on opposite sides and disagree in the debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not mean the minister himself <e> <s> what i mean is that i am struck by how other ministers on his side of the house will often tell us how valuable it is to spend money in those areas <e> <s> i apologise to him for suggesting that he might think it was a good idea to spend more money on health education or any of the matters i mentioned <e> <s> i strongly apologise but i have heard some of his colleagues say that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend takes the words out of my mouth <e> <s> having spent a lifetime in teaching i know of the pleasure one has when the light shines in the eyes of the more recalcitrant students because they eventually get the message <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington fully appreciates the point that that is the last occasion on which one should criticise or remind them of their past errors <e> <s> it is precisely the time when one should congratulate them <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the secretary of states answer most disturbing <e> <s> those of us who regard competition policy as the central issue in this field and who have had some experience in these matters are fully aware that it is always a matter of urgency <e> <s> that is one of the tricks of the trade <e> <s> i am disturbed that a senior and powerful minister such as the secretary of state in a government with a strong majority should already have been pushed into a matter which i believe is a matter of principle <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said earlier it ought to go to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start with a word of apology to the noble viscount lord whitelaw <e> <s> i shall not be here to hear him reply to the debate <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i also congratulate the noble earl and i hope that in a moment he will congratulate me <e> <s> this is the first time that i have dared to get to my feet to take part in question time <e> <s> will the noble lord tell me something which i do not fully understand <e> <s> why we need to have passport renewal at all <e> <s> why having made an application for a passport do we not as it were get one for life <e> <s> is it not a total waste of resources that one does not have a once-for-all passport <e>", "<cs> my lords has the secretary of state looked at the annual report of the office of fair trading and in particular the statement made by the director general about the resources available to him where he claims that if money and manpower ceilings were to become too tight in relation to the demand put upon his office then the taxpayer in his capacity as a consumer or as a trader would be likely to pay the price in other ways <e> <s> can the noble lord assure this house that enough resources will be made available to the director general so that competition policy can be pursued vigorously and expeditiously <e>", "<cs> my lords happily i am the first to congratulate the noble earl lord lauderdale on introducing this subject to your lordships house <e> <s> i must thank him for doing so <e> <s> in the remarks that i am about to make i shall make one or two of possibly a controversial nature with which he may disagree but i hope that he accepts my reassurance that this is not meant to detract from the enormous importance of the subject with which i agree entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords nonetheless i think that the noble earl will agree that the shorter the construction period the better from every point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to do that but i also believe that as a matter of courtesy i must thank all the noble lords who have contributed from both sides of the house for the excellence of their contributions <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the principal criterion to be applied here is what the work of art in question would fetch on the open market at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords therefore will the noble lord confirm what he seems to have said that there is literally no public interest whatever in this matter <e> <s> it is an astonishing position if that is what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather strange that at precisely the moment when this country has a manufacturing trade deficit for the first time in its modern history the government choose to close down and limit the activities of a body which might make a major contribution to reversing that trend <e>", "<cs> my lords following the minister in this debate i am in some slight difficulty <e> <s> i had hoped that he would be announcing some new policy initiatives and things of that kind <e> <s> instead of which i am forced to ask the question if the policy is so excellent why do the problems persist <e> <s> why is everything actually getting worse <e> <s> why is this so when there is this broad and non-political agreement that inner city problems are of major urgency and need to be tackled <e> <s> to be told that the problem is being tackled seems to me to fly in the face of all experience and all reality <e> <s> i am sorry to introduce a slightly acerbic note into what has been a rather less than acerbic debate but it is an important point to make <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may say how indebted we are to my noble friend lord lovell-davis for introducing this excellent debate <e> <s> i also say in particular to the noble baroness lady faithfull how much i agree with everything she had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords before turning to the remarks which i have prepared i feel obliged to refer to the powerful and in my opinion important speech of my noble friend lord carter <e> <s> it is not too much to say that i was deeply shocked by what he had to say about what is happening to the real income of the severely disabled <e> <s> one may argue backwards and forwards about possible social security reforms but it seems to me that as a minimum condition of a civilised society one would certainly insist that the real income of the severely disabled should never fall and at the very least should rise in line with the prosperity of the rest of the society in which we live <e> <s> i do not expect the noble earl lord arran to give us any assurances on that at this moment but i hope he will tell his right honourable friend the secretary of state that some of us are more than unhappy to be told that this is the state of affairs that will rule in our country <e> <s> since occasionally we understand that ministers are willing to think about matters i feel he really ought to consider this again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the secretary of state about two aspects of the statement which are slightly puzzling <e> <s> first nothing is said about the medium term financial strategy <e> <s> are we to assume that that is now dead and that the government do not rely on it at all as part of macro-economic policy <e> <s> secondly do the government have any view on the level of exchange rates as they exist at the present time <e> <s> in particular is dollars to the pound viewed by the government as a good development in terms of the present state of the balance of payments or as a bad development <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the noble viscount in dealing with this extremely technical matter and also accept that it ought not to be dealt with in party political terms <e> <s> but will be accept from me the proposition that it is not the case logically or within sound economics that in order to invest it is absolutely necessary to raise the rate of return <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject that we have been debating for the last few hours is an important one and as many noble lords have said is extremely complicated <e> <s> in my view there is much in it which is controversial but little that is party political <e> <s> indeed having sat through the debate i not surprisingly agree with quite a few of the remarks i have heard from the opposite side of the house and have not been entirely convinced by everything that i have heard from my own side <e> <s> clearly the committee stage of the bill should not be hurried <e> <s> it is too easy to make mistakes and we are talking about legislation which we hope will last for many decades <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i profoundly disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is not theft <e>", "<cs> i am saying that it is not theft <e> <s> i am providing the noble lord with a specific example <e> <s> i write quite a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not writing in order to get anything <e> <s> i want the people who are concerned to have it <e> <s> i do not deny that there are other authors especially in the field of fiction perhaps who have a different view <e> <s> i am simply pointing out that it is not quite as simple as those who say that it is theft would like to believe <e> <s> in many cases it is not in other cases it may be <e> <s> my only point was to get a sense of balance in the matter perhaps excessively since i am an economist <e> <s> i have no doubt that some writers feel very strongly that they do not want their work copied <e> <s> but i must say that a large number of us who are academics have exactly the opposite view <e> <s> i am certain that i am reflecting that view <e> <s> i do not doubt that the noble lord is reflecting another view <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that in the early days of the crash unit trusts apparently were not marketable and small savers investing in them were unable to sell them <e> <s> does he regard that as a satisfactory state of affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord clarify one aspect of his answer <e> <s> is he saying that even if it were possible to establish that some shares were not marketable in one way or another the government regard themselves as having no responsibility in that area whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that this could all be dealt with extremely easily simply by repealing this nonsensical legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords our debate today has been about such mundane matters as finance and the economic impact of science <e> <s> it has been a debate in which some six fellows of the royal society have spoken <e> <s> i feel i must echo very strongly what the noble lord lord adrian said namely that we must never forget that science is valuable in its own right <e> <s> it has played a great part in the glorious intellectual history of our country <e> <s> even in the present conditions of adversity it will surely continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that point it reminds me so much of the apologies that have been put forward over the past years for almost everything else to do with our relative decline <e> <s> it is always to do with the relative expansion somewhere else <e> <s> in some sense as it were by definition it is but that does not mean it is not a serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others in congratulating the noble lord lord mason of barnsley on his maiden speech <e> <s> perhaps i may also echo the earlier remarks that i really look forward to the day when he makes a controversial contribution to your lordships house <e> <s> following my old friend lord harris perhaps i may also say that i am sorry to hear that he has lost his innocence <e> <s> i always thought it was his most endearing characteristic and indeed what enabled him to be so effective in propagating his views <e> <s> i must also tell him that i at least still believe in the correctness of elementary economic theory <e>", "<cs> my lords at a rough glance there is a lot of very good sense in the white paper but the remarks made about sight testing are absolutely outrageous <e> <s> indeed seeing them placed in the context of raising resources they are even more outrageous <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord to remember that there is a perfectly good way of having the better-off provide more resources for the health service and it is called income tax <e> <s> to introduce user charges here is not justified in any way whatsoever and it seems to me to be a most doubtful thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly concentrating on one or two educational and economic aspects in the report <e> <s> first i should like to say that i think it was right of the government originally to question the support we gave to overseas students <e> <s> indeed i see this as part of a general view of scrutiny of public expenditure <e> <s> my view is that those of us who tend to favour public expenditure have a greater obligation to scrutinise its use as opposed to those who think that it is money thrown away <e> <s> therefore i do not object to the government looking at this matter as they did and asking questions about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not well established that apart from raising the tax threshold as a sensible way to operate in this area the best way of all is actually to raise child benefit in order to deal with poverty and other traps rather than lower it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too say with great pleasure that this is an excellent debate which the noble lord lord thorneycroft has introduced <e> <s> he referred to grave and difficult matters <e> <s> i agree with him on that <e> <s> he also said that we really do not know where these events may end <e> <s> i very much agree with him on that <e> <s> indeed i am not the kind of economist who always claims to know <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming i have done the sums correctly in my head is it the case that these overseas assets are earning less than per cent <e> <s> per annum in real terms <e> <s> is that not below what one would expect the normal rate of return to be from investment in british industry <e>", "<cs> if we cast our minds back to the second reading debate a number of noble lords spoke in favour of precisely a move in this direction and i was one of those <e> <s> i think what we had in mind was something extremely simple <e> <s> we simply hoped that the word photographic would appear in line on page after literary dramatic musical or artistic <e> <s> in other words we wanted photographic treated in exactly the same way as these other works <e> <s> i rise simply to support this amendment and also to ask the mover of the amendment or the minister whether the amendment does that simple thing which is what is required of treating photographic works in exactly the same way as all those other works <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which is extremely important <e> <s> the subject was discussed on second reading <e> <s> there was an impressive speech from the noble viscount lord eccles on the subject which many members of the committee will remember <e> <s> others spoke in favour of the equivalent of leaving out other than commercial research <e> <s> we argued it first on pragmatic grounds <e> <s> it seems strange that the government who are anxious to see the advancement of research in the private as well as the public sector and who are even more anxious to see joint work done in the public and private sectors should make the whole process infinitely more complex by saying we can draw a line where no line can be drawn <e>", "<cs> may i ask a similar question <e> <s> what about researchers who are employed by commercial companies many of whom do very serious academic research <e> <s> would it be good enough within the bill for a researcher to truly believe himself that this work is academic so long as he can say to himself i have truly looked in myself <e> <s> i believe it is academic and therefore it is academic <e> <s> i cannot see anything in the bill that says that <e> <s> but is that the answer to the question <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl clarify the amendment to some degree <e> <s> the only word in the amendment that seems to have significance is systematic <e> <s> i am puzzled by what he might mean by systematic <e> <s> what has to happen for someone to fall foul of the amendment <e>", "<cs> before making my final remarks i wonder whether i am in order to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first why does the bill in several places refer to education when it does not mean education <e> <s> secondly what is this curious objection that we see yet again because something happens to be commercial <e> <s> as far as i am concerned education is education <e> <s> if there is as it were a commercial element that does not derogate from the educational value <e> <s> i find this antipathy to making any commercial concession to education very odd <e> <s> i ask those two questions before making my concluding remarks <e>", "<cs> listening to the debate i remain completely convinced that from the common sense point of view i am entirely correct <e> <s> it seems to me that the argument is to make the exception for education which i do not think for one moment is meant to detract from the copyright that is given to the creative people who produce these works <e> <s> my basic argument is that they build on what is there in our common culture and therefore when granting a copyright we expect something back <e> <s> expecting something back broadly in education would not damage the rights of the original authors and owners to the degree that some noble lords say <e> <s> i remain convinced of the correctness of my argument <e> <s> on the other hand i have no great wish to divide the committee but i believe that i shall have the privilege of returning to the theme on a later occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there is a fundamental conflict of values or of interpretation of what we are observing <e> <s> i have consistently argued that the granting of copyright to the author and others is a privilege granted by society <e> <s> others seem to see it as an inalienable right <e> <s> it is not it is granted by society <e>", "<cs> i should not have known about it years ago but i know now that there is reprography <e> <s> however i want to make certain things that we do lawful because none of us likes to discover that some of the things that we do turn out to be unlawful <e> <s> that seems to be central to the issue <e> <s> the idea that those of us who do a tiny modicum of copying are somehow stealing from authors seems to me to be extreme beyond belief <e>", "<cs> i know that i should not put on my professorial hat and get annoyed with those who do not understand what it is i am trying to say because all good teachers must persevere <e> <s> the point of my amendment is precisely that at the present time and under the bill as it exists there will be plenty of copying because the whole point is that the copying that goes on is completely wasteful <e>", "<cs> i am not anxious to prolong the debate <e> <s> however i am anxious to get the argument correct <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that the city university is so well off compared with the university of london <e> <s> i am worried that we are debating at cross-purposes <e> <s> i am not opposed to licensing schemes or any of the things that my noble friend lord willis and the noble earl lord stockton wish to see happen <e> <s> i am asking only for a modicum of reason <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord finally sits down may i ask whether i fully understand what he said at the end of his speech that the government are content to leave private home taping of a record bought by an individual as an illegal act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that everyone who is involved with health care will be pleased to hear about the extra million although i think that many will see it more as a sticking plaster than a fundamental intervention that is required to deal with a crisis <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can tell us first how the extra million will actually be allocated between health authorities secondly where the extra million is coming from and thirdly whether the extra million is a once-and-for-all allocation which means that it will merely postpone the crisis or can one rely on it to be next years base <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the minister for a moment <e> <s> what i had in mind was whether the allocations were according to the present shortfall as seen in the accounts of the health authorities or whether they were going to be related to medical need in some more positive way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord sefton on introducing the debate <e> <s> however having listened to some of the comments that he made i think that he regards me and those like me in the south as part of a problem rather than as people anxious to help with a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that is the case and in the ministers reply i hope to hear a statement along those lines <e> <s> however i do not think that as yet your lordships have heard a statement to that effect <e> <s> my main conclusion is that a statement as regards policy is precisely what is required <e> <s> to repeat the point made in the document i see that policy as a combination of the reinforcement and encouragement of market forces which is clearly needed but equally a great degree of government intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe very strongly that your lordships house should always act cautiously in rejecting what the elected other place wishes to do <e> <s> however where the other place uses its powers to limit the freely decided activities of another elected body or bodies then that restraint is less compelling <e> <s> indeed i go further and say that it is also less compelling when attempts are made to limit the authority and power of any other independent organisations or institutions <e>", "<cs> i do my lords but i do not have the faintest idea why that is relevant to this debate <e> <s> it does not seem to me that the view that one has to take or some of us do should be what is determined by either christian or jewish teaching specifically in its original or primitive form <e> <s> some of us believe that in the past years there have been some developments in human thought and human moral values and therefore are not ashamed to take a different view <e>", "<cs> my lords my point still remains that the examples are trivial <e> <s> the substantial point that i wish to raise is not the question whether local authorities make mistakes <e> <s> those of us who live in london as i have all my life are perfectly aware that authorities right and left do things we do not care for <e> <s> our concern is whether as my noble friend lady blackstone said the sledgehammer of central government is required in these cases <e> <s> that was the point i was trying to make <e> <s> perhaps we shall have a chance to debate it again later in the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> may i remind her <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall the debate we had in november just following that statement in which all sides of the house expressed strong support for basic science and suggested that it might be a good idea to review the expenditure statement of her right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> is there any likelihood of urgent action to meet the needs of science which are so important for our countrys future <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether he would consider answering the actual question on the order paper which is whether her majestys government believe that the provision for treatment of these cases in this area is adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly one does not wish to impose on the noble earl at this time but in considering the white paper and what ground it covers can those of us who have been involved in public life on the official side and who have played according to the rules namely that we have not breached confidentiality at any time be assured that the secretary of state has in mind that the legislation will also cover ministers so that they might also consider sticking to the official secrets act both in the letter and in the spirit <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the minister before he moves to the next point <e> <s> he is seeking to reassure the committee about the nature of the clause as put forward and as he seeks now to amend it <e> <s> i wish to ask him two specific questions concerning his reassurances <e> <s> is he saying to the committee that if the clause in his amended form passes into law we can be absolutely certain that as a consequence no book will have to be withdrawn from a library <e> <s> secondly may we be assured that no teacher librarian or other local authority employee who is explicitly homosexual will <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask for one final clarification <e> <s> i thank the noble earl for his clarification on the matter of who may bring an action <e> <s> however i am even more confused now <e> <s> let us assume on the one hand that there is an argument about a certain authority promoting homosexuality <e> <s> assuming that does that not bring into question everything that the local authority is doing <e> <s> therefore as my noble friend lord mccarthy has said the issue of shakespeares sonnets would arise <e> <s> one is arguing in a sense that the authority is promoting a positive policy and defying everybody <e> <s> therefore how is one to know that those particular books are not connected with the promotion of homosexuality <e>", "<cs> i must apologise <e> <s> i thought my two amendments were very innocuous and i thought they would be dealt with very rapidly but i am relatively inexperienced <e> <s> of course i agree <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one brief point which follows on what the noble baroness lady blatch has said <e> <s> it has been bothering me all day <e> <s> the suggestion has been made that opposition to clause stems primarily from homosexuals <e> <s> to my certain knowledge so far as concerns the arts that is simply not the case because the whole force of objection is coming from people who are heterosexual <e> <s> that applies to the sciences as well <e> <s> however to judge it as opposition from a small pressure group is entirely erroneous <e> <s> we ought to get that point on the record <e> <s> the objections are not from groups asking for special privileges but precisely from other groups who say that they do not want that to happen <e>", "<cs> this has been a very long debate <e> <s> i sat through the whole of the debate yesterday as did the minister who is also sitting through all of the present debate <e> <s> it seems to me that the debate has been excellent in the sense that it has simply demonstrated how unsatisfactory is this clause <e> <s> it has simply not been thought through <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to clarify his answer <e> <s> is he saying that it is the view of her majestys government that it is not their intention that those disabled after april will lose compared with those disabled before then and that they will guarantee one way or another that no disadvantage will result <e> <s> does he mean that it is purely a matter or technique and that if one technique fails the government will find another one <e> <s> is that how we are to understand the ministers remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the reply that the noble baroness gave i think it was two questions back in which she outlined the governments general view of the position and the circumstances that are now emerging in our society <e> <s> will she confirm that the religious provisions in the new education bill will allow for much greater flexibility under the heading of corporate worship with regard to the timing of the act of corporate worship <e> <s> will she also confirm that this greater flexibility has been broadly welcomed by all the relevant churches <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first make this point <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to my colleague lady blackstone and her remarks on ilea <e> <s> in case your lordships have misunderstood her view my noble friend was and is totally against the abolition of ilea <e> <s> her comment to which the minister referred was simply to the effect that if the government were against ilea they should show a little courage by removing it rather than killing it off by the death of a thousand cuts <e> <s> i make that point just in case there was any misunderstanding of my noble friends position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather puzzled by one aspect of the noble lords answer <e> <s> is he saying that the recent strike in connection with a rise in wages is unconnected with the claimed rise in productivity <e> <s> i go on to ask him whether his claim about unemployment falling last year will carry on into the coming year <e> <s> in other words will unemployment go on falling at the same annual rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i take part in the debate with some trepidation <e> <s> i am not a farmer <e> <s> it is a great many years since i looked at the common agricultural policy <e> <s> in view of what i am about to say perhaps i should add that i was in favour of the united kingdom joining the ec on balance <e> <s> the negative part of the balance was the common agricultural policy <e> <s> if asked about the prospects at the time we joined i should have said that by we would have it reformed and sorted out <e> <s> i would have thought it unbelievable for the common agricultural policy to be in a greater mess in than when we joined <e> <s> i say that to put the matter into context <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister whether his department has done the calculation the other way round namely whether he has worked out what the cost would be to reduce the waiting list by per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking specifically with regard to london <e> <s> the right way is to take the length of the waiting list and to work out what it would cost to reduce it by given amounts <e> <s> if we knew the answer to that question then we would have a perspective of the nature of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her answer to my question <e> <s> i should like to pursue that matter further and ask whether she <e>", "<cs> my lords were i to ask the noble baroness whether she would also favour the use of the market mechanism to deal with the shortage subjects which has also been reported in the education press would her answer be that that also is speculation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to bear in mind as policy develops that some of us consider that we have an excellent civil service <e> <s> it is one of the few institutions in this country that is admired world-wide for its honesty probity reliability and devotion to duty <e> <s> i believe that it is one of the few institutions that the rest of the world would swap for their own <e> <s> i do not think that they would change their businessmen for ours and they would not change their trade union structures for ours <e> <s> but i think that they would like to have our civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may start by congratulating the noble lords lord joseph and lord stevens of ludgate and the noble viscount lord oxfuird on their maiden speeches <e> <s> i do not say that merely as part of the normal courtesies of your lordships house <e> <s> i could not flatter them more than to say that i wish that their speeches were not maiden speeches so that i could respond in my more usual controversial and acerbic fashion <e> <s> suffice it to say that i look forward to more such opportunities in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord in case he misunderstood <e> <s> i was under the impression that i was making a joke i was being a trifle frivolous <e> <s> i should love your lordships house to be full of mobile telephones <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that some of us thought that the point of this question was to throw light on the financing of the national health service will the noble lord tell us whether he regards himself as the right minister to answer the question in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying a few words about the current economic context <e> <s> the minister who introduced the debate tried to do that to a limited extent <e> <s> my difficulty is that it was impossible to recognise anything corresponding to economic reality in what he said especially when he referred to our recent experience as the best economic performance since the war <e> <s> my perusal of the facts and that of other commentators certainly leads to a different view <e> <s> in particular so far as concerns this bill one must never forget that unemployment is still at a very high level by any post-war standards <e> <s> it may well be that the minister will say well unemployment is falling <e> <s> however the extent to which it is falling is much more a measure of the extent to which the government forced it up in the first place <e> <s> indeed one is reminded of the alleged benefits of self-flagellation or beating ones head against a brick wall it feels so much better when one leaves off <e> <s> that is certainly what we are observing with the current decline in the rates of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to be the first to congratulate the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead on his maiden speech <e> <s> he has been a major figure in our public life for many years and we look forward to his many further interventions in the deliberations in your lordships house <e> <s> i must also say how much i am looking forward to the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of chester who will speak immediately after me <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords who have taken part in the debate and especially my noble friend lady ewart-biggs for introducing it <e> <s> i begin with some of the general principles <e> <s> we must all agree that ultimately in judging the performance of any industry the consumers interests must be dominant <e> <s> even where the industrys customers include firms the cost of overcharging such firms or providing them with poor service will be passed on to their customers as well <e> <s> it is entirely right to take the consumers attitude as central to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount confirm one matter that i understood him to say namely that the ordinary consumer of electricity will still be confronted with a monopoly supplier and that <e>", "<cs> my lords where will there be competition <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ask his right honourable friend the secretary of state whether it is possible for a document to be produced later in the year explaining and clarifying the law as it will then stand bearing in mind the large number of lay people notably parents who will be involved in the education decision-making process as governors and in other ways and who will have great difficulty in understanding the complexity of the law as it applies to them <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the minister will come back to the house may i ask do not the government have a duty if the rover group is to be sold to obtain the highest possible price for it <e> <s> therefore whether there is an exclusive basis for dealing or not will he not at some stage have to explore other possible bids for this concern <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord beloff for introducing this important topic <e> <s> let me say to him apropos his opening remarks or perhaps i should say it to the noble viscount lord davidson that there is no danger of fisticuffs verbal or otherwise this evening <e> <s> indeed given this lovely spring day my mind turns to quite other subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that surely the best way of disposing of the surpluses is to dispose of the idiotic common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> in attaching my name to the first amendment let me say first that although i am sympathetic to the other amendments mentioned by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls it seems to me that the key amendment is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he referred to those of us who disagreed with him as deluded <e> <s> is he aware of the research evidence that shows we are not deluded <e> <s> there is no evidence to show a causal connection between licensing hours and alcoholism <e> <s> if he were merely to use his common sense if i may be as robust as he was when he referred to delusion he would see that the provisions of alcoholic beverages in off-licences and similar places is a response to a demand <e> <s> it is not causal <e> <s> it is not remotely connected with the opening hours of licensed premises <e> <s> the noble lord is entitled to his view of the problems of society connected with alcoholism but he is not entitled to mislead the committee about what we know <e> <s> it is not a matter of doubt <e> <s> it is a matter that has been studied and shown not to be the cause <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene my difficulty is that i do not fully understand the noble earls reply <e> <s> as best i understand it it was we wont do it full stop <e> <s> we have decided not to do it and thats it <e> <s> i do not regard that as a reasoned reply <e> <s> i do not like to be a nuisance but i personally would prefer to divide the house if i am simply told you cant have it full stop <e> <s> i do not know what the noble earl thinks <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords for taking part in this debate and the minister for her response <e> <s> i believe it is a besetting sin of your lordships house that we tend to be a trifle self-congratulatory <e> <s> this has been a very good debate and i for one have learnt a great deal from it <e> <s> not least of the contributions has been that of the noble marquess lord huntly <e> <s> he referred to his father as having one or two outrageous views and it may be that the noble marquess has one or two such views himself <e> <s> in that case i look forward very much to hearing them <e> <s> if it will encourage him he ought to know that one or two others of us have opinions which are occasionally a trifle <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lord ennals for introducing the debate <e> <s> it is an extremely important subject and i was determined to take part <e> <s> however i shall not be able to stay to the end of the debate <e> <s> i have apologised to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for that and for the fact that i shall not be able to hear his reply <e> <s> i look forward eagerly to reading it <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall return to that <e> <s> however as i argued earlier when the noble lord was not present in the chamber the additional funds needed are net of the funds which are in the public expenditure white paper <e> <s> the requirement is for a further billion or so on top of those funds <e> <s> i am not denying that there are additional nominal sums of money being put forward <e> <s> they are nominal in terms of current prices rather than in the sense of being trivial <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall detain the house for only a few moments on this matter <e> <s> i have two topics to raise <e> <s> one concerns article of the order <e> <s> we welcome the article with respect to options on palladium and platinum especially as my noble friend lord williams of elvel was particularly keen to see platinum introduced <e> <s> should other markets develop for options in other precious metals will the minister say whether the government have it in mind to amend this order or introduce another order to deal with that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords if the issue is one of knowledge and of dissemination of knowledge would it be possible to levy vat at a maximum rate on some alleged newspapers while not levying it on serious newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question asked by my noble friend lord williams of elvel <e> <s> in previous privatisations whether or not one agreed with them the private sector ended up with the real assets of the business and the exchequer ended up with some cash <e> <s> in this one as the noble lord has described it the private sector appears to me at least to end up with the business but the exchequer is out of pocket to the tune of million <e> <s> that is exactly what the minister has said <e> <s> will he confirm that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the minister how pleased i am to have that answer to my question <e> <s> will she take this opportunity to utter a word of criticism to that small minority of people who seem to be going out of their way to undermine this important educational development <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join with other noble lords in congratulating the select committee on a quite superb report and in thanking the noble lord lord shackleton for introducing the report to us in such an excellent and interesting way <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord for moment <e> <s> he said that he would make a statement on what the governments space policy is <e> <s> i take it that the noble lord will not sit down before telling us that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would care to correct one aspect of an answer which he has just given <e> <s> is he not aware that the sterling/dollar rate and the sterling/deutschemark rate were considerably higher when the labour party was last in power than at the present time and that sterling is now devalued against both the dollar and the deutschemark compared with years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord clarify his answer to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that i misunderstood <e> <s> am i right in assuming that any applications made before st march will be assessed according to the current law <e> <s> i refer not to this bill but the bill that this legislation terminates <e> <s> the minister seemed to say that the earlier applications would not be dealt with in this way but i do not think he meant that <e>", "<cs> i suppose that in one way the amendment of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is a forlorn hope because it is essentially an amendment which totally undermines the nature of the bill <e> <s> i recall the second reading debate <e> <s> we agreed then that the purpose of this legislation was not to end regional policy <e> <s> we agreed that we still believed regional policy to be of great significance and that we might regard it as becoming more significant in the future than it had been in the past <e> <s> i gather that we are not to interpret what the government propose to do here as somehow the government announcing that regional policy is at an end <e> <s> we were all interested in that common view that we held <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will forgive me for speaking a second time but i believe that the discussion is getting slightly out of control <e> <s> i understood that the amendment was not specifically directed to scotland that we were not debating scotland not interpreting the bill as being in some sense anti-scottish <e> <s> i did not approach the amendment in that way and i am now a little taken aback to find myself in the middle of a scottish versus english debate <e> <s> i hope that that is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord dean of beswick on introducing this important debate <e> <s> the report by the audit commission <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to comment on the fact that the very low paid and those on social security have marginal rates of tax in the order of per cent <e> <s> does he not think that at some time there should be tax reforms which offer some incentives to those people <e>", "<cs> my lords my first pleasure is to congratulate the two maiden speakers <e> <s> as a fellow academic i was most sympathetic to what the noble earl lord russell had to say <e> <s> he reminded me of a matter that we must raise in due course which is the financial time bomb ticking under our universities <e> <s> several of us are very close to disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to differ with the noble lord <e> <s> it does inhibit the university giving tenure to anyone it chooses <e> <s> our amendment would do precisely what the noble lord lord annan wishes which is to provide that the university should be free to offer tenure to anyone it wishes <e> <s> this bill and the commissioners prevent that happening <e> <s> however we shall deal with the matter in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not looked at the figures recently but can the noble lord tell the house why he chose the year as the base year <e> <s> is that an especially good year to throw light on the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness care to answer the second part of my noble friends question and say whether the government have any view as to why universities are having to sell these books <e> <s> is it not because they are desperately short of money which is needed for serious higher education purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene briefly <e> <s> first i hope that the noble lord remembers that i took part in the committee stage of the bill but i did not get a copy of the letter to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i am grievously disappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords following my noble friends second question why does the noble lords department need to spend any money at all on advertising <e> <s> to use his favourite phrase why can it not rely upon market forces <e>", "<cs> i thought that this was a serious subject but one or two of the interventions did not suggest to me that it was serious <e> <s> however we shall now try to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> it is more than also it is almost entirely <e>", "<cs> i cannot speak for my noble friend but i hope that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls will bear with at least one or two of us who are still relatively new at this game certainly i am <e> <s> sometimes one does not remember to make the appropriate remarks <e> <s> having said that it is certainly my view that what we are trying to do here and just to anticipate there will be many other attempts late into the night is to understand what is happening <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words about amendment no <e> <s> which has been tabled by my noble friend lord carter and myself <e> <s> i did not take part in the debate on religious education but i am bound to say that i believe that in considering children with special needs we have a moral imperative <e> <s> those of us who in a sense are self-sufficient in what we do have a particular obligation to take such children seriously in educational terms and also to bear in mind the problems that their parents and families in general have in these matters <e>", "<cs> i do not feel that a topic such as this is one on which the committee should divide <e> <s> the subject of children with special needs is such that we ought to work the matter out by debating it and getting it straight <e> <s> although as i had already anticipated i accept the view that somewhere implicit in the bill are concerns corresponding to my amendment i should be a great deal happier if the minister felt able to say that she would think further about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> an explicit statement by the government of a commitment by the secretary of state to take account of children with special needs would be an enormous boost <e> <s> even if it simply makes what is implicit explicit i argue that that is a good thing <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it is in order for me to ask a question <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are fundamentally important amendments which i was proposing to move with the noble lord lord joseph <e> <s> i should like to know when those amendments were suddenly destroyed <e> <s> i have been sitting here for most although not all of todays debate and i fail to see how such an important issue can suddenly disappear so to speak by magic <e> <s> at the very least i require an explanation <e>", "<cs> i must say that i did not even know that amendment no <e> <s> had been accepted <e> <s> in those circumstances i should have thought that some explanation would have been in order <e> <s> i must appeal to someone who is concerned with such matters and say that to allow such an important amendment to disappear on a bill of such importance is not the way to conduct business correctly <e>", "<cs> under no circumstances do i wish to criticise the chair or go against the rules <e> <s> however i hope that the committee realises how fundamental this set of amendments is <e> <s> in terms of the curriculum for me these are the most important amendments <e> <s> i am sorry that we should have been debating them so late though it appears that now we are not going to debate them at all <e> <s> it is an absurd state of affairs that an issue as important as this can be ruled out by rules <e>", "<cs> we can carry this on almost endlessly <e> <s> however may i ask this question <e> <s> does the core curriculum stay in the bill <e> <s> is there any possibility that we can argue that the core curriculum ought to be in the national curriculum <e> <s> that is what this point is about <e> <s> as i understand it the core curriculum is in the bill <e> <s> i simply wish to argue that point <e> <s> i believe that somebody ought to find a way to enable me to do that if not now at some other time <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may at least ask for a modicum of clarification <e> <s> it seems to me that the bill must take precedence <e> <s> one may disagree but the fact is that as the government have said this is a major if not the central piece of legislation in the education field for a generation <e> <s> i refuse to believe that the rules will be such that the consideration of the bill would be damaged <e> <s> i should simply like some explanation of when we can discuss the point at issue <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has made a very important statement if i understand it correctly <e> <s> i hope that the committee will bear with me if i ask one or two more questions in order to make sure that i understand what she has said <e> <s> am i right in assuming that with regard both to the core subjects and to the foundation subjects at the different stages the government are saying that in no case will these become mandatory until it is clear that the available resources are there <e>", "<cs> i do not really want to continue i was asking a negative question <e> <s> if the maths teachers are not there will the government agree that this aspect of the matter cannot go forward <e> <s> i fully accept that if the teachers are there it can go forward but that is not really the interesting question <e> <s> the interesting question is the negative one <e> <s> i use maths teachers as an example <e> <s> if they are not there will the government hold back until we get them <e>", "<cs> in view of the very important contribution to this debate by the noble baroness i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak with some trepidation but nonetheless someone ought to say that he does not agree <e> <s> that person is me <e> <s> i add that i am speaking very much for myself on this issue <e>", "<cs> i am deeply disappointed with the reply of the noble baroness because it does not seem to me to address itself to the argument that was put forward <e> <s> in pressing for the core curriculum as being the central mandatory part none of us is arguing that there should not be a broad curriculum <e> <s> none of us is arguing that at all <e> <s> indeed our whole point is that there should be a much broader curriculum <e> <s> our view esentially and we could in due course table such amendments if this amendment were to be carried is that there should be a broad range of possible subjects <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment on what the noble baroness lady blatch said <e> <s> it seemed to me that she put her finger on the central issue which is precisely connected with what some of us are objecting to <e> <s> the possible list of subjects which someone thinks ought to be mandatory is much longer than even the noble baroness says and she could produce a list twice as long as that with no trouble whatsoever <e> <s> that is the basis of our objection that we can think of so many things that are desirable in a broad curriculum and certainly those that have been mentioned including those which the noble baroness lady faithfull has brought up <e> <s> we want an explanation still of why those included are there and those omitted are not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for just a moment so that i may ask him to clarify what in fact he is saying <e> <s> am i right in thinking that he is not actually discussing taxation he is discussing income taxation <e> <s> can he tell us about indirect taxation national insurance contributions and such matters so as to give us a broader view of the taxation changes over the past decade <e>", "<cs> my lords how pleasant it is to get away from the turbulence of the education reform bill albeit for only a day and enter the tranquil waters of applied economics <e> <s> we are indebted to the noble lord lord joseph for allowing us to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords those were periods when our economy was growing pretty rapidly <e> <s> it was a period during which both the government of whom the noble lord was a member and a supporter and the labour government were in power <e> <s> a great deal of that situation was not dissimilar to what we are observing now <e> <s> in his day the buoyancy of the economy generated tax increases <e> <s> i do not say that that is wrong i am simply saying that it is an argument which has been investigated and which does not seem to stand up <e> <s> what does stand up is that we must look at the fundamentals behind our economy <e> <s> i agree very strongly with the noble lord on that point and believe that adam smith would also have agreed with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not wish to press the point too strongly <e> <s> it is worth making the point because it is interesting in economic terms <e> <s> if tax rates are cut it is easier to make money <e> <s> it is therefore not obvious that one puts in more effort to make money <e> <s> one might put in less effort <e> <s> that is a central proposition of economics <e> <s> that is the difficulty that <e>", "<cs> i am anxious to be helpful <e> <s> i must tell the minister that i do not understand what she is saying <e> <s> it would help us to make up our minds about what to do next with the amendments if she would clarify matters <e> <s> we have no difficulty with diagnostic tests <e> <s> we all agree that they are a good idea <e> <s> it is not obvious to us why they should not be done continuously but nevertheless they are a good idea <e> <s> if one does diagnostic tests one can respond to them and do something helpful for the individual child <e> <s> there is no problem for us there <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one remark <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness lady young was trying to be helpful to the minister <e> <s> all the minister has to say is that she will take seriously what we have said take this amendment seriously and come back to us <e> <s> i do not think we shall necessarily press the point but i must draw the attention of noble lords to the fact that the minister has not said that <e> <s> she has given us exactly the opposite impression that she does not like what we are saying nor our amendments <e> <s> we are desperately trying to be helpful and if the minister will say that then i personally shall be quite happy <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will bear with me if i pursue this matter a little further <e> <s> perhaps i may first say that i am somewhat at a loss <e> <s> i am not aware that we disposed of the equivalent amendment to clause assuming that the noble baroness was referring to my amendment because i did not move it <e> <s> i am a little at a loss about that matter <e> <s> unless i was asleep i am pretty sure that i did not move the amendment so it is still there to be brought back in the future should i want to move it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return to this point <e> <s> i too believe very strongly in that <e> <s> the central part of my own theme and my view of decision-making is that i want secretaries of state who are able to act <e> <s> however i should still like them to be constrained by rationality <e> <s> in particular i should like the committeee to bear in mind a point that i made earlier about the principle of fallibility <e> <s> the essence of all decision-making is that there is always the fairly high probability that one is mistaken <e> <s> the whole aim of the democratic academic and argumentation processes is to expose fallibility <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am not too happy about that explanation but i should like to think about what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> as she is well aware i have ample opportunity to put down similar amendments throughout the passage of the bill and to discuss the same principle further so since no other noble lords seem to be very interested i shall not detain the committee any longer <e> <s> i am not sure whether the correct procedure is to withdraw the amendment or not to move it i shall do whatever is appropriate <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not want to wreck the clauses i am trying to improve them <e> <s> i am getting rather fed up with the fact that every time one tries to make a contribution one is told that one is wrecking the bill <e> <s> there are other areas in regard to which i shall be looking forward to wrecking the bill but this is certainly not one of them <e>", "<cs> i am probably in one of my more stupid moods because i do not see how it would defeat what the noble baroness lady young had in mind if i understood her correctly <e> <s> she is saying that there should be a national system of assessment <e> <s> regretfully i agree with her that everybody should have a piece of paper <e> <s> i hate credentialism but we seem to live in that sort of world and anyway it cheers people up to have a piece of paper <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will bear with me and she and i both stayed until oclock the other morning and i am not in the mood for that again so i agree that we should like to get a move on i am not saying that i want a local curriculum <e> <s> we are not debating the national curriculum <e> <s> unless i now totally misunderstand her i regard the individual attainment targets and the programmes of study as being what they are <e> <s> they are concerned with what one actually does in education <e> <s> they are concerned with the individual child and what that child is doing <e> <s> i can see the des laying down a very broad view on that but i regard the specifics of it and i thought that was what the noble baroness lady young was saying as being very much a local matter <e>", "<cs> i am still totally at a loss <e> <s> i do not wish to divide the committee but perhaps the noble baroness may wish to think more about what has been said <e> <s> i shall think more about what has been said and return to the subject at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl to clarify the matter <e> <s> are we not discussing an amendment which relates to the foundation subjects <e> <s> the minister has replied as regards the core subjects which are different from the foundation subjects <e> <s> unless i misunderstood him he seems to have said that programmes of study for the foundation subjects will be guidelines and therefore my noble friend is pushing at an open door <e> <s> i should like some clarification on this point <e>", "<cs> those of us who have some experience of teaching know that after a certain amount of time one is wasting ones time in attempting to communicate but i will still carry on <e>", "<cs> maybe that is the explanation and we have all totally misunderstood the bill <e> <s> are we being asked to accept that the expression the core and other foundation subjects is to be taken to mean that the foundation subjects consist of the core and other foundation subjects and that that is what the bill means <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall continue to keep up our efforts on the gcse <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before doing so can the noble baroness clarify this point <e> <s> in the areas where the secretary of state will consult will he make it known positively to interested parties that their views are desired or will the interested parties take it for granted that the initiative must lie on their side <e> <s> will consultation mean a positive statement such as i should like you to tell me what you think or the negative approach if you have anything to tell me come and tell me <e> <s> have i made myself clear <e>", "<cs> with that reassurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a brief word on the nature of these councils which follows on from what my noble friend lady david and the noble earl lord russell have said <e> <s> the noble baroness emphasised to us her view of the councils as being independent <e> <s> we certainly would like them to be so <e> <s> they do advise and many of us have been in the business of advising for many years <e> <s> i have advised ministers <e> <s> there are two kinds of advice that one can give advice that they want to hear and advice that they do not want to hear <e> <s> my own view is that the only advisers who are worthwhile are those who give advice that ministers do not wish to hear <e> <s> my concept of independence is the concept of saying things which to say the least can be something of a nuisance <e> <s> i believe that is what the noble earl had in mind <e>", "<cs> i am most annoyed with the noble lord lord ritchie because i have naive in my notes and i am at a loss to think of another adjective now that he has also used jejune and unsophisticated <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord rose to that bait <e> <s> i actually do not have quite the antipathy to geography that i sound as though i have <e> <s> if i use the word foundation and i say to myself is putting in geography somehow foundation <e> <s> intuitively it does not ring true to me <e> <s> my point is precisely what the noble lord lord trafford said <e> <s> what one wants is an explicit recognition of groups <e> <s> that is what one wants <e> <s> i should like the bill to say that <e> <s> if the bill said that then i feel that it would be enormously improved <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we may have misunderstood this <e> <s> my reading of clause is that there are excepted provisions <e> <s> only some under subsection seem to be made by positive resolution <e> <s> large numbers seem to be subject to annulment which i think means negative resolution <e> <s> never having been in the other place i have no idea what the difference is but the procedures are certainly not the same <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the minister for a moment <e> <s> my understanding of the word tautological is that it means self-evidently right <e> <s> did the minister mean to say tautological <e>", "<cs> i just have one brief point to make and then i shall sit down <e> <s> i should just like to go on record for saying that i believe that in many cases children are very much better judges of their educational needs and of the education that they are receiving than their parents are <e> <s> that follows on from a remark made by the noble lord lord somers earlier <e>", "<cs> i have become most puzzled while listening to this discussion <e> <s> i should like some clarification by the movers of the two amendments because my interpretation of them is that the <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady young emphasised the matter is extremely serious <e> <s> we on this side of the committee are very sympathetic to the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> there are two types of truancy and it is concentrated in the to year-old age group <e> <s> the noble baroness was entirely correct when she spoke of the other consequences of truanting <e> <s> truants are people who have all the broad social difficulties and truancy is related to juvenile delinquency vandalism and other such behaviour <e> <s> that behaviour is confined to a minority <e> <s> however it sometimes seems to dominate our environment particularly in the inner cities <e> <s> one of the difficulties is that of parental complacency <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord seebohm when he says that parents must be confronted with the problem <e> <s> however many of the truants about whom we are speaking this afternoon do not have the sort of parents who will help to solve the problem <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but i am completely lost <e> <s> which amendment are we currently dealing with <e> <s> i thought that we were dealing with amendment no <e> <s> zc but the noble baroness appears to be talking to amendment no <e> <s> zd <e> <s> did we deal with amendment no <e> <s> zc without anyone telling us <e>", "<cs> has the minister finished her contribution at this stage as regards amendment no <e> <s> zd <e>", "<cs> i believe that i strongly support this clause but since i am not sure whether i fully understand it perhaps i may ask one or two questions before committing myself totally <e> <s> as i understand the clause and as i understand the noble baroness the school day if we take that as an example will be determined by the governors <e> <s> am i to understand that they will be able to determine the school day in a totally unconstrained fashion <e> <s> will the governor who decides to concentrate the whole of the schools activity in the first part of the day be allowed to do that or more or less have any other arrangement <e> <s> more generally is this an area where <e>", "<cs> while thanking the noble baroness for the answer so far perhaps i could press her since we are seeking to probe this matter to say someting about two other aspects of these amendments <e> <s> unless i misheard her she does not seem to have included these in her answer <e>", "<cs> before the minister answers perhaps i may say that i have been listening to the discussion and i find it difficult to understand why we need to draw the line in the way the minister has suggested <e> <s> why can we not define something to be called to year-old education some of which takes place in predominantly full-time institutions and some in more flexible institutions <e> <s> why must we have the distinction between schools and fe colleges <e> <s> that seems to me to be a hangover from the past <e> <s> since we are dealing with the education reform bill perhaps this is a chance to get rid of the distinction altogether and to realise that we are moving into an entirely new era in which we can call all such schools colleges without worrying about their composition <e>", "<cs> while thanking the noble baroness for her answer there are two points i should like to <e>", "<cs> i should also like to add a little more <e> <s> i assume that these are still education institutions and that academic matters still take first priority <e> <s> i am most concerned that we seem to have lost sight of that altogether <e> <s> having sat as a governor on such bodies i must tell the noble and learned lord that on the whole business people are pretty useless <e> <s> they do not understand many of the matters although they try very hard <e> <s> i should like them to be there to some degree but the weight given to them does not appear to me to be helpful <e> <s> i find to be most distressing the lack of weight given to the community with people concerned with the highest education and academic standards <e> <s> i do not believe that these institutions have any hope whatever of prospering if they do not see their first duty as educational and related to that the maintenance of the highest of academic standards <e> <s> i should like to hear a government response that recognises that <e>", "<cs> i should like to respond to that rising to the bait so to speak <e> <s> i did not say that there should be no business representation <e> <s> i have had experience of this and i speak as a former academic at least <e> <s> business people appear to suffer from three delusions first they think that teaching is easy but it is incredibly hard secondly they think that if academics are not confronting students they are doing nothing and are idle and thirdly they have not the faintest idea what academic research and scholarship are about <e> <s> that is the nature of the problem <e> <s> they are often very well meaning and can be helpful in a minority of cases <e> <s> i believe their role in this is excessive and i would rather see less of them than more <e>", "<cs> i am less than happy about this matter <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord said i believed that this was a matter of public versus private <e> <s> that makes a difficulty for me because i believe that such things should generally happen in public <e> <s> let us assume that instead of providing <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her one question <e> <s> i should simply like to put it as a question and perhaps the noble lord the lord privy seal will answer it in due course <e> <s> but it is germane to this amendment <e>", "<cs> in saying a few words on this amendment in a sense i shall be giving part of the speech i did not give in the previous debate <e> <s> i found the previous debate very unsatisfactory because we were skating round the issues <e> <s> in fact one or two members on the government benches more or less said that and i was somewhat sympathetic with them <e> <s> we must get into the substance of the abolition of the ilea on the one hand and inquire about the positive case for the devolution of education to the boroughs on the other <e>", "<cs> as we discuss the amendment it seems that we are illustrating precisely what i had in mind in my earlier intervention <e> <s> here we have a service fulfilling a need meeting a demand and internationally recognised for its quality and we place it at risk <e> <s> i repeat that i can see no rationale for placing a service like this at risk <e> <s> i think that it is foolhardy and wanton <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will bear with me because i have one or two other questions to which it will be of interest to know the answers <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that there is no actual obligation to provide adult education <e> <s> i understand that the government and the noble baronesss right honourable friend the secretary of state have been in touch with at least one or two of the conservative boroughs <e> <s> without any secrets being revealed it will be interesting to know whether adult education was discussed when they talked about their anxieties in regard to how to deal with this subject <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness can tell us something about that <e>", "<cs> i was genuinely seeking enlightenment so as to save myself having to look it all up <e> <s> am i not right that it is not obligatory to provide adult education in other words there is no statutory responsibility <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> she will not be surprised to hear that i am not happy with the answer although i am not too unhappy <e> <s> i should have liked her to have gone further on the openness point because i believe that it is a good thing <e> <s> i do not believe that most of the matters i have in mind could be described as commercial incompetence <e> <s> i am concerned with the disposal of valuable community assets <e> <s> i should have thought a degree of openness in justifying that would be a good thing <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not yet heard what it is and he may even enjoy it this time <e> <s> it is the point about real resources <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear has raised the point and i reiterate it <e> <s> we still await a modicum of an answer <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness lady young that we think that the government are wrong <e> <s> let there be no doubt about that <e> <s> however given that the die is cast the next stage is to make the best of what is happening <e> <s> the amendment is intended to be constructive and to help the new local education authorities in their task <e>", "<cs> with the committees leave i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i speak slightly reluctantly because with respect i disagree somewhat with the noble and learned lord as i shall outline <e> <s> i fully accept his <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that as the paradigm case <e> <s> the notion of pressure on staff which is often again slightly indefinable is a difficult matter to isolate within a grievance procedure but it certainly is easy to isolate in terms of the atmosphere of the university <e>", "<cs> these are substantive and serious amendments although they are also probing amendments <e> <s> the response of my noble friend lord annan shows that that probing was worthwhile <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> d the clause as it is written refers to efficiently and economically <e> <s> those are words from my own subject <e> <s> they do not imply anything about standards <e> <s> put crudely what we are discussing is the relationship between inputs and outputs <e> <s> a process of a very low standard can be efficient and economic so long as the inputs are disproportionately lower still <e> <s> reading it that way as i did i was unhappy <e> <s> as my noble friend lord annan has said we are very much concerned in universities with absolute standards <e> <s> in our previous discussions on academic freedom i did not put forward the very important idea that in the case of many young people almost the only acquaintance they will have in their lives with the highest standards is in universities <e>", "<cs> yes i beg your pardon i was referring to paragraphs c and d of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find the reply of the noble and learned lord somewhat reassuring <e> <s> we all agree that we must treat academics and indeed everybody else in this context correctly <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fear that i shall offend the noble earl lord halsbury because i too take the question of tenure fundamentally seriously and this seems to be the clause under which i can debate it <e> <s> in order to say that i do not want tenure abolished my best method is to say that i do not want the commissioners brought in to abolish it <e> <s> thus with due apology i am afraid that i too am about to make a long speech but it is my only opportunity <e> <s> i promise not to make another when i have finished it but tenure is as important to me as perhaps some other aspects of the bill are to members of the government <e> <s> i hope the committee will bear with me but i wish to say this once and it is important <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not realise that the committee allowed any other noble lord to answer questions <e> <s> my concept of tenure is not being able to be fired for redundancy <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to the noble and learned lord that i find his answer extremely unsatisfactory <e> <s> he does not seem to grasp what we are talking about <e> <s> we are discussing the recruitment of academic staff <e> <s> to a large extent we have accepted the governments view that the means of recruitment have been excessively rigid <e> <s> we are suggesting that there be a range of contracts from short-term contracts for short-term purposes longer term contracts and the tenured contract <e> <s> that is a range of possibilities i should have thought we could trust the academic institutions to decide upon in order to recruit staff in the appropriate way <e> <s> that is what we are arguing <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong this discussion <e> <s> i am deeply disappointed with the answer of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i believe that this is a matter worthy of more serious discussion <e> <s> we shall return to it on report <e> <s> however at the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as a non-expert in the matter i too have been very puzzled as to why considerations of this kind are not dated from the day that the bill will become an act <e> <s> it has puzzled many people in the academic world as the noble earl said <e> <s> without wishing to delay the committee excessively one would like an explanation of why the day of the introduction becomes the effective date which to use one of our favourite words in these debates is a little unjust in some cases <e> <s> one is looking for an explanation <e>", "<cs> the distinction is that of movement within a scale and movement of the scale itself <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord will be able to clarify that point for us in due course <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the committee but i want to return to my previous point which was that introduced by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may use this peg on which to hang one thought which has concerned me for some time during todays debate <e> <s> when we were discussing academic freedom we discussed it with respect to the universities <e> <s> those of us who believe in such freedom i assume all of us do would assume that it would apply to the polytechnics as well <e> <s> i do not know how in due course the government will react to the amendment which was passed this afternoon but whatever its practical consequences are i hope they will extend to the polytechnics because academic freedom is as important there as here <e> <s> i do not think that they should feel neglected <e> <s> i take this opportunity to make that point <e>", "<cs> we welcome this amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask two questions simply to see how the governments mind is working <e> <s> it is the converse of an earlier amendment <e> <s> why is the ufc not included under this heading <e> <s> why should it not be able to call on the audit commission since on both sides of the house we strongly approve of the audit commission and its work <e> <s> similarly while i notice that grant-maintained schools come under this heading why have ctcs been left out <e> <s> i do not want to detract from the amendment of which we strongly approve but i am interested to know the reason for those two limitations <e>", "<cs> am i right in understanding that this is a technical amendment because if it is not i do not understand it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one point <e> <s> i think there is a difference between whether there is a covert agenda here and the technical point raised by my noble friend lord irvine the other night and by the noble baroness lady seear now <e> <s> it is a point which is worthy of reasoned argument <e> <s> we shall not go into it now because i think we are all very tired but i must reiterate the point raised by my noble friend lady david <e> <s> we shall discuss the whole of that clause in some detail on report but we shall not pursue it now <e> <s> i think the noble lord should not be under any illusion we think there are serious technical sides to this as well as other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords energy debates in your lordships house are always interesting and enjoyable and this is certainly no exception <e> <s> apart from the main principle i think that there has been a certain amount of meeting of minds <e> <s> the difficulty in winding up at this stage is exactly the one mentioned by my noble friend lord stoddart namely that all the good points that one has prepared have already been made <e> <s> he said that he would nevertheless try to say something original <e> <s> i am afraid that there is no possibility that i can say anything new <e> <s> the best i can do is to undermine underline some of the points that have already been made <e>", "<cs> my lords freudian indeed <e> <s> i have a couple of questions for the noble viscount <e> <s> are we to understand that legislation will be introduced in the next session <e> <s> is that a definite government commitment <e> <s> do we have any idea when it will be introduced <e> <s> i do not ask that just for ourselves because a number of his noble friends or their friends can see the new honeypot and are very keen to get their paws into it <e> <s> from their point of view the sooner it happens the better although that may be to the detriment of the rest of us <e>", "<cs> exactly <e> <s> following the point of the noble lord lord reay if the industry is sold the proceeds of these assets will accrue to the treasury and then to the taxpayer if they were then used for tax cuts <e> <s> but the tax cuts are not pro rata according to electricity consumption <e> <s> indeed with the tax cuts that this government have in mind which are tax cuts for the very well off and benefit reductions for the very poor they will be genuinely stealing from a <e>", "<cs> my lords the words of the prime minister quoted in the question refer to the des which it says <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also intervene at this stage <e> <s> i was puzzled by the ministers reply <e> <s> the problem of women in refuges is a very small one in national terms but it is a major problem for the women concerned <e> <s> the ministers solution seems to be extremely bureaucratic and i cannot imagine why he would want to approach the problem in that way <e>", "<cs> the minister referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for asking a supplementary question but can he explain to the house how raising a price namely the rate of interest lowers the rate of inflation <e> <s> surely raising a price is inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords in putting forward this rather absurd proposition the noble lord said several times that the government believed that the business would do better in the private sector <e> <s> i am bound to say to him that he is standing both logic and history on their heads <e> <s> the girobank came into existence precisely because its business was not being undertaken properly in the private sector <e> <s> the commercial banks have always been in a position to offer money transmission services of that kind and they failed to do so <e> <s> that is precisely the point at issue <e> <s> as i understand it the statement referred to the particular strength of the girobank in money transmission but that is a euphemism the girobank is superb in effecting money transmission <e> <s> it is the commercial banks that have failed in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i must say that he cannot give us a guarantee of that <e> <s> i cannot see in terms of the normal criteria that any of them would have a dominant market position <e> <s> it would simply be a stronger market position and that would be a source of concern <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the ministers answer to the supplementary question can he enlighten the house as to her majestys governments view of why the trade deficit and the current account deficit are as large as they are <e> <s> in particular does he believe that it has any connection with the exchange rate <e>", "<cs> my lords the document itself refers to the licensed teacher undertaking such training as the employer deems appropriate but my noble friend asked how we shall know that each employer deems the same kind of qualities appropriate as each other employer <e> <s> perhaps i may also ask whether a teacher who achieves this status in one lea will be eligible for employment with any other lea <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord make some comment on the speed of the matter <e> <s> speaking for myself i am appalled by the slowness of the affair <e> <s> i understand that in october despite expressions of dissatisfaction and so on investors nonetheless went on investing <e> <s> i am certain that the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister comment upon one aspect of a report in todays issue of the <e>", "<cs> my lords as a non-member of your lordships select committee i wish to join with other noble lords in welcoming this excellent report <e> <s> the noble lord lord swami referred to it as a classic of its kind and i am sure that he is right <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations to the committee on the evidence which is a gold mine for those who are interested in the subject <e> <s> we shall go over it on many more occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether she intends to respond to the intervention of her noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who said that social and environmental studies which include economics and economic awareness could be taught in our schools in such a way as would amount to labour party indoctrination <e> <s> is that now the view of the des on the social sciences <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to intervene and to ask a question assuming that the noble earl is referring to subsection a or perhaps a and b <e> <s> can the noble earl give a further explanation because from my reading of it the subsection is completely impossible to interpret in the way that he says <e> <s> does the noble earl not agree that it simply does not cover the points made by my noble friend and by the noble baroness <e> <s> i am perfectly willing to be persuaded by the noble earl about the all-embracing nature of the subsection but from my limited knowledge of english it simply is not as he says it is <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl can give an explanation that we can all understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her answer and i am glad that she has placed it on the record <e> <s> i believe that all of us not least the teachers would be more reassured if it were in the bill <e> <s> however i do not wish to delay your lordships at this time so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before this subject comes to an end let me say that i am becoming more puzzled <e> <s> with leave i am asking a question <e> <s> is it correct that the noble baroness will return to us with a definition of modern foreign languages <e> <s> is that what we are asked to wait for <e> <s> in particular will she be telling us what the word modern means <e> <s> many of the problems raised could be dealt with if we knew what we were talking about <e> <s> does modern simply mean any language which is currently being spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if it is felt that the minister is unable to comment on this amendment <e> <s> i am somewhat surprised because the minister has usually coped extremely well on this and all other matters <e> <s> i certainly wish to comment on the amendment because everything that the noble lord lord young of dartington does is extremely interesting <e> <s> it would be a pity to let it go without responding <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a few points on the first half of the amendment to indicate some worries <e> <s> one accepts that assessment is different from examination <e> <s> i do not think that we need argue about that <e> <s> if i was a parent with children at school i should be worried at the enormous burden that seems to be building up for young people with assessments of various kinds and gcse <e> <s> in due course i shall comment about a-level also <e> <s> perhaps the minister will go to some trouble to reassure us and those outside who are parents that they can be confident that the different arrangements which are being introduced will not interact in a detrimental way and that the concentration on assessment and preparation for gcse and other matters cannot do any harm <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> it is a trifle controversial but i can save my response for a later occasion when we have finished with the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few brief words in support of this amendment <e> <s> i assume that in a well-run school material for a profile would be there anyway <e> <s> the idea of a profile seems to be intrinsic to education and to helping the pupil <e> <s> there are two questions which arise <e> <s> the first is whether it requires formalising in other words that there should not just be a few pieces of paper stuck together but there should be a proper profile worked out <e> <s> the second is whether it should be universal and if universal whether this is the time to introduce it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> she will appreciate that i cannot get her to answer a question unless i put down an amendment however defective it may be <e> <s> i think i found her answer reassuring i shall look at it carefully in tomorrows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously not happy with that <e> <s> i have also refrained from commenting on the shadow bodies that have been set up <e> <s> i think it would be most inappropriate at this stage for us to comment on the particular individuals who have been appointed <e> <s> that does not mean that i am incapable of making comments on what the secretary of state has been up to but i do not think it would be a gentlemanly thing to do at this stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not regard any of the noble baronesss remarks as a reassurance <e> <s> speaking for the first and second amendments i must say that i am profoundly disappointed at the governments response <e> <s> if i may refer to what the noble lord lord hastings said these are matters which are not in the remotest sense political <e> <s> they are matters of judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords they are certainly not <e> <s> it is mistaken to argue that these bodies should be interpreted in precisely the way in which the noble lord has done <e> <s> it seems that he has not remotely endeavoured to deal with the point i made and about which i asked him namely how can these bodies keep all aspects of the curriculum under review if they are not in a position to carry out research <e> <s> that is what is meant by keeping all aspects of the curriculum under review <e> <s> i shall not dignify the reply of the noble lord as an argument <e> <s> i am very unimpressed with the reply and i certainly wish to divide the house on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour it is the nearest i shall get to reassurance <e> <s> i should have preferred a more positive statement but i certainly do not intend to wax heavily on that now <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> that certainly is nearer to a reassurance than anything i have heard since or so this afternoon <e> <s> we are <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with slight trepidation because i wish to say a few words in support of the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> my fear is that in doing so i may ruin it for her rather than the reverse <e> <s> nonetheless it seems that her argument is cogent and compelling <e> <s> one is rather puzzled because the head teachers are the people with the most knowledge and experience in this area <e> <s> in the new regime that we are moving into we shall have governing bodies which are inexperienced <e> <s> i am not against them being consulted but it does not seem that the bill addresses itself to the people who can be of the most help who are the head teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it may be agreeable that i speak on this amendment because my own amendment will fall since i assume that a government amendment moved at this time of night is likely to be accepted <e> <s> i am glad to see the move that the government are making to deal with complaints <e> <s> the noble baroness lady hooper made a promise to go in that direction and we believe it to be a step in the right direction <e> <s> in saying that i prefer amendment no <e> <s> essentially what i am arguing is that one could go quite a little further <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords for joining me in the discussion and also the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i found her response rather more reassuring than last time <e> <s> as with so many aspects of the bill i agree that it is a matter of waiting to see whether the developments to which the noble baroness lady young referred take place <e> <s> no one need be in any doubt about our scrutinising this to see how the situation develops <e> <s> it is to be hoped that we can be optimistic about the development of nursery education <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were to be a diagnostic test of whether or not i understood that answer i think i would fail it <e> <s> i have to assure the minister and i am sure that it is my fault rather than hers that i do not understand now any more than i did <e> <s> perhaps she can find time to write to me and explain further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments demonstrate very clearly where i and my noble friends are in some disagreement with the government and with the whole nature of this bill <e> <s> in particular i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> in this group because i think it is the most important of the amendments in this list <e> <s> it relates to the whole question of the consequences of allowing grant-maintained status and its relationship to the ability or what we believe will become the inability of local education authorities to act as local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment was meant to be helpful <e> <s> those who know anything about educational psychology are aware that if one constantly tries to be helpful and those efforts are rebuffed one ceases trying to be helpful <e> <s> i believe that the noble earl has not answered the case <e> <s> he said that the government are determined on an all or nothing course and are simply unable to open their mind to the possibility that within that some modification may be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most reassured by the statement of the noble baroness <e> <s> however i am a trifle puzzled by her logic because i think that she made the case for this amendment infinitely better than i did <e> <s> it follows therefore that she should have accepted it <e> <s> but i shall not press that point <e> <s> i am reassured and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for the second time during the course of the report stage of this bill the noble earl has gone over my head <e> <s> i do not follow him <e> <s> he used the expressions will be expected will ensure and should be <e> <s> so far as i am concerned all of those words are as good as shall <e> <s> i therefore cannot see where the words occur <e> <s> if they do not occur in the bill how do we know that such matters will be ensured how do we know that they should be and how do we know that they are expected <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i am fully prepared to take the noble earls view on this matter since he has placed it on record <e> <s> it is with pleasure that i do not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with regret i am not convinced <e> <s> we disagree fundamentally on this <e> <s> i feel that we could do with a walk through the division lobbies <e> <s> therefore i wish to press my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting my noble friend lady serota on this amendment i do not have to remind your lordships of her great knowledge and wide experience of the subject <e> <s> it seems to me that your lordships would be wise to heed her advice and accept the first two amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice to that opinion <e> <s> i too was taken aback by the introduction of politicisation on this issue <e> <s> i am not saying that people cannot bring politics into almost anything that one can think of but my understanding of the grant-maintained proposals is that they were put forward on educational grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords while i think that this is a slightly trivial matter in my experience as a parent i must say that the noble lord lord beloff is entirely right parents do disagree <e> <s> however the whole point of family life is for them to come to an agreement on the matter <e> <s> we certainly did not run our family on the assumption that we could not come to an agreement about how to bring up our children <e> <s> in the case of the exercise of this vote it seems that the noble baroness <e> <s> lady seear is entirely right <e> <s> it takes the most pessimistic view of the nature of the family in this part of our century to argue that parents even though they disagree could not come to a conclusion <e> <s> i hope that we do not base our deliberations on that hypothesis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> as i understand it she distinguishes between what she calls campaigning and some other form of information provision <e> <s> as i now understand it that distinction will apply to the governing body as well as to everybody else in the instance we are discussing they will simply provide information <e> <s> campaigning can be separate <e> <s> the noble baroness says that subject to remaining within the law and remaining within the proprieties there will be no restraint upon that <e> <s> i will accept that as a reasoned response to my remarks <e> <s> the prodecure appears to be less biased than that currently in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i assumed that in this case within the law meant within the law as defined by this bill and more generally within the law in the sense of not containing defamatory material and matters of that kind <e> <s> in particular i assumed that where something called campaigning was involved the governing body would be as restrained in its ability to campaign within the provisions of this documentation as for example a local education authority <e> <s> i have assumed that that is what the noble baroness was saying <e> <s> it is up to her to say whether she is saying that if she wants to <e> <s> if she is saying that i find it moderately reassuring and therefore i propose not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i have no intention of pressing the amendment but i should like to go on record as saying that i am quite unconvinced <e> <s> the school as it exists is a real asset which belongs to local taxpayers <e> <s> there can be no doubt about that <e> <s> it is being taken away from them <e> <s> if the secretary of state were that keen he could buy it at its market value but he is not proposing to buy it from the local taxpayers <e> <s> he is proposing to take it away from them and leave them with the financing of the interest on the capital involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that answer which i shall read with great care <e> <s> the main point that i was trying to make was that this is a difficult and highly technical matter <e> <s> the minister might like to ask her right honourable friend the secretary of state whether in due course he might consider publishing a long but clear document about the financing of this sector <e> <s> assuming that it comes into existence i believe that this sector would benefit from such a document <e> <s> i shall read what the minister has just said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her intervention <e> <s> i also thank the minister for her answer which i found to be genuinely helpful <e> <s> however it brings out my main point with which she agrees of how difficult is all this <e> <s> it would be as well at some point if we could discover what it all amounts to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> it might help me to clarify my mind <e> <s> is she saying that if a grant-maintained school which was comprehensive wished to become selective it would be subject to the precise procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to respond rise to the fly of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and get us started on a comprehensives debate <e> <s> suffice it to say that i do not remotely accept that selective education is other than damaging both for the pupils in the school and for all other pupils in the area in which the selection takes place <e> <s> i do not regard entrance to oxbridge as my criterion for educational success <e> <s> it is not one that i hope increases in currency as a result of this legislation <e> <s> if one does regard it as such i point out that many of us have children who went to oxbridge and also to comprehensive schools <e> <s> it is worth bearing that in mind <e> <s> as i say i must stick to my rules <e> <s> i am not going to have a debate on comprehensives <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question <e> <s> first i thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his reassurance <e> <s> i find these two clauses completely incomprehensible <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord admits that they are at least difficult to understand <e> <s> is he saying that the effect of the clauses if a grant-maintained school were to go out of existence is to restore as far as possible the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to prolong the debate but it is an important matter <e> <s> will the minister confirm in her reply that it is the case and will be the case after the bill becomes law that schooling between the ages of five and is compulsory <e> <s> if that is the case will she explain the departments response to the noble baroness lady faithfull that an amendment of this kind would place too great a burden on teachers <e> <s> i think that is what the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that very puzzling <e> <s> if schooling is compulsory i should have thought that the first charge on the available time and ability of teachers would be the keeping of the appropriate records of attendance <e> <s> i should have thought that everything else would come after that <e> <s> will the minister say something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords in vigorously opposing the amendment i find myself in agreement with an occasional opponent and in disagreement with noble lords with whom i should prefer to be in agreement <e> <s> vigorous opposition to it may be the greatest service i can give to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i said that i strongly believed that public money should be used for that purpose <e> <s> however i must remind the noble lord that in this country we have a large system of maintained schools in which such money is used for those purposes <e> <s> if more money is available that is where i should like to see it spent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord st john of fawsley was right <e> <s> i was finding the report stage of the bill a chore but the subject of city technology colleges has brought me fully awake again <e> <s> i shall start by saying a word on public expenditure in response to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> when i was a junior economist in the treasury when he was chief secretary this type of nonsense would never have got off the ground <e> <s> i was amazed to hear what he just said <e> <s> this proposal would have been regarded as a demonstrable waste of public money <e> <s> it would not have got above the level of an under-secretary let alone seen the light of day <e> <s> it involves expenditure where it is unnecessary it involves capital expenditure as my noble friend lady blackstone has said where it is unnecessary and it involves raising costs per pupil where it is unnecessary for no ends that anyone can see except for the governments rather minor doctrinaire ends <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble baroness to answer the second part of the question <e> <s> that seems to me to get to the heart of the matter <e> <s> in an industry as fragmented but as important as agriculture it is a proper function of government both to see that the research takes place and largely to finance it

interventions were critical of the details of it on reflection those critics would probably also favour the spirit that is that one would like the governing body to represent in some broad sense the community which the school is serving <e> <s> it may be that the precise wording of this amendment does not achieve that <e> <s> i know nothing of the case of the london borough of barnet but i find what it is doing most unattractive <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene briefly on the subject <e> <s> i was concerned by the intervention of the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> i should normally have expected her to be enthusiastically in favour of the proposal <e> <s> i was somewhat taken aback by her negativism <e> <s> in particular i hope that i do not have to remind her or other noble lords of the distinction between further education and adult education <e> <s> the two are not the same and have never been recognised as the same within statute or the education service <e>",

lord <e> <s> i accept with alacrity <e> <s> i think it is the first amendment i have ever had accepted in any form at all and i sit down hurriedly <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who of course understands such matters better than i has said that in his view an lea is included <e> <s> i accept that view <e> <s> however it does not explain why an lea should not have first claim since the assets belonged to it in the first place <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord will answer that question before i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that answer <e> <s> i believe that that takes us along some of the lines that we wish to see followed <e>

political matter although we support the amendment <e> <s> in echoing what the noble lord lord beloff has said i believe that quite independent of party there is a kind of bureaucratic mind on the left or the right which cannot wait to carry out such contract funding and interference and which does not have the faintest appreciation of the issues that we have been talking about <e> <s> i regard the matter as essentially non-political <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking briefly in support of this amendment i am bound to say that i wish there was no need to have such an amendment <e> <s> i find it almost inconceivable that this body would not produce an annual report on its activities <e> <s> i should have thought any sensible body would do precisely what the noble earl lord russell has said <e> <s> indeed as i go into the printed paper office every day and see with despair the vast number of glossy annual reports from all sorts of bodies i feel most of them are a complete waste of money and frequently public money <e> <s> i am certainly not someone who thinks that the more reports there are the better but in this case i feel that everything the noble earl has to say is eminently sensible <e> <s> i remain quite mystified as to why the government cannot say you do not need an amendment like this it is perfectly obvious that this is what will happen <e> <s> it is perfectly obvious that parliament will wish to have such material in order from time to time to debate university developments <e> <s> i dearly wish that we did not need even to consider such an amendment as this however i strongly support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> on the elucidation point i should be obliged if he would pursue the matter because i cannot believe that for example a retired person with experience under paragraph a would be disqualified under b so i really believe that the word or is what the government have in mind <e>

the governments position even though it clashes with the logic of my position <e> <s> i believe that it is a serious error not to take the point that when we are coming to the governance of an institution of this kind there is a special role for the employees <e> <s> however i have made my point and the noble and learned lord has made his <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in on this matter <e> <s> i have not spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down it would reassure noble lords if she would give an absolute guarantee

this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has indeed reassured me to a considerable degree and thank her for that <e> <s> i am concerned that the governments interest in profligacy does not extend to dealing with the london borough of kensington and chelsea but depite saying that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that here we have another example of the secretary of state creating the uncertainty and chaos that he claimed would exist if he did not abolish ilea <e> <s> the government have made their position clear and there is no need for me to underline what they said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little puzzled and i may have been asleep but has amendment no <e> <s> a been spoken to at any point

are grouped together <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by saying how bitterly i resent the fact that we are debating what i regard as a matter of absolutely fundamental importance to the future of academic life in this country at this hour after such a long period of time <e> <s> i wish to place on record that i do not believe your lordships have served the country or within it more narrowly the academic community in allowing this debate to proceed in this way forcing those of us who take this matter extremely seriously into this position <e> <s> i may say that i personally am extremely exhausted <e> <s> i want to place that on record because our <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness explain to those of us who have difficulty in following the matter why we are subsidising farmers to produce more crops while at the same time we are subsidising them to produce fewer crops <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for what i take to be a sympathetic answer would the government if one of the great foundations were to finance a pilot study into a general teaching council give a fair wind to such a study or at least support it without necessarily imposing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his explanation of the technical side of the amendments and the regulations <e> <s> as he has himself taken the opportunity to say a few words about the assisted places scheme generally i shall also take the opportunity to say a few words although they will be of a different kind to remind the noble lord that those of us on this side of the house do not approve of the scheme <e> <s> we regard it as divisive and damaging to the maintained sector <e> <s> since we see no public good resulting from the scheme we also regard it as a misuse of public money <e> <s> we would certainly feel able to outline higher priorities for the use of such public money if it were available for education more generally <e> <s> as i believe the noble earl is well aware we would ease out the scheme if we were in a position to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i particularly liked the thought that one mans outline is another mans guideline <e> <s> if you added discuss it would make an admirable examination question but since we are anxious to proceed i shall not work on it tonight <e> <s> i am disappointed <e> <s> i believe that there will come a day not long hence when the department and whoever is the secretary of state will wish that they had written these precise amendments into the bill but that is by the way <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> there is a slight difference of view as to what the teachers believe in this matter but i shall not pursue that <e> <s> my point was not that teachers would willy-nilly create problems or be the source of difficulty <e> <s> i say that outside pressures will be the cause of problems and difficulties and that teachers will feel obliged to respond to them particularly along the lines suggested by the noble lord lord ritchie <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly from these benches i entirely agree with the views expressed by noble lords and i am very sorry that the earlier amendment was not accepted <e> <s> i should find it astonishing if the government do not accept this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the least a head teacher could do would be to inform the parents in writing both of the decision and of parental rights <e> <s> one would hope that the head teacher would go further and see parents in all such cases <e> <s> i hope strongly that this is an amendment that the government will be able to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord now tell us what guidelines he is talking about <e> <s> we are taiking about guidelines to do with this particular matter on balloting <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again but we might as well know what we are talking about <e> <s> there is a document of guidelines on grant-maintained status but my reading of it is that it is not a set of guidelines to do with what i understood the noble lord was talking about which were the guidelines on balloting and in particular the specific points of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the government and congratulate the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> from her i learn the lesson <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall comment briefly on two or three aspects of these amendments <e> <s> i start with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> noble lords will recall that when we were concerned about the abolition of the ilea and the taking over of those educational functions by the individual boroughs as local education authorities many of us on this side were worried about the ability of the local education authorities thus created to do the job <e> <s> that was one of our arguments against the abolition of the ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether those of us who are doing the work are allowed to speak on this matter <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord the government chief whip will bear in mind that some of us are finding this extremely hard work and are anxious to do it properly <e> <s> i for one should find it easier to do it properly at am tomorrow rather than being hurried tonight and being under undue pressure <e> <s> i know that the noble lord the chief whip has to take all matters into account <e> <s> i am not pressing him for an answer now <e> <s> the point made by my noble friend lord taylor is one that must be taken seriously <e> <s> we have worked hard on the bill from the very first day and it would be a pity to ruin it at this late stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may ask her since we are discussing the arts whether she is of the opinion that amendment no <e> <s> is written in the english language as we know it <e> <s> i have been puzzling over the matter for some time and i cannot make any sense of the syntax <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting this amendment i would particularly emphasise the point on clarification <e> <s> i was intrigued by the point made earlier that further education included adult education in the sense in which we understood it <e> <s> nothing would please all of us more than to be told that further education includes adult education because that would then cover everything that we have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps a non-scot may intervene briefly in this matter <e> <s> we support the amendment very strongly <e> <s> i was one of those who felt that the earlier amendment was doubtful <e> <s> i believe strongly in a single funding council for universities <e> <s> i felt that the scots were probably slightly mistaken in wanting their own funding council <e> <s> however this amendment is another matter and it is one that is entirely correct <e> <s> scottish universities come within the ambit of the bill and the croham committee recommended that there should be a scottish subcommittee <e> <s> that committee should be taken as the definitive body when it comes to a subject of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for the amendment and perhaps i may ask just one question of her <e> <s> it may be a subtle point on right of access but as regards one or two of the institutions to which the amendment is relevant and which receive public money will some appropriate body still be able to discover that the public money is being used correctly validly or whatever may be the word <e> <s> in other words as regards the oxford colleges i believe that it is still the case that even though they are not directly funded they are in receipt of public money <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness can tell me anything about that or in due course write to me about it <e>", "<cs> my lords before commenting on the amendment i should tell the noble viscount lord eccles that i was very taken aback by what he said <e> <s> i respect his view but as i know one or two of the education officers he had in mind i find it astonishing to believe that they were members of the labour party <e> <s> i find it rather hard to believe that they were even supporters of the labour party but the noble viscount may know more about them than i know <e> <s> however i was taken aback by what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble earl <e> <s> i go further than him because i am strongly in favour of restructuring and i always have been <e> <s> i believe that the higher education system is greatly in need of rationalisation which would raise its efficiency <e> <s> it would be a great pity if other aspects of the bill which will pass into law were to act as a disincentive to restructuring <e> <s> the staff concerned must be persuaded as to restructuring and that it would be advantageous <e> <s> however it would be a pity if questions of tenure got in the way <e> <s> i believe that the government might have thought of the amendment tabled by the noble earl and myself because it would ease the way towards the ends that they have in mind <e> <s> i am pleased to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak briefly to this amendment since the subject of bogus <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> obviously i am not happy with it <e> <s> i am surprised that the government seem to have a rather <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hope that would not happen <e> <s> on the whole the incoming authority from my knowledge of local government would rarely have a majority of all the votes cast let alone per cent <e> <s> and feel obliged to reflect the political complex of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just intervene for a moment <e> <s> as a relatively new member of this place i am learning about the procedures of the house and i am certainly aware of the point that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has made <e> <s> however i have noticed that your lordships are also capable on matters of importance of showing a modicum of tolerance <e> <s> i have also noticed that occasionally the noble lord the leader of the house has intervened to deal with matters in that way <e> <s> i should have thought that this was one of those occasions especially in view of the point made about our inability sometimes to discuss things when we are fresh when we could at least show a degree of tolerance to colleagues who feel that this is an important matter <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord belstead will say a word in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask some questions <e> <s> am i right in understanding that this kind of amendment is not unusual and has been introduced before and that its significance ignoring the ilea point for the moment is to work out the logical consequences of what has already been agreed within the bill as we are currently considering it <e> <s> in other words the amendment does not give the secretary of state power to amend the bill or other legislation in substance other than as has been discussed here <e> <s> that is my interpretation of what the minister said <e> <s> i should like her to reassure me on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view one advantage of speaking more or less at the end of a debate is that all the good arguments have already been put <e> <s> i assure noble lords that i do not intend to chew over this meal yet gain <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from rejecting that key aspect of the higginson report do the government intend to make a reasoned statement explaining why as-levels do the job whereas almost everyone in education concerned with broadening the curriculum for young adults believes that the higginson proposals arc the correct way to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords following the noble lords question and bearing in mind how flat the profile of exports has been over the past year or two perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> is there not a very strong case for intensifying the efforts of the ecgd and indeed other efforts that the government might undertake to encourage exports <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the secretary of state see a contradiction between his statements that government must govern and that government must refer to the wishes of the commission <e> <s> as someone who strongly supports our membership of the community i still prefer government to govern <e> <s> is it too late for the government to draw back from this foolhardy and over-anxious sale of a public sector asset at a price that is not helpful to the taxpayer and in the longer run is not helpful to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is interested i mention british rover <e>", "<cs> my lords having mentioned the rise in investment would the minister care to comment about the danger of that increased investment which is sorely needed being brought to a premature halt if interest rates are raised further <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clarify the governments position on this once and for all <e> <s> is he saying what he appeared to he saying yesterday and to some extent today that the only criterion the government thought relevant to this matter was one of commercial profitability and that there was no public interest whatsoever in a continuation of a film production industry in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the pick-up in investment this year but may i ask the minister whether he intended to place his answer in the context that the ratio of investment to gross domestic product both as a ratio and relative to that of our own competitors has been lower during the lifetime of this government than it was during the previous labour government and also lower than it was during the conservative government of the early s <e>", "<cs> my lords now that profits have risen so drastically can the consumer expect a fall in prices in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister to bear in mind that the issue is not benzodiazepines themselves but repeat prescribing which seems to be growing at a very rapid pace <e> <s> if this is happening can the minister either use his good offices to emphasise the seriousness of the matter to the medical profession or alternatively do something about giving medical training to doctors receptionists who seem to be the principal persons whom patients see for these drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords following the earlier question can we be assured that the working party will take cognisance of the views of those of us who actually go to football matches stand on the terraces and travel by public transport <e> <s> therefore we are aware of the facts of the matter which are that there is not a great deal of football hooliganism except in one or two isolated spots <e> <s> a scheme of this sort seems to me to be quite excessive <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government know whether those who own and operate these oil rigs have themselves engaged in a series of safety checks in the past few weeks to make doubly sure at least for the moment that everything is as well as it can be <e>", "<cs> my lords it is nearly enough <e> <s> however one is rather intrigued by amendment no <e> <s> in which the words <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be dishonest of me if i did not say that i believe that the original amendment put forward by the noble lord lord swann and others and carried by your lordships was better than this <e> <s> i believe it to have been better than this <e> <s> i am happy that mine is not the first discordant remark made <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead made a remark earlier with which i entirely agree that at best the parts of the bill dealing with universities do less damage than they earlier did <e> <s> however that is about the best that we can say <e> <s> that is why i felt i must start by speaking as i have <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord can clarify one aspect of his answer which i may have missed <e> <s> will the new research unit which will be working in this field be located at the institute of psychiatry or do we not yet know where it will be located <e>", "<cs> my lords i am under the impression i hope that it is correct that we are discussing amendment numbered a <e> <s> amendment numbered a deals with the tax treatment of student nurses <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment meets the rules of order of your lordships house and it is an amendment of the kind which your lordships have debated carried and put to the other place <e> <s> i find it an extraordinary state of affairs and i certainly think that those in the nursing profession will find it even more extraordinary that we have had two speeches on the subject of the amendment from the noble baroness and the noble lord lord trafford <e>", "<cs> my lords and from the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> we have also had a long series of lectures on the british constitution which interesting though they are and i found them immensely interesting speaking as an academic seem to me to have no bearing on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords normally when one speaks at the end of a debate one feels rather fed up because all the good points have already been made <e> <s> certainly they have all been made from this side of your lordships house so far as i am concerned <e> <s> i am slightly surprised at the lack of participation of noble lords from the other side of the house <e> <s> i should have thought that noble lords opposite would have been queueing up to say how marvellous was this brilliant budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i have of course been sitting waiting for that precise statement <e> <s> i am glad to hear it <e> <s> when the minister or one of his noble friends is going to make a different statement on the ems will he write to some of us ahead of time so that we do not suffer an excessive degree of shock <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness in a position to comment on some evidence given by the council for the protection of rural england to the energy committee in another place on this very subject <e> <s> the council said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with his right honourable friend mr biffen who yesterday advised the chancellor of the exchequer that he must limit the present relief on mortgage interest because one of the most powerful inflationary factors must be the rise in house prices <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the independent schools teachers pay is rising at approximately twice the rate that it is in maintained schools <e> <s> would it not be a good idea if in this case the government followed the lead of the private sector and paid a proper rate of pay which would both raise the morale of teachers and help to keep them in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords did i miss the ministers answer to the second part of the question of my noble friend lord molloy namely whether he can indicate when a reduction will take place <e> <s> in particular can the noble lord reassure his own noble friends that the reduction will occur before the next general election <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a few remarks about paragraphs f g and h <e> <s> i am rather surprised to discover that the secretary of state does not have any powers corresponding to what is said under paragraph f <e> <s> be that as it may it seems to me that the minimal change required in paragraph f is that the secretary of state should be restricted to exploiting intellectual property that belongs to him <e> <s> the paragraph presently reads as though he can exploit all of our intellectual property <e> <s> that seems to me to be quite out of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer briefly to the question of publication <e> <s> what the noble lord lord skelmersdale said was encouraging <e> <s> it is my view that in an area of this kind there should be no party political differences between us <e> <s> essentially this is a matter of fundamental principle <e>", "<cs> my lords apropos the question on the order paper can the minister clarify the problem <e> <s> if nuclear power is economic why must it be protected by statute <e> <s> if it is not economic why are the government interfering with market forces <e>", "<cs> my lords if the objective of govern-ment policy is to ensure that the quality of service is improved why do they not show a more sympathetic response to the noble lords question because it is not obvious that allowing the post office to raise charges will act as an encouragement to improving the services <e> <s> it will encourage it to stay with its unsatisfactory ways <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble viscount for his answer perhaps i may remind him how controversial this subject is <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree well he will not agree <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether the tasks will be made known publicly and in particular how they will be interpreted <e> <s> will they be placed in the public domain <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press another matter <e> <s> one worry of parents as the noble viscount is well aware is privacy of the assessment <e> <s> can he reassure the house that the assessment of young people at the age of seven will be entirely a private matter between teachers and the parents and that it will not become public knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that the secretary of states statement sounded as if he were much more concerned to protect the great department of state of which he is in charge than to protect investors <e> <s> the investors in this case could at least ask the question if the department of trade and industry was not there to protect us and if no one else was there to protect us who was there to protect us <e> <s> after all we are not dealing here the secretary of state should not make the point with normal risks <e> <s> the investors involved are not fools <e> <s> they were perfectly aware of the fact that these things were risky <e> <s> they are concerned about the misuse of funds and misinformation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his answer and associate myself with the sentiments that he expressed <e> <s> is he aware of the number of cases of faulty assessment which have been referred to in the press <e> <s> although few in number they are obviously of great importance to the young people involved <e> <s> have the government a view of what can be done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords while bearing in mind that the noble viscount cannot commit himself on the issue today i hope that when he conveys our views to his right honourable friend the secretary of state he will remind him that in this scientific field as in so many others we are among the world leaders if not the very best in the world and it would be a major pity if we lost our researchers because of a shortsighted lack of funding <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to the noble lord lord trafford i feel that he has a clearer view of the bill than i have <e> <s> however i should like to raise one or two questions on which the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall sit down in a moment <e> <s> i do not think that this is quite as big a problem as one or two noble lords have suggested <e> <s> nonetheless i believe that the noble earl lord russell has put his finger on a small but important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the amendment arises in a small number of cases in respect of which we are hoping to hear that the noble lord lord skelmersdale following upon his remarks about looking at the contract will take on board the point that the noble earl lord russell has made <e> <s> there is a distinct possibility that we could reach some degree of agreement on this matter <e> <s> i do not believe the issue is quite so major as some noble lords have suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the question of increased student numbers has the noble viscount seen the recent statement by the chairmanin-waiting of the university funding council who is a member of your lordships house but is not in his place <e> <s> it says that places in higher education should be reserved largely for those students who are willing to pay for them <e> <s> do the government have a view on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i have a simple factual question <e> <s> can the minister tell the house how much it would have cost in total to have up-rated child benefit in line with the full indexing <e> <s> how much was added to family income support <e> <s> am i right in saying that only a fraction was added <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what has fallen is not unemployment but the governments doctored unemployment figures <e> <s> is he also aware that if he were to compare his own figures for the growth in the labour force with figures for the growth in employment there is ample evidence that it is most unlikely in recent times that unemployment has fallen <e> <s> if anything unemployment is probably starting to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments view that one ought to encourage older people back into teaching or into teaching in the first place <e> <s> does the noble viscount not agree that qualification and training are of fundamental importance <e> <s> is the minister not aware how much of many peoples education in certain subjects of which mathematics is the perfect example and this will apply to many members of your lordships house was ruined because they were taught by people who simply did not know how to teach <e> <s> does he not agree that that is a very serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to my noble friend lord bruce and the noble lord lord diamond it seem is that the treasury has a choice <e> <s> it has to accept that it is either meretricious or incompetent <e> <s> it is up to it to decide which it would rather be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one question to the secretary of state as he has referred to the rise in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord as i am a fellow computer user whether he can at least clarify logically the distinction between making a back-up copy of a program on a soft disk and copying it on to the hard disk of the more expensive systems that one or two of us have which is certainly the most sensible course if you have a hard disk <e> <s> i do not quite see why copying it onto the hard disk is not an infringement of copyright as i understand it because otherwise no one would use hard-disk machines at all whereas making a copy as it were a back-up copy would be regarded as an infringement <e>", "<cs> my lords as an academic i must always place on record my extreme discontent with the view that is expressed <e> <s> it can only be put forward by people as i have argued before in connection with this bill who have had no experience whatever of students libraries or teaching <e> <s> the governments position essentially is this if i say to my course on monetary economics that i want them all to read a particular page of an article by

it that available for lending means taking it out of the library <e> <s> as always on these matters i do not entirely trust the legal profession when it gets its hands on this issue <e> <s> that would not mean that if the book was well used in the library even though it was an important work that would not be defined as lending and therefore a back-up copy of that very important work which scholars might use could be made <e>", "<cs> my lords again i understand why these amendments have been put forward <e> <s> however i am not entirely happy with them <e> <s> my main concern is that i have

dismiss other forms of sensible control of personal credit <e> <s> similar points have been made by noble lords this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what the banks say but the banks are in the business of making money and not of worrying about social security <e> <s> i might add that if it was right years ago to have the higher real level why is it not right now <e> <s> incidentally one can also buy insurance against the theft of cards <e> <s> i do not accept that argument at all <e> <s> the answer is quite different and it is the one that i gave <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i also understand that this is the first statement which the noble lord has read in your lordships house and therefore as a matter of courtesy i must congratulate him on that <e> <s> having said that those are the only kind words i have to offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene a second time but i asked a question of fact in my original intervention <e> <s> i asked the noble lord to give us all the relevant figures so that we could compare the costs of closing down the shipyard with the costs of

lordships <e> <s> if the noble lord does not have the information i am willing to accept it subsequently <e> <s> central to this whole discussion are answers to my first questions <e>", "<cs> my lords

in public ownership with i agree a degree of subsidy <e> <s> if we are to discuss this sensibly we have to look at the figures <e> <s> we cannot go ahead with broad remarks like it was not viable <e> <s> that is a meaningless statement <e> <s> if the noble lord does not have the figures i shall have to have them later <e> <s> however they are central to the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some universities are a good deal richer than others and that some are capable of raising million while others have difficulty in raising pence <e> <s> would it not be reasonable for the ufc to take account of the difference in funds available to universities and in particular whether that difference is not itself a reflection of the relative academic qualities of the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the education act which made it very clear that there should be no charge for school activities <e> <s> however does the noble viscount appreciate the paradoxical result of that measure namely that activities such as a foreign trip which is the best way to improve language training and teaching in this country will be precluded from the educational experience of most children because there is no way of charging and the local authorities do not have the resources for them <e> <s> is it not right that if there is to be no charging and if the national curriculum is to succeed then his right honourable friend the secretary of state must provide much more in the way of resources to the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount go a little further <e> <s> he used the expression conflict of interest <e> <s> many of us fail to see how there could ever be a conflict of interest <e> <s> the argument goes all the other way <e> <s> there is an enormous concatenation of interest between the police as members of the community and their work as police officers <e> <s> it would be a great pity if any chief constable were to take the view that there were difficulties when most of us believe that there are no likely difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to the draft order i do not wish to delay the house excessively but there are a number of questions that i need to raise <e> <s> first there is no disagreement between us on the importance of research in an industry of this kind <e> <s> the fundamental question is not whether research is desirable but how it is to be financed <e> <s> the normal economics are that if we are discussing fundamental research the benefits of which accrue to the whole industry it is not in the interests of any individual manufacturer to finance that research because the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like to break the rules and interrupt the minister but a precise point has been made by the noble baroness lady seear and by me <e> <s> although everyone says that research is important there is no evidence that british industry is engaging in any more research <e> <s> that is the nature of the problem <e> <s> the government are apprised of the matter and so are we <e> <s> the problem is that british industry does not appear to be apprised of it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord willing to clarify his earlier answer in case the foreign exchange markets are misled <e> <s> are we right in understanding that although the government have a foreign exchange policy it is simply that the noble lord refuses to tell us what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell us whether the report of the working group to which he referred will be published <e> <s> more importantly can he tell us whether the government are committed and are willing to say that they are committed to the continued existence of these residential schools in inner london <e> <s> if there are any signs that this provision will disappear can the minister say whether the government will intervene to see that that does not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like to trouble the noble viscount but i asked him specifically about publication of the report <e> <s> is it that he is unable to answer or that the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords if it will help the noble baroness i can tell her that in countries such as germany and japan to per cent <e> <s> of the age groups stay on <e> <s> that shows how abysmal is our staying-on rate <e> <s> given that abysmal position although as she rightly says the situation has improved slightly can the minister tell us whether the improvement in the governments view is occurring for educational reasons or as a result of economic factors because young people on the one hand <e>", "<cs> my lords again ever helpful can say that there are certainly elected members of the general optical council indeed the majority of them are elected <e> <s> the ministers reply following the spirit of the question seemed to follow the spirit of what the government have been doing and was not as pro-consumer as one would have liked <e> <s> surely what is required in this area is precisely what the noble lord said namely a much greater consumer representation among the privy council nominees <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just clarify the matter <e> <s> the reason i asked the question is that some of us strongly approve of deregulation but we would like to see it reinforced rather than interfered with by the professionals which am afraid does occur occasionally <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord williams of elvel referred to the bill as a hotpot <e> <s> it is certainly a very diversified piece of legislation what we might call a conglomerate merger of dti interests <e> <s> it is also speaking for myself a very complex bill large parts of which i have to tell noble lords i do not understand at all <e> <s> i have read the dtis companion introduction and i am bound to say that there are large parts that i still do not understand <e> <s> therefore i hope noble lords will bear with me if i take slightly longer in making this speech than i normally would but also will bear with me subsequently in committee where one puts down amendments with the sole purpose of discovering what the bill means because we will certainly have to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of that but i say to the noble lord that that is true of any <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me if i intervene for a moment

"<cs> if i may just join in this discussion i think that those of us who are really rather keen that nuclear power generation should take place assuming it is economic are very worried as is often pointed out by the irrationality of the public about these matters <e> <s> they believe that there are cover-ups <e> <s> they believe that governments are tempted to cover up no matter what they say <e> <s> it seems to me that those of us who favour nuclear power in that sense wish the government would take this opportunity because as my noble friend lord williams of elvel puts it it really would at the very least confirm in statute what the government propose to do <e> <s> it would he immensely reassuring in the unclear context and that is why one is rather disappointed by the noble baronesss reply <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that although we have considerable natural gas supplies natural gas provides a particularly important back-up to our countrys long-term energy reserves <e> <s> is it the view of her majestys government that the current price of natural gas truly reflects its long-term value to the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how much of the british film industry is british in the sense of being owned and financed by british people <e> <s> is it not overwhelmingly foreign-financed <e> <s> is not one reason for that the less than generous tax advantages given in this country for film production <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the minister back to his answer to the previous question but one <e> <s> was he saying that we are running a positive balance of payments surplus on film and television activities <e> <s> i heard him quote the export figures <e> <s> can he quote the import figures and the differences between the two <e>", "<cs> on the opposition front bench we warmly support the amendment <e> <s> in particular we support the arguments that have been put forward in favour of it <e> <s> i believe that there is no difference between any of us on the importance of research and development and i fully accept that the government have taken a very strong and positive view on the desirability of encouraging research and development <e> <s> there is no argument between any of us on that matter <e> <s> this is very much a matter of what <e>", "<cs> i apologise for intervening yet again <e> <s> i am at a loss as to why the minister is unable to be more positive <e> <s> i can well understand if he were to go away and then to discover on reflection that we were all wrong that he would come back and say you didnt really understand and we can explain it <e> <s> i doubt that any of us would be churlish if we were all wrong <e> <s> however for the noble lord to have considered this amendment with advice and to have discovered that we are entirely right then to be told that in a bill of this size the government cannot find room for such an amendment seems very far fetched <e> <s> i can find things in the bill that i should be happy for him to take out <e> <s> all we ask is that he considers the points that the noble viscount is making <e> <s> if he <e>", "<cs> briefly i just wish to clarify something <e> <s> as i understand it what the noble lord has said is that it is too early to decide along the lines of this amendment but that he will consult and if in due course as the noble lord lord benson pointed out it became abundantly clear that a statutory back-up would be required the government in following dearing would not at this stage turn their face against that idea <e> <s> before withdrawing the amendment i should like to be clear in my own mind that that is what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> subject to that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment on behalf of the noble lord lord williams and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is vitally important to encourage first-class british design throughout british industry <e> <s> given that the design centre was once a marvellous showcase for the best of british design can the noble lord say why the conclusion has been reached that we do not need such a showcase <e> <s> can he offer your lordships any explanation as to why we no longer need a design centre <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not an anwer to my question <e> <s> simply to say that it is no good is not an explanation of why other nations feel that such showcases are so important and why to repeat the point in its heyday the design council gave enormous leadership not only to industry but to many of us as consumers by educating us into design <e> <s> i should still like an explanation of why the shop is not needed any more <e>", "<cs> my lords the name is the british antarctic survey not the international antarctic survey <e> <s> will the noble viscount although i think he is saying this anyway convey to his right honourable friend that what is required is that the british antarctic survey should have the ship which it wants and which it judges as being correct for the scientific purposes it has in mind <e> <s> secondly will he recognise the fact that many of us include in the calculation of value for money the idea that it would be a british ship built in a british shipyard <e>", "<cs> my lords the stupid questionnaires to which the noble lord lord beloff referred have their origin in the department of education and science <e> <s> that department totally backs them as its system of staff appraisal <e> <s> however i ask the noble viscount to return to the original question <e> <s> it is a serious matter when some quarter of all undergraduates study social studies and business but those subjects are not represented at all on the universities funding council <e> <s> will the noble viscount at least draw to the attention of his right honourable friend the secretary of state the fact that that scale of omission is rather serious <e>", "<cs> i should like to reiterate our view and then ask two additional questions <e> <s> where <e>", "<cs> as an economist i too was extremely intrigued by this point <e> <s> surely the expenses of an investigation if i may refer to a previous paragraph refer to the expenses of an investigation whatever they happen to be <e> <s> the whole of the paragraph that we wish to amend is irrelevant <e> <s> as an economist i give my advice freely to the department on this occasion i believe that expenses of investigation is a well-defined concept <e> <s> it means what it costs to undertake the investigation <e> <s> the amendment is a drafting amendment and i do not wish to push it too much but it seems to me that the department is unduly nervous at the use of the english language <e> <s> the paragraph is not required <e> <s> it is right that the expenses of the investigation should be recoverable <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am mystified because the secretary of state gives a very good example of where additional powers may be required <e> <s> however he said <e>", "<cs> it is always a favourite subject of the committee when we come to the meaning of words <e> <s> i now find myself less able to understand than i did when we started <e> <s> the very least we require based on the noble lords statement is that both proceedings and procedure are necessary because neither cover all that we have in mind <e> <s> from my knowledge of the english language procedure covers more of what the government have in mind than does proceedings <e> <s> if it is meant to cover proceedings as well meaning legal proceedings then perhaps the noble lord will reflect on that and come back with an amendment which covers both definitions <e> <s> certainly my understanding of the word procedure is that it involves pretty well all the range of activities which the noble lord said he thought the word proceedings covered which in my view it does not <e> <s> we do not want to bandy around these words all the time but there is a substantive point which the noble lords department might want to reconsider <e>", "<cs> my lords in his excellent introduction to this extremely interesting debate the noble viscount lord hanworth referred to history <e> <s> it is true that we have all been around this course many times before <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will forgive me if i offer the following quotation from a lecture on technical education <e> <s> reference was made to <e>", "<cs> my lords always in these debates one comes prepared with an elaborate set of notes to which one refers in the course of the evening <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> certainly one of your lordships raised the issue of <e> <s> nonetheless i was not seeking to be acerbic or difficult <e> <s> i intended to be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will bear with me <e> <s> does he intend to say anything on the point made by the noble lord lord howie on the role that the government could have in enhancing the image of engineers <e> <s> the noble lord referred to what had happened with design and how it has been brought much more to the public attention through ministers taking a great interest in it and by their presence on certain occasions <e> <s> his point on engineers applied a <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the stringent conditions in the education reform act regarding the ability to charge is there any danger that talented young musicians who wish to use the centre will be unable to do so because they will not be able to afford the cost of the musical instruments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to welcome the rise in manufacturing productivity <e> <s> it compares quite favourably with the heyday of keynesian demand management in the s and early s so the government are doing quite well to get back to our best days <e> <s> however given the ministers earlier answers is he aware of the cbi statement only a couple of months ago that although we have improved it would take us about years if we continue to make relatively good progress to equal the productivity levels of west germany and france years to equal the productivity levels of japan and to quote the americans we may never catch up with them <e> <s> does the minister care to comment on that <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask two questions about this new clause <e> <s> like other noble lords i have great difficulty in following any of it <e> <s> i am asking for enlightenment <e> <s> could the noble lord explain more clearly than he has what it is about charities that requires their aims or objects to be set out in this very definite and clear way that does not apply to other companies <e> <s> i was totally lost at that point in the noble lords contribution as to what was special about charities he having said earlier that all other companies were not required to say anything other than we are in business as companies <e>", "<cs> i am most indebted to the noble lord <e> <s> i follow that part of the argument <e> <s> i entirely accept the fact that for all sorts of control purposes one wants to know why a charitable company is in existence <e> <s> however earlier the noble lord said that we did not need to know why other companies were in existence <e> <s> i cannot see the consistency of that position <e> <s> i should have thought that for all sorts of reasons it would be worth while to know precisely what business a company was in <e> <s> if i were a potential creditor of any company i would not find it satisfactory to be told that this is a general commercial company that can do anything it likes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly pursue the point <e> <s> i understand that argument <e> <s> however my question went further <e> <s> i was asking for evidence <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> to follow the logic of the noble lord is he agreeing with members of the committee that we all favour transparency but telling us that we cannot do it <e> <s> is the minister simply making the bald statement that it is impossible to draft a clause that will achieve the end that we want namely that the <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to pursue the remarks of noble lords on the constitutional side where i am somewhat out of my depth <e> <s> i am however worried about the economics of all this and the behaviour of markets <e> <s> i feel that the point raised by the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth was not properly answered <e> <s> standing back from the debate i am very puzzled that on the whole a government regarding themselves as non-interventionist and essentially laying down a set of rules should now produce an argument about reacting rapidly to circumstances in a most interventionist manner <e>", "<cs> i am extremely disturbed by the replies that we have had <e> <s> it is quite wrong to raise the question of merger at this stage <e> <s> this is not about mergers <e> <s> the noble lord will see me in an extremely fierce mood because he knows i am extremely antipathetic to the merger movement which i think has been mostly detrimental to the british economy over the past few years <e> <s> however that is for another day <e>", "<cs> it may be useful if this side of the committee is allowed to join in the debate even though i have never obtained a substantial interest in any company or been in the position of threatening to take one over <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord morris it is fundamental that a company should know who its shareholders are <e> <s> i should like to add a second fundamental principle <e> <s> believe that financial markets exist for the sake of industrial and commercial firms and not the other way round <e> <s> in other words what matters is what industry does

companies would hold meetings on bank holidays or late at night <e> <s> if this is a serious problem it ought to be taken up by the government and some solution put forward <e> <s> however i admit that i am absolutely staggered at the problem <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may thank the noble lord for his response <e> <s> of course i accept that people who talk too much can be a pain in the neck in all

training and employment aspect to this matter perhaps i may ask why the money is not being used where it is known to be most effective that is in the further education sector where the government are cutting funds for training <e> <s> why do not the government use those enormous funds in that sector rather than in the tiny number of ctcs <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are extending this matter and going slightly wide of the order paper the minister may like to consider that the reason the german education system is so successful is that the german government pour vast amounts of money into their ordinary straightforward schools which is what we should like to see happen in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the law and as the noble viscount will remember i supported its clarification by what we introduced into the act <e> <s> the question i ask is as a result have we got matters wrong <e> <s> before we clarified the act a great many of these visits were paid for in rather an informal way and matters were rather blurred <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that having clarified the question of charging for which i do not criticise the government many school governors are now worried whether they can levy voluntary contributions <e> <s> there is therefore a danger of which farm visits is a good example that such visits will not take place although everyone agrees that they are educationally valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount is aware i raised the question in order that the subject may be aired <e> <s> is he aware that some of us have received a number of letters on the subject <e> <s> at the moment i have one with me from the national farmers union <e> <s> it makes precisely the point that i make namely that in seeking to clarify the law <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is the noble viscount who has answered the question can we assume that lip-reading and the training of lip-reading teachers lie within the area of responsibility of the department of education and science and not of the department of health or the department of the environment <e> <s> if the des is the responsible department and as this is the kind of worthy but rather small activity that is easily forgotten and neglected can we be reassured that his department will keep an eye on this matter <e> <s> if the local authorities to which he has

your lordships indulgence as i still am a university teacher and i am a member of the association of university teachers <e> <s> nonetheless i hope that i may be permitted to ask a question <e> <s> is the minister aware that if the salaries and working conditions of universities continue to deteriorate that will have a much greater long-term effect on students than what is happening at the moment

appropriate settlement can be made <e> <s> for those of us looking at the matter it is impossible to understand the ministers answer that it is up to the university authorities to solve the problem <e> <s> they cannot solve it if there is no money <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my point <e> <s> are the government doing anything <e> <s> i could not understand from the ministers answer whether it was merely a matter of waiting for a day or two and the government would then be making a positive and constructive statement or is it as we believe that the government are happy to let the situation deteriorate until something catastrophic occurs <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment perhaps i may contribute one or two words on the nature of competition <e> <s> i must say that for me competition is the central issue here <e>", "<cs> as i like the noble lord and other noble lords am not usually in charge of companies or involved in asking significant friends to ask questions in the house i am already taken aback that anyone would think that that was a proper way to behave but let us leave that on one side <e> <s> i do not see how that differs from the present state of affairs in which i gather that this sort of thing happens in any case <e> <s> that is not my point <e> <s> i believe that with the criterion slightly changed the secretary of state can still stay above the battle and not involve himself with bureaucracy but i accept that things are more difficult for the company concerned <e> <s> it has to <e>", "<cs> i hate to educate the noble lord with respect to the history of economic doctrine <e> <s> however i must first say that i was both aware of and a supporter of adam smith before the noble lord knew anything about economics if i may be so acerbic <e> <s> however the essence of adam smith is precisely his emphasis on the dynamics of competition <e> <s> other economists later may have slightly lost sight of that <e> <s> but adam smith saw the market as a living dynamic thing in which when people got together and merged those essential dynamics were destroyed <e> <s> that is exactly what this debate is about <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i am a trifle disappointed <e> <s> it is certainly not the intention of the amendment to pre-empt the activities of the mmc or anything like that <e> <s> the intention is to make much clearer what the secretary of state and the director <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could at least make clear what we are talking about <e> <s> the intention is not to replace another body with the activity of the secretary of state <e> <s> it is certainly not for the secretary of state to do the work <e> <s> equally we must recognise what actually is the position <e> <s> the secretary of state has himself made clear that he does not simply take a merger and say this is a merger <e> <s> clearly it involves concentration first and foremost and therefore i must send it on <e> <s> the director general does not do that <e> <s> they clearly concern themselves with criteria <e> <s> i understood the secretary of state to he saying that he took a broader view of the matter <e>", "<cs> before bringing this to a conclusion may i first say to the secretary of state if i dare that i thought that he put my case better than i did <e> <s> i think his analogy with the magistrates court is precisely what i had in mind and the question of whether there is a case to answer is precisely what i had in mind <e> <s> therefore as with the noble lord lord lloyd the issue simply revolves around whether it should be made explicit <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i thought that the amendment was rather sensible <e> <s> however it may well be that the secretary of state has already covered the point which i thought was sensible <e> <s> what one has in mind is exactly the point which i think the secretary of state has made that is that the time has gone by and then suddenly as it were one begins to suspect that there is something fishy in the matter and therefore one wants to be in a position to look at it again <e>", "<cs> we have slightly jumped the gun <e> <s> we have not yet come to my amendment no <e> <s> h <e> <s> most of what the noble lord has said is relevant to that amendment <e> <s> i shall not speak on that matter yet <e> <s> i shall go back to my amendment no <e> <s> g and to the reply that the secretary of state made <e>", "<cs> with respect we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> g which is an amendment concerning the operations of our merger policy viewed as our merger policy <e> <s> i am about to move amendment no <e> <s> h which covers precisely the ground that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has referred to <e> <s> that amendment concerns taking account of european merger policy <e> <s> i have not yet spoken to amendment no <e> <s> h because i was dealing with amendment no <e> <s> g <e> <s> this is a purely procedural matter <e> <s> i was simply doing what i was told which was to stick to the amendment that i was moving <e>", "<cs> this misunderstanding is my fault <e> <s> i did not intend the reference to the european community to mean at that point the communitys competition arrangements <e> <s> the points i raised and the points to which the secretary of state addressed himself concerned such matters as the nature of the market we were considering <e> <s> i entirely accept that i have blurred the issue here <e> <s> but i should like at least to get my blurred issue dealt with first because i felt that for the second time today the secretary of state put my argument better than i could have done <e> <s> his bus analogy was precisely what i had in mind <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may bring this extremely interesting discussion to a close <e> <s> i have a sense of responsibility that in drafting the amendment badly i may have led us on to the wrong track <e>", "<cs> i thank the secretary of state for his answer which is to a considerable extent reassuring <e> <s> i believe that the noble lords lord ezra and lord lloyd and myself were right to raise this matter <e> <s> i shall not pursue it now because i should like to reflect on precisely the points that the noble lord has made about the fluid nature of the matter <e> <s> however i repeat my point that both the government and those of us in opposition must make much more clear to people the significance of what is happening in europe and the significance of in terms of legislation generally <e> <s> that is why i have pursued the matter <e> <s> i shall return to it in this and other bills <e> <s> having said that i do not in any sense criticise the secretary of states answer i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had not realised that i had been so quiet over the last two years that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran had not yet noticed that i had joined this chamber <e> <s> however that is by the way <e> <s> the secretary of state has responded admirably to the concerns of the committee <e> <s> i look forward to seeing what he can do to help us here <e> <s> on the basis of so heartening a response on his part i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> were the noble lord to say that the monopolies and mergers commission would farm out investigations to a panel of three and that those investigations would come before the full monopolies commission for discussion and approval then i should support him <e> <s> but at present under the fair trading act it is perfectly clear and under the competition act it is carried forward that the monopolies and mergers commission can form a panel which without reference to the full commission can commit the commission <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> if there is to be a panel of three which can issue a report without any reference at all to other <e>", "<cs> i am certainly not persuaded <e> <s> my view is exactly the reverse <e> <s> it is that the mmc is overloaded and this is introduced in some way to try to keep it still operational <e> <s> however we have a duty as an opposition to point out the longer term implications of the governments frivolous actions <e> <s> we have done our duty in that regard and we have also listened to the noble lord in his attempt to justify what the government are doing <e> <s> we have happily made our point and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a few words in support of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i too have no idea whether schedule is the right place for this provision <e> <s> but that is a minor matter <e> <s> i have several points to make here <e> <s> the provisions that are suggested in the amendments which we are discussing should take place anyway <e> <s> my guess is that in practice they may well happen anyway <e> <s> i look for some reassurance from the minister on that <e>", "<cs> <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord has now arrived at the point we wanted to reach <e> <s> many of those he calls professionals and practitioners are ultimately operating for to use his expression the innocent investor <e> <s> therefore that distinction does not seem to be as clear-cut as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i am an innocent investor <e> <s> i certainly never act on my own behalf <e> <s> however others whether engaged in unit trusts or pension funds are acting on my behalf as an innocent <e> <s> therefore i do not see and this is what my noble friend asks why this right of innocence is not transmitted forward to the professionals acting for us <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to keep matters going unduly but the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is right to raise this matter and i hope that we do not rush through too rapidly and not clarify it <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his answer which is exactly as i expected <e> <s> i entirely agree that given his assurance there is no need for what he rightly calls a transitional amendment to be included in the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may draw the noble viscounts attention to the wording of the question which is to ask her majestys government whether they are examining the matter and <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like to pursue the matter but the noble viscount will be aware that it is stated in the education act that the universities funding council has an advisory role to the secretary of state <e> <s> a number of the questions are motivated by the desire of many of us to ask the secretary of state to fulfil his duty and look after the national interest <e> <s> will the minister convey to his right honourable friend the secretary of state and i think that he has already said that he will that we expect in cases such as this that he will take decisions in the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount extend his answer a little further <e> <s> he will be aware that the education act makes political activity in school illegal <e> <s> these bodies seem to be political pressure groups <e> <s> they themselves are connected with charities and seem to be endangering the charitable status of the organisations with which they are connected <e> <s> is it not the responsibility of the secretary of state under the act to take the lead in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to press the noble viscount but perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> while he is right that the schools can consider the issue of abortion it is not the case that the schools are free to engage in political activity <e> <s> two years ago the government went to a great deal of trouble to stop precisely that <e> <s> the question is not about a balanced approach to abortion which we would all favour it is about political activity <e> <s> one requires an answer on that <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an excellent debate introduced by my noble friend lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> we have covered a great deal of material on teacher supply <e> <s> i confess that i have nothing original to add to what has been said on the facts <e> <s> i must however add my voice to those who say that new initiatives are urgently required <e> <s> many of us on this side were critical of it as a bill but now that we have the education reform act it is our duty to make it work <e> <s> we pointed out last year how dependent it was for its success on teacher supply <e> <s> and how right we were <e> <s> it may well be that the secretary of state exhausted himself getting the act on to the statute book <e> <s> perhaps he is looking for new fields to plough <e> <s> until that happens he and no one else is the responsible person <e> <s> he must accept full responsibility for the teacher shortage and the solution to it <e> <s> we hear that he is pressing the treasury for new money <e> <s> we can only hope that he is successful <e> <s> we must also hope that he does not fall for typical treasury arguments based on naive views of productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly comment on the connection between the teachers of the noble lord lord beloff and for that matter those of the noble lord lord stewart and the enormous achievements of those noble lords <e> <s> however i remind those who are devotees of the writing of evelyn waugh that those were the bad old days of the independent schools <e> <s> exactly the same kinds of people not the excellent teachers whom the noble lord lord beloff had went into teaching <e> <s> the independent schools made it their business to try to bring that to a stop <e> <s> i am not saying that there have not been inspired people of all sorts but i do not believe for one moment that that should be used as an argument to detract from professionalism <e> <s> since we are on the subject although it has nothing to do with the main theme i take the same view about university teachers who could also do with some professional training <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the relevant figures are that per cent <e> <s> of girls stay on at school while per cent <e> <s> of boys stay on <e> <s> that confirms what the noble viscount said <e> <s> the noble viscount mentioned that in the past year there had been an increase in those staying on in full-time education <e> <s> can he confirm that in the s until last year the rate of increase was lower than at the start of the decade and that it was only last year that the situation began to recover <e> <s> can he explain that fact <e> <s> can he also explain the curious fact that the proportion staying on at school rather than going on to further education is now lower than it was at the start of the decade <e>", "<cs> my lords can we pursue one aspect of the ministers answer in relation to gcse which i welcome <e> <s> can he confirm that it is the governments view that gcse has been helpful in persuading young people to stay on in further education <e> <s> will he therefore confirm that it is a bad idea that those people who are trying to undermine gcse should continue to do so <e> <s> can the noble viscount confirm that gcse is a success <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain to the house the point of raising interest rates <e> <s> is it to dampen down demand and economic activity <e> <s> if so why does he tell us that demand and economic activity have not been dampened down <e> <s> may we have some enlightenment on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain why he broadly agrees with his noble and learned friend when interest rates in the united states are distinctly lower than they are in this country <e> <s> we should be very happy to have interest rates as low as those of the united states as would the cbi <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will also enlighten us on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that although i am partially retired as an academic even i am snowed under with filling out such forms <e> <s> it deflects me from my main job of asking the noble viscount difficult questions <e> <s> more seriously does he recall that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and the noble baroness who was the minister at that time both reassured your lordships when we were debating these matters that we would not be snowed under with these bits of paper when the bill became an act <e> <s> it looks as though the promises they made have not been fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can clarify one aspect of the change which has taken place <e> <s> am i right in assuming that the earnings of pensioners should they choose to work will simply be subject to taxation in the normal way <e> <s> further will it be the case that their pension will be added to taxable income and will also be taxed or will it be free of all tax <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply the noble viscount used the expression until a decision is reached <e> <s> how long will that be <e> <s> those children who are not in school are losing the education experience at the exact time that they are not in school <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether it is the case that we have a problem in trading with the soviet union because of a lack of facility with the russian language <e> <s> is he aware that one cause of that is the considerable shortage of russian language teachers in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reconsider his answer on tax relief <e> <s> is he aware that until recently there was no suggestion that the provision of crche facilities should be treated as imputed income for the working woman <e> <s> the revenue has only recently decided that it is income and therefore taxable <e> <s> it is therefore obvious that what the revenue has decided is a disincentive to women <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind the noble viscount that there is no provision for re-entry in the education reform act as passed <e> <s> is the ministers department monitoring opting out particularly with a view to discovering whether the effect of opting out will be to raise costs for the local authority left with the remaining schools and therefore placing an added burden on ratepayers no i beg your pardon not ratepayers poll tax payers in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i pursue the matter a little further <e> <s> that was not my question <e> <s> i am perfectly well aware of that and of the political point which the minister has made <e> <s> my question followed the point which was made earlier <e> <s> if schools opt out because they do not care for what their local authority plans to do which i should have thought and let us stick to the conservative authorities is not necessarily detrimental to what is happening locally then are they not in principle adding to the costs of that local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly answer the question but i could put a further question <e> <s> does the minister agree that we must assume that local authorities exist to try to run their education services efficiently <e> <s> if we make that assumption and solely for the sake of the noble viscount i stick to conservative authorities does he agree that costs will rise as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the secretary of state for his reply and one well understands how he argues his case <e> <s> however i am rather mystified because i did not interpret the clause to mean the use of the sex discrimination act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the secretary of state because i was trying to make that point <e> <s> one is not arguing that this is a matter of employment but we are trying to argue the logic of the case <e> <s> however one has had a chance to make the point <e> <s> i am glad about that <e> <s> i interpreted the secretary of state as saying that he is glad that we had that opportunity <e> <s> i believe that we must find a way of coming back to this matter and i address this much more to noble lords opposite and we must find a way of persuading companies to appreciate this matter in their own interests because it seems to me that we are talking here about people who have a valuable contribution to make <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while also welcoming what i understand to be the noble lords statement that more resources will go into that work may we have some assurance that the quality of statistics will improve and to pursue the point raised by the noble lord that the treasury will not tamper with them <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest some examples to which the noble lord may wish to refer may we in due course look forward to the day when our unemployment statistics measure unemployment when our income and output statistics equal the same number as they are supposed to do rather than differ and when our balance of payments statistics do not seem to contain a larger error than the balance of payments figure in the first place <e> <s> in other words when may we look forward to some useful statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may utter a few words of thanks to the noble earl lord russell for taking part in this debate <e> <s> i felt that his contribution was particularly helpful and he covered certain matters which i omitted <e> <s> perhaps i may also offer an apology <e> <s> it was remiss of me not to join with the noble viscount in thanking the science working <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that what really mattered was the decline in the public debt <e> <s> is he saying that future generations will welcome the decline in public investment and the quality of the environment in which they will live because this government have cut such expenditure in order to cut the national debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am doubly grateful in joining with other noble lords to thank the noble earl for introducing this debate because i was unable to take part in the earlier higher education debate <e> <s> this is therefore my opportunity to get back into the swim of education so to speak <e> <s> i can cover only a few of the topics that noble lords have raised but i shall do the best i can to express at least some of the views of the opposition front bench on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lords department has undertaken work which shows that even when one makes the most generous allowance for the research effort of universities leaving in the remainder as comparable for teaching the universities are still excessively generously treated compared with the polytechnics or to put it the other way round the polytechnics are not reasonably well treated <e> <s> i understand that his department has done that work <e> <s> perhaps in due course he will let us know about it <e>", "<cs> i am not going to pursue the salary point for the moment <e> <s> will the noble baroness clarify the answer she gave to her noble friend lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> i thought the noble lord was being reasonable <e> <s> he said that he wanted to know the criteria for the appointment <e> <s> the noble baroness said she did not want to be restricted on that <e> <s> but she did not even go so far as to say that the government would like to appoint someone who knows something about the industry even if in the end they do not succeed in that <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i have very much been looking forward to discussing this amendment not simply because it is the first amendment with which am dealing <e> <s> although the noble lord lord peyton referred to it as simple i think that it is an amendment of fundamental importance <e> <s> having said that i am not certain that i agree with it <e> <s> i am glad that the amendment has been tabled because i believe that the subject is worthy of very serious consideration by this committee <e>", "<cs> i had intended to raise that point <e> <s> on the one hand my worry is that i do not want these committees to be in the pocket of the regulator and this relates to many other amendments as they will come up <e> <s> much as i want to see the regulator succeed a number of consumer matters may involve conflict with the director himself or herself <e> <s> i do not want the consumer committees to be in the pocket of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back on this issue <e> <s> the noble baroness may recall that i was seeking independence from both the secretary of state and the director general <e> <s> one obvious body that might have rights to nominate such bodies would be local authorities <e> <s> this government have clearly set their hearts against that concept <e> <s> they do not like local authorities appointing people to all kinds of committees <e> <s> i am not seeking to persuade the government on that view <e> <s> my point was this <e> <s> one can achieve independence of either of the other two only through the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for his interesting reply <e> <s> he has clarified for me at least the governments thinking although that does not mean to say that i agree with it <e> <s> however it throws light on precisely why this amendment is so important <e> <s> the noble lord said that the consumers committees will be fully integrated into the director generals office <e> <s> he referred to them as being part of the directors organisation <e> <s> the interesting point raised by this amendment is why this should be so <e> <s> i was quite astounded by the electricity consumer councils welcome for this aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> as always the noble lord has answered in a very clear forthright manner <e> <s> we are indebted to him for that but i do not like the content of the answers <e> <s> first as i understand it these committees cannot give evidence <e> <s> they have no locus in order to become involved in say monopolies mergers restrictive practices and that sort of thing <e> <s> that is my understanding of the bill <e>", "<cs> what it considers is of course up to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> what we are concerned about is what these people can do by right and obligation with respect to protecting consumers in the industry <e> <s> what i have in mind and have been probing for and let us take the restrictive practices i can argue through all these clauses and give examples is where a local consumer body believes that the local production of electricity or supply of electricity is being subject to abuse of monopoly power <e> <s> first i feel it is only right that it should be drawn to the commissions attention <e> <s> it is a matter that concerns the commission and i should be horrified to be told that it did not think the matter concerned it <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the minister wishes to speak before me on this point <e> <s> what i have in mind is clearly not that the committees should make a referral <e> <s> i am not seeking via this bill completely to change the mergers and monopolies <e>", "<cs> i am indebted to the noble lord for his remarks but that is not my point <e> <s> my point concerns the consumers committees <e> <s> i agree that what the noble lord has said clarifies the point that arose under the earlier amendment of the noble lord lord peyton <e> <s> our vision of the consumers committees is of something rather more independent than is the governments vision as i see it <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur was very clear in his response to the noble lord lord peyton as regards the close relationship between the consumers committees and the director general <e> <s> essentially i am pointing out that that is not quite our conception <e> <s> our view is an alternative view and one which i think is at least worth considering in terms of consumer protection <e>", "<cs> the point of these amendments is to remove misapprehensions that members of the committee such as myself have <e> <s> i put the simple question that if a local consumers committee comes to the conclusion that it perceives an abuse of monopoly power could it with no problems whatever simply go directly or write directly to the monopolies and mergers commission or the director general of fair trading to say that it had discovered what in its view constituted an abuse of monopoly power <e> <s> the committee could not refer it to the monopolies and mergers commission or the director general of fair trading in the sense that the noble lord lord trafford pointed out but could it draw it to the attention of those bodies <e>", "<cs> i shall obviously read that answer more precisely again <e> <s> i think some of this may turn on the use of words like might ought have a right to and other such expressions <e> <s> i shall consider those words and come back to them <e> <s> however i am to some extent considerably reassured <e> <s> nevertheless i must study the matter further <e>", "<cs> of course i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> as always i am extremely interested in the use of the english language particularly in respect of legislation which is not my subject as the noble lord well knows <e> <s> if the words had been reversed and the first sentence had had appointed and the second establish he would have put up an equally good defence <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that answer which deals with the matter entirely to our satisfaction <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord perhaps i may say how disappointed i am at the view of the noble lord lord peyton of my amendment <e> <s> i may sound lofty but i was genuinely open-minded about his amendment <e> <s> as i argued i have problems on achieving independence <e> <s> i was aware of my amendment and of his and i was trying quite honestly to find a way through them <e> <s> i still am <e>", "<cs> it was not my intention to prolong this discussion but i am most perturbed <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord is aware of the paradoxical nature of the argument that he has put forward <e> <s> essentially we are concerned with the appointment of consumers committees <e> <s> subsection gives us the only criterion we have here <e> <s> it has been amply pointed out that the only criterion that seems to concern the government is someone concerned with the provision of electricity supply services <e> <s> what the noble lord lord ezra seeks to do and what i was slightly amending is to say that if we are going to specify any criteria at all for consumers committees then we might as well specify some consumer criteria <e> <s> alternatively we can adopt the view of the noble lord lord peyton and not specify any criteria at all <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment to amendment no <e> <s> standing in the names of the noble lord lord wise and my noble friend lord carter <e>", "<cs> this is an important point <e> <s> as members of the committee are aware i was not able to take part in the second reading debate on this matter <e> <s> but anyone who has experience of regulations will be well aware of what the americans call regulation capture namely that in the end the regulator gets captured by the industry <e> <s> the americans are perfectly well aware of that and it is a very serious matter <e> <s> that is why some of us adopt the view that whether it is done via the approach of the noble lord lord peyton or through certain ideas which i have we should like a wedge between the regulator and the consumers <e> <s> that is because we are fearful that in due course the regulator will be captured by the enormously powerful industrial interests which will always be at work <e> <s> it is quite right that they should be at work but regulatory capture is not a satisfactory state of affairs <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord renton that i am always interested in history and matters of historical importance quite independent of currying favour with the prime minister <e> <s> his intervention was of enormous interest and i shall obtain a copy of the appropriate <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one supplementary remark to those of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i think the point has been made and i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i ask leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene here for just a moment <e> <s> i should remind the noble baroness that the amendment is actually about financing techniques it is not about some of the other matters which she has just mentioned <e> <s> further i wonder whether she would like to take this opportunity to clarify more generally the issue of licences <e> <s> i thought earlier when the noble earl lord lauderdale said that the licences could be easily changed that i heard the noble baroness say that that was not the case and that they would be very hard to change <e> <s> perhaps she will confirm what i think i heard her say <e>", "<cs> i hope that there is only one <e> <s> those questions must be answerable <e> <s> i am aware that i am going on at great length <e> <s> i intend to go on at great length because it was not i who delayed the earlier proceedings <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness so that i may understand that reply <e> <s> someone seeking to buy an area board will simultaneously negotiate the price plus the licence <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> if i wish to buy an area board or whatever the boards will be called from now on i shall simultaneously negotiate with the government on the whole package including the licence at that point so that i get the licence when i get the company <e>", "<cs> perhaps then i may ask another question since it relates to an answer which may be coming <e> <s> my point was that once the industry has been privatised it will be possible for someone else to take over a particular plc as it is a plc and plcs can be taken over <e> <s> i asked specifically whether they would then be taking over the licence with no problem whatever <e> <s> does the licence automatically go with the plc <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> it was never my intention to press this matter to a division <e> <s> the committee could have passed through the lobbies formula by formula <e> <s> however i hope that when the noble baroness reads my contribution in <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for the explanation of the amendment <e> <s> i am bound to say that it turns out to mean a good deal more than i had worked out from looking at it <e> <s> there are two questions which he might care to answer <e> <s> am i right in assuming that under the general rubric of efficiency and economy it is now the case that the generators transmitters and what are called the suppliers are all as it were obliged to meet the efficiency and economy criteria under paragraph b to which he refers <e> <s> as i understand it that is the direction of the amendment <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl will make that absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not have the slightest interest in northern ireland <e> <s> i meant great britain rather than the united kingdom <e> <s> the point i made in my remarks is the one that i should like to be addressed <e> <s> i shall try to show an interest in northern ireland on another occasion but that is not what i have in mind at this moment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i am amazed by that last answer and i shall come back to that on clause <e>", "<cs> i should have been but was not but i was in the technical sense <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness generally <e> <s> i shall read carefully her answer to the first amendment because i think that it is an important matter and we may come back to it <e>", "<cs> from these benches we think that this is a sensible amendment and that it is also very much in line with the stated policy of the government <e> <s> we have seen in the past the government showing an interest in this kind of development <e> <s> therefore the only issue is the usual one on which we shall no doubt hear from the noble baroness as to whether it should be in the bill <e> <s> we believe that this is precisely the kind of clause that ought to be in the bill <e> <s> it would act as an encouragement <e> <s> what seems to cause us to differ throughout the discussion on this legislation is that we should like to see certain encouraging things in the bill whereas the government seem to keep saying that there is no point in putting them in the bill as they will encourage them anyway <e> <s> we look forward to hearing whatever variant of those answers the government put forward <e> <s> broadly we feel convinced that this is something of which the government must be in favour <e>", "<cs> i wish to reiterate the point that i have made several times this evening <e> <s> it is our view that licences and all that goes with them are central to the bill and those issues have not been thought through fully <e> <s> on an earlier amendment we tried to persuade the government to think again about the licences and all those matters <e> <s> i am looking forward to hearing the noble baroness answer a number of questions i asked about the licences and the price regulation scheme <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene but i am a trifle unhappy about the reply of the noble lord as regards paragraph c <e> <s> i believe that the anxiety of the noble baroness is that a firm subject to the price regulation formula but anxious to maximise profits will place quality of service in danger <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment is saying that if that were to happen and if the quality of service were to decline the obvious place to penalise the offending body would be in connection with price <e> <s> that is how the amendment reads at least <e> <s> it makes perfectly good sense to me <e> <s> the argument that the penalty as it were should be kept separate from the price regulation does not appear to me to hold water <e> <s> i heard the minister say that he would convey the views of the noble baroness to his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> i beg the committees pardon <e> <s> the minister will convey the views of his noble friend to the director <e> <s> but perhaps he may care to inform also his right honourable friend who i am sure takes an interest in our proceedings at all times that the idea particularly behind paragraph c of the amendment is one that is certainly worth considering if quality of service is important <e> <s> i know we all believe it is important <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i am somewhat reassured but equally mystified because that answer would take a number of other items out of the bill because the director has responsibilities for them <e> <s> the point that i was making given that one has written a sentence under clause a is why it is not a better sentence <e> <s> however we can return to the matter on another occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> clause is the clause under which one would most properly discuss the whole question of the grid merit order optimising the generation of electricity and producing the optimum investment decision <e> <s> it is my view and i believe the view of my noble friends that if the industry were privatised in that way it would simply be unable to optimise in the way that the nationalised industry does by the merit order system and the grid <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say whether the government have given any support to the principle of governors being fully reflective of the local community <e> <s> can he say whether the video to which he refers which i hope will find its way into our library at some time so that we can see it says anything at all about the governors and their relationship to the local community and in particular aspects of what might be called their representative nature <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return to a theme which has occupied me for a long time and ask yet again whether any thought has been given to the political complexion of governing bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am the last to add my congratulations to the sub-committee for a superb report <e> <s> it gives a very clear exposition of the directive and of the uk position with respect to monopolies and mergers control <e> <s> we are also told much of interest about what happens in other countries <e>", "<cs> with the permission of the committee this is always a difficult matter <e> <s> on the occasions when i had experience of government i was always in favour of governing and was much less on the side of those who wished to object to governing and who wanted to be consulted and so on <e> <s> it is easy to argue and psychologically i tend to be on that side that those who object are being trivial frivolous and so on <e> <s> in my experience of these matters the people who object and wish to make representations take great offence if it is suggested that what to one person may seem a minor matter is actually minor trivial or frivolous <e>", "<cs> with the committees permission perhaps i may clarify that point <e> <s> again i tend to sit on the fence a little <e> <s> i clearly do not believe in encouraging frivolous or trivial objections <e> <s> when i <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> as she knows i devote all my spare time to reading the draft licence documents and cannot wait for more to appear <e> <s> however perhaps i may ask her to clarify one part of her answer which i think i understood <e> <s> did she in fact say that the representations would be limited to the precise licence modifications that the director general is discussing and that it would not be this relates to earlier interventions an invitation to general representations on the behaviour of the licence holder <e>", "<cs> i fully understand that explanation for which i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise partly for clarification again <e> <s> am i right in believing that we are dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> my groupings say that we are but if so i did not hear the ministers reply to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i believe i heard the minister say that she would send the press release about the appointment to the noble lord lord peyton <e> <s> my second question is will she send me a copy of the press release <e> <s> i was aware of the appointment but i should like to know more of the details <e>", "<cs> if the minister will forgive me i intervened precisely to distinguish what happens in clause from what happens in clause <e> <s> when <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene yet again <e> <s> one is delighted to hear that the noble baroness will think about the amendment again <e> <s> i am bound to say that one reason why i hope that she will do so and why she might well consider following the line indicated by the noble lord lord peyton is that her examples have exactly the opposite effect in my mind to what she intended <e> <s> i find it inconceivable that a director appropriately appointed even one as committed to privatisation and biased as this particular person should not take those matters into account at all times <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness clarify something which convinces me that i do not understand the bill <e> <s> is she saying that the general powers that the secretary of state has under various acts of parliament as regards monopolies and mergers will not apply to this industry <e> <s> is she saying that the power of the secretary of state to refer a matter to the monopolies and mergers commission does not apply in the case of electricity <e> <s> in other words is that somehow written out of his powers in ways which i do not understand <e> <s> i had assumed that all this provision does is to leave the powers of the secretary of state where they are with respect to monopolies and mergers that includes this industry but to give further powers to the director <e> <s> that does not detract necessarily from what the noble lord lord peyton is saying <e> <s> am i right in saying that this bill does not take away the powers that the secretary of state for trade and industry has with respect to monopolies and mergers <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble baroness <e> <s> in all ways she is extremely helpful <e> <s> nonetheless i am not satisfied <e> <s> as i understand it section criteria will apply as and when competition issues arise <e> <s> in that sense my amendment may be unnecessary for that purpose <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls would be entirely wrong to support this amendment <e> <s> i accept on the basis of the noble baronesss explanation that the amendment is misplaced but it does not mean that the ideas underlying the amendment are mistaken <e> <s> i am simply giving notice that a different kind of amendment is required <e> <s> i should like to give an example <e> <s> i was unaware of the monopolies and mergers commissions work on chat lines <e> <s> i am a very imaginative person but i find it difficult to work out what expertise the monopolies and mergers commission has which would qualify it to advise the secretary of state on chat lines <e> <s> that is precisely my point <e> <s> we need a body that could advise the secretary of state on electricity matters in these areas <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the minister <e> <s> i was not seeking to denounce professor littlechild but as an economist myself i think that the noble baroness ought to accept that i know something about the writings of most of my colleagues <e> <s> i am unaware of the contributions that professor littlechild has made to the economics of the electricity industry that is the only point i am making or to any other aspect of the electricity industry <e> <s> so far as i understand he is perfectly qualified as an economist but that was not my point <e> <s> my point repeats that which i made in the earlier debate is he someone who knows anything about this industry <e> <s> i am fairly certain the answer is that he is not <e>", "<cs> before bringing this discussion to an end perhaps i may say that there is a difference of philosophy between us <e> <s> i do not wish to prolong the debate <e> <s> on the argument about lay people who are able to give judgments on any matter under the sun such power stems from our civil service which is largely unqualified and can justify its own existence only on the same basis <e>

<e>", "<cs> on that theme although we seem to have gone a little way from the amendment i assume that all conflicts of interest will simply not be allowed to occur <e> <s> i cannot imagine that professor littlechild or any other subsequent director will allow a conflict of interest to arise <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord williams and i have given notice that we shall be querying clause in the hope of having clarification of this most obscure clause <e> <s> the committee is still dealing with the general section of the bill headed modification of licences <e> <s> however in this area we are clearly within the ambit of the fair trading act and the competition act <e> <s> are we discussing competition matters but not other licence amendments <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> she has said in terms that the clause does not limit the competition legislation and that is the important answer which i am glad to hear it <e> <s> it is a technical question <e>

paragraph stating that the secretary of state must do so <e> <s> i note <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> although i am in danger of boring members of the committee may i ask whether reasonable includes comparison with what other suppliers are charging <e> <s> we created these local supply monopolies which were the area boards and they clearly do not compete with each

that there are several suppliers and that <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness touches on a classic matter of consumer protection <e> <s> if i were on her side which is speaking for the industry i should produce her arguments <e> <s> however i am on the consumers side and i do not accept those arguments at all <e> <s> you can always think of excuses as to why your high costs correspond to your problem rather than your inefficiency <e> <s> almost the only database that we shall have will be comparisons <e> <s> i am not saying that it will be an invalid reply to say we have bigger problems connecting you and therefore we have to charge you more <e> <s> i simply make the point that it is a relevant consideration to say i do not accept that it is expensive to make my connection <e> <s> i am arguing that you are inefficient compared with other area boards <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that there is any difference between us on this matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly because it may assist me not to move my own amendments in a moment <e> <s> i accept the noble baronesss point that most of us have no experience of this procedure because we do not request a supply <e> <s> we live in premises where the supply has already been installed as the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes pointed out <e> <s> there is no question that arises from our point of view because our interests begin on this side of the mains <e> <s> this point concerns those whose interests begin on the other side of the mains <e>", "<cs> what i have in mind is my role as dr frankenstein building a monster that requires a massive machine <e>", "<cs> before we conclude this issue i wonder whether there is one matter which could be clarified here <e>

friends <e> <s> i did not understand the noble lord lord sanderson to be accepting the amendment or expressing the slightest sympathy towards it <e> <s> i did not hear him say that he would take the amendment away and redraft it <e> <s> therefore i believe he is against the amendment <e> <s> i think that is rather unfortunate <e>", "<cs> i believe that that is an interesting point but i do not believe that it is quite devastating <e> <s> of course as a university teacher i am well aware of the different levels of understanding or not understanding <e> <s> i assume that we should have to have recourse to the notion of the average or within per cent <e> <s> of the average consumer or something of that nature <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply which i understand <e> <s> i am quite sympathetic to the point of view he takes <e> <s> it just seems to me and i leave this thought with members of the committee that if we are to have this new electricity bill which is a new departure for us altogether that where the opportunity arises we should take advantage of the new departure and not simply say that matters are all right now <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> however it is not i who require to have light shined on me it is the bill if the noble lord will forgive that slight quip <e> <s> i thank him very much for his answer <e> <s> the only point i would make on reasonableness is that after all we are discussing a bill where the economics are the essence <e> <s> in a way reasonableness is not known to economists other than in concepts like what is reasonable is what the market will bear <e> <s> unfortunately that is not reasonable as it would be thought of by some consumers <e> <s> in other words reasonable is not so simple a matter <e>", "<cs> i intervene in case i misunderstood the noble earl <e> <s> although this issue is concerned with safety and so forth the general ability of any customer to complain to the director about anything still holds <e> <s> in other words if the customer believes that the decision to supply is unreasonable he can still go through the complete set of procedures in connection with the director <e> <s> he can say although you have acted i still wish to complain to say that you have acted incorrectly and you must put it right again <e> <s> can the noble earl confirm that that side of the issue still holds <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the treasurys latest figures <e> <s> of course one possibility is that they are wrong <e> <s> however if we accept them does the noble lord have an explanation for the fact that we have an enormous balance of payments deficit including an even larger balance of trade deficit while the germans and japanese have a massive balance of payments surplus <e> <s> does the noble lord or the treasury have any explanation of how that is compatible with the alleged figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to return to my theme <e> <s> i am well aware that people in the treasury can do elementary arithmetic and no doubt the figures are as they stand <e> <s> however the fact remains that before the noble lord goes around trumpeting this success he must look at the whole picture and answer the question that i asked <e> <s> will he comment on the fact that the latest treasury figures show that our productivity has ceased to grow <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reflect again on his answer to the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e> <s> does he not agree that the telephone directory as we know it is obsolete and is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that in connection with the lingua scheme it has been reported that his right honourable friend the secretary of state has said that the european commission has no

research in psychiatry <e> <s> will he convey to his right honourable friend how disappointed we are to hear that the general practice research unit at the institute of psychiatry at the maudsley hospital is no longer to be supported by his department despite the enormous importance of its work <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene to ask the noble lord to clarify what he is saying <e> <s> i listened earlier to the noble lord lord orr-ewing making a similar point <e> <s> is he saying that the monopolies and mergers commission has failed to understand the act under which it has been set up to operate and which it has interpreted having considered everyone of the arguments that the noble lord has put because they are put in the report and rebutted <e> <s> is he saying that the monopolies and mergers commission does not understand its own legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i take part in this debate as an opposition spokesman on industry <e> <s> my noble friend lord williams of elvel did the same and as i understand it the noble lord lord young is still the secretary of state for industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to return on other grounds to the remarks of my old friend the noble lord lord harris and i shall do so in a moment <e> <s> however i think that the evidence is overwhelming <e> <s> we are not discussing a minor rise in the real price of beer bitter in this case <e> <s> i see that the noble earl wants to intervene <e> <s> perhaps i may just finish this sentence <e> <s> we are discussing a major price rise which could not possibly be accounted for by what has allegedly happened on amenities <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the noble earl is perfectly within his rights to say what he regards as unreasonable <e> <s> perhaps i may remind him that we should be looking at the same table <e> <s> the table to which i refer is the one that takes out the vat element <e> <s> there may be a further element for vat <e> <s> however this table is net of the vat element <e> <s> in my old treasury days the exchequer was most obliged to the industry for generating a degree of revenue <e> <s> of that there is no doubt <e> <s> i do not think that the ending of a monopoly here would diminish that revenue <e>", "<cs> i had not realised that the noble baroness was to make a mini-second reading speech on non-fossil fuels <e> <s> nevertheless that does not detract from the interest of what she had to say <e> <s> with permission i shall respond to some of what she said but save some of my remarks on the points that she raised for the specific amendments which deal with those matters <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness for a minute <e> <s> i should like a little elucidation <e> <s> if it is a question of past costs then why does not the most fundamental principle of economics apply namely that bygones are bygones <e> <s> those are sunk costs <e> <s> why do the government not just write them off <e> <s> it seems to me to be very odd that a nuclear quota is needed in order to deal with past costs <e> <s> that is my first question to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness continues perhaps i may bring up again the question that was asked by the noble lord lord nelson <e> <s> he put it in much clearer terms than i did but nonetheless it concerns the same point and it is fundamental <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness can clarify the matter <e> <s> the french may well have vast amounts of spare nuclear capacity and as i understand it the supply companies will be free to buy electricity wherever they want <e> <s> i take it that ours will not be an industry which will be told specifically by the secretary of state to buy british and not french <e> <s> i believe that that is against community law anyway <e> <s> it is at least possible that the nuclear industry does not have the very large degree of protection in terms of nuclear <e>", "<cs> my true hope is that with british science and technology what my noble friend says will turn out to be true <e> <s> i believe that the amendments are sensible but i have a few questions to ask <e> <s> i always have one obvious comment <e> <s> i hope that because the governments thinking is not so divergent from ours we can look forward to the noble baroness accepting some of our amendments today <e>", "<cs> we are certainly sympathetic to these amendments <e> <s> it might help the committee if i cover two or three points first and get them over and done with in one go <e> <s> i believe that for once the intervention of the noble lord lord renton is less cogent than usual because to anticipate what the noble lord lord ezra may say his amendment with respect to non-fossil fuels refers to generating capacity and not to generating output <e> <s> even though we know that the wind does not blow every day we can still with what little we know about the science and technology of a windmill determine its capacity <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness for a moment <e> <s> she has put her finger on the nub of the matter and i believe this is the right time to clear it up <e> <s> i do not see how competition between electricity suppliers in any way leads to energy efficient programmes but quite the contrary <e> <s> the companies are in the business of selling electricity and that is what they are competing to do <e> <s> except on pr grounds and we certainly cannot rely on those why should they promote energy efficiency <e> <s> that is the first question <e> <s> the second question is this is the noble baroness saying therefore that energy efficiency will have to lie with the individual firm and household taking its own private and atomistic decision <e> <s> i believe that that is what the minister is saying <e> <s> therefore she is saying that there is no national interest in energy efficiency <e> <s> that is the worrying thing namely that she does not see any overall interest in energy efficiency other than those decisions taken by private firms and individuals <e> <s> it seems to me that she has said this before but i was hoping that the government would see that there is an energy efficiency interest here over and beyond that <e> <s> that is where she has rather lost me and that is why some of our little debates have not led to any meeting of minds <e> <s> it may well be that this is something she does not wish to pursue on this amendment but if it will help her that is what we are about <e> <s> we are saying that we do not see that it is in the interests of the supplier to promote energy efficiency and we do not see how it can be left to the demander <e> <s> that makes the position as clear as i can <e>", "<cs> i wish to join the debate especially as one of my amendments is allegedly being debated <e> <s> the amendment that the noble lord lord williams and i have tabled is intended to show that we are being our usual helpful selves to the government in attempting to improve the clause <e> <s> the words that we wish to leave out seem to us to add nothing whatever to the bill unless one were to add the words in such circumstances and to such extent as <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness permit me to intervene <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble earl lord lauderdale is right <e> <s> essentially if the supplying companies have to meet a non-fossil fuel quota as they do under the bill they will certainly want to meet it at least at cost <e> <s> the fact that the french supply counts against that cost and that the french supply is provided at marginal cost which so far as i can see because bygones are bygones the french can do without infringing the treaty of rome means that the companies will buy as much as they can from the french industry at marginal cost <e> <s> it seems to me that that is exactly the point which the noble earl made <e> <s> this arrangement is particularly beneficial to anyone who can supply at least marginal cost <e> <s> it is a help to them <e> <s> i do not say that it should not be allowed to happen but it is peculiar that it comes within the quota <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her extremely clear exposition <e> <s> she has of course made it very clear that it is a matter of protecting the nuclear industry <e> <s> we are back on that track <e> <s> the argument is not about non-fossil fuels because our amendment puts all the fuels on a par <e> <s> nonetheless the noble baroness makes it clear and i do not say that she is mistaken that we do not have a level playing field but one on which the bias lies toward the nuclear industry <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> it is possible that i simply do not understand <e> <s> i could read this paragraph meaning one of two things <e> <s> the director may say to the secretary of state i am proposing to make some regulations <e> <s> is that all right <e> <s> which is what i assumed it meant when it says that he may with the consent of the secretary of state make regulations <e> <s> the secretary of state may then agree that the director may make some regulations <e> <s> but the alternative interpretation which i cannot find in the text but did get from the noble lords reply is that the director says to the secretary of state i shall make these particular regulations <e> <s> are these okay <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as he knows there is no one less expert in interpreting legislation in this chamber than i am <e> <s> clearly what he says makes sense and is what the clause ought to say <e> <s> if he will let me know in due course that his lawyers and draftsmen state clearly without doubt and without further ado that that is what the clause means then there is nothing between us on that matter <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> i believe that i now understand some parts of this clause <e> <s> i take his point on the secretary of state and i do not need to press that matter <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i suppose that the noble earls experience and my experience of society are slightly different <e> <s> these are people who do not easily go to anything <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> the problem is that they need rather more direct help <e> <s> i know there may be differences of philosophy between this government and us these days and we are regarded as slightly old-fashioned in our view that we wish to get a bit of protection for people <e> <s> but the noble earl says he or i might do things if we were in that position because we are capable people <e> <s> i have a different image in mind of people who are in more considerable difficulty <e> <s> but i do not seem to get anywhere in persuading the noble earl even to say that he will think about it <e> <s> i will give him one last chance to say i will think about it and then i will give up <e>", "<cs> that at least is something indeed in view of the answers which the noble earl was giving i did not think that he was taking the matter away with commitment <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> he partly gave me the answer that i did not want namely that we must leave matters to the consumers committees <e> <s> i am anxious to give them as much freedom as they can possibly manage but i think that this is a case where they should not have freedom <e> <s> since i understood the noble lord to say that the government were thinking through the whole area of what the committees should be set up to do it would be foolish on my part to press him while the government are still thinking about the matter <e> <s> he has at least heard what i have said <e> <s> i wait to hear the governments thinking as that seems to me to be the most appropriate thing to do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble viscount will allow me also to add a note of scepticism concerning his answer <e> <s> is he aware that almost every i am tempted to say every librarian in this country would reject the answers that he has just given <e> <s> all are under the impression that they are making real cuts in their expenditure on books and periodicals <e> <s> did i hear the minister correctly <e> <s> did he say that one reason why the government do not fully finance the expenditure on libraries is that they believe that if they were to do so it would add to the pressure to raise the price of books <e> <s> was that part of the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble viscount with respect to ensure that he writes to me about this matter <e> <s> from my limited knowledge of economics and what determines prices i find it almost unbelievable that financing university libraries would be a cause of book price inflation <e> <s> has the minister any more information in his current briefing that might shed light on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement which i am sure all noble lords found most interesting <e> <s> before asking him a number of questions perhaps i may say that i am not proposing at this moment to debate the loan scheme <e>", "<cs> these are very technical matters <e> <s> they are also quite fundamental to the electricity industry and we are indebted to the noble lord lord peyton for raising them <e> <s> needless to say i do not entirely agree with everything the noble lord has said on this matter in particular when he considers as he did at the outset the alternative possibilities for the national grid <e> <s> the one possibility of retaining the ownership of the national grid company in the public sector seems to me obviously to be the right thing to do just as to the noble lord it is obviously not the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord puts me in some difficulty because i simply have to tell him that he is mistaken <e> <s> there is no other correct way of solving a problem of this kind other than on the basis of marginal cost <e> <s> one also has to consider the investment side the capital costs and the relevant discount rate <e> <s> in addition one has to make allowances for risk <e> <s> however i must tell the noble lord that cost in this case means marginal cost <e> <s> there is no other correct way of doing it <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness ought at least to grant me the slight knowledge that the whole point of the merit order is that demand fluctuates <e> <s> if demand did not fluctuate there would not be a merit order problem <e> <s> she ought to realise that i am aware of that if little else <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i hope that she will bear with me a little longer if i ask her for clarification on one or two specific points so that we can understand this <e> <s> perhaps i may start with the most obvious point <e> <s> let us assume that after a while as a result of the buying and selling of shares someone or some company owns two or three and possibly even adjacent suppliers or area boards <e> <s> that would certainly raise very serious competition issues <e> <s> do i understand from the noble baroness that the government do not deem it appropriate that special shares should have been in existence to prevent that happening and that the government would instead rely on the fair trading act as a way of dealing with such an obvious move in the direction of monopoly and away from competition <e> <s> that is one question on which i should welcome clarification from the noble baroness although she has probably answered that to some extent when she mentioned the fair trading act <e>", "<cs> at this time of night i certainly shall not fall into the trap of discussing the philosophy of timeless versus everlasting <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for her excellent and interesting answer and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i partly had in mind and this appears in clause that it is recognised that the treasury could end up beyond the target by sheer chance and i shall come on to that in a moment <e> <s> however from what the noble baroness said i take it that the treasury would not feel obliged in those circumstances to make a bid for the company because it never intended that to happen and that therefore in the ordinary sense the takeover code would not apply <e> <s> subject to that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe it is very unfair of the noble lord lord renton to raise this extremely fascinating subject of treasury control <e> <s> much as i would wish to occupy a good deal of the remaining part of this evening dealing with that subject i shall refrain from doing so <e> <s> that is not because i am not interested or that i feel what he said is unimportant <e>

her answer to my noble friend lord williams of elvel <e> <s> will it be within the remit of the public inquiry that it would be able to report that the sizewell c reactor should not be built <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a problem in taking part in this important debate introduced so excellently by my noble friend lady turner of camden <e> <s> my problem is that this is a subject on which i have views <e> <s> i am well aware that there is nothing more dangerous than taking part in a debate in which one has views <e> <s> one of my views is that i take strong exception although i know the spirit in which the remark was made to describing this as a womens debate <e> <s> i see it as no more a womens debate than i see the electricity bill in which the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes and i take part day in and day out as a mens debate <e>", "<cs> no my lords my point was not to do with talking <e> <s> i assume that the older one gets the more one has the right to complain about the young <e> <s> my point was to do rather more with acting <e> <s> the remark concerned the phrase unfit to govern <e> <s> but i go further than that in referring to the remarks of the noble earl lord russell because nothing would be more disastrous than to allow elderly professors to stay on even longer <e> <s> i should regard the idea of introducing flexible retirement for professors as catastrophic <e> <s> however those are the only slightly acerbic remarks that i intend to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> when i was a junior economist in the treasury i was also a young father and i should have liked my children near moaning away during the course of the day <e> <s> the treasury creche at least shows that the treasury is a first-class employer <e> <s> indeed i should like to hear more on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be quite typical for the department of health not to have a crche <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister remember that in the last time that his party left this country in a mess the labour government were given a balance of payments deficit of billion to deal with <e> <s> the deficit is now billion <e> <s> can he tell us the approximate size of deficit that in a year or two he will be asking the next labour government to clear up <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall that i asked the same question two years ago and obtained an answer concerned with photographs <e> <s> has he recently looked at his own passport photograph <e> <s> is he under the impression that it bears any resemblance whatever to himself <e> <s> is not the question raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter perfectly serious <e> <s> why can we not have permanent adult passports as we have driving licences <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene here for just a moment <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble baroness is aware of this but she is in fact implicitly supporting the point which i made namely that one of the things at which one looks askance is this mutually destructive advertising by the different energy industries often built around the minor neuroses they have such as the use of the word power <e> <s> however i am not certain that that is enormously helpful to her case in her endeavour to support advertising <e>", "<cs> this has been a useful discussion not least in clarifying the spelling of the word flotation <e> <s> whatever else may have been my experience this morning my education has been improved <e> <s> i am interested to note that the water bill has kept to one spelling throughout whereas with electricity we have gone in for various spellings <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply particularly the comment that the sums of money involved are expected to be fairly small <e> <s> with that additional clarification i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister but i find his answer to be quite amazing <e> <s> i am amazed that he was even willing to read it out <e> <s> if he reads the clause carefully he will see that as set out up to that point it contains nothing to prevent grants being made as appropriate <e> <s> i agree that we need transitional arrangements that they need to be as small as possible and that they need to fit the circumstances <e> <s> however i find it extraordinary that anyone can read the clause without the last two sentences and take it to mean that everyone must receive the same transitional amount <e> <s> without the last two sentences the clause means exactly the same and therefore they are irrelevant

was interested in the use of the words of course <e> <s> i should like to believe that <e> <s> it seems to me to be up to her and to her right honourable friend the secretary of state to make sure that the of course is of course <e> <s> what she said was helpful <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> however i apologise because i have one other question that i forgot to ask for the record just as a matter of history <e> <s> does she know whether the fund has ever been used <e> <s> did it ever serve any purpose other than a psychological one <e> <s> that is just to complete the record <e> <s> i do not need an answer at this moment <e> <s> did i also understand her to say that the agreement referred to in subsection a of the clause in a sense is already agreed <e> <s> we are about to pass into law the need to agree but i thought the noble baroness said that they already have agreed essentially to get back what they put in plus interest <e> <s> i thought she said that that is what will happen <e> <s> so in a sense my concern and in a curious way her concern are both irrelevant <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will confirm that too <e>", "<cs> on the implicit assumption that at some point i shall be told briefly about the history of the fund i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i could rise to the bait and begin a fractious argument about members of parliament being directors of newly privatised companies <e> <s> however i do not believe that members of the committee would welcome that exercise in the middle of friday afternoon <e> <s> i should like to go on record as saying that i could put forward a good case for saying that it would be slightly inappropriate for members of parliament to be directors of privatised companies at least in the early days <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend lord williams would join me in that <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble earl was slightly taunting me and i refuse to be drawn on the issue <e> <s> i have made the appropriate point and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> as i read it this amendment would enable the secretary of state to make grants to this end <e> <s> the amendment certainly does not say that all such lines should be placed underground merely that grants should be available <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness and other members of the committee who have joined in the discussion on this amendment <e> <s> i do not apologise for raising one or two of the general issues partly because i did not take part in last weeks debate i am sure the chamber always wishes to hear me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful that the noble lord asked that question <e> <s> to put it in the most commonsense terms let us assume that i make a bid for a nuclear power station and i am the lucky winner of this great asset which i assume has a

respect to what i have to do to run my nuclear power station in a <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> all i can say this rather follows what the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil said in regard to the earlier amendment is that the more i listen to the discussion the more bizarre the privatisation <e>", "<cs> i thank both the noble lord for his intervention and the noble earl for his answer <e> <s> i am well aware of the earlier clauses and i hope that i am not confused between them and this <e> <s> my problem is statistical if i can put it that way <e> <s> i have a feeling that the noble earls department thinks that the word means something in this context <e> <s> i am certain that it does not <e> <s> in other words if the word statistical were left out it would not make any difference <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> it half reassures me <e> <s> i entirely agree that the purpose of the clause is correct <e> <s> is there any chance that she can give me an example of the kind of exemption she has in mind <e> <s> it seems to me that as people begin to contemplate the reality of privatisation two aspects are dawning on them <e> <s> one is that there may be a good deal less competition than was hoped for <e> <s> that is quite clear <e> <s> the other is that different parts of the industry may engage in anti-competitive or unfair behaviour <e> <s> there was quite a good example in the <e>", "<cs> yes that is enormously helpful <e> <s> the point that the noble baroness is making is that at certain times there will be co-operative activities on the part of individual enterprises which <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive my intervention because i know that this has gone on for a little longer than perhaps some noble lords may wish but it is a very important matter <e> <s> his right honourable friend the prime minister used the words <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that there is no adequate substitute for books in education has the noble viscount seen the excellent volumes called <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but perhaps she should reflect on <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords who have intervened both for and against the amendment as well as the noble baroness <e> <s> clearly the amendment has been put down in order to obtain some enlightenment and some simplicity <e> <s> however i have not received quite the enlightenment that i wanted <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness even though she may not be able to answer me at this precise moment if this phrase were not in the bill does she imply that the director general and his office would not be subject to treasury control <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i know how busy the government are but if it were possible for them to write to me giving a definitive statement as a lifetime student of treasury control i

forward <e> <s> i accept those arguments <e> <s> however as a last point i wish to ask the minister when he replies to deal with the intervention of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes which i found a little troublesome <e> <s> her view was that if the secretary of state made these appointments they would be political ones <e> <s> the government have usually been at pains when we on this side of the house have occasionally suggested that the government act politically in these matters to point out that they simply appoint the best people for the job <e> <s> i hope that whatever the noble lord feels he will not accept the argument that the secretary of state cannot appoint the consumers committees because he cannot be trusted not to appoint political people <e> <s> it seems to me that the key argument here is the one that my noble friend lord howie of troon made other speakers also made this argument that what is required here is a modicum of independence in appointing the best people <e> <s> i believe the secretary of state is the right person to do that job <e>", "<cs> my lords although the two amendments are grouped together they are only slightly incompatible <e> <s> their theme is not exactly the same but they are related <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment of the noble lord lord peyton proposes that the industry expertise should be vested in the director themself rather than in the consumer committee <e> <s> i understand the argument and it is one to which i subscribe to some degree <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> refers to the appointment of other persons with interests in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> she is right to find the wording ambiguous <e> <s> i fully accept her comment in that respect <e> <s> i tried to make it unambiguous by explaining what i meant which is to some extent what the noble lords lord renton and lord ezra have said that the amendment means <e>", "<cs> my lords having introduced the amendment perhaps i may thank the minister for his reply which is extremely interesting <e> <s> with regard to treasury control i place on record because it is of interest to note that the remuneration referred to here in all its forms will be fully charged to the consumer and will not be public expenditure in the form in which i think that would be correctly defined <e> <s> at least that point is worth considering since we understand that it is the intention for the cost of consumer committees to be recovered from licence holders through licence fees <e> <s> it is by no means clear that it is public expenditure <e> <s> the minister may wish to reflect on those words <e> <s> i am not saying that it makes his remarks on treasury control erroneous but as a matter of interest i think that it is not public expenditure <e> <s> having said that and having thanked the minister for a very clear and informative answer i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> i missed her opening sentence <e> <s> however i heard the rest of what she had to say <e> <s> i have a few questions to add to those of my noble friend lord williams of elvel unless they were dealt with in the opening remarks of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl <e> <s> i am not a little disappointed at his reply <e> <s> i am perfectly well aware of what appears in other parts of the bill <e> <s> my intention was to follow in the spirit of what i thought we were doing in respect of this part of the bill in relation to the general duties of the secretary of state and the director <e> <s> later in the bill that is spelt out in more detail <e> <s> it was my judgment and still is that since we were adding the duty to promote research to specify the general duty with regard to standards of performance at this point would make matters clearer and more reassuring <e> <s> this section of the bill seemed a suitable place to put it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall intervene briefly in this matter <e> <s> it seems to me that on more than one occasion the noble lord lord ezra has made an overwhelming case for taking much more seriously than we have done the general activity called combined heat and power <e> <s> certainly as a result of listening to the noble lord and doing a certain amount of reading i who started on the bill both rather ignorant about chp and thinking that it was something rather far out am now convinced that this is one of the matter of the greatest importance for the electricity industry <e> <s> it does not solve all our problems but clearly in so far as we are strongly committed to efficiency and equally are all trying to take due account of environmental problems and other such matters this is at least something that needs promotion <e> <s> i suppose the relevant word is promotion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his answer and the uncovenanted extra answer about exemptions <e> <s> i found that particularly interesting and helpful <e> <s> of course i wanted the noble earl to be on record as saying what he has just said <e> <s> i am indebted to him for saying what he thinks the clause means <e> <s> i am still rather puzzled that clause a does not get into difficulties in terms of overseas purchase but i must accept that if that is his advice which he has now given me then that is so <e> <s> it does not read like that to me but i am glad that he had made this statement <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for his additional remarks on how the government propose to use the exemptions which had puzzled me <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her answer to the first part of my amendment <e> <s> with due respect to the noble lord lord renton its meaning is perfectly obvious <e> <s> it means what i said that the normal planning procedures will apply <e> <s> the noble baroness has said that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no difference between us on that matter <e> <s> however in a bill as complicated as this there is no harm in obtaining reassurance from the government that that is still the case <e> <s> i say to my noble friend lord howie of troon with whom i have rarely if ever disagreed that i was not happy with what he said <e> <s> i regard myself to be at least as much as a technocrat as any member of your lordships house <e> <s> as regards major planning issues i certainly believe that the community both in the small and the large has the right to make its views felt <e> <s> in dealing with the big battalions of technocrats like me it also has the right to receive such assistance as it can so that its views can be put forward <e> <s> i hate to disagree with my noble friend but i did not care for what i thought he said so he is about to say some more <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with that either <e> <s> okay i have made my point and so much for that <e> <s> my real concern is with the second part of the ministers answer <e> <s> i feared that she would give that answer and i was sorry to hear it <e> <s> she is almost certainly right that it follows inevitably and logically from this clause that the kind of considerations of the commitment to the non-fossil fuel quota must weigh in the balance in a public inquiry <e> <s> therefore it could happen that a power station which was regarded as being most unsatisfactory on environmental and community grounds and might even be unsatisfactory on normal cost benefit grounds would nonetheless have weighed in its favour the argument that there is a commitment to non-fossil fuel sources in this case nuclear <e> <s> the noble baroness said that it could weight in the balance and would not be decisive on its own <e> <s> i am glad that she said that because that is my reading of what the bill must state <e> <s> my view is that it is not a satisfactory state of affairs <e> <s> in a sense i have discovered what i wanted to discover and i have said what i wanted to say <e> <s> i am now perfectly happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her clarification of the amendments <e> <s> as i understand it it will remain the case that fossil fuel levy will be borne entirely by the customers of the electricity industry <e> <s> therefore there is no change of substance there <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> i assure him that nothing i have said should be interpreted to mean that i am opposed to what we find in clause <e> <s> i feel strongly that we must have a clause by which the secretary of state can take such matters as the national interest fully into account and act accordingly <e> <s> i take his other point that this would not be a secret <e> <s> it would be fairly obvious that demands would be made for copies of such orders <e> <s> i am grateful for the noble lords sympathetic response and for his willingness to look at the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is kind of the minister to give such a clear and cogent example <e> <s> i still believe that logically what is in subsections and could be construed to be covered by subsection and so in drafting terms i believe that i am still right <e> <s> having said that i entirely accept what the minister said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords again i than the minister for enlightening me on what this complex schedule means <e> <s> he is right that the worry my noble friend and i have will be dealt with by later clauses <e> <s> i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too certainly wish to congratulate the noble baroness on bringing in these most welcome amendments <e> <s> i think she has gone a considerable way to meet the concerns of those in your lordships house who have worried about these matters <e> <s> i refer not only to noble lords but also to interested people outside <e> <s> therefore i hope the noble baroness will not think me churlish if i add one or two critical remarks and also at least speak to my own amendment and say why i still think it is a good amendment <e> <s> however i do not wish the noble baroness to misunderstand my remarks <e> <s> i think she has done a great deal as regards moving in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some trepidation that i join this debate <e> <s> i had better ensure that we are talking about amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i have no problem with amendment no <e> <s> i believe that amendment no <e> <s> is intended to take us on with combined heat and power and is meant to be the governments response to pleas in that direction <e> <s> i hope that i am right in that assumption <e> <s> the only minor matter between us concerns amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> my name is not attached to <e>", "<cs> my lords again i rise with slight trepidation in support of this amendment <e> <s> if the government do not accept it i hope that this is an occasion when a little exercise through the division lobbies might be appropriate <e> <s> however that is a matter for the noble lord lord peyton <e> <s> ending the relevant sentence at the point where the noble lord lord peyton wishes it to be ended is to raise the question for what other reason would the director wish to collect this information <e> <s> in other words the noble lord lord peyton is entirely right <e> <s> the sentence can stop exactly where he wants it to because that is obviously i underline the word obviously where the sentence should stop <e> <s> i make that point of agreement with him and hope very much that the government will see the point of what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak to this amendment i am of course aware of the position in the consumer world of the noble baroness lady oppenheim-barnes <e> <s> indeed she has vast experience in this area and i think therefore that noble lords would do well to listen carefully to the advice which she is offering <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> the fact that the government will improve on the wording is even more pleasant for me to hear <e> <s> therefore for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i am most encouraged by his remarks in relation to health and safety <e> <s> i am pleased to hear what he had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should normally wish to support the noble lord lord peyton on an amendment of this kind <e> <s> however i must follow the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i have always assumed that paragraphs of this kind were written into the bill as a kind of outdoor relief for the legal profession <e> <s> although to the rest of us this does not seem to mean anything and seems to be gobbledygook i thought that that was how the legal profession earned its living <e> <s> given the pressures the profession is under from other quarters one is loath to suggest anything that might lower their standard of living at this time <e> <s> therefore although my natural inclination is to support the noble lord lord peyton i believe that these clauses are included <e>", "<cs> my lords when considering our amendments the noble baroness often says that she is interested to know what our amendment might have meant <e> <s> i am bound to say that i had not the faintest idea what this amendment meant when i read it <e> <s> i am still having great difficulty in discovering what it contributes to the question of transfer <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for explaining or rather restating the amendment <e> <s> as i spend a great deal of my time trying to understand the noble earl and to be educated perhaps he will tell me why the new wording is better than the old wording <e> <s> is some meaning to be attached to it in terms of the future of

we should leave out those words <e> <s> as the education spokesman for these benches i hate to <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house although we do not wish to continue this discussion perhaps i may say that i entirely agree with the noble earl <e> <s> it is purely a matter of the wording <e> <s> i still insist that my wording is correct <e> <s> it may well be that in due course the noble earl would like to consider the matter with his noble friend <e> <s> i do not press the point <e> <s> having had what i think is an extremely interesting interchange of views i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords since i am as it were the residual spokesman on this matter at the present time and i am not a scot perhaps i may ask for one word of reassurance from the noble earl namely that this is simply a technical amendment and which reveals my ignorance that there is absolutely nothing in this amendment to which any scot in particular would object <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> no one ever tells me anything <e> <s> given what she has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her account of the amendment <e> <s> noble lords on this side of your lordships house are troubled <e> <s> whatever happens one will have to look carefully at the record to see what she said <e> <s> i shall express our concerns <e> <s> our first anxiety relates to pre-payment for expenses that have yet to be incurred <e> <s> that pre-payment may mean one of two things <e> <s> it can mean an assurance if you incur these expenses and you convince us that you had to incur them and that they are as low as they should be and various other points to deal with treasury control then the government will seriously consider paying those expenses <e> <s> it is pre-payment in the sense of commitment <e> <s> i am not clear whether the amendments do not go further than that and say we agree to pay those sums of money now ahead of what you do <e> <s> we need some clarification of what is meant <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i should like to elucidate the matter <e> <s> the control of public expenditure must clearly still lie with parliament notably the other place <e> <s> parliament must therefore be in a position to say we shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his answer <e> <s> i agree with him entirely that this is a matter of balance between the needs of the public the needs of the secretary of state and the costs that are placed on companies when they have to provide information <e> <s> we are trying to ensure that that balance will be correctly struck <e> <s> we hope accepting how powerfully industries can lobby and how difficult it is for the public to lobby that the secretary of state will recognise his responsibilities in this matter as i am sure he will <e> <s> the noble earl has emphasised that point of balance <e> <s> i am therefore perfectly happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the minister says firm monetary policy is the only way to get on top of inflation why are the government making such a song and dance about wage settlements at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness clarify one aspect of these inquiries in relation to the bill going through your lordships house <e> <s> will the representations being made about these power <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the question of complacency does the minister intend noble lords to believe that there is no short-term financing of the deficit <e> <s> surely a large amount of the inward capital flow is short-term financing at an interest rate of per cent <e> <s> is it not the case that if we run a deficit we must eventually run surpluses to repay our debts <e> <s> there is no way around the fact that in due course we must run a balance of payments surplus there is no sign that we shall do so in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the secretary of states answer to his noble friend with which i am much in sympathy will he confirm that this is a superb report by the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> will he also confirm that in the past a report of this quality has never been criticised in the way just suggested <e> <s> will he also take an early opportunity perhaps at this very moment to issue a statement of support for the excellent work of the commission in the hope that it will continue to do such excellent work even though occasionally it embarrasses others who may be quite friendly to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to this amendment i suppose that the noble earl lord lauderdale is right in his view that we are all green now <e> <s> i regret to say that i think i still remain a rather pale shade of pink <e> <s> however that is by the way <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord ezra the noble earl lord lauderdale or my noble friend lord williams of elvel need apologise for bringing the matter back to your lordships <e> <s> this is a minor matter but it is also a serious one <e>", "<cs> my lords we fully accept the fact that the amendment is technical <e> <s> my slight difficulty which does not need to delay the house concerns the concept of leviable electricity <e> <s> i think that i understand what the noble baroness said leviable electricity is either generated by a fossil fuel generating station or by a non-fossil fuel generating station in pursuance of qualifying arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord has given an extremely good example of the nature of the problem <e> <s> however it is still not obvious to me that the secretary of state could get away with doing that <e> <s> i do not see how it could be kept secret that he was acting in that way and i do not see then how he could persuade the other place that for that kind of reason he will not let the other place know the directive <e> <s> i am with the noble lord as regards his concern about the problem <e> <s> my concern is whether this clause in any meaningful sense gives the solution to the secretary of state <e> <s> i believe that the examples given were absolutely excellent but that does not solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me a very evenly balanced argument <e> <s> i am slightly at a loss as to what to do <e> <s> i believe that my own view is correct <e> <s> on the other hand the ministers view is not so different and so incorrect and therefore it would be rather bad manners to press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for the amendment about which we are extremely happy and for his further words <e> <s> i am sure that in due course my noble friend lord williams will have some flattering words to say to the government front bench <e> <s> as i shall not have an opportunity to do that perhaps i may echo the words of the noble earl and say what great personal pleasure i have had in discussing this bill and in particular in listening to the arguments from the front bench even though on occasions as the noble earl is well aware one has had to say that one is not persuaded <e> <s> however i thank the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit that i am absolutely staggered <e> <s> i thought this was an innocent little amendment but it seems to be producing an extraordinarily complex debate <e> <s> i simply do not understand what the minister is on about <e>

matters which i assume would be the private business part of the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords surely one possible piece of evidence is that the two occur at the same time so they go hand in hand <e> <s> bearing in mind the figures which the noble viscount has given about the general decline in the number of young people receiving school meals and which seems deplorable do the government agree with the old-fashioned view that if all children took school dinners the communal spirit of the school would be improved and it would be good for education <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the draft social charter is a typical and classic example of the doctrines of european christian democrats <e> <s> until recently we thought that they were also the doctrines of the noble lords party <e> <s> what puzzles us and we ask him to explain it is why the government are so antipathetic to a point of view which we thought was typically their own <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question asked by the noble lord lord beloff would the noble lord care to comment on the paradoxical position that so far as one can see from the figures given the other day the expenditure being laid out for bed and breakfast accommodation for the homeless appears to be so large that it would be a good idea to draw the attention of the universities to the potential sums available <e> <s> they are obliged to earn as much money as possible <e> <s> it appears from the figures that the last thing they should do is to provide accommodation for students <e> <s> the way to make money is to provide accommodation for the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may help the noble lord perhaps he will be willing to tell his noble friend that the universities in this country do precisely what she says <e> <s> it is an extremely good value for money operation which one is happy to advertise at this moment in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking from the opposition front bench on this perhaps i too may emphasise that this is not a party matter and that i do not intend to make any party points <e> <s> to use the phrase of the noble lord lord beloff we are discussing here a genuine and acceptable difference of view <e> <s> i am on the other side of the debate <e> <s> i do not think that these teachers are correct in their view of history but i disagree with many people on many different matters including my own subject <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i am just extremely ratty on a hot friday afternoon but this will not do <e> <s> noble lords have raised this as a specific issue <e> <s> to be fobbed off by being told that we can write to the secretary of state is quite unacceptable <e> <s> i have done my job i have said what i want to happen <e> <s> i want the noble lord either to tell me what he will do or to tell me that he will go to his right honourable friend the secretary of state and tell him what i and other noble lords have said he should do <e> <s> we cannot go on with this briefing which with no disrespect to the noble lord himself i find most unattractive and quite unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should preface my short pungent question by saying how sad i am to hear the rumour that the secretary of state may not be answering any more questions from the dispatch box <e> <s> i turn now to my question <e> <s> is it not intriguing and astonishing that despite extraordinarily high interests rates and they are very high for consumers but consumers are not being misled about them indeed the rates are perfectly clear consumers still continue to borrow <e> <s> do the government have any explanation as to why they continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her important and interesting statement <e> <s> what the government are proposing appears to be a half-way house between what they originally proposed which was entirely to privatise all generation including nuclear generation and the suggestion that was made when your lordships were discussing the electricity mi when many noble lords on all sides of the house thought that the whole thing would be infinitely easier if the government kept the whole of nuclear power in the public sector at least for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recall that on friday last she appeared to say that expenditure on agricultural research and development was not investment <e> <s> has she had a chance to reflect upon the view which she seemed to state at that time <e> <s> further does she now recognise that expenditure on agricultural research and development is investment and that any cuts therein would be extremely damaging to the future of our agricultural sector <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for those of us who helped to insert the new clause in the bill i am bound to say that we are rather sad that the government have decided that they are unable to accept it <e> <s> they are making a serious mistake particularly if they have the interests of the nuclear industry and nuclear generation at heart <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to throw any cold water on all of this will the noble lord tell us whether his department has undertaken any studies of the effectiveness of this service and in particular in relation to the question of the noble viscount whether the department is proposing to monitor the service in its new form to see whether it does any good at all <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who still teaches at london university i certainly do not wish to say anything which would be of disadvantage to london university students <e> <s> however would the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that his comments on the polytechnics are a little puzzling given that his department reported last week that up to a fifth of teaching in the countrys polytechnics is substandard <e> <s> that is precisely what his department reported <e> <s> is he saying that that has no connection whatever with financing <e> <s> on the question of universities it is true that those of us who teach in universities are responsible for maintaining standards <e> <s> the point being put to the government since they provide most of the funding is whether they will take into account the need to maintain standards in determining the funding that they make available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i fully understood the noble earls general answer <e> <s> we all agree with him that long-term saving is to be encouraged <e> <s> however it is not obvious to me why the government do not offer a premium on the reinvestment of national savings so long as the reinvestment is for the longer term <e> <s> i took the drift of the question to be precisely that point <e> <s> does he not agree that the government should be encouraging reinvestment of those certificates for very long periods of time which would certainly help the economy at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not understand the ministers answer <e> <s> can he tell the house simply how much prices have risen for the typical business and household users <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to be a nuisance but i do not believe that the question has yet been answered <e> <s> it was what has been the average price change and how much extra does it cost in ordinary everyday money <e> <s> it cannot be a difficult question because real terms means the actual increase minus the increase in inflation <e> <s> i do not believe that the answer will be embarrassing to the government and i wonder what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister to clarify what i believe he said to his noble friend lord ashbourne first that the government support schools outreach and believe that it is a good organisation and secondly to the extent that schools outreach can raise some funding on its own the government will be open to persuasion up to a point to match that funding <e> <s> is that the message that the ministers department is seeking to get over <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i appologise to him for intervening in an area which is not normally my own it does not seem to me that the control of public expenditure which is what he referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords it was my belief that the noble lord had not completed his remarks <e> <s> i was using the device of intervening before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> however i should not use it if it were remotely against standing orders <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assumption that it is not i was inquiring whether the noble lord the minister really is trying to argue that the public expenditure control criterion is central to this matter <e> <s> i do not believe that the mover of the amendment had any intention of getting into quite so complicated or deep a field <e>", "<cs> my lords since the point of local management of schools is to give each school a budget and let them get on with the job of allocating it can the noble viscount reassure the house that whatever solution the department finds to deal with the many anomalies that are clearly arising that solution will not involve detailed des interference with the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for the last part of his answer which overrode what he said earlier about seeking the further views of interested parties <e> <s> the report is outstanding and i hope that he will convey to the law commission the views of i assume most noble lords that it is a fascinating document <e> <s> is not the report so definitive that what is now required is an urgent move towards legislation both on the general ground that this is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord able to explain a point which i have not been able to follow in the discussion <e> <s> i refer to the connection between sunday collections and increased mail charges <e> <s> is the implication that sunday collections will be highly unprofitable therefore one has to raise the cost of postage for the rest of the week <e> <s> why should there be any connection between sunday collections and the price of a postage stamp <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the congratulations to the minister <e> <s> has his department considered that tourism like other forms of international trade especially in this country would be enhanced if britain were fully to join the exchange rate mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has already raised the matter i seek some clarification on the word reasonable <e> <s> if the director concerned were an accountant i could see the word reasonable having some meaning apropos that qualification <e> <s> however the director may be an ordinary person <e> <s> frequently in a private company a director may have no knowledge of or interest in the accounts <e> <s> he has some knowledge of and interest in what the company does whether it be in publishing books or selling antiques <e> <s> would reasonable then be interpreted as reasonable for that person <e> <s> that is the clarification we require <e> <s> it must be borne in mind that while in many of these companies the people concerned certainly have no knowledge of accounting or of company law they are anxious to be as honest as they possibly can <e> <s> reasonable would mean one thing to a fully qualified accountant but it would mean something quite different to somebody else <e> <s> the clause does not seem to differentiate according to person <e>", "<cs> my lords these are obviously sensible amendments but i have one question for the minister <e> <s> i speak as one who is not an accountant <e> <s> we have accounting standards <e> <s> essentially the requirement is to produce disclosure with respect to compliance with accounting standards <e> <s> however as a layman i fail to understand what kind of circumstance would cause someone not to comply <e> <s> why is the requirement not mandatory and why is there not a simple statement that everyone should produce accounts that comply with accounting standards full stop <e> <s> is there some subtle reason for voluntarism which i do not understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i again have another laymans question <e> <s> this seems to make sense but i have a question <e> <s> although on and off i took part in the proceedings on this bill i become more and more convinced that i do not understand any of it <e> <s> can the noble lord explain to me net or gross of what <e>", "<cs> my lords that leaves me even more mystified <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> there may be some confusion here in terms of counting lines because the piece of paper that we have before us does not have the lines numbered <e> <s> but i assert until someone contradicts me that line is the line which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a simple query which i think may be answered in a very straightforward way in reference to the definitions <e> <s> am i to understand that these are not changes in definitions in any way that is significant <e> <s> however am i also to understand that where these definitions appear they are all definitions that are known to and fully accepted by the accounting profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that we are right in looking at the whole group of amendments and not just at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> again i rise simply for my own interest and enlightenment <e> <s> the noble lord did not say why amendment no <e> <s> was as it is <e> <s> since i cannot work out why it is as it is i should simply like to know what amendment no <e> <s> does <e> <s> i take it that it does not do anything at all but i should like to be reassured on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords again i wish simply to clarify amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as i understand it essentially the amendment deals with people who are in process of becoming qualified <e> <s> am i then to understand that after we revert to what one might call the normal way of doing things namely fully qualified people from then on will be capable of meeting these conditions <e> <s> to put the question differently there must be a significance to january but the world goes on after <e> <s> so does what happens after just become a normal arrangement as it were <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord williams i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a and i draw your lordships attention to the fact that it involves leaving out subsection of clause which the governments amendment no <e> <s> does as well so there is nothing between us on that matter <e> <s> the content of amendment no <e> <s> a which stands in the name of my noble friend lord williams of elvel is a subject that we have raised on more than one occasion earlier in discussing this bill <e> <s> but we do not apologise for coming back to it <e> <s> it is our last chance to make the point and to plead with the government to take seriously the problem here <e>", "<cs> my lords on the technical point that the noble lord made about the precise nature of the amendment relative to the clause or rather the other amendment to which it is attached he is right to say that the reason for that is a procedural reason namely that we can amend only what comes back to us from the other place <e> <s> one has used that point to establish the general principle <e> <s> we are in no doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord replies in addition to what my noble friend lord wedderburn said i slightly missed what the noble and learned lord said in his opening <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not take decisions on whether or not the noble lord makes his statement <e> <s> that is for his side of the house <e> <s> i hoped i might ask a question and with permission i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the minister said that the government believe that the promotion of energy efficiency is in the public interest <e> <s> is it the case that re-affirmation and exhortation are good enough <e> <s> does he not agree that if we wish to promote energy efficiency we must make those who use energy inefficiently pay a high price for it in other words they should be taxed for using energy inefficiently and those who use it efficiently should gain certain benefits <e> <s> is it not time that the government intervened more actively to promote energy efficiency instead of merely talking about it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may press the matter a little further so that the minister understands my question <e> <s> we cannot leave the consumer to take the decision because he will take an inefficient decision <e> <s> the government must make it expensive for the consumer so that he takes an efficient decision <e> <s> does the minister agree with that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask three brief questions <e> <s> i should add that i do not ask them unsympathetically <e> <s> i appreciate the difficulties into which the government have got themselves although one cannot resist saying i told you so as they did not have to do it <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will at least reflect on three of the answers that he has given <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that it is getting late and i for one cannot wait to return to the intellectual excitements of the companies bill <e> <s> however i have one further question <e> <s> we know little about the new company scottish nuclear limited <e> <s> it has been invented by the government as it were to help solve the problem which confronts them <e> <s> we know nothing about the economic or financial regime under which it will operate <e> <s> in order that we and people in scotland may be enlightened as to what we shall have in the public sector will the minister come back to your lordships house with a fuller statement explaining how the company will operate its objectives the way in which it will be constrained and so forth <e> <s> i do not expect an answer tonight but i should like reassurance that we shall have an answer in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a trifle lost on the procedure but i shall talk until someone tells me that i am out of order <e> <s> i am doubly lost because i wanted to talk about the governments amendments <e> <s> i take it that i am still in order when i say how much i approve of them <e> <s> they represent an important step forward <e> <s> that is stage one <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is the competition directive <e> <s> i do not know what number it is and i do not think it is difficult to specify which directive i am talking about but i assume that it is the same one as the one which the minister mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords one day i shall learn how to do these things <e> <s> however i shall do the best i can now <e> <s> let me again say that it is not my desire nor that of my noble friend lord williams of elvel to undermine what the government are doing in this set of amendments <e> <s> what the government are doing seems to me to make perfectly good sense <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords i had better not follow that remark <e> <s> the government are surely fully committed to teacher assessment <e> <s> there have been statements made on that topic by the noble baroness lady hooper in this house and by the former secretary of state <e> <s> am i right in understanding that whatever else the minister was saying the government remain fully committed to teacher assessment as part of the assessment procedure <e> <s> it is impossible to see how anything can take place without the teachers <e> <s> will he not then draw to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little taken aback <e> <s> is the noble lord going to say something about amemdment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> i raised the question because while the other amendments which he moved seem unexceptionable amendment no <e> <s> requires a moments reflection particularly as it was not debated in committee in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> and the amendments to it <e> <s> i do not want to go over again the ground of amendment no <e> <s> of which the noble lord lord elton reminded us save to say that the financial services act was regarded and certainly in my experience is still regarded as hostile by many people in the financial markets <e>", "<cs> my lords that enables me to proceed rapidly to the conclusion that i wished to reach namely that because on the one hand we do not want to over-regulate and because on the other there are so many different bodies involved but over all because of the desire for fairness within the bounds of competition i am persuaded that the noble lords amendments are to say the least worth taking seriously <e> <s> they add something useful to the bill <e> <s> i should like either to believe that they are acceptable to the government or i am always open-minded to hear the government explain why they are already in the bill <e> <s> that is normally the governments favourite answer to this kind of amendment <e> <s> either way however the operators in the city require at least some modicum of reassurance and certainly a less threatening approach to the subject of regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his exposition of this extremely important topic <e> <s> we wish equity markets to operate as effectively as possible <e> <s> we want them to be as up-to-date as possible <e> <s> certainly we want the international stock <e>", "<cs> my lords my position was not to approve or disapprove of small shareholders <e> <s> i have a general interest in the problems of psychiatric medicine and that is why i intervened in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we have some comments on the amendment the noble lord has moved and some further comments on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we may have further comments as we go along <e> <s> until we hear the noble lords explanation on these amendments we do not know whether we shall have any serious comments <e> <s> in general we are anxious to get on with the business quickly but we prefer to stick to the groupings as they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to confine myself solely to the topic raised by the noble lord which is the concept of attaining university entrance level and to make the observation that this is a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my point <e> <s> as a university person myself i am well aware of the existence of mature students <e> <s> at the very least i hope that the department of trade and industry will therefore consult universities which have had a lot of experience in dealing with mature students <e> <s> my reason for intervening was precisely to draw that to the attention of the minister <e> <s> i am well aware of the reason for the amendment but i also hope he is aware that there is a vast experience within the university and polytechnic worlds of dealing with these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said what the schedule does but he did not tell us why it does it <e> <s> is it because it is perfectly obvious to all intelligent people why dates of birth are so relevant to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the minister to be saying that with their great interest in sociology the government want to provide appropriate databases for their sociologists who wish to investigate the company sector <e> <s> however he has still not told me why the information is relevant <e> <s> he has simply said that the matter goes back even earlier in the bill <e> <s> obviously it is such an important matter that one could not possibly oppose it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his answer to my question <e> <s> may i ask whether the government broadly endorse this excellent report from the audit commission <e> <s> may i also ask whether they accept one of the other main recommendations and observations of this report namely that the role of the local education authority changes substantially under the new education act and will enhance that aspect in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords contrary to what the noble friend of the minister said the audit commission actually says that monitoring educational quality and advice to improve it are crucial <e> <s> in other words the inspectors are crucial <e> <s> may i further ask the noble viscount whether he is aware of another figure in the report which is extremely worrying <e> <s> i refer to the fact that as presently arranged the average teacher in our schools is observed by an inspector only once every seven years which is about the same as never <e> <s> the audit commission report suggests that the inspectorate and the education officers could be redeployed in order that the average teachers work could be observed once every year <e> <s> is that an objective that the government approve of and will they try to ensure that it happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it was my noble friend lord callaghan of cardiff who emphasised some years ago the importance of links between industry and all schools <e> <s> i believe he had it in mind that the links should be two-way <e> <s> does the minister have any information on industry notably management in industry taking an interest particularly in our primary schools <e> <s> the biggest interest firms could take in our state schools would be for senior management to send their own children to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i was enjoying the debate until just now <e> <s> having listened to the noble baroness lady strange i now feel so hungry that i am not sure i can get through the material that i have prepared <e> <s> however i shall do the best i can <e> <s> we have managed to cover pretty well all the problems of society <e> <s> we have shown how they impinge on the family <e> <s> that is not surprising as the family is a major and perhaps the dominant social institution <e>", "<cs> my lords as always may i welcome the intervention of the noble lord lord joseph in all matters of education policy <e> <s> i begin by saying something about standards <e> <s> we must raise standards <e> <s> i am not one who tends to argue from the position that our standards are too low <e> <s> in other words i wish not to be negative <e> <s> my own view is that our standards simply should be higher and that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly surprised to hear from the noble viscount that all the surveys showed the same result since i understood that they had reflected very different views of the present state of teacher supply <e> <s> would it not be wholly advantageous not least to the government if instead of each year having a junior civil servant telephone all the local authorities to find out the position regarding the employment of teachers there was a body to provide the information in a professional manner <e> <s> as well as being useful to the country would that not also be of help to the ministers right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up the debate for the official opposition i am as noble lords will be well aware very much the third choice speaker <e> <s> however i assure the house that when we come to committee stage my place will be taken by my noble friend lord carter and with the help of my noble friend lord gallacher he will bring his expertise to bear on these very serious matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on that <e> <s> i merely say that if the noble lord does not like the use of the expression profit maximisation he should complain to professor walters to professor friedman or to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> there is a point that i meant to raise which the noble lord lord ezra also mentioned <e> <s> will this body have all the information that it wants in doing its job <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware how absurd have been his answers to this question <e> <s> the ctcs were introduced by his government <e> <s> the problems which have emerged in this specific case were pointed out by several of us at a time when we begged the government not to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am as puzzled by the noble lords answer as the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i was completely in favour of big bang but remember the great worry at the time that small shareholders would suffer <e> <s> i should have thought that the evidence overwhelmingly shows that the small shareholder finds himself with large charges <e> <s> is the noble lord quite certain in terms of what he knows of the subject that it is economic for small shareholders to buy shares at the present time <e> <s> all the material that i have read suggests that it is expensive for the small shareholder to trade <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount place the answer in a slightly longer term perspective <e> <s> it is good to see that north sea oil investment has recovered after the accidents and crises that hit the north sea but how does the present position compare with the general investment we experienced in this area over the past decade <e> <s> does he believe that investment is buoyant enough in terms of exploiting the future potential of the north sea oil fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble viscount used the neologism chargepayers <e> <s> i take it that this is what the rest of us mean when we refer to poll tax payers <e> <s> however chargepayers is the expression i heard but it is not a word in the english language that i have ever heard before <e> <s> further will the noble viscount also clarify the use of the word duty <e> <s> assuming that he is correct in saying that the education reform act states that local education authorities have a duty in this connection if they fail in that duty will her majestys government intervene to ensure that they provide a youth service <e> <s> alternatively is this one of those duties about which the government will simply shrug their shoulders and say well you have a duty but it is too bad if you do not fulfill it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i heard that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recognise that as he used the word chargepayer it will almost certainly appear in the new edition of the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clarify his earlier answer <e> <s> i understood the question not to be about disruption or cessation of service but about the monopoly in regard to the normal post office service <e> <s> do i understand first that the ministers answer means that the government have no intention of removing the post offices monopoly over whatever it is one would call normal service <e> <s> secondly is it not the case pretty well everywhere in the world that the post office in this context is a public monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might press the minister <e> <s> he has now changed the form of his words which does not necessarily mean that he is mistaken <e> <s> however does he accept that there is a distinction between the problem that might arise if there were disruption and that which might arise if the service were below what one might regard as a good enough standard <e> <s> am i not right in saying that the two problems are not the same <e>", "<cs> my lords on page the statement ends with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord yet again but he has now been asked a very simple question and has given he answer to a different one <e> <s> i did not ask nor indeed did my noble friend what in his view was the competence of the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> i asked for confirmation of what he actually said <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the minister of state at the department of industry will be advising us as to the places where we can buy light bulbs <e> <s> it must be within his departments area of responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for the statement <e> <s> however i am bound to say that for complacency and lack of content it exceeds any statement that i have heard in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his extremely clear and interesting introduction to the regulations <e> <s> many topics have been raised which are of interest to educationalists <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will forgive me if at this late hour on this last day i do not pursue every one but confine myself to only a few <e> <s> that does not mean that the others are unimportant quite the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly hearing problems and remedial work are subjects which noble lords take very seriously <e> <s> did i understand the minister to say that the nhs would provide whatever state of the art hearing appliance that was required by the patient and that there is no restriction on the ability of the medical profession to provide under the national health service the exactly correct hearing aid <e> <s> in other words is the noble baroness saying that the stories that one hears to the effect that the very best hearing aids are not available on the nhs are not true <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to clarify her answer <e> <s> i agree that i used the clich state of the art <e> <s> nonetheless i asked in the case of a person going for a hearing aid under the nhs and who required the very best available technologically advanced hearing aid whether that would be prescribable under the nhs <e> <s> is she able to say categorically yes in answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear the noble viscount say that the government are keen on the independence of universities <e> <s> when we discuss certain forthcoming legislation i look forward to seeing some indication of that from the government front bench <e> <s> recognising as does his honourable friend the junior minister in another place that under-financing of university libraries has adversely affected research and scholarship will the noble viscount say whether it is the governments view that no matter what happens to library funding they wish to wash their hands of the whole matter and will not intervene in any circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer albeit not one that pleases me very much <e> <s> does the minister recall that i raised the matter in july in connection with the education bill <e> <s> is he aware that noble lords who debated the subject thought that the problem was serious but minor <e> <s> is he aware that the unattractive practice to say the least is now growing and may soon become widespread <e> <s> can he advise the house whether the business of local authorities appointing only governors of their own political persuasion is legal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am completely puzzled by the ministers answers to the questions <e> <s> i should like to read from <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot think of anything original to say on the congratulations line except that i totally agree with the noble baroness that she ought to be looking for a modicum of support from her own side when one considers how two of her noble friends have reacted to certain prospective legislation in the education field <e> <s> i understand that the reply about sufficient resources being available is yes <e> <s> in that case can the noble baroness say why even her right honourable friend the secretary of state appears to be worried to a very considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to say anything in support of the government but i understand that the government have been consulting on these matters and having issued a draft circular intend issuing a final circular on the relevant considerations of the sort that the noble lord raised <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether the final version of the circular outlining the measures that local authorities should be taking into account will be issued in the near future or is the pressure of work in the des on other nonsensical matters preventing movement on this very important aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a most interesting debate <e> <s> all noble lords who have sat in the house have been given a great deal to think about <e> <s> we have learned much from colleagues who have contributed from all sides of the house <e> <s> even the minister said one or two things that were useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have contributed and beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated to the noble baroness the document to which reference was made is freely available even to ministers <e> <s> i assure her that it makes extremely interesting reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall get to the question there is no problem there at all <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that in referring to the speech made by her right honourable friend the secretary of state the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness clarify her reply <e> <s> we want the curriculum council to be as independent as possible <e> <s> however some of the things it is up to seem a trifle bizarre <e> <s> as my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not anxious to denigrate the secretary of state today <e> <s> i can do that on many other occasions <e> <s> rather i was anxious to be constructive <e> <s> therefore i ask the noble baroness again whether she is confident that the anxieties will be taken on board <e> <s> i shall concentrate on history because it is a subject which interests us a great deal <e> <s> we do not want to tell history teachers what they must do but does the noble baroness agree that one could raise an eyebrow or two occasionally by asking them what they think they are up to <e>", "<cs> my lords we are delighted that the secretary of state is apprised of the problem <e> <s> however am i not right in saying that he has no powers to achieve the solution which the noble baroness lady seear and others of us have in mind <e> <s> is it not right that all he can do is to encourage <e> <s> furthermore is not what the minister says against all experience in education and if there is any flexibility it is used entirely for the sake of examinations and what is compulsory <e> <s> is it not excessively optimistic to assume that the most <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not heard that before and that is welcome news <e> <s> will such an amendment of regulations be the subject of a debate in your lordships house so that we can bring to bear the many views which we have on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords there apears to be a frightful mess <e> <s> does the minister agree that statements made to your lordships house should contain material which your average lordship can understand rather than say that it is all very difficult although it is all very difficult <e> <s> in particular i refer to the formula set out on page which i am bound to say makes no sense to me whatever <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister questions about that <e> <s> however if he cannot answer them today perhaps he will ask his right honourable friend the secretary of state to issue a further statement so that we can understand the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps on reflection the noble lord may wish to withdraw one or two remarks which he made about his noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> i have certainly heard the noble lord lord beloff speak on these subjects before particularly with regard to the question of standards <e> <s> perhaps he will hear his noble friend speak on that subject again in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will no doubt remember how much work we put into this part of the act <e> <s> i assume that such work was put in in order that the provisions under the legislation would be obeyed <e> <s> i wish to ask a question which has arisen in respect of other matters <e> <s> it is about assemblies not about religious education <e> <s> i understood the minister to say that a parent can complain if he believes that the act is not being implemented properly in the case of a specific school <e> <s> however am i also correct in thinking that it now transpires that in such a case the parent has no redress in law <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to pursue this too strongly but it is an important matter <e> <s> the noble baroness says that action can be taken but the question i asked was who can take such action <e> <s> in other words is a parent in a position to take legal action directly or does the parent have to rely upon the department doing this for him or her many years in the future when a particular case may no longer apply because the children concerned will have left the school <e> <s> it is a most serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble baroness mean to say that in the end the government really do not care how local authorities spend money <e> <s> the minister seemed to be saying that the government were perfectly happy to let authorities spend the money in any way they wished <e> <s> does the minister not find it paradoxical that she has a totally <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble baroness accepts that i do not wish to have a debate with her and her noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> however the point i sought to emphasise is that there is no doubt whatever about the enormous public support for the youth and adult education services in this country <e> <s> is she not aware that many people will look askance at the fact that the government do not appear to think that that service is worthy of the highest priority <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your pardon <e> <s> occasionally i am allowed to ask a question <e> <s> will the noble baroness think again about the answer that she has just given <e> <s> is it not the case that in introducing local management of schools the government have to agree the formulae which local education authorities use in that management <e> <s> therefore is it not the case that the government have at least a modicum of leverage in accepting only formulae which will pay specific attention to children with special needs <e> <s> perhaps i may add that i regard that point as non-political it concerns children with special needs not politics <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not in the mood this afternoon for a political wrangle and i shall not be tempted by what the noble baroness has started <e> <s> she referred to the document as a management tool which i found extremely intriguing <e> <s> however the document states i shall give the noble baroness the exact reference it is to be found in the preface <e>", "<cs> my lords i have learnt in life never to predict anything <e> <s> i certainly did not prepare for this debate expecting the main onslaught on my views to come from the social and liberal democrat benches <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the noble baroness that the government whom she so vigorously attacked were supported by and kept in office by the so called lib-lab pact <e> <s> perhaps i may also remind her i hope not ungenerously that her present leader in this house was a distinguished member of my party and a distinguished holder of high office <e> <s> i have no intention of having a great argument with the noble baroness but i am deeply disappointed by that aspect of her speech <e>", "<cs> my lords we may have another opportunity to return to that point perhaps when many of us write our memoirs and deal with the history of the countrys economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that we intended to take a long time this afternoon on student matters <e> <s> for those of us who are parents and who have been involved with parental contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl lord caithness for his introduction to this debate <e> <s> it is not the first time i have heard him defend the indefensible and he does it very well <e> <s> it would be easy to devote all ones contribution to this second reading debate to an exposure of the inadequacies of this ill thought out and universally condemned bill <e> <s> while i intend to say something of that sort in my view it is more important to concentrate on general principles <e>", "<cs> my lords i am shocked that the noble lord did not appreciate how principled my speech was <e> <s> there is some confusion <e> <s> there is no question of us voting on the second reading <e> <s> what we have is an amendment to the second reading <e> <s> the issue of voting on the second reading is not before us <e> <s> noble lords should not allow themselves to be confused on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene again because i believe the point is important <e> <s> i am speaking not merely for myself but i think also for my noble friends <e> <s> i as a matter of principle would not vote against the government on the second reading of the bill <e> <s> i must say that in terms <e> <s> i regard it as an important point for the noble lord to understand <e> <s> the government may have chosen this as a matter of confidence we did not choose anything <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to know that i take the traditions of the house seriously <e> <s> i do not accept that voting for the amendment is a vote against second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice to those of other noble lords who have congratulated the noble lord lord annan on introducing the debate <e> <s> although we are not a vast group of speakers we seem to be a very select one <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point <e> <s> i do not seek to disagree with most of what the noble lord said but my experience is slightly different <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not seem to be doing very well these days <e> <s> my speech yesterday ran into difficulty with at least one noble lord who i see is in his place and who thought it was not good enough <e> <s> it now appears that my remarks today are not good enough for another noble lord <e> <s> it is the only speech that i have <e> <s> however i have not in the past been backward in speaking on the question of science and higher education <e> <s> one cannot talk about everything at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his kind remarks about lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> i am sure that all members of the house will wish to be associated with them <e> <s> lord stewart was a major figure in government <e> <s> on the subject of education which is our concern today i believe that he took part in every debate on every education bill that came before the house during his period here <e> <s> he was a kindly man <e> <s> we shall miss his good sense his constructive and intelligent contributions and his ready wit <e> <s> we shall certainly miss him this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak on the amendment with some trepidation <e> <s> i am not a constitutional expert <e> <s> i have not had the privilege of serving in the other place and i have been in this chamber for only three years <e> <s> however i am learning as i go along <e> <s> i assume that for the moment the noble earl has not accepted the amendment because like me he was waiting to hear the speeches and hoping to learn something <e>", "<cs> we are indebted to the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead for introducing the amendment <e> <s> when he broke off initially in the way he did when reminiscing about rampant inflation and collapsing sterling i thought he was talking of today not <e> <s> the difference is that in my noble friend lord callaghan was determined to see that economic policy was adjusted in the interests of the nation and indeed eventually in the interests of sterling <e> <s> i for one wait to hear similar statements coming from the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say two things to the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not suggest for one moment that it should be accepted <e> <s> i suggest it should be taken seriously <e> <s> equally as i in all humility always take seriously that which someone who says i am not an expert says <e> <s> i require as a slight <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i am sorry i know that to do so is disconcerting <e> <s> is he saying that the government could not technically simply raise the maintenance grant by the relevant amount using the regulations of the act <e> <s> there need be no connection between giving students decent grants and the loans scheme <e> <s> it seems to me to be rather threatening to suggest that either one agrees to the loans scheme or one does not receive the money <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down will he clarify parts of his answer <e> <s> the first part of his answer did not seem to be connected with money at all but he was simply arguing that part-time students were not a priority <e> <s> in answering his noble friend lord eccles he switched to referring to what he called a lot of money <e> <s> i must say that or million is not what i would call a lot of money for such a desirable objective especially as the noble baroness is entirely right in saying that this scheme will be self-financing very quickly <e> <s> can we be told which argument the government most rely on <e> <s> is it that this is not a priority or do they not want to spend the money <e>", "<cs> i wish to clear up a misunderstanding <e> <s> the noble earl has referred yet again to the famous meeting with the secretary of state <e> <s> i welcomed the meeting and thought that it was useful <e> <s> i did not wish to be discourteous to the minister or to his right honourable friend <e> <s> however i believe that such discussions should take place in another way and that was my only point <e> <s> as the noble earl is aware i attended the meeting and listened carefully <e> <s> i learnt a lot from doing so and therefore i welcomed the meeting <e> <s> i had no desire to be discourteous or to discourage the ministers right honourable friend from calling another meeting to tell us more <e> <s> i made what i still believe to be a valid constitutional point that the place for such a discussion is across the floor of the chamber <e> <s> i had no desire to do other than to make that constitutional point <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment of the noble earl <e> <s> his eye has caught a point that some of us missed <e> <s> it is worth underlining it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to join in the debate but we must get the economics and finances right <e> <s> the fact is that we are starting from a base on which the government have cut the real value of the grant by around one-quarter <e> <s> that is the key initial fact <e> <s> during the lifetime of this government the real value of the grant has fallen by one-quarter <e> <s> the correct base line therefore is to put the grant back by that quarter <e> <s> that is the key base line <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on the matter <e> <s> we are indebted to the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley to the noble lord lord colwyn and to the noble earl lord bathhurst for raising a matter which we all seek to raise for the sake of clarification <e> <s> the noble lord lord colwyn put his finger on the key issue which is not simply osteopathy or chiropractic but generally professions ancillary to medicine <e> <s> what we know and i think that this is an entirely correct development is that these people are moving on from diploma level to the degree level <e> <s> that is wholly to be welcomed <e> <s> many people are doing this and they are doing it via the cnaa which is a helpful body in this regard <e> <s> i do not believe that the government would remotely wish to have any of those developments held back <e> <s> it would be a great pity if the loans scheme could not accommodate such people <e>", "<cs> i must reply to the noble baroness <e> <s> it is a matter to which i have given a very great deal of thought <e> <s> it is a broader point than the question of women that we now raise <e> <s> let me add that i certainly would expect the employer to meet the cost of the loan <e> <s> to take an obvious example the brilliant young economists i produce i shall say to them when you go to an interview you should ask whether they are going to pay off your loan <e> <s> that will be my advice to them <e>", "<cs> i wish to make three concluding comments which i had intended to save until next monday <e> <s> however i may as well make them now <e> <s> the government often make an international comparison but they must stop the <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble earl will take the opportunity to clarify one or two areas of this amendment <e> <s> i shall not deal with the matter of long courses <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl because i am trying to learn <e> <s> in the case of a four-year sandwich degree course of which one of the years would be a vocational year for which i believe a mandatory award is not available in usual practice is he now saying that a loan would be available for the vocational year <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> i repeat that we shall abolish the scheme <e> <s> the noble earl will have to wait not very long now for an exchange of positions <e> <s> he will then hear precisely what i have to say on these matters <e>", "<cs> we appear to be having a great number of different debates on what we are going to do <e> <s> i assume that i at least and perhaps the noble baroness will be here for a little longer <e> <s> if we are not i shall have to go back to being a retired professor of economics <e> <s> indeed that might be a much more satisfactory way of spending my time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will have seen the excellent report published by her own department this week on developing school management <e> <s> is she aware i am sure she is that it says that the function of the local authority will <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press the noble baroness on this point <e> <s> it is connected with the question of training <e> <s> is not the problem that head teachers are being asked to manage budgets which is something that they have not been asked to do before <e> <s> they do not have the appropriate training <e> <s> if my noble friend is right and i believe that he is in terms of scarcity of funds head teachers will be asked to manage budgets which are too small to begin with <e> <s> we are asking what the department will <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall speak to this very long group of amendments which as the noble earl lord russell rightly said have a common <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i think it would be useful if we clarified this point simply so that we understand the governments position <e> <s> i should like to ask him again whether i understood him correctly to say that the student loans company will be just like any other company offering loans to the personal sector i think those were the words that he used and would operate just like any other company <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may thank the noble earl for the response to some of my questions <e> <s> i am still puzzled by the prison question <e> <s> i should like to be assured that no question of imprisonment arises <e> <s> perhaps we ought to wait for a definitive statement on that which the noble earl may give us at some other time <e>", "<cs> i am not objecting to the fact that i was answered <e> <s> i did not like the answer as the noble baroness is well aware <e>", "<cs> we have had two debates <e> <s> one was a debate upon a debate about what happened before <e> <s> the ill-feeling felt by noble lords opposite should not be addressed solely to the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> it was a grouped series of amendments and it is customary to divide on the first <e> <s> i can assure the committee that i would have insisted on dividing if the noble earl had not done so <e> <s> that is not out of any lack of respect <e>", "<cs> with respect it is not the same point <e> <s> let me just invent a possible fantasy <e> <s> let us assume that during the course of today sterling plunges i <e>", "<cs> if i may just proceed to a conclusion i was extremely intrigued by the intervention of the noble lord lord harmar-nichous <e> <s> i was surprised by it <e> <s> he ought to know that flexibility in economic policy-making is something advocated by old fashioned keynesians like myself i am somewhat surprised to see him a loyal supporter of the present government also espousing a keynesian position on these matters <e> <s> i know that the noble earl lord caithness sitting opposite was deeply shocked that such s ideas to which i still subscribe have any echo on those benches <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble baroness to bear with me but it is important that we know what we are debating <e> <s> the loan starts at or and eventually it is grossed up and becomes which is times as much <e> <s> therefore if the student who owes is to pay a week ignoring the inflation rate interest to be added he will be repaying over at least years and if we add the interest to that it will be more than years <e> <s> as i say i think that the statement of the noble baroness is an extremely important one <e> <s> she may not want to commit herself precisely to it but it is very important to me in trying to participate in the committee to know precisely that part of the governments scheme <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that <e> <s> i shall look very carefully at what she said <e> <s> it seems to me that that means that the repayment period will be a minimum of years and will probably be more than years bearing inflation in mind <e> <s> that might lead to further consideration on report <e>", "<cs> for once i do not seem to have been my normal extremely clear self i thought that the amendment was so clear that it did not require a long lecture from me <e> <s> perhaps it would help now if i stated what the amendment meant <e> <s> i might then receive an answer that corresponded to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl very much <e> <s> that was the answer i thought that he would originally give <e> <s> we did not need any of the other answers <e> <s> on uprating nothing has changed as a result of the bill <e> <s> the treasury will decide year after year what it feels it can do by way of uprating considering the general economic circumstances of the country <e> <s> in that sense nothing has changed from the existing student maintenance scheme <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has put his finger on what is wrong with the bill <e> <s> if one were specifying a suitable student loans bill such provisions would be intrinsic to the bill <e> <s> we would go out of our way to see that students on longer courses did not suffer because of that as the noble earl has said <e> <s> secondly when one is considering repayment instead of having the crude mechanism that the government have invented the per cent <e> <s> point for deferment one would have a graduated scale of repayment according to the various levels of income as the noble earl has said <e> <s> one would be on the way to the graduate tax version of this form of maintenance <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear the noble earls remarks on the amendment and i wait to see <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her response <e> <s> in particular i thank her for emphasising paragraph c of schedule which gives the secretary of state power for concellation <e>", "<cs> the point on costing is that it will cost money <e> <s> the noble earl lord russell is quite right that it is never adequate to say this will cost money <e> <s> one has to ask whether it will cost less than the alternative <e> <s> many of us believe that alternative recruitment schemes will cost the government whichever government are in power enormously larger sums of money <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> my own view is that the student loans company will turn out to be a loathsome and loathed company particularly because it will be following the principles which the noble earl himself pointed out <e> <s> i refer to the vigorous pursuit of defaulters whom it will assume are purposeful defaulters rather than defaulters who happen to become so because circumstances made them like that <e> <s> that is one reason why i believe that what we are discussing here cannot survive in its present form <e> <s> at the very least this company when it eventually comes to realise that it should pay some attention to its public image for as long as it survives ought to adopt a totally transparent approach to its functions <e> <s> the purpose of my amendment which i agree is not very expert although its spirit is clear is as it were to guide the company in the right direction <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl <e> <s> he is being a little harsh <e> <s> i have in mind certain figures he could have included in the bill which would have so astonished me that i would not have been foolish enough to query them <e> <s> however i have to admit that he has had more experience of legislation than i have so perhaps he is right and i would have been difficult over any number but i do not think so <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> yet again i have learnt something because i did not fully appreciate that that was what the government would do <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble earl to reassure me that i understood what he said <e> <s> my understanding is that the inflation rate that will apply will be the inflation rate of the previous year <e> <s> therefore one would know the inflation rate in advance <e>", "<cs> i rise first to support the amendment and secondly to echo some of the words of warning that the noble lords lord flowers and lord adrian have given <e>", "<cs> as a university professor albeit retired and emeritus i am sorry to hear that <e> <s> from what we have heard there ought to be a modicum of ill feeling between the secretary of state and the institutions if the institutions are being threatened which is the point at issue <e> <s> i speak entirely from the outside <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> to describe such a company as a company given all that he has said seems extremely far-fetched <e> <s> it is a government office <e> <s> i cannot but congratulate the minister on his ingenuity when he said that it might generate some income <e> <s> what were the two examples <e> <s> it would sub-let office space <e> <s> where did it get that office space in the first place that it is now sub-letting <e> <s> the other was that it would get rid of obsolete equipment <e> <s> again that is a strange concept of income <e> <s> the whole thing is odd <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to take part in this discussion because i had assumed that what the noble lord lord beloff had said was right and that the role of the referee was negligible <e> <s> however i now discover from listening to the noble earl that the role of the referee is rather serious <e> <s> it appears that the referee is to be a sneak and a coppers nark <e> <s> he is to be someone who is approached for information <e>", "<cs> although it is late this is our only opportunity to debate these matters and i see no reason for being brief this is genuinely the only chance that we have to deal with certain very important matters as the noble earl lord caithness has already pointed out <e> <s> i shall concentrate on amendments nos <e> <s> a and since the noble earl lord russell has put the other amendments into appropriate perspective <e>", "<cs> i realise we are all tired <e> <s> however if the noble baroness reads my second reading speech she will see that i went to a great deal of trouble to say that i fully accepted that we had to rethink the whole question of student maintenance <e> <s> i went to a lot of trouble to say that the status quo is not sustainable <e> <s> i repeat that the status quo is not sustainable <e> <s> however the government have produced something worse than the status quo and that takes some doing <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lord cocks of hartcliffe for raising this matter <e> <s> i wish to address the specific issue that he raised and to follow other noble lords in considering the general question <e> <s> clearly the noble lord lord cocks is right to raise the matter and place it before your lordships <e> <s> the people of bristol are also right to be concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall be forgiven for saying how unsatisfactory i find the answer of the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> i was first informed of the matter via my noble friend lord ponsonby who had in turn been informed by the government chief whip lord denham on thursday afternoon as the noble lord the leader of the house said <e> <s> it took me a little time to appreciate the significance of the amendments <e> <s> i then went immediately to the government whips office and said that the amendments were of fundamental significance and that it was my view that the government should not proceed with them at the pace they intended <e> <s> i said that i should need a great deal of time to examine the significance of the amendments <e> <s> i asked the whips office to get in touch with ministers on the matter <e> <s> i also said that i was available for whoever wished to speak to me on the subject <e> <s> i was in your lordships house on thursday afternoon and available on thursday evening on my home telephone number which i gave to the government whips on thursday evening <e> <s> i was in your lordships house for most of fridays business <e> <s> i discovered today that no message from me appeared to have gone to the government side on the lines that i have just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that what i have to say will not count as my speech on this particular matter <e> <s> i am terribly worried now about the rules <e> <s> i have been sitting here quietly because i thought the noble earl was introducing his own amendments and that he was not replying <e> <s> i certainly have a great deal to say on this issue and i intend to do so <e> <s> we ought to get the position straight <e> <s> i have no desire on this occasion or indeed on any other to break the rules <e> <s> i am currently on my feet in regard to a point of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hate to be thought of as a nuisance but would the noble lord the leader of the house at least tell me exactly what are the rules in this connection <e> <s> do the rules state that the moment the noble earl rises to speak the rest of us would be out of order if were we to do so <e> <s> if that is the case could the noble earl in future kindly look over to this side of the house before he rises to his feet to see whether any noble lord is about to rise to speak <e> <s> i have no desire whatever on this or indeed on any other occasion to be out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords would it help the noble earl if i made my speech <e> <s> then he could reply on behalf of the government <e> <s> there are only a couple of points that i wish to underline <e> <s> i preface them with the remark that it is already obvious that i am totally incompetent when it comes to procedure at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his answer <e> <s> i am delighted to hear what he had to say about the access funds <e> <s> i look forward to hearing more details when we have an opportunity to discuss the matter <e> <s> all of us who are concerned with higher education whether or not we like the bill will regard as highly desirable any measure to provide more funds to help students <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl <e> <s> on the latter point perhaps i should clear up what i tried to convey <e> <s> my point is that the noble earl has given us more and more information every time he gets up <e> <s> we are grateful to him for that <e> <s> some of us have been trying to put the pieces together to convert them into one large patchwork quilt which has a logical structure or pattern to it <e> <s> however it seems to me that the time will come i am not pressing him to do this at the moment when the government themselves will wish to produce a complete document stating all that has now been said amounts to the following that is all i have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl and all noble lords who have contributed to the debate on this important matter <e> <s> the debate enables us to clarify one difference between us as to the net benefit of the scheme <e> <s> the noble earl will recall that i argued that the money which brought the grant for the average student back to its level in real terms in was money that was owed to the student and any net new money would have to be over and above that amount <e> <s> therefore my calculations as to what is net are very different from the governments calculations <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to my amendment the noble baroness asked what i thought was a very important question <e> <s> i do not want to delay the house but i believe that she has put her finger on the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> the amendments are grouped together <e>", "<cs> my lords i nevertheless beg to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with those who have thanked the noble earl for adding some reality to the scheme which has looked rather theoretical until now <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff may be right in suggesting that what is proposed is the simplest way of carrying out what is required but from the description of it it certainly sounds bureaucratic <e> <s> there was a description given of pulling off the different bits of paper <e> <s> i cannot remember how many there were on the carbon blocks <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his contribution <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am in great difficulty as to how to contribute to the discussion of the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i should start by saying that in so far as i understand the amendment at all i simply cannot accept that it is a mere technical amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness on that <e> <s> does not the noble baroness lady blatch agree with the noble lord lord orr-ewing that we should introduce some discipline into visits to the house of lords <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord would be the first to be willing to mark the essays <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend lord dormand of easington is right in that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the noble lord lord beloff has embarrassed me once before on raising the matter of his own education <e> <s> for the second time i forbear to comment on the consequences of it <e> <s> have the government changed their policy as regards the noble baronesss last remarks concerning the desirability that the overwhelming majority of our teachers should be taught properly themselves and go to teacher training college <e>", "<cs> my lords i must interrupt the noble earl as i wish to follow his argument all the way <e> <s> i realise that it is my amendment that is being discussed but i certainly did not think that the words over the age of had anything to do with the age of <e> <s> i thought those words simply meant someone who was over the age of for example years plus one minute <e> <s> i am rather lost here <e> <s> if one says over the age of does that mean years-old in law <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely difficult to speak after that particular intervention <e> <s> i thank the noble earl for his reply and noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> i am not endeavouring to damage the bill at this point <e> <s> i am merely endeavouring to establish the point about scrutiny revision and the need for time to think these matters through <e> <s> what has emerged from our discussions is precisely that those are difficult areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few brief words on this amendment which is tabled in my name and that of the noble lord lord addington <e> <s> i fully appreciate that when a scheme of this kind is introduced one faces the problem of what to do about what one might call so far as concerns england and wales a non-standard three-year degree namely a four-year degree course <e> <s> i do not say that in order to insult the scots and infer that there is something abnormal about them <e> <s> it is simply that they have the tradition of a four-year degree <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord beloff and lord rippon laid down a very simple principle <e> <s> it was not that the universities and colleges should be allowed to exploit the government but simply that the government should agree that whatever be the agreed audited costs they were the costs that the government should meet <e> <s> i cannot understand how the noble earl can possibly reject that suggestion <e> <s> it is the noble earls scheme <e> <s> surely the government would be willing to meet the agreed audited costs of the scheme <e> <s> that is all that the noble lord lord beloff is asking for and i cannot see how the noble earl can reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords our deliberations are nearly at an end <e> <s> i cannot pretend that i am at all happy with the bill although noble lords can claim to have removed or moderated some of its faults <e> <s> in that connection i have heard that the government propose to guillotine the debate on your lordships amendments in another place <e> <s> i never criticise the other place but i do not see how noble lords can with confidence do their job of scrutiny if it does not examine our amendments fully and seriously albeit eventually to reject them <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be inappropriate for me to refer to london university except to say that those of us who teach there are under the impression that we are short of money <e> <s> however following on the question separate from the issue of whether or not financial resources are adequate which is arguable are the government satisfied with the way that the universities funding council is allocating resources <e> <s> in particular is the noble baroness satisfied with the length of time that sometimes seems to be taken in advising universities of their allocations <e> <s> is it not the case that the ufc has become rather too bureaucratic <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the noble lord lord renwick refers generally to children who leave school without adequate skills in reading writing and spelling <e> <s> noble lords who have spoken have tended to concentrate on dyslexia leaving nothing for me to add on that subject other than to say how sympathetic i am as indeed we all are to what we have been told <e> <s> i should also like to say that the british dyslexia association apart from the good work that it does in its own field is to be congratulated on promoting international literacy year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am giving the number of adults <e> <s> i am not quoting the figures with regard to children <e> <s> we know that although these children of asian origin themselves have considerable achievements many of their families have major language problems <e> <s> indeed to refer to a problem that the noble baroness lady faithfull raised about school attendance a subject on which i am extremely sympathetic as she knows we have evidence again more <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> we ought to conduct the debate on a basis of realism <e> <s> is the noble baroness saying that her department is not bombarded with letters from all and sundry in her case from members of her own party drawing her attention to the politics of the people whom she is considering <e> <s> if she is there has been a miracle in whitehall since the last time that i was involved <e>", "<cs> i put down my name to oppose the question as a means of probing an aspect of the bill which i find somewhat arcane <e> <s> in the explanatory and financial memorandum of the bill there is a straightforward sentence which i can understand <e> <s> it states that clause <e>", "<cs> i did not intervene earlier because the relevant arguments were put most cogently by members of the committee who spoke and i had nothing to add <e> <s> their arguments were overwhelmingly correct <e> <s> i also wanted to hear the ministers reply in the hope that she would accept the amendments or say that the government intend to draft similar amendments to the same purpose <e> <s> she did not confirm my worst fears by saying that everything can be done via regulations and <e>", "<cs> politically motivated <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lord to read his own speech and appreciate the logic of his own position <e> <s> the logic which is also the logic of the noble baronesss position is just that <e> <s> it may be one of those people will be appointed and the government would like that but it may be that it is not one of those people in which case the government could live with that as well <e> <s> one ought to appreciate the nonsense that is being offered to us on amendment after amendment <e> <s> i bring up that point as a preliminary remark to my amendment which represents the reverse position <e> <s> my amendment concerns who ought not to be on those authorities <e> <s> there is now the converse case <e> <s> i shall be interested to discover how the government get round that point <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i do not accept that the present arrangements work well <e> <s> as regards a conflict of interest when the bill becomes an act the problem will be intensified <e> <s> to say the least i utter my normal warning as i have in respect of other legislation <e>", "<cs> i reveal yet again that i am connected with the university of london and with at least one of the postgraduate institutes <e> <s> as the noble lord lord dainton has just said it follows logically that the reply given by the noble baroness to the earlier amendments on university representation should carry over at least to the point of her agreeing to think the matter through further namely that she will consider this amendment with the others <e> <s> since there has been an interval of a couple of hours perhaps she has had time to reflect and is now willing to accept the amendments <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not wish to press the withdrawal of the amendment but i should like to have some clarification in case i did not quite follow what the noble baroness said <e> <s> did she say that this matter would be dealt with by order and that the order will essentially meet what is said in the amendment <e> <s> is that a fair summary <e> <s> i think that is what i heard her say <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i heard the noble baroness say that the basis for grant-maintained schools was the exercise of choice by parents <e> <s> will the noble baroness tell noble lords what view the government take when that choice is exercised on the basis of racial prejudice <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like to press the point and i was not aware of a question on the subject <e> <s> however i asked the noble baroness point blank to take a view on the exercise of racial prejudice <e> <s> am i right in thinking from her answer that the government do not care in the slightest whether or not parents choose to send their children to particular schools on the basis of racial prejudice <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord jenkin of roding for his intervention <e> <s> i thought long and hard about preisely the point that he made namely that essentially the districts which bear in mind good management principles would behave in exactly the way that i describe in my amendments <e> <s> given that the intention of the bill as stated strongly and clearly by the secretary of state is to devolve as much as can be devolved i shall take his point <e> <s> indeed i thought about it <e>", "<cs> obviously i do not want to bore noble lords more than i usually do but it will satisfy me if i could be reassured that within a district one would be seeing regular information on the health of inhabitants within the district rather than information just about the nation <e> <s> in other words the point i wish to make is that one does not want aggregate data one is interested in data which are specific to the district <e> <s> i understand that that is what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps i may double my word of thanks to the noble lord <e> <s> i was particularly reassured by his remarks on services <e> <s> i am certainly reassured by what he has just said <e> <s> therefore although i was originally of a mind to divide the committee he has totally taken the wind out of my sails and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene for a moment to clarify one of the points at issue <e> <s> i do not think that the issue is commercialism it is that when considering what is best for people in the locality full weight should be given to their convenience <e> <s> it is not obvious where in the decision-making mechanism any weight is given to the convenience of people in the locality <e> <s> those are not sums that enter into the accounting systems with which the gps and the local officials will be concerned <e> <s> that is precisely the point at issue <e>", "<cs> i was foolish to join in this debate <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord has put his finger on the precise issue <e> <s> many of us fervently believe in the national health service and are totally committed to the altruism of the providers <e> <s> what we fail to see in the bill i say this in clear terms is any back-up for that altruism <e> <s> the bill seems to wish to replace altruism by market mechanisms <e> <s> some economists believe that altruism is a bad basis for decisions and market mechanisms are good <e> <s> many of us who support the national health service do not take that view <e> <s> the noble lord has put his finger on one of the central issues that concerns us <e> <s> altruism will cease to be the <e>", "<cs> if i may correct the noble lord i said it was foolish of me to intervene <e> <s> i thought my intervention was really very good <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all members of the committee who have contributed to this interesting little debate <e> <s> if i understand the noble baroness correctly she said that her right honourable friend the secretary of state is meeting the royal colleges and some developments on the quality accreditation and the professional side may emerge from that <e> <s> i shall wait to hear the results from that meeting possibly amendments may flow from it <e>", "<cs> although my name is down to the amendment i did not speak at an earlier point because i wanted to hear what the noble baroness had to say <e> <s> i was extremely disappointed with her reply <e> <s> it seemed that the noble lord lord coleraine had put the matter as clearly as he possibly could <e> <s> his commitment to openness is shared by the noble lord lord tordoff and by me but from listening to the noble baroness it does not appear to be shared by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying to the short debate for the opposition i should declare an interest namely i am a member of the council of the royal pharmaceutical society of great britain which as noble lords will know is the statutory body concerned with the profession of pharmacy in this country <e> <s> in saying i declare an interest i do not mean that i have a pecuniary interest but simply that i find the twin subjects of the profession of pharmacy and the pharmaceutical industry extremely interesting <e> <s> they are fascinating activities especially to an economist <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord with respect <e> <s> i have some connection with st thomass hospital <e> <s> is he saying that st thomass has to make these cuts because it mismanages its resources <e> <s> does he wish to place that on record at this time <e> <s> i should be grateful to know what he has said because in due course i could take the opportunity to rebut it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene and it is unfair to interrupt the noble lord so often <e> <s> however i want to say how much i agree with him <e> <s> almost everybody i have spoken to in the hospital service believes that devolution to self-governing trusts is the first step towards privatisation <e> <s> there is no shadow of doubt that that is right <e> <s> the question that the noble lord might address himself to and then might ask his noble friend on the front bench is whether the government will put down an amendment to guarantee that what he says with which i agree about moving in the american direction cannot possibly happen <e> <s> if one were to ask for some way of reassuring those who work in the hospital service that there is no danger that trusts are the first step towards privatisation one would ask for precisely that <e> <s> there is no doubt that what the noble lord said is right <e> <s> in my experience all over the country people are saying that the government are playing games and that they want to privatise <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting the noble lord once again but that is a terribly important matter <e> <s> is he saying that when the secretary of state receives the documentation he will ask the people seeking to become self-governing trusts whether they have consulted all the various groups which the noble lord mentioned and ask them to say what the consultations have produced <e> <s> will the secretary of state then make clear the basis of his response as regards all the documentation <e> <s> can the noble lord also say whether he is aware of the fact that there are hospitals which are preparing at the moment to become self-governing trusts which have drawn up all the necessary documentation and which cannot wait for the bill to become law so that the application can be submitted <e> <s> such hospitals have no intention of consulting <e> <s> is he not aware of that situation <e>", "<cs> the group of amendments includes two separate sets of ideas <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> deals with procedures in this chamber and in another place with respect to affirmative resolutions rather than the other way round <e> <s> the other amendments deal with matters of substance <e> <s> we support the amendments by arguing that the best way is to put the matters on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether one is allowed to intervene on a procedural matter but i should say that amendment no <e> <s> a was grouped with amendment no <e> <s> g <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt was not present when amendment no <e> <s> g was called <e> <s> we are hoping that when we reach the other amendments in that group we can proceed <e> <s> i hope that that is agreeable to the committee <e>", "<cs> i believe that i am right in saying that a national health service trust of the kind which the noble baroness is about to introduce in the bill is not a trust in a legal sense <e> <s> it therefore cannot hold money on trust <e> <s> the point is completely wrong <e> <s> many of the great teaching hospitals have trustees who have such free money <e> <s> if they wish for research funds the nhs trust hospitals will have <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay the committee but the question of trusts arose a little earlier <e> <s> i for one found it rather difficult <e> <s> would it be possible for the noble lord to write to me and to other interested noble lords clarifying the question of trust property meaning trusts in the legal sense of nhs trusts <e> <s> i should find it helpful to have that clarified <e> <s> i do not seek to delay the committee at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i was an innocent by-stander as regards this question <e> <s> is not the noble earl aware that the government of which he is a member have been elected for the past three general elections on one premise namely that inflation does not have many causes but only one an excess rate of rise in the money supply <e> <s> have the government now given up that position in order to adopt the position which the rest of us have held for quite a long time <e>", "<cs> i got lost by the answers given to the noble baroness lady macleod and to my noble friend <e> <s> i understand that under the act everybody in this country is entitled to be registered with a gp <e> <s> i believe that is what the noble baroness said <e> <s> i also understand that if a specific gp will not take a person and that person cannot find a gp the family practitioner committee will guarantee to find one <e> <s> the point is whether the fhsa has exactly the same duty placed on it to guarantee a place <e> <s> i cannot find a reference to that in the bill <e> <s> indeed i cannot find where it is referred to in the act where <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her extremely helpful reply <e> <s> perhaps i may inquire about one matter <e> <s> i was aware that there is a national policy on the matter <e> <s> however i should like guidance as to whether within the broad national guidelines it would still be open to the fhsa to interpret those guidelines as it sees fit fine-tuning them to its own circumstances <e> <s> to take an obvious example an fhsa which deals with problems which arise in the inner city particularly with a mobile population will have a very different problem regarding complaints from that affecting an fhsa in a rural area <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her additional answer <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords for their remarks <e> <s> i too have looked into the question of women in medical schools in some detail and can certainly confirm that what the noble lords lord walton and lord mccoll said is entirely right <e> <s> as i understand it the problem is that we may have to introduce positive discrimination for men if we are to have any male doctors in the future <e> <s> on the other hand i regret to say in the presence of those two noble lords that women have so far not thrust through at the higher levels of being consultants and deans of medical schools to the degree to which those of us who are equal opportunity enthusiasts look forward <e> <s> however i am so confident in womens ability in that respect that i do not think that they will need any help from us in both ruining the rugger in the university and in rising to more or less take over the medical professions something which i enthusiastically support <e>", "<cs> my i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> i think it is probably the one i would have given had i been sitting where she is <e> <s> i am not sure that it is one that i entirely accept <e> <s> but one of the advantages of not sitting where the noble baroness is sitting is that one has a certain freedom to open ones mind to relevant matters <e> <s> i think that in the operation of the bill and the way it is going to work fhsas will have this burden placed upon them and they will have to take the matter seriously <e> <s> however we can wait to see how it evolves for the time being <e> <s> it may well be that if the bill remains on the statute book in any form after the electoral events of next year this aspect may need to be examined further <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before thanking the noble baroness for her answer let me say how much i agree with the noble lord lord mccoll <e> <s> i actually have a long running list which i constantly update of all the improvements needed on this site <e> <s> i shall add the two that he has just mentioned to the many others i have developed in my three years as a member of your lordships house <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for her very helpful answer and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not fully understand the answer <e> <s> since the data are being collected for many of us not least those who are assessing efficiency of performance it would be advantageous at least to make it clear that they should be available to interested people <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> however that is not quite the same as making it obligatory <e> <s> i do not believe that that is part of my lack of understanding of the bill if i may look at the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> it is part of my disagreement with the bill which is a different matter <e> <s> i should have thought that it was an issue to which we could return <e> <s> the fhsas might wish to make it mandatory rather than optional <e> <s> however we have aired the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> it will be interesting to see whether we can rely on the decentralised system to produce what we wish <e> <s> the certificate of qualification is a very good one and it would be a good idea if most gps had it <e> <s> it may well i be that that will result through the automaticity that is built into the system or that publishing a list from the fhsas will encourage doctors to proceed in the appropriate direction <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i was glad that she underlined the importance of medical audit and also recognised what an onerous business this is <e> <s> i have been involved in the equivalent only once and it was the most tiring experience imaginable <e> <s> apart from anything else auditing ones fellows is psychologically draining to say the least <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord my mind was on matters of business while listening to his excellent answer <e> <s> i was not concerned to debate whether they are voluntary or how the regions will operate <e> <s> i was more concerned about the secretary of states role in the matter <e> <s> the minister appeared to be saying that the secretary of state will decide the factors and that is that <e> <s> he will not come to this chamber and lay down regulations on the factors but will say you will take these matters into account <e> <s> then the region will go ahead and negotiate on that basis <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> then i am being stupid because i found that answer more difficult to follow <e> <s> the subsection reads <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has now clarified what will happen although we have not yet agreed that it is right <e> <s> however i thank him for at least clarifying the matter <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord because i now understand what we are talking about <e> <s> however i do not believe that the matter can be dealt with in the course of our deliberations on the bill <e> <s> i am not convinced by the statement referring to gps contracts and fund-holding practices <e> <s> it is not obvious that the two are logically compatible and i believe that major difficulties will arise <e> <s> however we can face them at the time <e>", "<cs> there is nothing between us <e> <s> i do not assume that the secretary of state is an idiot even the abstract secretary of state rather than the specific one that we have <e> <s> as i said earlier the points on my list are points that any sensible secretary of state would take into account <e> <s> i still believe that any secretary of state is occasionally capable of getting certain aspects wrong and i should have liked to have had the chance to debate them <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his excellent answer <e> <s> i am delighted that it will be done by regulation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord takes us into a very deep water <e> <s> he must have had some experience in this area <e> <s> i do not know whether in his hospital there is a formulary and so on <e> <s> there is undoubtedly a conflict and it is one which occurs not only in medicine <e> <s> it happens in other professions <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i am aware of his discussions with interested parties <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what comes out of them <e> <s> i utter the plea that what we do in the drug field will be an agreed move forward one involving satisfaction on the part of the secretary of state who is anxious to protect the taxpayer but also one that will not be deeply offensive to the professional people involved <e> <s> i may want to come back to the matter on report but for the moment i thank the noble lord for his reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord since we are on an important matter <e> <s> in fact we are discussing two important matters on the economic side <e> <s> he quoted data and such information usually emanates from the government about increasing real expenditure on the national health service <e> <s> having put that data forward the government always have difficulty in accounting for all the crises that the national health <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not say that <e> <s> i simply say that per cent <e> <s> definitely does not measure what used to be called the volume terms real resources available to the national health service <e> <s> far from it <e>", "<cs> i accept the last remark about which i was as ignorant as anyone else <e> <s> four amendments are grouped together but that standing in my name is more limited than those standing in the names of the noble lord lord kilmarnock and the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> their amendments are better than mine but they are all good amendments which the government should be looking eagerly to accept rather than to damage <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> the lettering of the amendments has now become so complex that i am having great difficulty in keeping up with which is which <e> <s> one day i hope that we shall have a debate on the lettering of amendments <e> <s> i believe that i was speaking to all the amendments but i was concentrating on what i saw as the central issue because i thought it would help your lordships to concentrate on that and on the amendments of the noble lord lord kilmarnock and the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> they seem to get to the heart of the matter which is what i wanted to do <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord because i think he is misunderstanding me and his noble friend lady cox <e> <s> we are not seeking to extend the powers of the audit commission <e> <s> we are questioning whether the words mean anything <e> <s> i do not think they do and i think that the noble lord lord henley is saying that they do not add anything new <e> <s> therefore since the words do not appear to add anything new they are otiose and should not be in the bill <e> <s> one is asking for them not to be in the bill because one has a suspicion that maybe they mean something but the noble lord has just confirmed that they do not mean anything at all <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should make it clear that i am not suggesting that the audit commission should query the objectives of the government <e> <s> it is for members of your lordships house and those in another place to query the objectives of the government <e> <s> i am not suggesting that deleting this will enable the audit commission to query the objectives of the government <e> <s> i am simply saying that since the audit commission would never in any circumstances involve itself in considering the objectives of the government the issue does not arise <e> <s> in other words what the government are seeking to stop is not there to be stopped because it does not happen <e>", "<cs> as a vigorous anti-smoker i am tempted to rise to the bait but i shall not <e> <s> the amendment has nothing to do with nannying but with the saving of life and that is a duty <e> <s> as regards alcohol i draw the noble earls attention to the fact that the word abuse is at issue <e> <s> i assure him that i have no objection to alcohol in quite reasonable quantities <e> <s> however here one has in mind a different point <e> <s> the noble earl will be aware that it is a different phenomenon for those who are alcoholics <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the two amendments i congratulate the two noble baronesses on the excellence of their contributions which have enabled me to cross off most of what i was going to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> for those of us who are interested in the subject the point she is making is important <e> <s> is she saying that those groups are already included within the meaning of the words illness and disability and therefore that the words in the amendment are unnecessary and that no problem can possibly arise <e> <s> the arguments put forward are that the words are necessary and that problems can arise <e> <s> it is a matter of interpreting the law <e> <s> is the noble baroness saying that there is no difficulty because those groups are definitely included <e> <s> can she give an absolute assurance that that is so <e>", "<cs> i thought that this amendment was completely non-controversial until the intervention of the noble baroness <e> <s> i am now obliged to be a trifle controversial which as she knows is not my habit <e> <s> i was going to begin by saying that the matters before us are entirely non-political <e> <s> if one looks at the committee stage of this matter in another place anxieties on this were raised by honourable members of all parties <e> <s> i still believe that there is no political content in the amendments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene because i do not want my noble friend to withdraw his amendment before i ask the noble baroness a question <e> <s> i said earlier that it looked as though the minister of state in the other place was at one stage going to introduce government amendments <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to discussions between officials <e> <s> is there still some possibility of government amendments <e> <s> was the noble baroness trying to convey that to the committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth says what he is going to do with his amendments i wish to ask the noble viscount what we are to make of his broader remarks <e> <s> the government do not deny that a problem exists <e> <s> there is a serious problem here and for the people who buy cars in this area it is a matter of some urgency <e> <s> it is not a trivial matter and it should not be delayed <e> <s> this is the only bill before us <e> <s> there is no government bill <e> <s> however the government will introduce proposals when time allows <e> <s> i could give the noble viscount a long list of government legislation that many of us would not like to see on the statute book <e> <s> if that were dispensed with there would be a great deal of time for a bill of this kind <e> <s> however i shall not bother with such a list at this time <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply which i shall read with care <e> <s> i found some parts of it most reassuring but others rather horrifying and perhaps when the noble lord reads his reply he will reach the same conclusion <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i heard him say age and infirmity and it is precisely because there might be no great age and no infirmity <e>", "<cs> even so i would welcome and i am sure other noble lords would welcome rather more clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to indicate my conservatism by saying how much i agree with the noble earl that the government must take full responsibility for monetary policy <e> <s> equally if monetary policy goes wrong and the inflation rate rises does he not agree that the government must also take full responsibility for that situation <e>", "<cs> i thank noble lords for that interesting debate <e> <s> i am interested to learn that medical education has improved to such an extent that medical students now learn the difference between incidence and prevalence and will presumably learn about other aspects of epidemiology <e> <s> that will stand them in good stead <e>", "<cs> i thank members of the committee for their interesting contributions <e> <s> i thank especially the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale the point which he raised was precisely that which i had in mind when i said that on reflection i was not very happy with the wording of the amendment <e> <s> the matter was further clarified by the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> in that case i must go away as i am sure will other members of the committee and read the bill again <e> <s> however the bill states <e>", "<cs> in absolute terms the noble baroness has now made the point very clearly <e> <s> the bill says that it is where the local authority thinks the assessment is needed <e> <s> the noble baroness does not understand my point which is that the person or carer may think that assessment is needed and may disagree with the local authority <e> <s> that is the whole point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have learnt a great deal this evening <e> <s> we are most indebted to the noble baroness <e> <s> as i understand it with guidelines you are free to choose what you do and with guidance you are free to choose what you do so long as you do what you are told <e> <s> many of us have brought up children on that basis <e>", "<cs> i was a little lost <e> <s> it is my fault and not that of the noble baroness <e> <s> i am delighted as is the noble baroness lady masham to hear that the local authorities have that power and i hope that the local authorities exercise it as required <e> <s> having said that and having thanked the noble baroness lady hooper for clarifying these matters i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments <e> <s> i agree that it would be best if they were accepted and included in the bill <e> <s> what the amendments say corresponds with what anyone would regard as good practice <e> <s> it would be silly if an authority having become involved in this did not do what the amendments require <e> <s> nonetheless there are good reasons for making it clear that authorities ought to <e> <s> the alternative having listened to the noble baroness lady hooper reply to an earlier amendment would be to do it under guidance <e> <s> that now seems to carry great weight <e> <s> i wait to hear whether the government will either accept the amendment which i think would be the best course or tell us that guidance will be the way that they will do it which means that they will do it <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i am delighted to discover that not only work but thought has gone into preparing the governments case on these and related matters <e> <s> i shall not reminisce on my own happy days in the public service and so on <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord rises perhaps i may ask whether the noble baroness is aware that her answer to this question pre-empts the answer given by her noble friend on the previous amendment <e> <s> it still seemed to be somewhat doubtful exactly what was being inspected <e> <s> the noble baroness lady blatch has now said in terms that there is no doubt whatever that the quality of care being provided is to be inspected whereas earlier there was some doubt as to whether that was so <e> <s> it may well be that in order fully to understand the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone we need the clarification that we were promised on the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> i am indebted to the noble lord <e> <s> i have to tell him that rugby is not my game <e> <s> however there are other games that one could take seriously <e> <s> by his analogy he raises a vital point <e> <s> in terms of community care there is no substitute for the devotion that the voluntary bodies bring to this area <e> <s> i take that to be the analogy to the amateur spirit to which he referred <e> <s> however i make the same point about sports and games as i do about community care it is better to do the thing properly <e> <s> i even believe that about rugby which is a game that i do not particularly care for <e> <s> i always thought that it was a girls game played by rather brutish men <e>", "<cs> no question of payment has arisen on the amendment <e> <s> with regard to rugby i thought it was an amateur game although i should like to see it played professionally <e> <s> i believe that rugby league is a professional game <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i do not go through the whole sporting calendar in detail <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could interrupt the minister because i do not want her to be too kind to me <e> <s> i meant what i said <e> <s> i do not for one moment doubt the contribution that the voluntary sector makes <e> <s> i am also well aware that it contains a number of people who are very capable <e> <s> however i meant bumbling along with the gifted amateur <e> <s> it is what is wrong with the country not what is wrong with the voluntary sector <e> <s> i do not withdraw the remark even if the noble baroness becomes angry with me <e> <s> it is what i meant to say <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords for taking part in this interesting discussion <e> <s> perhaps i may start with the question put by the noble lord lord swinfen <e> <s> he poses a very interesting problem <e> <s> i for one hold the organisations he has in mind in the <e>", "<cs> that is a very good question <e> <s> if what i am now doing is as a politician occasionally i am horrified to find myself referred to as such i have to say to the noble lord that i consider myself a bumbling amateur <e> <s> i am not good at it <e> <s> however if the noble lord will allow me to go on to discuss public expenditure i would regard myself as not merely an expert but as an expert with very few rivals <e> <s> in that case i have not the slightest difficulty in referring to myself as a professional <e> <s> however where i am a bumbling amateur i welcome a great deal of help from the noble lord and others to do my job slightly better <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord but let me add that i did not use the word reputable and therefore by contrast the word disreputable <e> <s> i do not suggest that the question of being reputable arises in any way <e> <s> however i ask noble lords and specifically the noble lord lord swinfen to bear in mind the point i made that voluntary organisations are themselves extremely keen on these amendments <e> <s> they want to see these proposals accepted as i understood did the noble lord lord swinfen <e> <s> it is simply my being obstinate and refusing to back down on the question of amateur versus professional which may get between us on this matter but perhaps the noble lord will bear with me and allow me to be obstinate <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment on behalf of the official opposition i take the opportunity of congratulating the noble lord lord seebohm on not merely his introduction to this amendment but on his own major contribution in this area <e> <s> i do not say that to him because we expect to pension him off in the immediate future but simply because the area of social services will be forever indebted to him for his contribution <e>", "<cs> i think that we should clarify a point which seems to me to be quite fundamental <e> <s> it concerns the first part of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord seebohm namely subsection which starts with the words <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps preface my question by saying that i am not against indicative drug budgets because they seem to be a broadly sensible way of approaching the problem of prescribing <e> <s> is the minister saying that in the governments view we have debated the matter sufficiently and that no case can be made for having the affirmative procedure <e> <s> as i understand it i remain a tyro in these matters whether it is the affirmative or negative procedure does not affect what happens in this place but it may affect what happens in the other place <e> <s> is the minister saying that we have explored these drug budgets in so much detail and that the remaining details are so uncontroversial that the affirmative procedure would not be relevant to the other place <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord carter has the same view i am not seeking to undermine or wreck the bill with this proposal but there are certain matters about which people who are affected the pharmaceutical companies are a good example are to say the least a trifle doubtful <e> <s> does the minister intend to be as definite in her answer as she sounded <e>", "<cs> my lords employment in manufacturing is already declining <e> <s> according to the governments own forecast employment may continue to decline and unemployment rise at a faster pace in the coming year <e> <s> bearing that in mind is it not a singularly inappropriate time for the government to be interfering with english industrial estates which everyone agrees has done an extremely good job <e> <s> surely what is required is that the government give it more support rather than talk of selling off its assets <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the government will confirm my understanding from what i have read in the newspapers <e> <s> i do not have the advantages of the noble viscount <e> <s> are the government totally committed to the continuation of english industrial estates <e> <s> will it continue to have sufficient resources to do the job that it has done so well until now <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how pleased i am at the ministers last remark <e> <s> is she able to throw any light on what this is all about <e> <s> two extremely good history teachers seem on the face of it to have been very badly treated <e> <s> your lordships have debated the matter before no one seems to be able to put a finger on precisely what is going on <e> <s> it seems to be beyond any reasonable sort of behaviour to suggest that the two teachers have done anything wrong <e> <s> does the ministers department have any knowledge of the matter <e> <s> in particular can we be told what is the alleged offence of the two teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to this point but the noble baroness seems to be throwing salt into the wound <e> <s> there appears to be some implication that these two people have done something wrong <e> <s> they have a view of history quite different to mine but that is not an offence against anything that i can think of <e> <s> will the noble baroness at least assure the house that if her right honourable friend the secretary of state hears fom the two teachers he will act rapidly and make it abundantly clear as i believe will turn out to be the case that these are two reputable people who are simply trying to do their jobs as teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i never like to introduce a note of controversy and of course i entirely accept what has been said about the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> however perhaps the noble baroness will address the point raised by the noble earl lord clanwilliam <e> <s> does she agree that it is the case that any drug because of the great amount of good it does is always potentially dangerous <e> <s> because it can do some good it can also do some harm <e> <s> the nonsensical drugs put forward under the name of homoeopathy and so on may well have little effect in terms of doing harm but the reason is that they also have little effect in doing good <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness saying that they are available because their effect is negligible and therefore the government do not feel that there is need to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that her answer is a trifle bizarre <e> <s> is she aware that the ratio of taxation to incomes has been higher throughout the governments period of office than it ever was under the previous labour government <e> <s> if it is true it is in terms of the governments published figures that more seems to be spent on health at present than years ago how does she account for the acute crisis and lack of beds in all the major london teaching hospitals which apart from anything else place at risk the lives of members of your lordships house every day of the week <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is report stage <e> <s> i thought i was allowed to ask a question <e> <s> indeed i know that i am because i consulted the clerks who told me that i am allowed to ask a question with all respect to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords on a matter of order it is not just a question of catching us on the hop because it will very much complicate questions of voting and decision-making generally <e> <s> if i may be as blunt as i possibly can i am extremely concerned that the amendment to which the noble baroness lady young has spoken will be accepted on the grounds as i understand it that it may be acceptable to the government <e> <s> i have no knowledge although i hope that it is the case whether the amendment to which the noble baroness lady cox is about to speak will also be acceptable to the government <e> <s> but if this amendment is dealt with earlier than the other amendment we shall find ourselves in some difficulty about dividing the house <e> <s> i am wondering whether any enlightenment can be thrown on any of those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords this may well be out of order but i should like to ask a question <e> <s> were it to happen that amendment no <e> <s> of the noble baroness lady cox was passed is there any information that we can be given about what the government view as the consequences of that because we should then be debating the amended version of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with a great deal of sadness especially after the intervention of the noble lord lord walton of detchant <e> <s> i was concerned about our procedure which i entirely accept is standard procedure because i did not want to make the speech that i am about to make about the role of the universities and conduct an argument between the universities and the polytechnics <e> <s> but i shall now have to make it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point but i do not see the logic of it at all <e> <s> we are here discussing due consideration for the appropriate membership of the regional health authority <e> <s> desirable though it is to bring money to the table it cannot possibly bear the weight of the argument that we are discussing <e> <s> we are discussing something deeper in terms of public policy <e> <s> the polytechnics engage in this kind of education and training and no one doubts the importance of their contribution <e> <s> the universities also engage in it <e> <s> i have to underline the fact that i am not trying undermine amendment no <e> <s> in any sense whatever <e> <s> i am simply saying that the logic attached to amendment no <e> <s> carries over to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness and also apologise to her for not having looked fully at my notes when making my own speech <e> <s> on the last occasion she made the point that she has just made <e> <s> i found what she said extremely encouraging <e> <s> however i meant to ask her this time how the people making the appointments will obtain that information <e> <s> will it become a standard procedure to ask anyone who is likely to be appointed to declare their interests so that they can be ruled out if they have the wrong interests <e> <s> how will the minister or whoever else is involved obtain the relevant information <e> <s> i am sorry to have to come back to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> she has thrown a little more light on the issue although as always having thrown some light on it she has raised another matter which leaves me again confused <e> <s> i seem to go backwards every time i go forwards <e> <s> did i understand her to say that the matter would be dealt with by regulations and not by guidance <e> <s> i did not think that it was a question of either regulations or guidance <e> <s> i thought that one could have both regulations and guidance <e> <s> is the noble baroness saying that it will not be included in guidance but it will be in regulations or that it will be in regulations and may also be in guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness very much for that answer <e> <s> although i should obviously prefer my amendments to be on the face <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the motive behind the noble lords amendment <e> <s> we should remind ourselves that we are discussing consumer protection <e> <s> clearly a tamper-proof odometer would be the ultimate in consumer protection in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i well understand the noble lords reasons for moving the amendment <e> <s> i have one concern <e> <s> as i understand it the insurance industry is somewhat worried about the excess burden which this provision might place on it <e> <s> it is not obvious to me that the bill is improved by adding these words even though the noble lord was responding to the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> i wonder whether he consulted the insurance industry before adding these words to the bill <e> <s> i do not want my remarks to be interpreted as in any way moving back from my support for the bill <e> <s> however it would be a pity to do anything which added undesirably to the costs of the insurance industry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may say that she has somewhat avoided the primary question namely what would happen if appropriate budgetary provision was not made <e> <s> as i understand it it is all very well for the secretary of state to say that he would like it to happen and to write some letters <e> <s> however if it does not happen there is nothing in the bill to enable him to ensure that it happens <e> <s> therefore setting aside wording which never bothers us we can always get that right surely the point of the amendment is this if the government are serious about the matter i understand that they are strongly committed to it they should either accept the amendment or rewrite it in a form which meets those aims <e> <s> i believe that i am right in saying that the secretary of state has no powers to insist that an integrated comprehensive child health service should be appropriately financed <e> <s> at present all he can do is to encourage and advise <e> <s> the amendment is at least important enough for the noble baroness to take it away and see what she can do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of your lordships perhaps i may rise again <e> <s> i have checked with the clerks that i am able to rise so long as the noble lord does not object to me doing so which i hope that he does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall ask a question namely will the noble baroness address herself to the point that she raised <e> <s> the point of the amendment is <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return the compliment to the noble baroness lady masham who was good enough to support an earlier amendment of mine <e> <s> she has argued the case totally successfully and i wish to emphasise how much i support what she had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to the amendment i bitterly regret that we should be discussing it at oclock at night because the topic of national health service waiting times is one of the most interesting and one of the most difficult to account for <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord to clarify a point <e> <s> i am asking a question <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord lord morris that the rules of procedure allow me to ask a question <e> <s> the noble lord has been jumping up and down for the past two hours implying that we cannot ask questions <e> <s> i have consulted the clerks on this matter and i assure him that i am allowed to ask a question <e> <s> he may not want me to ask a question <e> <s> he may feel that it is rather late <e> <s> i too feel that it is rather late and i wish that the government would organise the business so that i was not obliged to discuss serious matters of this kind at such a late hour <e> <s> however if the noble lord insists on interrupting me i shall deal with his point but i shall waste a great deal more time <e> <s> i should be most obliged if he would allow me to ask my question <e> <s> i should also be obliged if he would not interrupt me every time i ask a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> i wish that we had time to pursue the matter further still in particular the point arising from the question of the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> the real point is that there is as it were tort and tort <e> <s> if an operation goes wrong one can see the nature of the problem arising with respect to the operation <e> <s> but if a person wished to argue that he did not want the operation done in that hospital in the first place he would be seeking damages from the district that produced the contract <e> <s> that seems to be something that requires more thinking about <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies perhaps i may supplement what my noble friend lord ennals said so that we are all clear about what we are debating <e> <s> i must point out to the noble lords lord walton and lord butterfield that these are not problems that can arise these are the intentions of the government <e> <s> if one does not see that their purpose in the area of salaries is to free these people to choose the salaries they wish one does not understand the nature of the reform <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for explaining what the amendments mean <e> <s> i have been puzzling over them <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that she referred only to assets donated to the hospitals <e> <s> i have the obvious question why does the amendment not use the actual words assets <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the noble baroness has changed her answer which was most cogent and acceptable <e> <s> she now agrees that the amendment gives the secretary of state much wider powers <e> <s> the minister said that the amendment was for a particular purpose and she did not say it was for any other <e> <s> does she insist on her broader answer <e> <s> that is a matter of much greater seriousness when we come to study the operations of the trusts <e> <s> in principle and purely theoretically once a provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to delay your lordships <e> <s> i hope that this is a technical matter <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm that the effect of the amendment is to leave the position in scotland no less open and accountable than that in england <e> <s> i take it that that is exactly what he is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord henley and also the noble lord lord walton <e> <s> i apologise to the minister for not saying at the outset that this was a probing amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment which also stands in my name for the reasons that the noble baroness lady masham put forward so cogently on introducing it <e> <s> having listened to the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter lord mottistone and lord swinfen i now feel more strongly that i was right to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords having fallen foul of the rules last week i do not propose to have an argument with the noble lord this week <e> <s> i shall so to speak keep my powder dry for another occasion when we know what we can or cannot say <e> <s> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> much of what he says makes good sense <e> <s> in particular i see the logic of what he says about the budget when it is first set up <e> <s> i have some anxiety but it is for general medical practitioners to decide what they want to do <e> <s> they will find themselves more involved with accounting than medicine <e> <s> but as the noble lord said no one is obliged to be a fund-holding practitioner if that is the word <e> <s> we obviously differ <e> <s> not only is no one obliged but few i believe will want to do it <e> <s> the noble lord thinks that more will agree to become budget-holders <e>", "<cs> my lords i recommend the amendment in the names of the noble lords lord walton of detchant lord hunter of newington and myself <e> <s> i hope very much that we are pushing at an open door <e> <s> given that the government have accepted the amendment of the noble lord lord butterfield we must now refer to indicative amounts and not indicative budgets <e> <s> that presents me with a great problem <e> <s> i had become accustomed to indicative budgets i shall now have to try to get into the habit of using indicative amounts <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will forgive me if i interrupt the noble baroness but it is very important that we do not debate at cross-purposes <e> <s> does she accept that the amendment was put down as a result of the reassurance that her right honourable friend the secretary of state gave <e> <s> her noble friends may have made good points but they have nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> we live in a finite world and there are finite resources <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is simply to put down what her right honourable friend the secretary of state said <e> <s> does she agree that the remarks of her two noble friends are totally beside the point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will not wish to speak before i say simply that we support the amendments <e> <s> i am not clear that they are of equal importance but i should particularly like to agree with the noble baroness lady mcfarlane in emphasising the importance of continuing education <e> <s> i do not seek to undermine the importance of research but nothing can be more important than

speaking to the amendment i had intended to concentrate entirely on general principles <e> <s> however i was most struck by the comments of the noble lord lord kilmarnock about the experience of the terrence higgins trust <e> <s> one of the great anxieties in relation to such cases is that although the government rightly say that they wish to safeguard taxpayers funds and ensure that resources are used efficiently they end up with a bureaucracy so complex that one wastes vast amounts of money on form filling <e> <s> that is undoubtedly to the detriment of the service in which one is interested <e> <s> the noble lords point is well taken <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble baroness said is terribly important <e> <s> to clarify her statement on the governments position is she saying that ordinarily resident means exactly where you are at the moment <e> <s> you do not have to establish any local connection other than that <e> <s> is she saying that that is what was said earlier and that that is what it means <e> <s> is she saying that all the other worries about establishing a local connection in other legislation will not apply to community care from now on <e>",

cannot argue <e> <s> i just want to make sure that she knows what she is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak briefly to this amendment which stands in the names of the noble lords lord

need any legislation <e> <s> it would all happen automatically <e> <s> as i understand it the point of writing legislation is to make people do the right thing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord

potential for returns <e> <s> that is precisely the view that the japanese and germans are taking <e> <s> will the minister not at least suggest to his right honourable friend that some return to the

he likes under the act and get away with it <e> <s> the regulations are wrong <e> <s> i am willing to delay this matter but if noble lords are prepared to agree a set of regulations that are wrong then it is for noble lords to say <e> <s> i am not mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness surely agrees that there are great difficulties with the reported figures <e> <s> they could be the tip of an iceberg although our hope is that that is not the case <e> <s> the problem is that we do not know very much about the scale of this appalling form of behaviour <e> <s> is the department financing research first into trying to get a clear picture of the extent of child abuse and secondly into factors which might eventually throw more light on the causes of this appalling aberrant behaviour <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand as regards this tragic case that the noble baroness said earlier that the government believe that resources were not the point at issue <e> <s> if that is true does she not agree that there must have been incompetence and a failure on the part of the wandsworth council and health authority <e> <s> if that is the case surely the government cannot wash their hands of the affair but should be adopting a more active part in seeing that that sort of thing does not happen again <e> <s> in the end a child died and as my noble friend lord jenkins pointed out other children are at risk <e> <s> the government cannot let this matter go by the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble lord will forgive my intervention but he was speaking very fast <e> <s> there is one point i should like him to clarify <e> <s> he referred to the uprating of research council awards <e> <s> am i correct in thinking that he said that they will be uprated in april <e> <s> does that mean that the uprating will then be payable from the following academic year so that the point made by my noble friend lady blackstone is entirely right in other words it will be another full year before research council awards are actually uprated <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who is pro nuclear i find it interesting to see that there is no limit to the different arguments invented for nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important report which raises a host of fascinating subjects <e> <s> i will confine my remarks to only a few of the topics under consideration <e> <s> i start on the question of method and in connection with that and in congratulating the noble baroness lady brigstocke on her maiden speech i reiterate what she said <e> <s> there are many first-class language teachers in our schools but that of course is why we want such teachers for all our pupils <e> <s> we must not be content with second best or unqualified teachers especially in the maintained schools in our country <e> <s> the noble baroness said that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i was tempted to make that remark but i did not have the courage <e> <s> the noble lord is clearly more courageous than i am <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl reflect further upon the question of my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> i speak as someone who is in favour of joining the erm indeed i would have joined some time ago <e> <s> nonetheless does he agree that this is not just a matter for technical economic analysis <e> <s> surely as my noble friend said this is a situation in which we must take the people of this country with us <e> <s> further can the noble earl give us guidance as to what the government have done in this connection <e> <s> i am not aware of any effort on their part to persuade the people of this country in exactly the form put forward by my noble friend of the desirability as some of us believe it to be of joining the erm <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may pursue the issue of criteria <e> <s> bearing in mind the fact that the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that doctors nurses and paramedics tend to be opposed to self-governing status and that it is only the management staff who seem to think that they will do well out of it will the secretary of state in making such a decision actually make public in documentary form the precise reasons to which my noble friend referred as to why he took the decision in the way he did <e> <s> in other words will the reasons as to why the hospital concerned did or did not meet the required standards become public knowledge <e> <s> alternatively will he simply say yes or no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to pursue this matter but my noble friend asked an important question <e> <s> perhaps i may clarify the position in regard to your lordships house <e> <s> if a particular hospital were granted self-governing status would members of this house be able to ask precisely why this had happened <e> <s> alternatively if such questions were asked would the minister if it were his job to do so simply rise and say my right honourable friend the secretary of state has taken this decision and there is nothing more to be said <e> <s> that would be a very serious situation given the way in which we have debated such matters in this chamber <e> <s> we need to know upon what basis especially in terms of public documentation we shall be able to examine such decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for introducing the regulations <e> <s> i have a number of specific questions to ask her but not surprisingly i take this opportunity to make one or two comments <e> <s> i shall not speak at great length because i feel that this is one of those areas where there is no meeting of minds or perhaps there is a meeting of minds in the sense that we simply agree to disagree <e> <s> in the past i have railed against the method of using public funds as have my predecessors <e> <s> however the government have stuck to their view and i do not think that either side has made any concessions <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness so that we know what we are talking about <e> <s> are the salaries that she quoted what i refer to as net income and what the regulations refer to as relevant income or was she quoting the figure that i asked for which was gross salaries <e> <s> i have a feeling that she quoted the former <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the noble baroness is completely confident about that answer <e> <s> i must say that i find it almost impossible to believe <e> <s> nonetheless i am willing to wait for further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> on reflection i wonder whether she is <e>", "<cs> my lords i protest strongly against this curtailment <e> <s> i asked my question in a perfectly <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to judge whether the government are being reassuring <e> <s> does the noble baroness not recognise that new lectureships hardly represents one per east european country <e> <s> it does not seem a great deal to me <e> <s> in particular following the remarks that have been made does she not recognise that we are not simply talking about the soviet union but about a great many other countries and the study not only of the languages but of the economies of those countries has been neglected for a great many years <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree that there will be enormous economic benefits if the government give the lead in seeing that a great deal more research takes place in those areas <e> <s> it is not just a matter of languages there are markets and investment opportunities <e> <s> to take an obvious example czechoslovakia alone is a country for which we need lectureships <e> <s> while i do not wish to criticise the government will the noble baroness recognise that we are trying to encourage her to see that a great deal more is done <e>", "<cs> in speaking on this amendment i emphasise that we are discussing a matter of copyright law and that no political implication is involved <e> <s> having said that i cannot resist the remark that i find it somewhat paradoxical that i from this front bench should be pressing for the protection of property rights and that noble lords opposite on the government front bench are the ones resisting <e> <s> legal historians in the future will be extremely puzzled at the exchange of what would be thought to be the normal philosophical positions on this matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is doing his best but i have to correct him <e> <s> he is simply mistaken <e> <s> i have been advised that the case was decided in precisely the correct way and not in the way the noble lord described <e> <s> i am sorry to have to correct the noble lord because like him i am not one to correct people <e> <s> however this matter is so important that we must get everything we say here right <e>", "<cs> the ministers answer was helpful <e> <s> may i take it to mean we do not want to delay matters now because i feel that i could rebut some of the points that he has made and we may be able to solve some of the problems that the government are willing to talk to us about these matters before report stage <e> <s> do i understand him to be at least as encouraging as that without of course there being any commitment from the government <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support the amendment <e> <s> while we agree that sections of the media are different we believe that those who show the news on television should have the same kind of approach as is used in newspapers <e> <s> just as it is reasonable to show the winning cup final goal in a newspaper it is equally reasonable to be able to show it on television <e> <s> this is an important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> is he aware what a pleasure it is for all noble lords to see the noble lord answering a question for the first time from the government front bench <e> <s> we all wish him well <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to my noble friend lord willis for introducing the amendment and to the two noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i say with great regret that my opening remarks must be ones of complaint <e> <s> in committee i asked whether because the matter was highly technical and because it was very late at night i could see the relevant minister <e> <s> i did not wish then to delay matters by going into great detail <e> <s> i was given an <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl does not wish to impugn my honour on this matter or suggest that i am not telling the truth <e> <s> i telephoned his office and was told that his office was not dealing with this issue because the noble earl is not an expert in the matter <e> <s> therefore i have certainly telephoned his office and i am most upset if that information was not communicated to him <e> <s> i was told that the relevant office to ring of which i was well aware was the department of trade and industry <e> <s> i hope that he will take my word that i rang that office on more than one occasion <e> <s> therefore if i am in a resentful mood i am resentful at his suggestion that i did not do exactly what i said i did <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot have all this to-ing and fro-ing but i do not understand the noble earls argument <e> <s> he has put his finger as i thought i did on the absolutely central view that we know what the law was supposed to mean <e> <s> there was never any argument about it <e> <s> before the case no one was writing articles saying that there was a problem it has only arisen after the case <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that her right honourable friend the secretary of state has said first that he does not know whether teaching standards have fallen and secondly at col of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the autumn statement <e> <s> it is extremely difficult to comment on it as one has it in ones hands only an hour before doing so <e> <s> i was always amazed at how well my noble friend lord bruce of donington coped in such circumstances <e> <s> now that i have to comment on the statement i am even more appreciative of his achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not for one moment wish to underestimate the achievements of my colleagues and i in academic life <e> <s> i just wanted the expression higher education qualifications to be defined for me <e> <s> i did not want to underestimate the achievements <e> <s> i simply wanted to know the meaning of the expression <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the minister on his answer <e> <s> he always says that he has had no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still at a loss <e> <s> this is a straightforward question in which the word approve appears <e> <s> are we not entitled to an answer <e> <s> does the noble lord disapprove of this activity <e> <s> there is no doubt that it took place <e> <s> will he not at least tell your lordships that he disapproves of it <e> <s> that is the important part of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords as a minimum therefore i assume the noble lord will say that he approves of people obeying the law <e> <s> will he at least say that <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the relevant topics have been covered <e> <s> i hope therefore that i shall be forgiven if i concentrate on only a few themes <e> <s> of course i begin by congratulating my noble friend lady castle on her maiden speech <e> <s> i was particularly impressed by the balance of her exposition and by her objectivity <e> <s> perhaps i may echo the words of the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> i cannot wait to hear her when she feels truly able to speak her mind <e>", "<cs> my lords there is merely a conflict of fact <e> <s> i believe that one should get ones facts right <e> <s> he said that nine years is unprecedented but is a larger number than nine <e> <s> therefore he is simply mistaken <e> <s> that is the only point i am making <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former chief examiner at a-level i believe that the noble baroness exaggerates the quality of the standards but we can leave that on one side <e> <s> will the noble baroness take more seriously the remarks made by the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> is she not aware that pouring into our universities every year are for example students of science engineering and i regret to say this economics who know nothing about the history of their country or who certainly do not retain such knowledge <e> <s> they have no interest in literature which is a subject they drop once they have done it at o-level <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness quotes many figures <e> <s> has the minister actually visited any schools recently <e> <s> the best evidence is that obtained with our own eyes <e> <s> does the noble bareness not agree that if one visits a large number of schools in our country one sees that they are desperately in need of refurbishment <e> <s> is it not also the case that that is an extremely efficient way to invest our resources <e> <s> if we do not refurbish them they will fall down and the cost in due course will be that much higher <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in great difficulty about how to open my contribution to this debate <e> <s> my noble friend lord longford mentioned my failure to discuss the subject of religion on the last occasion i spoke <e> <s> i shall tell him that quite honestly if i were a free agent i would devote the whole of my speech to that subject <e> <s> however i am not a free agent for a reason that he will understand <e> <s> some years ago my wife told me that under no circumstances should i ever express my views on religion in public indeed if she had her way i would not express them in private <e> <s> i should point out to my noble friend that underlying all my views on education are classical liberal principles that is principles of freedom of thought and freedom of expression and certainly therefore i shall never be one to prevent those in the religious business from expressing their views on education <e> <s> i only wish that they would show a similar tolerance towards people who share my views on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to get worse <e> <s> the noble lord has made it clear that he does not understand anything about this subject <e> <s> perhaps i may make it clear to him that at the height of my <e>"]
