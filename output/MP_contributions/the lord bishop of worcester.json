["<cs> my lords i am sure we are grateful to the noble lord lord spens for the manner in which he has introduced this debate <e> <s> we are glad indeed that the government are ready to consider these issues at this very early date <e> <s> it also falls to me to express our gratitude to the noble earl lord gowrie for his statement on behalf of the government <e> <s> we note the categories of unemployment that he has outlined <e> <s> we also note the economic policies directed to them <e> <s> a number of us will be given a degree of reassurance <e> <s> nevertheless there seem to be some very important basic issues here and some short term policies to which i should like to draw the attention of the administration <e>", "<cs> my lords to enjoy two maiden speeches in one afternoon on a similar subject is a privilege that we do not often have in this house <e> <s> it is a particular pleasure is it not to congratulate the noble baroness lady airey on her speech <e> <s> over the years many of us have appreciated herself her revered husband and her family for the manner in which they have exercised care and understanding not only for our heritage but for a great deal else <e> <s> we hope to hear more from her <e> <s> also indeed i am sure we should express our appreciation to the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> clearly both from her interesting account and indeed from her experience your lordships house will benefit i hope in future a great deal from her comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are extremely grateful to the noble lord lord scanlon <e> <s> he has introduced this afternoon a matter of the utmost importance and if i may say so speaking for those of us who are given the splendid term of prelate we are extremely grateful for this lead that has been taken for many of us who are affected very deeply <e> <s> i speak also as chairman of the manpower services commission in birmingham and the west midlands <e> <s> i should like to make a few remarks basic to the issue of training <e> <s> obviously i am not in a position to talk along the particularities of the noble lord lord howie nor am i able to anticipate the speech of the noble lord lord boardman <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the ministers assurance that there will be a further element of training within the yo programme <e> <s> will the minister comment on the wide differences in financial allowances presently given to those training under the msc those who attend colleges of further education and those few who are left in proper apprenticeship schemes <e> <s> the divergence of government allowances in these cases is a very serious issue for this age group <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no small responsibility to follow a maiden speech of quality and one containing such information <e> <s> we have with us a noble lord who reflects years of exper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the present determination in england to establish joint roman catholic church schools under the grant-aided system and in view of the fact that very distinct conversations are going on with the churches in england on this matter could i have an assurance that the experience they are learning in this country will be conveyed to those on the other side of the irish sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in the welcome and congratulations to lord stodart of leaston on his maiden speech <e> <s> we reiterate the words of the noble lord lord aylestone in all that he has said about him <e> <s> perhaps it is salutary that a bishop from the particularly english establishment should be reminded once again of the wisdom that comes from north of the border <e> <s> we are very appreciative of it <e> <s> my lords it has been a privilege for those of us who hold episcopal office and sit on these episcopal benches to take a regular share in the thinking and debating on the wider issues confronting our nation <e> <s> i rise sadly for myself for the last time before i relinquish the see of worcester in a few days time which will not permit me to make a contribution next week <e>", "<cs> my lords all members of the house will understand that one could have wished to make ones maiden speech on a subject less doleful than this especially when required to be uncontroversial <e> <s> one dreams of a maiden speech in which one propounds pleasantries on the development of english campanology in northern italy <e> <s> one can be fairly sure that only a few members of the house would become contentious on that issue <e> <s> but no there is this very important debate and we are grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for bringing it before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> had i put the question last wednesday as i had intended he would not have been able to give that answer <e> <s> however i am glad that one from these benches has had the opportunity of congratulating her majestys government for something that they have done <e> <s> many people will be grateful for what has been done in the budget <e> <s> will the noble lord agree with this <e> <s> in view of the fact that an important principle is involved namely the support and encouragement of marriage as a key part of our society and also in view of the fact that we have been able to grant tax concessions in other sectors of our land the concession should have been granted forthwith rather than in <e>", "<cs> i am in difficulty here because i would greatly welcome anything that would make available more rented property to those in need <e> <s> however i greatly fear that the government will give with one hand and take away with the other <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that an act exists dated which provides for a fixed date for easter <e> <s> it only requires an order in council for that to be implemented <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that that would probably be greatly welcomed by the christian community and would put us alongside the synod of whitby and st hilda <e>", "<cs> i should like to make two comments of a general nature <e> <s> the environmental issues have been well rehearsed in this chamber and in the press and figures of great importance have been quoted this afternoon <e> <s> there is no need to add to that <e> <s> however i should like to see the noble lords amendment placed on the face of the bill thereby firmly placing on the government of the day the duty to control these matters and to do all in their power to ensure that the environment is enhanced and protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go back to worcester in the course of duty without saying that i greatly hope that the reassurance will be given <e> <s> this amendment has been effectively supported by all sides of the house <e> <s> one must remember that the matter concerns communities as well as individuals <e> <s> i can take noble lords to villages in worcestershire where young people can live no longer <e> <s> they are very close to retirement communities where it is not worth while having a shop a school or a pub <e> <s> there has been a flight from the countryside <e> <s> people cannot find low cost housing and have to live in the town and commute to the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord parry for initiating the debate <e> <s> it raises important human issues about housing work the quality of life and the need to maintain valid communities <e> <s> having been brought up in the danelaw i cannot emulate his celtic eloquence but i shall try to contribute from my experience of rural communities <e> <s> i want to say how much i admire the patent sincerity of the noble lord in telling us about the east of england <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may now continue with the debate on the environment <e> <s> i must admit that alas my emotions have gone from anxiety about hong kong and other matters and they now centre upon the doorkeepers christmas dinner <e> <s> therefore i think that we must be swift in our speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should apologise for not having my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> i should thank also the noble baroness lady blatch for showing kindness to a bishop who has gone astray <e> <s> however i was not in time to put my name on the list <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that helpful and optimistic answer <e> <s> does he not agree however that the programme newsnight last night highlighted the fact that many of those who are sleeping rough are young people or children <e> <s> of those per cent are estimated to have disappeared from any lists <e> <s> will the minister therefore reassure us that among the resources which the government are making available there will be personnel to help those people get back on lists so that they can receive the benefits to which they are entitled <e> <s> will the minister also ensure that a computer is provided so we may know how many young people are missing at any given time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his full and comprehensive reply <e> <s> i am grateful that the debate has been so interesting and has elicited so many <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is not inappropriate for me as a fairly new member of this house to say how impressive i found the first two speeches in the debate with their note of solemn responsibility in the face of the present crisis and near unanimity <e> <s> i thank the noble earl and the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e>"]
