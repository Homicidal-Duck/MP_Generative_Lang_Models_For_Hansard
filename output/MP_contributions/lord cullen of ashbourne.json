["<cs> my lords since announcing his plans for the future of the hospital my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services has asked the north east thames regional health authority to establish a project team jointly with the area health authority the elizabeth garrett anderson hospital and those concerned at university college hospital to prepare proposals for the development of the hospital <e> <s> the regional health authority has already initiated discussions with all interested parties <e> <s> in addition my honourable friend the minister of state for health has had informal discussions with representatives of the action committee on the question of raising funds from voluntary sources <e>", "<cs> my lords many discussions have taken place already with the doctors the staff of the ega and the action committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the decision was the result of long discussions with the authorities concerned <e> <s> the noble lord knows a very great deal about this subject as the house has heard many times in the past and he will be aware that the government intend to make an arrangement whereby the million approximate cost will be shared between the government and voluntary bodies and discussions are now taking place on how this should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall have to write a letter to the noble lord i cannot find the relevant information in my brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely so and in many cases on religious grounds too <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a little early to ask these questions because the decision has only just been reached <e> <s> the project team which will be going into all the details has now been established <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware of that and so is the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no evidence to suggest that there is a general problem although no doubt there is variation between areas <e> <s> if the noble baroness has a particular case in mind i would suggest that she take it up with the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> the court report was really a review of the childrens health service and discussions have been taking place with all concerned <e> <s> these discussions are continuing and there has been also a steering committee set up on the warnock report and a submission <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is a resident nurse in all schools of pupils or more <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and is to increase the maximum penalties for directors who knowingly and wilfully contravene permit or authorise the contravention of clause <e> <s> the clause as drafted treats the offence as falling into the least serious category of offences which does not permit trial on indictment and sets the maximum fine on summary conviction at <e> <s> the amendment would substantially increase the maximum penalties <e> <s> on conviction on indictment the maximum would be two years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine and on summary conviction an unlimited fine <e>", "<cs> i confirm what my noble friend said that we do propose to accept the later amenment <e> <s> i hope that under those circumstances the noble lord will withdrawn his amendment <e>", "<cs> this clause is less controversial both in context and in drafting than those which appear on either side of it in the marshalled list <e> <s> the clause together with those that follow it prescribes the general rules and restrictions which should apply to directors entering into transactions with the companies on the boards of which they serve <e> <s> that there is a need for a reform of the law in this area is not in dispute <e> <s> however we will argue later in debates on later clauses dealing with this general subject that some of these clauses reveal major areas of disagreement seriously defective drafting and internal inconsistencies <e> <s> i hope i shall be able to persuade the noble lord that the sensible course is for the government not to rush headlong into such a technically difficult area without proper consideration and consultation <e>", "<cs> i first should like to say to the noble lord lord mishcon that i fully appreciate that he is trying to hurry things along we certainly appreciate it from this side of the committee <e> <s> this clause prohibits a company from transferring without the approval of the general meeting any substantial property to and by a director a director of its holding company or a person or company connected with a director <e> <s> the clause also provides what are to be the consequences in civil law for any transaction entered into in contravention of the clause <e>", "<cs> it will not surprise the noble lord if i say that of this series of amendments all regarding directors we cannot accept this amendment piecemeal in the middle of the other clauses <e> <s> i ask my noble friends to resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is another in a series of clauses about directors <e> <s> we have said several times that we would rather not take piecemeal one particular clause out of this series and i ask my noble friends to resist this amendment <e>", "<cs> this is rather a different matter and in our opinion this clause amounts to an unwarrantable invasion of personal privacy <e> <s> it would for example require a director to reveal to his company the existence and identity of an illegitimate child or an estranged wife even though there might be no question of any transaction or loan between these and the company <e> <s> it is surely totally unreasonable to force every company to maintain details of their directors wives children and the rest simply on the off-chance that some of them will do business with connected persons <e> <s> what is more it is unnecessary <e> <s> the jenkins committee made proposals for improving the present rules relating to disclosure of directors interests <e> <s> in our view these recommendations offer a better route to the objective aimed at in the present clause <e> <s> we will consider further precisely how these recommendations might be adapted and adopted in the context of our more general study of the rules relating to transactions between companies and their directors <e> <s> meanwhile i hope the committee will agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisional estimate of income received in from private inpatients in nhs hospitals in england is million <e> <s> we do not know how many pay beds would have been withdrawn over the next year if the previous governments policy had continued nor to what extent these withdrawals would have affected the level of income <e> <s> nor do we know how many pay beds there will be under our policy <e> <s> i should point out that the health services board who have the job of making proposals for the withdrawal of beds have just submitted proposals for the withdrawal of a further <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services is obliged by law to implement these by th september <e> <s> the board will be making further proposals in september for subsequent implementation <e> <s> my right honourable friend will introduce legislation as soon as he can but i cannot of course say when this would come into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister of health dr gerard vaughan has recently issued a consultative letter on the governments proposals for legislation on private hospital practice and the future of pay beds <e> <s> a copy of this letter has been placed in the library and all noble lords who are interested in this subject would be well advised to read it <e> <s> the detail of the proposals is in the letter but briefly the proposals for pay beds are that the secretary of states power to allow nhs facilities to be made available for private patients will be restored and compulsory phasing out will end <e> <s> it will be for individual health authorities to decide the extent to which facilities will be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that the noble lord knows the answer to that question but unfortunately i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i have got all the answers there <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that there were originally pay beds before the phasing out began and the present number that will be phased out is about of those pay beds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer that question because many of those pay beds were underused at the time <e> <s> most of the pay beds which have been phased out were phased out on account of the fact that they were little used <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot <e> <s> i can say that of the million-odd that the nhs received a good deal would of course go in providing the service <e> <s> there would be some profit on it but not a very great one <e> <s> on the other hand if all the pay beds were phased out those beds would have to be otherwise financed <e>", "<cs> my lords consultation is now going on and we are awaiting publication of the report of the royal commission on the national health service which is due to come out this month <e> <s> before that is seen and consultations have taken place no further decisions will be taken <e>", "<cs> that is correct my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a very short bill which has two quite distinct purposes <e> <s> the first is to provide a christmas bonus of for pensioners this year and to provide for bonuses to be paid in subsequent years <e> <s> the second purpose of the bill is to freeze for the time being the maximum amount of earnings which a dependent wife of a pensioner can receive before her husbands increase of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and for the general welcome they have given to this bill <e> <s> that perhaps does not quite apply to the noble lord lord houghton who was really making his goodbye swansong to this bill of which he does not approve <e> <s> having only just started to get involved in this field apart from once or twice talking about the christmas bonus before i find that one does find oneself in rather a minefield <e> <s> you start off on what seems to be a simple for the pensioners and you then get involved in all sorts of things which i know only a certain amount about <e> <s> i am in the middle of a sort of crash course trying to catch up with the extreme complications of the subject <e> <s> i will as the noble lord lord wellspestell suggested read extremely carefully what the noble lord lord banks and the noble baroness lady lockwood had to say <e>", "<cs> obviously the noble lord said pence which sounded like per cent <e> <s> i thought we had better get it right <e> <s> i quite appreciate that one of my honourable friends in another place suggested that a rd week might be another way of doing it but as the noble lord pointed out that died a very quick death and there is no question of that being brought up again <e> <s> it is fair to say lord wells-pestell mentioned this that although the christmas bonus is only a very small amount nowadays the increase in pensions generally which has taken place since we came to power is the largest which has ever been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their approval of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord lauderdale apologised for raising this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it might be convenient if i were now to repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services on the report of the royal commission on the national health service <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for pointing out the differences between scotland and england and i am also grateful to my noble friend lord drumalbyn for what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has said again in his usual charming way things he said earlier <e> <s> i can only say that both the matters that he would have liked to have attended to this time and the appetite of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will be satisfied in due course in by a second bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank both the noble lord lord wells-pestell and the noble lord lord banks for their approval of the order and i should particularly like to thank lord banks for having made such a valuable contribution to the short debate on this matter <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend the secretary of state will read what he has said with great interest <e> <s> mature students have never had difficulty in the past and of the students the majority will be unable to claim because they will not have had the opportunity to do sufficient work <e> <s> before it was quite easy for them to do about weeks work but they would not normally be able to claim and we reckon the savings would be about million <e> <s> i may say that the students we are talking about are those out of say students who are at universities polytechnics and similar institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house was not unduly frightened by the noble lord lord wells-pestell when he suggested that the inflation rate would be so high that a per cent <e> <s> increase in the premium would not be adequate <e> <s> it is a per cent <e> <s> increase and i think as the noble lord lord banks said that that is a substantial increase <e> <s> so far as the ordinary child benefit is concerned it is the duty of the secretary of state to review this each year <e> <s> i do not think it is reasonable to suggest that the last administration having increased the child benefit from to only three months ago a further increase could be expected now <e> <s> the noble baroness lady phillips suggested that i had compassion <e> <s> i certainly feel very compassionate on the question of children and i entirely agree with statements made by the government that the children should be top priority <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that as soon as we can put that into effect we will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question that would probably better be put to one of the treasury ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for welcoming the continuation of the regulations <e> <s> perhaps i could try to explain in simpler words what the first paragraph that i read out really means <e> <s> i should like to give the example of a shop assistant working at a seaside resort <e> <s> let us suppose that he works for weeks and then registers for work either nearby or elsewhere <e> <s> further let us suppose that in fact he does not do any work during the off-season <e> <s> he can go on like that for three years or so and draw unemployment benefit <e> <s> at the end of three or four years he is likely to be designated a seasonal worker and from then on supposing that he had a -week off-season he would have to work for five weeks that being a quarter of the off-season period or show that he had a reasonable prospect of doing so in order to receive unemployment benefit during the off-season <e> <s> i hope that that explains the situation adequately to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords no measures are planned to increase price competition among manufacturers <e> <s> on marketing the price commission found that the general optical councils rules on publicity limited the information available to the consumer and created a situation in which competition could not be promoted <e> <s> my right honourable friends are considering whether any further measures may be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand my noble friends anxiety on this subject <e> <s> some time ago the price commission investigated dollond and aitchison <e> <s> the commission made no recommendations about the companys prices charges or margins but included in the report to the previous secretary of state a number of non-statutory observations including one dealing with price display <e> <s> the general optical council however declined to reconsider its present restrictions on publicity <e> <s> i understand that the director general of fair trading has had certain of the professional and commercial aspects of opticians activities under review but has not completed his consideration of this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that this is a view which is strongly held by many people and this is one of the matters which my right honourable friend is considering at this moment <e> <s> i fully appreciate the point of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord referring to nhs frames <e> <s> i think there is work going on on this matter at the moment and there is consultation between officials and industry with a view to increasing the range <e> <s> unfortunately it will mean quite substantial cost and it is unlikely that any action will be taken just at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that informative statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords the views that my noble friend has expressed are i know widely shared and in general the government favour the encouragement of competition in preference to control but they have not yet decided whether specific action can yet be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft social security benefits up-rating amendment order which was laid before your lordships house on rd october be approved <e> <s> i think that it may be for the convenience of the house if we take at the same time the draft family income supplements computation no <e> <s> regulations the draft social security earnings-related addition to widows allowance special provisions regulations and the draft social security maximum additional component amendment regulations <e> <s> these three instruments were also laid before the house on rd october <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> there has been some criticism but on the whole acceptance of the regulations <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell asked me who really gets this benefit apart from the families on fis <e> <s> he is quite right the cost for those families is about million a year <e> <s> we estimate that about pensioners will receive it also at a cost of about million and beneficiaries with young children will benefit <e> <s> that will cost about million <e> <s> that is how the balance is made up <e>", "<cs> my lords there is certainly substance in that but i doubt if the noble lord would wish to have it changed <e> <s> my lords i think i have answered most of the questions that i have been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night i feel that i should be as short as i can but i should like to start by saying how gratified i was that so many things that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has said are exactly how we see things ourselves <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has frequently admitted that the reorganisation in was a mistake and that is something to which he is turning his attention now and the consultation document will be out by the end of this year <e> <s> it is expected that that consultation will take six months or so and thereafter matters can be gradually dealt with and not rushed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is more suitable that we should reorganise the service again having reorganised it wrongly in the first place <e> <s> i may take rather a long time in reply because i have an enormous number of notes there have been rather a lot of speakers and a great many points raised <e> <s> i will answer some questions now and write to a number of speakers whom i cannot answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall be mentioning some of those too <e> <s> in england which my noble friend has in mind there are only a few water resources which contain naturally one part per million or more of fluoride <e> <s> these are groundwater sources as my noble friend says occurring mainly in buckinghamshire bedfordshire lincolnshire essex dorset derbyshire and cleveland <e> <s> with the exception of one major area these sources are relatively minor and those which contain more than one part per million are either diluted with low fluoride water or are only used as emergency supplies <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment is not aware of any sources of supply which naturally contain the optimum level of fluoride but which <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the estimates of the number of unregistered child minders recently published in <e>", "<cs> my lords there were child minders registered with local authorities as at st march and incidentally the number of children registered at that date was <e> <s> the average pay that these child minders receive is about a day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i was difficult to hear <e> <s> i hope that i am more easily heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the case which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> but there is no doubt that these arrangements cannot he isolated against cuts in public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that we are talking only about child minders who are rewarded for the work they do <e> <s> there are of course many people who are either relations or friends and who do child minding for no pay <e> <s> there is nothing illegal about that but other people who are being paid are actually operating illegally if they do not register <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ferrier and i as he well knows have something in common we both believe that there are outside the medical profession common law practitioners who have proved to the satisfaction of their patients that the therapies they offer are extremely <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of still-births in england and wales fell from to between and and if present trends continue will be even lower in <e> <s> in the latest year for which full information is available the proportion of still-births to all births in england and wales was broadly comparable with that in belgium france italy and the republic of ireland and rather higher than in west germany the netherlands luxembourg and denmark <e> <s> i am advised however that international comparisons of still-birth rates need to be treated with caution as they are subject to variations of definition or practice between different countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that these are all tragedies <e> <s> regarding the proportion of deaths which took place in the home and in hospitals the figures are rather interesting <e> <s> in the proportion of still-births in hospitals was per cent <e> <s> and at home per cent <e> <s> in in hospitals per cent <e> <s> at home per cent <e> <s> and in in hospitals per cent <e> <s> and at home per cent <e> <s> it would look as though there are more deaths taking place in hospitals now than there were before <e> <s> i think the answer is that there is better care of pregnant women taking place so that when there appears to be a difficult birth a woman is very quickly sent to hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is well aware that the last thing we wish to do is anything of that kind <e> <s> all the area health authorities are asked to take the maximum trouble about children elderly people and all deprived people <e>", "<cs> my lords there is certainly a wide variation <e> <s> the inner cities and deprived urban areas are always the places which are the worst <e> <s> in the country regions our record is much closer to the excellent results achieved in scandinavia <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft nursing qualifications eec recognition order laid before the house on th november be approved <e> <s> as noble lords will recall my noble friend lord sandys introduced a draft of this order which was then debated in this house on th july <e> <s> that draft was in a form appropriate to the circumstances of that time when as noble lords will recall her majesty was absent from the united kingdom and counsellors of state were appointed to summon and hold on her majestys behalf her privy council and to signify thereat her majestys approval to instruments such as the present one unfortunately owing to the timing of parliamentary business immediately before the summer recess it was not possible for the privy council when it met on th july to consider the order because at that time all the stages of consideration in another place had not been completed <e> <s> in consequence the draft has had to be revised and put into what is known as queens form and i have been advised that before it is put to the privy council again the order has to he approved again by resolutions of both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lords two questions there is no legal requirement for the authorities here to assist nurses in their learning of the english language <e> <s> i should expect that they would wish to help but they have no legal requirement to do so <e> <s> as i explained in my speech the first directive facilitates the free movement of what are termed first-level general nurses by requiring all member-states subject to certain conditions to recognise defined qualifications <e> <s> it also

some people need for reading and close work not to ordinary hand-held magnifiers which are widely available <e> <s> her majestys government are satisfied that the statutory restrictions on the testing of sight and the supply of optical appliances under the opticians act work in the best interests of patients by ensuring that the care of sight is entrusted to suitably qualified practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a powerful question <e> <s> there has been a great deal of interest in this subject recently and this is the second question that we have had on the subject during this month

that we can debate the matter properly <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly true my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just because there are such strong views on both sides of this matter that i thought it would be better if we could have a proper debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer that <e> <s> i know that there has been a definite restriction on price display and there was recently a case where somebody got into difficulty over having displayed prices <e> <s> the council still stick to the same line but i should not like to say that we have come to any decision on the matter as yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i did not hear that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their acceptance of this order <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord lord wells-pestell that i know he is very well aware that it is necessary for her majestys government to provide the government actuary with working assumptions as to the average number of those expected to be unemployed and the anticipated increase in average earnings during the following year <e> <s> i join very sincerely with the noble lord in the concern that he has expressed about the figure given for the number of unemployed assumed for and i feel sure that he and other noble lords will join me in hoping that this figure will not be reached <e> <s> i also agree with the noble lord that the assumed increase of per cent <e> <s> for both earnings and prices is dangerously high and assure him that her majestys government will adhere to policies designed to reduce this rate of increase wherever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be no further reduction in the number of beds or the level of service <e> <s> one of the two closed wards is to be re-opened as soon as possible the other will be reserved for the use of patients with spinal injuries <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house knows that my right honourable friend the minister of health went to stoke mandeville on th november and that this is when the decision was taken that one of these wards would be re-opened as soon as possible and there is no prospect of further cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to be able to answer the noble baroness but i am afraid that i cannot because it is only a very short time after the minister of health was down there <e> <s> the recruiting is going to start as soon as possible <e> <s> i very much regret that i cannot say that it is going to be next wednesday or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords the plan is to make a major appeal for the rebuilding of the spinal injuries centre <e> <s> there are plans already for the building to be rebuilt in the latter part of the s <e> <s> but the idea of this major appeal is to accelerate this as much as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i entirely agree with every word that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can say to the noble lord is that the problems of the nsic are going to be identified with a view to protecting allocations reflecting the true costs of running the centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend and my

entertainingly and to those who have spoken today from their knowledge and experience of the subject <e> <s> the debate has ranged widely covering not only the question of the standard of care which

the comments of noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i am giving <e>", "<cs> mine <e>", "<cs> in that case i must have been wrong the first time <e> <s> my lords the differential between prices for private and nhs spectacles is thus considerably wide <e> <s> in recent years we have had two price commission reports on this subject about which the noble lord lord northfield gave us much information this evening <e> <s> the two price commission reports have drawn attention to the unduly high level of prices charged for private spectacles and to the related matter of the lack of price competition in the sale of optical appliances <e> <s> this lack of price competition is mainly attributed to the restriction which the general optical council lays down in its rules of conduct that on pain of being struck off the professional register opticians must not display the prices of optical appliances in the windows of their premises <e> <s> although the council do not forbid the display of prices inside opticians premises in practice few opticians do so <e> <s> thus members of the public are not able to shop around and compare the prices charged by individual opticians and are unable to judge the expense they will incur before entering the opticians premises <e> <s> the general optical council maintain that removal of this restriction would not be in the public interest <e> <s> they contend that the advertising of prices could well result in patients choosing an optician for the cheapness of his spectacles rather than for the quality of his professional service which is of paramount importance in a primary health care profession <e>", "<cs> my lords it is well known that conservatives dislike restrictive practices and have a good record in this respect abolishing retail price maintenance in the early s and setting up the office of fair trading in which was sensibly extended by labour in to include service industries such as the optical service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord derwent for raising this matter of the commons amendment to clause of the bill <e> <s> it may be helpful to the house if i say a very few words about it <e> <s> the secretary of state at the time recommended against the exemption which has been sought for members of the british acupuncture association and register limited <e> <s> the commons committee granted their petition but said in its report that it had accepted the secretary of states recommendation <e> <s> it is not at all clear how this came about but in a matter of this kind the government feel and i understand that ministers concerned in the former administration agree that the other house should be given an opportunity to look at this matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords for the first five years after pension age which is for men and for women entitlement to a retirement pension is conditional upon retirement from regular employment <e> <s> however retirement does not mean that all work must be given up <e> <s> the normal test of retirement is that a persons intended earnings must not exceed the level which causes reduction of pension under the earnings rule <e> <s> the current level after making allowances for certain expenses related to work is a week that is just over per annum <e> <s> a person employed or self-employed with earnings of after allowances for the expenses to which i have referred could not therefore normally be treated as retired <e> <s> at age for a woman a person is treated as retired irrespective of the level of his earnings <e> <s> however if my noble friend has an individual case in mind and will let me have details <e> <s> i will gladly arrange for the matter to be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords

manifesto we committed ourselves to do just that and it is certainly our wish that we should do so <e> <s> there is no doubt however that in the present state of the economy this does not have the highest priority and we have not yet been able to make a start and i am afraid i am unable to tell the noble lord when we are likely to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a point which has been considered on and off ever since the act became law in <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly pass on that suggestion to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we are morally committed but at the moment i cannot say whether the resources will be available <e> <s> i quite agree that all parties are entirely in favour of abolishing the earnings rule as soon as we can and we feel exactly the same about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is putting me under a good deal of pressure <e> <s> it is true that we have already committed ourselves but i am saying that at the moment we are not financially able to carry out the commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is some difference and of course the self-employed person is able to <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that my noble friend is referring to the provision under which national insurance widows benefit ceases to be payable if the widow is living with a man as his wife <e> <s> the latest -month period for which a figure is available is st july to th june <e> <s> during this period widows had their benefit withdrawn under the provision in question following a decision of the local insurance officer <e> <s> of these widows have so far appealed to the local tribunal against the insurance officers decision <e>", "<cs> my lords to try to get some perspective in this matter out of the widows who had their benefit withdrawn appealed and of those appeals failed were successful and are outstanding <e> <s> so we are talking about a very small minority of cases <e> <s> it is well known and the finer committee decided so that this is a very difficult matter to administer <e> <s> i understand what my noble friend says about benefits being withdrawn on suspicion <e> <s> if either anonymously or otherwise people send in a report to the adjudicating authorities it is the latters duty to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble baroness that the fact that the number of cases is small is not a particularly good defence <e> <s> however i did say that those cases are difficult to administer and because the number is so small is perhaps some tribute to the way in which the job is carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the last point that the noble lord made <e> <s> efforts are being made to accelerate the appeal procedure <e> <s> i know that work is going on as regards that matter at present <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be possible for the widow to continue to receive her benefit while this matter is being looked at because in many cases it would go on for quite a long time it would mean public funds being tied up and eventually there may be some difficulty in getting the money back <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> that is exactly what i have been told myself and i believe that great care is taken not to pillory widows on a suspicion basis <e> <s> as i have said i think that there are but few cases and great trouble is taken not to be unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite understand why that should be so <e> <s> there are many people to advise <e> <s> i personally do not believe that these benefits are withdrawn unless initially the manager of the office is virtually convinced that it is right so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i know how to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house knows what a valiant champion of the widows my noble friend is and i shall certainly pass on what she has said to my tight honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has in mind i think those retirement pensioners who are paid periodically by payable orders instead of weekly by order book <e> <s> there are at present no provisions for paying pensions direct to banks <e> <s> i am glad to be able to inform the noble viscount that arrangements already exist to issue to those pensioners on request a card confirming their entitlement to a pension <e> <s> a pensioner who is not paid by order book and wishes to receive a card should apply to the department of health and social securitys central pensions branch at newcastle-upon-tyne <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very true <e> <s> if it would interest the house i shall give an indication of the other things that are available but they are in different areas and one has to make inquiries locally as to what is available <e> <s> you can for instance obtain concessionary rates on hairdressing dry cleaning rail fares bus fares holidays often for specified weeks theatre and cinema tickets entry to exhibitions and ancient monuments bingo halls adult education membership of sports and social clubs and some local authority services <e>", "<cs> my lords when people first get their pension payment they get a leaflet which is ni and on that leaflet is quite clearly shown that if you require it the central pensions branch will provide on request a card confirming that you are entitled to a retirement pension <e> <s> that is the sort of card that one in fact gets <e>", "<cs> my lords that is actually being looked at seriously at this moment <e> <s> i understand that there are certain administrative difficulties about it but i believe that they may well be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot answer that question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i can well understand how the noble viscount who always looks so young gets a childs ticket <e>", "<cs> my lords the government cannot be satisfied with the progress made to date to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking and are committed to achieving further reductions in the habit in order to reduce the toll of premature death and illness which it causes <e> <s> my right honourable friends the health ministers are currently engaged in negotiations with <e>", "<cs> no my lords there is no evidence to that effect <e> <s> i shall try not to mislead the house but the figures are a little complicated in this respect <e> <s> from until the consumption of cigarettes by weight steadily reduced <e> <s> it also reduced by the numbers of cigarettes smoked <e> <s> in the weight increased and the numbers went down slightly <e> <s> moreover during that period the percentage of males who smoked dropped from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and of women who smoked from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that it is more important to stop the young smoking than it is to stop some of us who continue to smoke as i do myself <e> <s> i am sure that speaking from this dispatch box i should suggest that everybody in this house who smokes should stop doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell knows a great deal about this subject and he has been dealing with these questions over many years <e> <s> i believe that he is quite right in what he says but it is also true to say that the men who are smoking are inclined to be smoking more <e> <s> the average number of cigarettes smoked by those males and females continuing to smoke has increased in recent years <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i am sure that my noble friend does not expect me to make any comment on that <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what the government are trying to do is to stop people smoking period <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an excellent point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have already said that i am trying to put across the governments view that neither men nor women should smoke if we can arrange it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid my hearing is getting very bad <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think that there is too much said about this <e> <s> it must be right to reduce the tar content but it is very important not to reduce it too quickly because otherwise people immediately reach for a stronger cigarette <e> <s> that is why in the arrangements that have been made between the dhss and the tobacco industry we have tried to do this gradually <e> <s> negotiations are now taking place for a further voluntary agreement with the industry as the present agreement runs out in a few months time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it might be convenient if i were now to repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services on the lambeth southwark and lewisham area health authority teaching <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for what they have said though i realise that they regard this as being a serious situation which it is <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wells-pestell will well know the previous administration had considerable difficulty with this area health authority which at one point was something like million in the red and they did press the authority to economise which they agreed to do <e> <s> after the budget in it was realised that not sufficient economies had been made to put the position right <e> <s> so there has been quite an ongoing situation here for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord please tell me what is his question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord pays me a great compliment in thinking that i am so very well-advised on what is happening in my department <e> <s> i am the spokesman here and this matter cropped up literally just now <e> <s> unfortunately i cannot give the noble lord an answer to the questions he has asked me <e> <s> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i am getting a great many compliments today <e> <s> i am afraid i do not know what the prime minister will do <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is greatly exaggerating the enormity of the crime that he thinks my right honourable friend has perpetrated <e> <s> in fact the judge himself said that he acted in absolute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will not expect me to do more than take note of what the noble lord has said and to take the matter back and discuss it with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have show that the ratio has increased from for every in-patients in to provisionally in in england from for every in-patients in to provisionally in in wales and from for every average occupied beds in to in in scotland <e> <s> figures are not available for northern ireland and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost <e> <s> in view of the debate we have just had i will circulate the rest of the figures in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord and since the figures have continued to improve <e> <s> it is certainly the intention of the department to encourage that in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords that there are differences in principle and in detail between the views of noble lords on the labour benches and those which are held by the government is of course inevitable <e> <s> i do not propose to go down the route that the noble lord lord wynne-jones encour <e>", "<cs> my lords it most certainly is yes <e> <s> in conclusion as i said earlier i do not believe that there is so much between us <e> <s> what this bill proposes is a transfer of the whole of the business of british aerospace to a companies act company of which about one half of the shares will initially be owned by the government <e> <s> this will be analogous to the situation which has for many years existed with bp a situation which was not disturbed by the last labour government <e> <s> we firmly believe that this change will be beneficial <e> <s> it will ensure the stability of the industry and of those who work in it and it offers the best prospect for those in british aerospace to build on the present strength of the industry and to achieve lasting prosperity <e> <s> i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened with great interest to a number of stimulating and thought-provoking speeches on the subject of housing and care for frail and elderly people <e> <s> i should first like to congratulate my noble friend lord hylton for raising this matter and for the cogent way in which he argued for changes in the present arrangements <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate him on his timing his timing is remarkable because after having debated the education bill throughout yesterday and yesternight your lordships should be just in the right mood to discuss matters affecting the elderly and frail <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has tabled this amendment in a probing spirit because we do see eye-to-eye on this matter <e> <s> perhaps it would be helpful if i explained the procedure for the issue of shares on flotation adumbrated in clause and how the arrangements will relate to employees and to the successor company <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot look at this again because i am absolutely certain that we are doing exactly what we should do <e> <s> we are making arrangements for all employees to have shares on the flotation and it is entirely up to the company at any time maybe annually to make shares available to employees on terms satisfactory to them <e> <s> i should have thought that there was little more that we could do <e> <s> directors will be appointed to the company and it will be entirely up to them to make suitable arrangements <e> <s> everybody knows that we are absolutely in favour of schemes for employee participation <e> <s> i would not wish to tie the hands of the directors in any way either the hands of those directors or the hands of the directors of ici or any other public company <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt at all that sensible arrangements such as this will be adopted by the sensible directors on this company <e> <s> but the government have no intention of tying the hands of the directors in this or any other matter which is not absolutely vital <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord ponsonby is waiting for a reply from this front bench i will reply but very shortly <e> <s> in point of fact the question which my noble friend asked has really been directed at the opposition front bench and not at the government front bench <e> <s> i would only say that his suggestion of three years qualification service will of course be considered with the other matters but so far as i am concerned i think the possibility of renationalisation without compensation by any democratic government in this country is not possible <e> <s> so i just do not believe it can be <e>", "<cs> our attitude to the amendment is that we will certainly consider the idea of the three years qualification as i told my noble friend <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the secretary of state to obtain an adequate price for any shares in the successor company that he disposes of directly or through nominees <e> <s> although the amendment is intended to be inserted in clause the duty which it imposes would have effect in any of the circumstances in which the secretary of state might dispose of shares <e>", "<cs> i find it rather difficult to answer that question <e> <s> as an ex-stockbroker i know how extremely difficult it is when somebody rings up and saysi should like to sell so many shares <e> <s> i leave it to you <e>", "<cs> i would think so <e>", "<cs> i hope it will be helpful if i seek to describe the process by which the vesting of the business in the successor company will occur <e> <s> the bill provides that the successor company must have been formed and registered under the companies act that on the appointed day it must be limited by shares and that on the appointed day all those shares must be owned by or on behalf of the crown <e>", "<cs> we have consistently made clear that the government are determined that british aerospace limited should not fall into foreign hands <e> <s> in that matter we are absolutely in accord with noble lords opposite <e> <s> that was made clear by my right honourable friend the secretary of state in his initial statement in the other place on rd july and on second reading on th november it was frequently reiterated during the debates on the bill in the other place and we reaffirmed it on second reading here <e> <s> i again formally set on record our determination to prevent the company that will be so important to our defence from falling into foreign control <e> <s> it is a determination which i know the opposition shares <e> <s> what divides us is merely the means of achieving a common end <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me a great deal of pleasure to respond to this short but stimulating debate <e> <s> this is the first time in this parliament that this house has had an opportunity for a full discussion of private medicine and i am grateful to my noble friend lord hunt of fawley for instigating this debate <e> <s> i am particularly pleased with the precise form of his motion to call attention to the extent of co-operation between the nhs and the independent medical sector during the past years and to the potential for future co-operation <e> <s> that is right it looks both to past achievement and to the future <e> <s> it also allows us to approach the subject of private medicine and its relationship with the nhs in its widest sense not confined to the narrower issue of pay-beds <e> <s> my noble friend followed his own lead with a very wide <e>", "<cs> an order in respect of the census giving the particulars to be stated in the returns has been laid before both houses today <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate on a bill which i think every speaker has agreed is a very complicated one <e> <s> a number of points have been raised by noble lords although i propose to deal with general points and leave many matters to the committee stage as suggested by the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord has made an extremely good point and i am very grateful to him for not asking for an answer today <e>", "<cs> my lords since the day surgery unit opened in september the increase in the <e>", "<cs> my lords day surgery has been used increasingly by the health service for a number of years <e> <s> advances in anaesthetic technique surgical method and care in the community have made it practicable to discharge patients on the day of operation when home conditions are suitable <e> <s> ovbiously many conditions cannot be treated in this way <e> <s> but with increasing experience it has become apparent that the range of operations that can be undertaken safely is considerable <e> <s> the operations that can be handled are often medically non-urgent although of considerable concern to the patient <e> <s> my noble friends department is well aware of this approach which it supports and has indeed commended to authorities <e> <s> we therefore welcome the initiative shown in this area <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there are a number of other hospitals which carry out day surgery and day case attendances for surgical and related treatments have increased considerably between and <e> <s> i have figures here which i shall be very pleased to show to my noble friend <e> <s> i doubt whether the house would be interested in all the details <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely concur with what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving the amendment the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede returned to the point as he mentioned which we discussed in committee <e> <s> at that time he was concerned to ensure that the secretary of state would not necessarily have to act immediately to sell surplus shares under the duty imposed on him by subsection should the target investment limit be exceeded <e> <s> i assured him that while the clause obliged the secretary of state to sell shares it enabled him to defer their sale for a short period to take account of market factors <e> <s> at that time the noble lord appeared to accept that explanation and withdrew his amendment but he has clearly since reconsidered the matter <e>", "<cs> my i lords with the leave of the house i will try to go a little further <e> <s> there may be some slight imperfection in the words reasonably practicable but as far as i am concerned i am not by any manner of means convinced that the alteration to appropriate to do so would be any better and in my view it would be more ambiguous than conducive to flexibility <e> <s> we have to consider in what instances we i shall run into any problem here <e> <s> as i see it it is only likely that it would be necessary to sell shares in any quantity it would never be a very large quantity if there had been a rights issue and shares had been taken up but not by everyone <e> <s> you might then find yourself with a rather higher percentage of shares than you had before and you would then have to dispose of those in order to get back to the previous position <e> <s> i do not see any likelihood perhaps the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede can see how this might come about of suddenly finding that a large number of shares needs to be disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very happy to consider the matter between now and third reading though without giving any particular commitment <e>", "<cs> the new clause amendment no <e> <s> would increase the rate of the death grant to for all recipients including those who at present receive reduced rates <e> <s> it would increase expenditure on the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord banks asked whether the government intend to allow the death grant and the maternity grant to continue to decrease in value <e> <s> the government are considering all aspects of the death grant including current levels <e> <s> an announcement of the governments intentions will be made in due course but it will be necessary to have regard to the economic situation and to priorities <e> <s> the matter is being examined seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is intended to allow guaranteed minimum pensions when transferred from one contracted-out pension scheme to another to be revalued at a fixed rate instead of by reference to the increase in average earnings <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware an amendment was moved in another place to achieve the same object <e>", "<cs> i do not think i am really in a position to say that but what i should like to do is to take this away and perhaps we could discuss it again at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> it would i suggest be convenient to discuss with the amendment to clause the amendments to lines and on page that is amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the supplementary benefits commission have three functions <e> <s> the first of these is the executive one <e> <s> the commission are responsible for determining individual claims to benefit and for the use of the discretion conferred by the present legal structure <e> <s> this discretion is in fact exercised by local officers acting in the name of the commission on the basis of guidance issued by them <e> <s> the major thrust of the reform of the supplementary benefits scheme set out in this bill is to change that pattern that is replace discretionary powers with published rights which will have statutory authority and replace officers acting as agents with officers who are subject to clear right of appeal independent determining authorities <e> <s> clearly the commission will have no place in such a system of adjudication <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wells-pestell has made an extremely important point and i will most certainly write to him <e> <s> i could give an answer now but i am sure i will give a very much better one by letter <e>", "<cs> one of the major areas of concern identi <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had made it quite clear that we shall spell out in regulations all that can possibly be spelled out but there will still be residual discretion <e>", "<cs> the whole idea is to put into regulations as much as can reasonably be put in <e> <s> there is a great deal of experience over many years of the supplementary benefits commissions working of the various things that have cropped up <e> <s> a great many of those things will be covered by the regulations put in <e> <s> it is obvious as the noble lord lord wells-pestell said that one cannot think of everything so there will be residual discretion for those hardship cases not covered by the regulations <e>", "<cs> in view of the pressure from behind me i am very happy after what my noble friends lord drumalbyn and lord boyd-carpenter have said to take this back and see what legal aspect there is to this and we can return to it at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i acknowledge that the present -day rule is generous to the weekly-paid for it means that their entitlement to benefit continues up to their first pay day even where they have to work a week in hand <e> <s> but for the monthly-paid who have to wait a further fortnight for their first pay day this is on the face of it less generous <e> <s> the present rules are designed to treat everyone alike and i think this is perfectly defensible <e> <s> the monthly-paid receive the same help as the weekly-paid <e> <s> adapting to the monthly pay cycle is admittedly more difficult but most employers who adopt this system make it flexible enough by way of advances of salary to cater for those who cannot <e>", "<cs> these amendents like those relating to a strikers own requirements nos <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said lone parents currently have a disregard on earnings compared with for a claimant who must register for work and for others <e> <s> the governments proposals are for a standard disregard of for all adults plus for lone parents a tapered disregard of half their earnings between and <e> <s> the justification for special treatment for lone parents in this field is i think common ground between us <e> <s> the tapered disregard will ensure that earnings up to will help increase net income <e> <s> this will encourage lone parents to earn more and strengthen their link with the employment field to which many will eventually return when their children are grown up but it might encourage some to increase their earnings to the point where they no longer need supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> there is a difference of view between us <e> <s> in our opinion to encourage lone parents to do some work and get the benefit from it appears to be a very good idea <e> <s> it seems entirely right to encourage lone parents where circumstances permit to take up opportunities in the employment field <e> <s> we are not trying to force them to do so we are encouraging them to do so and helping them if they do <e> <s> but nobody is suggesting that they are obliged to do this work <e> <s> our proposals simply give them the chance to keep in touch with the employment field to which no doubt they will eventually return when their children grow up <e> <s> i do not quite see the difficulty about this <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to take these various amendments together as the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> i shall start with amendments nos <e> <s> and dealing with the long-term rates of supplementary benefit <e> <s> as your lordships know these rates apply to supplementary pensioners and to those under pension age other than the unemployed who have received supplementary benefit for at least two years <e> <s> the bill proposes that these rates shall be aligned with the corresponding national insurance rates which means in practice that at the next up-rating the supplementary benefit rates will go up by p less for a married couple and by p less for a single householder than would otherwise have been the case <e> <s> the amendment would add those amounts to the new rates which were announced recently and thus reopen the gap between the supplementary benefit long-term rates and their national insurance counterparts <e>", "<cs> let me say straightaway that the government recognise that there is some widespread support for extending the longterm rates of supplementary benefit to the unemployed particularly now that the qualifying period for people under pension age is to be reduced <e> <s> the review team in its report <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord banks <e>", "<cs> i might have known that the noble lord would think of some extremely clever idea <e>", "<cs> the remarks that are made suggest that we on this side of the house are not concerned with the difficulties of the unemployed and that is by no means so <e> <s> i should like to remind the noble lord lord wells-pestell that during the course of the time that his party was in power the number of unemployed doubled but they did not do anything about this particular suggestion which has come today <e> <s> i am afraid that it is a nil cost package and at this stage until we can find other money and the idea that the noble lord has suggested is completely new to any of the thinking that has gone on so far i know it has come up before but it is not considered at this stage i am afraid i must ask the committee to resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> under the current rules capital of or less is ignored altogether in calculating a claimants resources for supplementary benefit purposes <e> <s> on sums over an income of p for each complete of capital is assumed and this assumed income is offset against a claimants benefit entitlement <e> <s> this rule is certainly very complicated for claimants especially pensioners to understand and of course it complicates for staff the task of calculating the amount of benefit payable to individual claimants <e> <s> that is why we are proposing the much simpler rule that anyone with capital in excess of should no longer qualify for supplementary benefit but on the other hand that if they have capital of up to none of it should be taken into account against their benefit entitlement <e>", "<cs> we are talking about cash when in this context we talk of the which exists <e>", "<cs> the intention of amendment no <e> <s> is to give the social security advisory committee a specific duty to advise the secretary of state on the way the insurance officers and benefit officers are setting about their job of adjudicating on claims for benefit <e> <s> the independent status of insurance officers is a cardinal feature of the national insurance scheme <e> <s> it is moreover a feature we value so highly that we are seeking to give the same status to the benefit officers who are to decide claims for supplementary benefit <e> <s> i am sure that i do not need to convince your lordships that the independence of the adjudicating authorities in our social security system is and will be something of which we can be justly proud <e> <s> but it is also something we have to guard carefully <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to extend the social security advisory committees role to cover means-tested assistance with welfare foods health charges and fares for travel to hospital <e> <s> i am conscious that we are already asking a lot from the new committee in entrusting it with an advisory responsibility which covers the major part of the social security system <e> <s> the committee will have to tackle an advisory role which is probably unique in the range and complexity of the subjects it covers <e> <s> it would be wrong and i think counter-productive to make further mandatory extensions to the committees task <e>", "<cs> the broad aim of these amendments as i understand it is to provide that reports of the social security advisory committee on northern ireland regulations accompanied by a statement from the secretary of state for social services should be laid before parliament rather than before the northern ireland assembly <e> <s> in fact the amendments as drafted would have some involved and rather curious effects <e> <s> i am sure your lordships would prefer to be spared a word-by-word examination of the amendments as drafted <e> <s> in principle and irrespective of the motives behind them they are i am afraid quite unacceptable on northern ireland political and constitutional grounds <e>", "<cs> i confirm that negative resolutions can only be prayed against <e> <s> i quite appreciate that the whole supplementary benefit system and the whole of this bill is important to northern ireland <e> <s> i can only say that we take all that very much into account <e> <s> i am afraid i am not any sort of an expert on northern ireland and i cannot really explain to the noble lord the reasons for what i said earlier <e> <s> however i am informed that there can be no doubt that a change of the kind suggested <e>", "<cs> the intention of this amendment is to require the government to refer regulations which specify the rates of child benefit to the social security advisory committee <e> <s> child benefit would then become the only benefit to be subject to this type of scrutiny by the committee <e> <s> it would not be appropriate to seek the new committees advice on benefit rates <e> <s> it would certainly be wrong to single out child benefit for this treatment <e> <s> benefit rates must remain the clear and final responsibility of parliament acting on the decisions of the government of the day <e> <s> there is no case or need for an intermediary in this matter <e> <s> full scrutiny of up-rating regulations by parliament is already assured because they are all subject to affirmative resolution so i trust that the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would ask noble lords to reject this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first it is misconceived in that this subsection applies only when my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor considers that in order to help the disposal of the business of the commissioners he should appoint a deputy commissioner for such period or on such occasions as he thinks fit <e> <s> it would therefore be meaningless to introduce a requirement to appoint a deputy by substituting the word shall for the more general power of may <e> <s> subject to the availability of suitable appointees my noble and learned friend will naturally make appointments if he considers them necessary and here i know i am echoing what my right honourable friend the secretary of state said in another place <e> <s> secondly the subsection follows in its wording that of the courts act <e> <s> this provides that the lord chancellor may appoint deputy circuit judges <e> <s> since the deputy commissioner would be appointed on the same basis as these deputy judges it is eminently suitable that the same language should be used <e>", "<cs> one certainly can get caught out in this business <e> <s> it was not so very long ago that the noble lord lord banks raised this subject and i came in with him fully in support <e> <s> now i find myself having to speak from this dispatch box and i cannot speak quite so naturally as i did then <e> <s> may i say that personally i still retain sympathy for the intention of this amendment but i should like to make one point which has not i think been made by any speaker <e> <s> from what all noble lords have said it appears that this is a tremendously humanitarian thing terribly helpful to everybody but i would point out that there are professional people who are anxious to go into this business and who are not doing it for love <e> <s> i make this point because it is quite important that we should keep it in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i took a long time in moving the order <e> <s> i propose to try to even things out by being very short in winding up <e> <s> i think we have had an extraordinarily interesting debate which i had not expected <e> <s> i shall try to answer such questions as i can and write to noble lords on other matters <e> <s> i thought that the noble baroness lady birk made an interesting and thoughtful speech and i am sure it will be read with great interest elsewhere <e> <s> i am pleased that she was agreeing with the government on the ethnic

not actually aware of those details but what the noble baroness has said will be read with interest <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should say that initially the flowers report is entirely a matter for

the house perhaps i may say that i have fully taken the noble baronesss point <e> <s> my lords a week may be a small amount of money although very important to the person concerned but million is a very large sum of money at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry but i am afraid i cannot give a breakdown of that figure <e> <s> i take it as the correct figure it being that which i have been given by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be very glad to give that assurance if i was able to but it is really up to my right honourable friend the secretary of state and i am afraid i am not in a position to give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand what the noble baroness says and i promise to write to <e>", "<cs> i certainly will my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to ensure that the extra expenses attributable to disablement were provided for in the supplementary benefit rates <e> <s> whatever the merits of meeting such costs i do not think that a means tested scheme such as the supplementary benefits scheme is the right place to start <e> <s> it seems entirely right as the bill proposes to assess the entitlement of all claimants to supplementary benefit by reference to normal requirements housing requirements and additional requirements where appropriate <e> <s> in this way a claimant who happens to be disabled will be treated in exactly the same way as any other person and any additional needs such as help with heating costs or the cost of a special diet which a disabled person may have will be met according to the normal rules of the scheme <e> <s> the expenses for which additions will be made to weekly benefits will be laid down in the regulations and the list of items will be added to as the need arises <e> <s> this will apply also to exceptional needs payments <e> <s> and i should point out that both attendance allowance and mobility allowance will <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wells-pestell has already said we debated this selfsame amendment in committee on st april <e> <s> i cannot add a great deal to the reasons i gave then as to why the government are unable to protect the position of existing beneficiaries who have capital over but i am only too pleased to give the house a brief rsum of my arguments <e> <s> our proposal to introduce a simple rule whereby anyone who has capital in excess of will not qualify for supplementary benefit replaces a provision in the existing legislation which is much more complicated for claimants to understand and for staff to operate <e> <s> in the present scheme capital of or less is ignored altogether in calculating a claimants resources <e> <s> on amounts over an income of p per week for each complete of capital is assumed and this notional income is offset against a claimants benefit entitlement <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in view of that explanation i hope the noble lord will with-draw the amendment <e>", "<cs>

sum but a different one <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e> <s> the last governments proposals for the census published in cmnd <e> <s> included a proposal to ask for the number of cars and vans available for use by members of each household <e> <s> the present government examined rigorously each of the questions our predecessors had proposed <e> <s> at first sight the question on cars and vans did not seem to be essential and it was therefore not included in the order <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is well made <e>", "<cs> my lords although we have already considered this amendment during the committee stage i am grateful to the noble <e>", "<cs> this amendment was one of a group debated in commons committee and later rejected on a division <e> <s> a requirement in the bill on the lines of the amendment would serve a real legal purpose only if the information to be provided by the minister were to be used at some further stage of the proceedings <e> <s> it is not however envisaged that there will be any further proceedings once the unfunded proportions have been determined <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been recognised that until the permanent units are established authorities would not be able to use all of the revenue allocation on secure facilities <e> <s> since the allocation derives from funds voted for health services and held back from general allocation authorities have been allowed to use it for other non-recurrent purposes and in particular on improving other psychiatric services <e> <s> the department has recently received up-to-date information from regional health authorities of the use made of these allocations as soon as it has been checked and collated i will send it to the noble lord and place a copy in the library of the house <e> <s> special capital is made available to health authorities as estimates are approved and plans develop and has been used on capital expenditure for the regional secure units programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand what the noble lord means about the slowness of the development <e> <s> in fact when this programme started and money was made available in onwards there was considerable underestimate of the difficulties that would arise in setting up these regional secure units <e> <s> there was local opposition and difficulty in getting staff <e> <s> but the concern that the noble lord has expressed is entirely shared by the department and by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand that the noble lord is very well up in this subject <e> <s> i also realise how important it is <e> <s> the department is also very concerned about the slowness in the development and every encouragement is given by the department to try to press on faster and further with this matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords although i understand that the number of such people has been somewhat exaggerated a census was taken at the end of last year and there were mentally ill prisoners so i am told who would have been suitable for transfer to hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the difficulty with staff is that there are many other jobs which they can do which are not anything like so difficult <e>", "<cs> the first of these units is likely to be opened by the end of this year my lords <e>", "<cs> it was intended to be encouraging my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by agreeing entirely with the noble lord lord wells- pestell that this has been an extremely interesting debate with most moving and illuminating speeches <e> <s> i certainly trust that the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal will feel that it was well worth having the debate <e> <s> i personally am very grateful to her for having raised the matter because it is of great importance and concern to so many of us <e> <s> it is a subject on which the noble baroness is particularly well-informed as chairman of the committee on the multi-handicapped blind and it is an indication of the noble baronesss high standing among organisations of and for disabled people that she was invited to open the new hostel at market deeping which is to be run by the national association for the deaf/ blind and rubella handicapped to which the noble lord lord maybray-king referred <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that we have not a homogeneous group <e>", "<cs> my lords we are concerned at the amount of money accumulating in the accounts of some long-stay patients particularly in mental handicap hospitals <e> <s> we are looking at ways of enabling their social security benefits including mobility allowances to be used more flexibly while at the same time avoiding abuse <e> <s> we shall consult widely before any changes are introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we are looking at the problem but i must tell your <e>", "<cs> my lords i will pass on that suggestion to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a large sum of money <e> <s> the amounts recorded in the national health service accounts rose from million in to million in <e> <s> even allowing for inflation that is a rise of million <e>", "<cs> my lords measures are taken by area health authorities to see that vaccination is arranged for

whether these notices have to be put up in general practitioners surgeries <e> <s> the whole vaccination programme is for the area health authorities to monitor and to guide <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circular sent by the department to health authorities announcing the publicity campaign for rubella vaccination it is urged that all women of child-bearing age who have not already received vaccine at school or elsewhere should be tested and vaccinated where appropriate <e> <s> health authorities appreciate the particular importance of ensuring that a non-immune woman attending a fertility clinic is protected and make arrangements for such patients to be screened and vaccinated before embarking on active treatment for their infertility <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the uptake was recently per cent <e> <s> and has now reached somewhere around per cent <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i understand that there are ample supplies of vaccine and that all efforts are made to

remarks of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt about it my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords a study is in progress on the scope for further initiatives to help the elderly and disabled to save fuel

tune of an extra per year each <e> <s> also under a fail-safe arrangement which was announced on th march supplementary benefit claimants or their dependants who are in receipt of attendance allowance constant attendance allowance or mobility allowance will automatically be entitled to the new higher rate heating addition <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot answer those detailed questions but a study is in progress on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i really was not going to say anything very much except to thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will realise that the scheme that we are carrying out now will operate for all forms of fuel and not purely for electricity as did the last administrations scheme <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has made clear the intention of this amendment is to limit the freezing of the earnings limit for retirement pensioners to the and up-ratings <e> <s> its effect would be to freeze the earnings limit until november <e>

a review in the tax year <e> <s> if there were no review of the limit until after the tax year the next review would be in and the limit would not be unfrozen until november <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord banks referred to the fact that i had taken part in a debate on this subject a year or two ago <e> <s> i am just as keen as my noble friend lord reigate that we should get rid of this earnings rule as quickly as we possibly can <e> <s> i think the very fact that we are having to slow down in getting rid of the earnings rule and even going further in not up-rating the earnings limit at this time must make it clear to your lordships that we consider that the present economic situation in the country is very bad and that is why we are having to eat our words on our manifesto commitment <e> <s> i feel <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to delay the freezing of the retirement pensioners earnings limit until the up-rating <e> <s> the earnings limit is being frozen at its current level of a week as a necessary contribution to the measures to hold back public expenditure and the need for these measures is immediate <e> <s> it is important therefore that the freeze should operate this year and should not be put off otherwise the effect of its contribution is lost <e> <s> if we did not feel as strongly as we do about this we should not be putting these matters forward this time <e>", "<cs> clause makes two changes <e> <s> one of these changes is that short spells of incapacity lasting three days or less will no longer count for benefit purposes <e> <s> payments of benefit will not be made for these periods nor will they link with other periods of incapacity or unemployment <e> <s> this change will only be made for periods of incapacity <e> <s> days of unemployment will still count for benefit purposes if there are two days of unemployment within a period of six consecutive days <e>", "<cs> it is very difficult to know how many people might behave in the way in which the noble lord has suggested it is really almost speculation <e> <s> we believe that very few people will behave like that and that the help which we are giving to the doctors and the small amount of money that will be saved will be advantageous <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right in saying that the overall point of the first five clauses of the bill is to save money <e> <s> one hesitates to go on reiterating that because it becomes extremely boring to noble lords <e> <s> however that is as he rightly said the main point of what we are doing <e> <s> the other arguments such as helping the doctors although obviously very useful are subsidiary <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord that this is confusing and it is complicated and i shall do my best to explain it in simple terms <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware unemployment benefit is paid for a maximum of one year days in any one period of interruption of employment <e> <s> once a claimant has received this one years benefit he can requalify for a further years benefit only after he has worked for at least weeks and for at least hours in each of those weeks <e> <s> the intention of this amendment is to reduce this requalification period from to eight weeks no doubt with a view to keeping it in line with the revised figure of eight weeks which it is proposed should apply for the purposes of linking periods of interruption of employment <e>", "<cs> clause gives power for the linking period to be increased by regulations to a longer period than eight weeks <e> <s> the intention of the amendment is to ensure that the linking period will remain at eight weeks for unemployment benefit even if it is changed for the incapacity benefits <e> <s> the noble lords reason for proposing the amendment is that for the unemployed the reduction in the linking period is beneficial <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord wants to probe our thinking on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that statistics are not collected centrally in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost <e> <s> however i can say that some pairs of contact lenses were prescribed in england in only a small proportion of which are likely to have been for children <e> <s> the statistics do not break down the lenses prescribed by age groups <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord knows contact lenses can be prescribed under the national health service only when in the opinion of a hospital consultant ophthalmologist they are clinically essential <e> <s> nhs contact lenses are not available through the general ophthalmic services <e> <s> i fully understand the noble lords point about sensitive children not wishing to wear glasses and look different from other children but certainly at this stage there is no way in which the consultant is able to prescribe contact lenses on other than clinical grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really believe that that is true although i feel very wary about saying that to the noble lord who has so much more knowledge and experience on this subject than i have <e> <s> but i have asked the department about this and i understand that a psychiatrist is brought in only if the child concerned has a psychiatric history <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i know that in the private sector contact lenses cost from about up to or more and this i agree is an appalling cost <e> <s> frequently contact lenses are desirable on account of cosmetic rather than ocular reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in the name of my noble friend lord bellwin on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an extraordinarily interesting debate greatly enriched by the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady mcfarlane of llandaff who i understand has two firsts in that she is the first professor of nursing in england and the first nurse to become a member of your lordships house <e> <s> i hope we shall hear her speak often in future and perhaps she will help us with the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply could not answer that question but i understand it is purely by regulations that this could be altered <e> <s> but as i say i will pass on the noble baronesss suggestion to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly have pleasure in writing to the noble baroness <e> <s> i am aware of the recommendation of the royal commission but we do not happen to agree with the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e>", "<cs> my lords yes technically many of them are but there is room for doubt about jam <e> <s> moreover it is questionable whether <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble in stockton has been caused by the somewhat obscure words in section of the food and drugs act <e> <s> i have been advised that this section was probably intended to apply to meat and fish products but the words are capable of applying more widely <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord is suggesting that this is really a storm in a jampot <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether the noble and learned lord expects much comment in reply to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is not too typical <e> <s> certainly these arrangements are made entirely by local authorities and i am sure that they differ one from another <e>", "<cs> my lords we have found it necessary to freeze the earnings limit for retirement pensioners at its present level of per week and to lift the statutory requirement to increase it in future years because of the need which we keep having to repeat to hold back public expenditure <e> <s> we recognise that this is not a popular measure but we believe it to be necessary in the present economic circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we are simply leaving the money frozen at this point <e> <s> we realise that it will be of some hardship to some people <e> <s> but this is one of the unhappy economies that we are making <e> <s> i doubt whether i can add anything to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that on this matter government spokesmen have been consistent perhaps too consistent for the wishes of noble lords opposite in declaring and maintaining that the primary object of this bill in its first five clauses is to make much needed economies in public expenditure <e> <s> the need to exercise some constraint over the continuing growth in the social security budget is inescapable and unless measures are taken the growth would outstrip the countrys capacity to pay for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank my noble friend for his support on the rather complicated point made by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> the saving under this clause reducing the linking from to eight weeks would be million <e> <s> unfortunately what i cannot tell the house is what would be the difference if it were weeks rather than eight <e> <s> but i understand that it would be several million pounds <e>", "<cs> my lords the change being made in the linking rule by this clause is the first change since the rule was introduced in when the figure of weeks was picked upon <e> <s> it is apparent that there has been no occasion to examine the practical effect of this rule in any depth before now <e> <s> this is the reason why the government did not have available the range of statistics that would have been desirable <e> <s> action to obtain these statistics is already in hand and the government intend to see that they will continue to be available for the future <e> <s> these figures will enable the department to gauge the effect of the change in the linking period <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing on the order paper in the name of my noble friend lady young <e>", "<cs> my lords at its meeting on th june the council deferred a decision on the european commissions proposal for an interim extension of the anti-poverty programme until the next labour and social affairs council meeting in november <e> <s> most member states including the united kingdom indicated that they would be in favour of an interim programme of the kind suggested by the italian presidency of the council as an alternative to the commissions proposal but one remained opposed to any further programme in this area until the commission had produced a report on the current activities as it is required to do by a council decision taken in <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but there is some doubt about what would happen to the projects the noble lord referred to if their funding from the council ceased <e> <s> it is probable that those projects funded by the home office which are now / between the council and the home office would be continued by the home office <e> <s> four different projects are covered by the home office two by the scottish development department two by northern ireland and one by the department of trade in wolverhampton <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i think it is true to say that many of the projects started by the council have been directed more towards helping social casualties than the actual provision of cash to deal with poverty in cash terms <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my friend lady young i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to say that i am sorry that my noble friend lady young cannot be here to listen to the interesting debate that we have had <e> <s> she has asked me to convey her apologies to your lordships <e> <s> as my noble friend said when she moved the second reading of the bill on nd june and as noble lords are well aware from discussion on the clauses although it is a social security bill its purpose is primarily financial <e> <s> leaving aside clauses and which are broadly technical clauses to are entirely concerned with achieving savings in public expenditure <e> <s> limited savings will also accrue from clause although its prime purpose is the implementation of the governments general election pledge to deal with the payment of supplementary benefit to strikers families <e> <s> the bill can be properly considered only in the context of our present economic difficulties and of the governments determination to tackle them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite understand the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not think i have said that nobody would suffer as a result of this bill <e> <s> i suggest that the noble baroness reads in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the answer is the same as the answers we have been giving throughout this bill <e> <s> it is no pleasure i may say to the noble baroness for either my noble friend baroness young my noble friend lord sandys or me to stand here and to discuss these measures which we have already said are thoroughly unpalatable <e> <s> it is a very uncomfortable operation to do this <e> <s> i am not suggesting in any way that anyone in this house has said anything which should not have been said <e> <s> if i did suggest that i most certainly apologise to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble and learned lord does not think that what i am doing is suitable <e> <s> i am simply making a closing speech at the end of the third reading and the noble and learned lord will no doubt be pleased to hear that i am just about to finish doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a pity if the noble lord had these views that he did not let us have them at committee stage when we could have considered them <e>", "<cs> my lords the majority of sight-tests and dispensings of spectacles are carried out under national health service provisions and we have no evidence to suggest that the combination of these functions within one business establishment is open to abuse <e> <s> but if the noble lord has any evidence of this perhaps he would kindly let me know <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is going back by a different route to a point which we debated on th january when he was concerned about the cost of spectacles <e> <s> but in fact as i said at the time the position is that we have referred this to the office of fair trading <e> <s> we hoped to have a reply by th april <e> <s> i understand that it will not now come for another two months <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is much more knowledgeable on this subject than i am and i am sure that what he says is right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the whole matter is in front of the office of fair trading <e> <s> i doubt whether we can take this matter any further until they report <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am sure that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is taking us back to the debate which we had in january when we went into the whole question of the expense of frames in great detail <e> <s> this is a matter which the office of fair trading is examining <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a brilliant idea <e>", "<cs> my lords plans have been agreed in principle between health and education departments the chiropodists board and the main professional bodies to raise the output of chiropodists from recognised chiropody schools by per cent <e> <s> over the level achieved in <e> <s> further expansion at these schools will be made as resources permit <e> <s> the chiropodists board has also approved the opening of two new schools in plymouth and in east sussex which between them will add another places by <e> <s> the scope for further progress will be kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that there is a considerable shortage of registered chiropodists in the country <e> <s> the total number of registered chiropodists is of whom work in the national health service and in the private sector <e> <s> it is well known that the number of chiropodists should be increased but it will take time <e> <s> it is a question of first training the teachers <e> <s> there are teachers and more are required <e> <s> so it will take time to train the teachers and then to recruit further chiropodists <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i know that there are accommodation and resources problems but i will pass on to my right honourable friend what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords as was made clear at an earlier stage the government do not take kindly to this amendment <e> <s> we think it is unnecessary because should the need arise the secretary of state is already able without new powers to vary the allocation to regional health authorities to reflect particular circumstances and regional health authorities already can and do take into account such special factors in determining the allocations to the present area or future district health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords will be aware we are concerned as a government that all employers in the public and the private sector should accept their proper responsibility for employing disabled people <e> <s> as one means to achieve this we consider that employers should be publicising their arrangements for recruitment and training of the disabled <e> <s> as the noble lord lord banks has just mentioned we shall on wednesday in this house and in another place be considering regulations being laid under the companies act prescribing the information which companies must include in their directors reports on the policies they have applied during the past financial year for the employment of the disabled <e> <s> information will be required on their policies for giving full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled persons

sensible person who is liable to break his glasses has a spare pair and if you do break your glasses you can always go back within months to your optician who has your prescription and get another

competition we have also to take into account the views of the medical profession <e>", "<cs> my lords the position on that is that if somebody goes against the regulations of the general optical

difficulty is the fact that if somebody imports something unless they actually make a confession that they are importing it for a particular reason you simply do not know why they are importing it <e>

am afraid that quite unintentionally i have already answered my noble friend on this point as he will have heard <e> <s> i doubt whether the committee will want me to say again what i said just now by mistake <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will be glad to hear that we propose to put forward an amendment on this point <e> <s> we intend to consider this proposal with a view to bringing forward an appropriate amendment at report stage <e> <s> i therefore hope that my noble friend will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to oppose this amendment the effect of which would be to oblige the secretary of state to refuse to issue a licence for the importation or exportation of a specimen of a species listed in schedule for the purposes of trade <e>", "<cs> again i am afraid that i must oppose the amendment which would have the effect as the noble earl has said of prohibiting exhibition to the public of a species listed on the new schedules and proposed for the act or of a part or derivative of such a species unless a specified licence had been issued <e> <s> at one time we seriously considered including such a provision in the bill but we concluded that it would not be justified <e> <s> the major effect of the provision would be upon zoos and museums <e> <s> the licensing of captive bred specimens which it would make necessary would be particularly onerous on the former <e> <s> this would have little benefit and could even have the result of hindering some of the important captive breeding projects being conducted by zoos <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no evidence of medical unemployment arising from the reasons specified by the noble lord <e> <s> on th december unemployed persons were registered as seeking work as doctors in great britain but there is no evidence that this is due to cutbacks <e> <s> health authorities generally are not cutting back on appointments to medical posts <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has figures i do not have my lords and course some of them are estimates for example the or doctors he mentioned <e> <s> the position at the moment is that at a time of very high unemployment throughout the country the number of doctors who are unemployed many temporarily is per cent <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is impossible in any industry to have everybody fully employed at any time <e> <s> some of these people are moving from one area to another and some of them are unemployed for only very short periods <e> <s> if only we had the same record of employment throughout the country as we have with national health service doctors we should all be very happy <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be interesting to know in what specialty this particular doctor was involved <e> <s> i know it varies in different areas but i am very surprised at what the noble lord tells me and perhaps he will let me have details <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will undoubtedly reduce the number of unemployed over a period of time when we have got the economy on to a proper basis <e>", "<cs> my lords on st october there were general medical practices in inner london with less than patients providing unrestricted general medical services <e> <s> twenty-four doctors in those practices were aged or over <e> <s> a further practices provide restricted services mostly to staff of hospitals or institutions <e> <s> two doctors in those restricted practices were aged or over <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely true <e> <s> there is nothing to stop a national health service doctor from having private patients as well as national health service patients <e> <s> that has always been the case and i do not think it has been suggested that it should change <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is no doubt aware that the whole question of primary health care deficiencies in inner london and we realise that there are some is currently being considered by a study group established by the london health planning consortium under the chairmanship of professor donald acheson professor of clinical epidemiology at the university of southampton <e>", "<cs> my lords like everyone else i agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised at the strength of the arguments which have been introduced in favour of this amendment and we may have to think about it again <e> <s> the reason i say that is that we have had legal advice that the powers are sufficient <e> <s> i am also told that the customs powers which are already in existence are considered sufficient to cover breaches of the import prohibition <e> <s> this is evidenced by the ever-increasing number of seizures which are made at ports and airports <e>", "<cs> i was going on to the question of prosecutions <e> <s> obviously the difficulty here is that the burden of proof as the noble lord lord houghton said is being shifted under this amendment <e> <s> as the committee knows it is usual in criminal proceedings that the burden is on the prosecutor and not on the defendant <e> <s> that is the nub of the problem over this amendment <e> <s> i think most noble lords would not wish to have an exception to the <e>", "<cs> we touched on this in a short debate on the question whether clause should <e>", "<cs> but they lose their licence <e>", "<cs> we are of course talking about endangered species <e> <s> eighty per cent of the animals that come in are neither endangered nor vulnerable and it is really about endangered species that we are talking where a licence is required <e> <s> if we tie that to the port of entry and even the time of entry it probably gives as good a control of the situation as one could possibly get <e>", "<cs> i understand that in the united states of america they have had considerable difficulties as a result of their blanket designation <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why we prefer the licensing system <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i cannot expand on it <e> <s> all i know is that they have had difficulties and that is one of the reasons why we have decided on this as being a better system <e> <s> i cannot say much more on this subject <e> <s> the noble lord either withdraws the amendment or he does not <e>", "<cs> they have not changed it yet but it may be with our good example they will do so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for speaking to all these amendments <e>", "<cs> the basic point is whether or not we stick to the washington convention <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> we sympathise to a great extent with the amendment <e> <s> there seems a need for example for a police constable who sees someone shooting at an obviously protected bird to be able to enter land to investigate <e> <s> on the other hand we are not happy about the wording of the amendment <e> <s> i undertake to consider whether a government amendment to achieve the aims encompassed by this amendment should be tabled at a later stage and accordingly i invite the noble lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i agree with the amendment <e> <s> undertake to raise the matter with my noble friend lord bellwin and therefore invite the noble lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to hear that from my noble friend behind me because i am not in favour of the amendment <e> <s> while understanding the intentions behind the amendments the government consider the bill as drafted to achieve the right balance and this reflects the present position <e> <s> we carefully considered an increase in the maximum penalty levels but concluded that it was right to use the statutory maximum fine currently for offences involving the illegal introduction of non-native species which are potentially the most harmful of the offences in this part of the bill <e> <s> also we have maintained the power which allows magistrates to send people to prison in respect of certain offences for up to three months and the multiplier provision which allows penalties to he applied separately in respect of each bird or egg which is the subject of a charge <e> <s> that is the governments view on this matter and i hope that the noble baroness will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the opticians act lays down that only registered medical practitioners and opticians may sell optical appliances to patients <e> <s> however under nhs arrangements patients have a legal right to ask for their prescriptions and take them to any registered practitioner of their choice to be dispensed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been into this question on a number of occasions before <e> <s> the situation is that anybody with a prescription can take it to someone who is prepared to sell him glasses <e> <s> on the other hand anybody who is selling glasses without an optical practitioner present to make sure that the patient is getting the right glasses is going against the dictates of the general optical council and can in fact be prosecuted <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is that a patient may have nothing wrong with him except the fact that he is getting a bit older and cannot see as well as he used to <e> <s> on the other hand he could have something else wrong with him such as hypertension diabetes or glaucoma which can easily be seen in an eye examination <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> i really cannot remember what i did say at that time <e> <s> i am sure that it made very good sense and if anybody wants to check it he has only to read <e>", "<cs> my lords harrods and selfridges have been providing this service for some years <e> <s> debenhams have now started doing so in most of their shops <e> <s> anybody else can have a go as long as they have the services of a registered practitioner <e>", "<cs> my lords to the tedium of noble lords i have tried to make that point many times before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my honourable friend the minister of health will make a note of what the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> we are concerned in this context with the beauty of nature not with nature introduced by human hand indeed if that were the meaning of natural beauty there would not be much natural beauty around <e> <s> the fact that a tree has been planted the course of a stream changed or the land <e>", "<cs> i hope that this answer will be more successful than my last one <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to ensure that a management agreement under clause will be a local land charge <e> <s> where such an agreement binds successors in title which will usually be the case this is provided for automatically by the local land charges act <e> <s> the agreement will be a local land charge both as regards restrictive and positive covenants <e> <s> but although a management agreement made under clause will normally bind successors it will be open to the parties to the agreement to provide otherwise <e> <s> in that event there is no purpose in registering the agreement as a local land charge because only the parties will be bound by its provisions <e> <s> to do so would moreover be out of line with the normal practice that one does not make express provision for the registration of something that is already a local land charge <e> <s> i hope that that clears up the point and that my noble friend will be able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> with regard to the first amendment the countryside commission has a statutory duty under section of the countryside act to advise local authorities in matters relating to the countryside as it thinks fit <e> <s> but it is the local planning authorities which have the executive task of landscape conservation <e> <s> they are the ones who have the responsibility of negotiations of management agreements with farmers and they must meet the cost <e> <s> i think we have to recognise that this requires delicate judgment and often there will be a need for urgent action if agreement is to be reached within a short space of time so as to dissuade a farmer from proceeding with an agricultural operation which in the view of the local authority would best be avoided <e> <s> we must try to keep a distinction between conservation advice from the commssion which the local authorities get in many ways and involvement of the commission in the detailed terms of individual management agreements implementing conservation aims <e>", "<cs> i am sure that everybody appreciates the concern for the environment which has motivated this amendment <e> <s> we are all concerned that new highways cutting through the countryside should blend in with the scenery and intrude as little as possible <e> <s> since the amendments of the highways act which are proposed are in terms of the provision of boundaries walls and fences by the authority which is constructing the works i must say a few words about the legal position <e> <s> the fact is that highway authorities are under no legal obligation at all to provide any kind of fencing along highways <e>", "<cs> we hope to issue a consultation paper within the next days and as my noble friend lord sandford suggested we propose to put an amendment in the bill in another place assuming the consultation period has been concluded <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to be able to tell the noble baroness lady david that we are happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not intend to give the noble lord what he calls a dusty answer and i doubt whether it will be quite as short as i should like it to be <e> <s> as the noble lord with all his experience will be aware there is already statutory provision for the secretary of state to consult the countryside commission before choosing his appointees and this process of consultation is a full and thorough one <e> <s> the chairman is already consulted by the minister about each individual on the short list for appointment <e> <s> there are ministerial appointees to national park authorities in england and a further in wales <e> <s> the range of interests represented is very wide as the noble lord mentioned including at present academics scientists farmers architects surveyors and at least one bank clerk <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the views of the noble lord lord melchett about the way in which the ncc have carried out their work <e> <s> perhaps he is right that in the last amendment they were against the government but in many other respects so many of the provisions of the bill are a result of the contributions which the ncc staff have made after wide consultations with other experts in the conservation world <e>", "<cs> yes we see it exactly that way <e> <s> we think that is in point of fact what happens <e> <s> turning to paragraphs <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with quite a number of amendments together <e> <s> perhaps i could speak first to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the water authorities present statutory duty to have regard to conservation of landscape and wildlife archeological sites and historic buildings and so on and the formulation of their proposals is extremely important <e> <s> i agree with and sympathise wholeheartedly with the noble lords view that the water boards must take their conservationist responsibilities seriously <e> <s> however the government think it is unreasonable to impose this new statutory duty upon them <e> <s> indeed i believe that a duty to take steps to preserve natural beauty to conserve nature and to protect archeological sites and historic buildings when considering what they propose to do would positively inhibit them in carrying out their prime function <e> <s> it is the water authorities main task to provide sufficient water for the needs of our population to remove sewerage and to provide for its effective disposal <e>", "<cs> i think that is a perfectly fair case but i do not think that it really changes what i said in my reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add one word <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett asked me whether the water authorities have power to spend money on these water conservation measures <e> <s> the answer is that they have <e>", "<cs> that is that the amendment actually says <e>", "<cs> i feel that i can deal more easily now with the amendment than before i heard what the noble lord had to say about it <e> <s> i was far from clear about the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> it appeared to be taking away the countryside commissions duty to encourage a proper standard of behaviour and to replace it with a duty to take steps to tell visitors their rights and explain how to avoid damage <e> <s> what i can see the noble lord really means is that they should be doing both <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the way the amendment is drawn removes from the commission one job and gives them another <e> <s> as i do not think that we want to take away the job which they are now doing very well stopping people <e>", "<cs> i accepted an amendment a moment ago and i have just said that i would like to look again at this one but everybody has been talking ever since i said so <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the point made by my noble friend but the difficulty arises when something urgent has to be done <e> <s> if i may just go through the argument the purpose of giving notice of entry to the occupier of the land is because he as occupier would need to let the authorised person on to the land and suffer any immediate inconvenience there may be <e> <s> the owner will of course get the notice where he is also the occupier <e>", "<cs> not everybody has an agent and it may be very difficult to find out where the owner is <e> <s> the occupier of course is easy but the owner could well be away in australia <e>", "<cs> i think if the occupier was doing something he is not supposed to do he must be there or he would not be able to do it <e>", "<cs> i must agree with that <e> <s> i can see that nobody is really very happy about this <e> <s> i will tell your lordships what i will be prepared to do which is to go part of the way to a halfway house and consider putting down an amendment at report stage along the lines that the owner as well as the occupier must be given hours notice of entry only where the purpose is in connection with compensation <e> <s> what one could not do is to do that in the case of something which needed urgent action <e> <s> i do not know whether that would help the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> we will certainly consider whether owner or occupier would not be an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords blood products which are imported for medicinal purposes are subject to licensing under the medicines act <e> <s> the controls over manufacturing and distribution including import include provision for checks on the selection of blood donors and the facilities used for collection of the blood the in-process manufacturing controls and testing of the final product before release <e>", "<cs> my lords blood products are not purchased centrally they are purchased by health authorities and i regret that up-to-date information on the expenditure on imported products is not available <e> <s> the country from which these products come is mainly the united states and some also come from austria and one or two other european countries <e> <s> so far as concerns making sure that these products are free from infection undoubtedly the careful checks which are made at all stages are extremely effective for all except a very few products one of which is used in the case of haemophiliacs <e> <s> there is a danger that factor viii which has to be injected into haemophiliacs can have in it a strain of hepatitis and at the moment there is no way of testing for these strains <e> <s> that is the one product as to whose freedom from infection we cannot be absolutely certain <e> <s> however every effort is made to see that it is not infected and although occasionally something may happen it is not of a serious nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that undertaking was embarked upon before this government came into power and that the noble lord knows a great deal about this matter <e> <s> there is no doubt that much of the material which comes to us comes from areas some i believe comes from mexico which occasion the making of the most careful checks <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord knows very well how these arrangements are made <e> <s> it must have been exactly the same in his time <e>", "<cs> my lords the long-term aim is that we should be self sufficient in blood products <e> <s> at the moment we import less than half of what is needed in the country <e> <s> the main laboratory is at elstree and it is now being upgraded <e> <s> by the end of next year there will be a doubling of the production there <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can answer that very fully but certainly immediately anything comes into the country it is checked at all stages <e> <s> i should come back to the point raised by the noble lord lord wells-pestell where he said that i should know the actual total expenditure on blood products <e> <s> i cannot give an accurate figure but i would think that it is something of the order of million to million but that is only an estimate <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we are anxious to get to the point where we are independent of supplies from abroad <e> <s> as the noble lord said we are spending about million to upgrade elstree and that will be completed by the end of next year <e> <s> we should very much like to be able to spend the million or whatever is needed completely to rebuild or hugely to expand elstree but at the moment for reasons which the noble lord will understand since we have met these reasons before now we are not anxious to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the gallant poles who settled here after the war are entitled as individuals to all social security benefits in the same way as are other united kingdom residents and no separate records are kept of them as a group <e>", "<cs> my lords if there are any special cases i should like to hear of them <e> <s> the poles are entitled to all the social security benefits pensions war pensions and so on just like our own nationals <e> <s> i do not think there is very much more that the government can do <e> <s> we all appreciate the magnificent work and service given by the poles during the war and i think we do everything that we can to help them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not have the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord if i can find the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not know the answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add to what i have said <e> <s> i am entirely in agreement with the tributes to the magnificent service of the poles in the last war <e> <s> we do everything we can to help them <e> <s> there is a home at newton abbot in devonshire which is run by my department where poles are looked after <e> <s> they are not able to assimilate into this country because of language difficulties and so on <e> <s> some of their dependants are there and some children are there <e> <s> normally the poles have managed to get jobs here in this country <e> <s> they are entitled to the supplementary benefits and pensions available to our own nationals <e>", "<cs> my lords if the pension age for men were reduced to it is estimated that the net cost to government funds for a full year at november rates would be in the order of million <e> <s> this estimate takes account of the savings resulting from consequential vacancies expected to be filled by people on the unemployment register <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but one cannot leave the financial aspect out of it altogether <e> <s> the calculation of million was based on the pattern of employment remaining the same as it is now with men between and and two-thirds of the vacancies being taken up by those on the unemployment register <e> <s> that is because all vacancies will not be taken up nor will there always be qualified people available in the areas concerned to take them up <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not actually tell you that but i could say that if we made the pensionable age for both men and women it would even itself out completely <e> <s> but it might be rather difficult to sell the idea to women who have been expecting to receive a pension at the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody deserves it more than the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords things have changed a little in pension arrangements since the days when the noble lord started work <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to explain that <e> <s> we are assuming that for people between and the pattern would be the same as it is now for those between and <e>", "<cs> my lords i

<e> <s> i am not sure that this is really a point i can go very far with <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord and his noble friend lord shinwell have a very similar view on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must make clear that it is very difficult to make any quick changes in this matter not only as far as the individual is concerned but also regarding the state and occupational pension schemes <e> <s> in due course the earnings-related addition in the pensions will build up and then it will be very much easier to do these changes when people will be able to afford to retire on a slightly reduced pension <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the supplementary benefit requirements regulations laid before the house on rd march be approved <e> <s> in her recent announcement of the general benefit uprating my noble friend lady young was not able to mention one minor item the repairs and insurance allowance payable to certain householders on supplementary benefit <e> <s> it is my duty now to invite your lordships to approve the statutory instrument laid before your lordships house which increases the rate of the repairs and insurance allowance <e> <s>

been told by the department is the governments line and their views on these matters <e> <s> i shall not be able to answer all the questions but as soon as i can i shall certainly see that they are answered <e>", "<cs> certainly i guarantee to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are aware of the need for special treatment of patients with injuries of the back involving the spinal cord and recognise that proper care and treatment can minimise the danger of aggravating the injury <e> <s> ambulancemen are most often involved in handling and moving patients before admission to specialised spinal units <e> <s> their basic training includes the management of casualties with spinal injuries with emphasis on the loading and unloading to and from the ambulance <e> <s> they are also trained in the use of the specialised equipment for spinal injuries which is available in ambulances used for emergencies <e> <s> education in the care of patients with spinal injuries is part of a doctors normal training in the general care of accident victims <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the noble lord how important it is that everybody should be taught how to move patients on these occasions <e> <s> i understand that one of the things which we are all inclined to do unless we are told not to is to take off our jacket and roll it up as a pillow and put it behind the head of the person who is injured <e> <s> this can have an extremely serious effect on the persons neck if it is injured <e> <s> one is most certainly advised not to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has made an extremely important point <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on her views to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> i entirely agree that first-aid should certainly include information on how to treat people with spinal injuries <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that the house knows full well what marvellous training is given by the st john ambulance and the red cross organisations <e> <s> whether the government can in point of fact influence the public to take these courses i am not sure <e> <s> i should have thought that the response could be very much helped by the media <e> <s> i would hope that they would perhaps advise the public how important it is not only for themselves but for other people <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on that suggestion to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i might also add to what the noble baroness said that it really takes four people properly to lift somebody who has a spinal injury so that they are kept absolutely level and flat with one person holding the head and neck and the others down the body to keep it absolutely flat <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that and i am grateful to the noble lord for pointing it out <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the choice of motion that the noble lord lord wells-pestell has made <e> <s> though there are many issues on which he and i do not see eye to eye it is eminently desirable for your lordships to debate the important issues he has raised and the debate gives us on these benches an opportunity to explain fully the reasons for those aspects of government policy which the noble lord has mentioned to invite your lordships to see the problems he has raised in the perspective of the countrys overall situation and to deal with some of the myths that the opposition has been fostering both here and more frequently in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords the current regulations governing supplementary benefit came into force in november <e> <s> the government have not yet been able to obtain firm evidence of the effect on school leaving patterns <e> <s>

consumers <e> <s> most of this aid is given in the form of heating additions to supplementary benefit claimants <e> <s> working families on low incomes also benefit from the increase given to family income supplement to assist with heating costs <e> <s> this is the most generous fuel assistance programme ever <e> <s> supplementary benefit heating additions became from last november a matter of legal entitlement rather than discretion and many heating additions are now made automatically without the claimants having to ask for them <e> <s> these changes will go a long way towards ensuring that those entitled to help will get it <e> <s> there are two leaflets available on heating costs <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first of my noble friends supplementaries the heating additions were boosted substantially more than the rise in fuel prices in november when the basic rate heating addition was put up per cent <e> <s> and when the rpi fuel component rose by per cent <e> <s> the next up-rating will actually maintain this position as the rise will take into account the forecast rise in fuel prices <e>", "<cs> then my lords they are all genuine cases and in the case of people receiving supplementary benefit they automatically get the increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of those figures but i am grateful to my noble friend for having made them available <e>",

which concerns the important matter of parallel importation of proprietary medicinal products <e> <s> my noble friend and the other noble lords who produced the report are to be congratulated for submitting such a clear account of the position together with their views <e>", "<cs> my lorcs my honourable friend the minister for health considers that it would be detrimental to patients to have their need for spectacles assessed and their spectacles supplied by unqualified persons <e> <s> the restrictions on the testing of sight and the supply of spectacles which the opticians act lays down ensure that an individuals defect of sight is accurately assessed lenses which provide the optimum correction are prescribed and the prescription is correctly dispensed <e> <s> in addition the present arrangements ensure that patients sight is tested by practitioners who are qualified to recognise signs of eye or other disease and refer patients for early medical advice and treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether they are held responsible for their failure but the people who undertake the testing of eyesight are qualified practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather surprised at the noble lord lord winstanley as a doctor taking that view <e> <s> i should have thought that he would be more on the government s side about the importance of the health aspect as opposed to the consumer aspect of this subject <e>", "<cs> that was a rather long supplementary question my lords <e> <s> with regard to what is done in america i doubt whether the noble lord would expect me to make reply <e> <s> i entirely agree with him and he has said this before in the house that if one wears spectacles it is wise to have your prescription on you <e> <s> it is also wise to have a spare pair of spectacles as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggested that i had not answered the original question <e> <s> but the reason for that is that i have answered it about half a dozen times in the last year or so and most members of your lordships house are becoming rather bored with it <e> <s> one of the reasons for the present arrangements is that if you have your eyes properly tested by a qualified person not only can he see whether there is something wrong with your eyesight but he might see that you are likely to get hypertension or diabetes quite apart from diseases such as glaucoma <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with that point and i hope that the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge will make a note of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord first for his support and secondly for all the information that he has given to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that information in the precise form requested is not available centrally <e> <s> nor is it possible to provide estimates of future expenditure <e> <s> the only indication that i can give is that about million was spent by english health authorities in on capital schemes costing or more for providing or improving staff residences <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the responsibility of the health authorities in the area to see to these matters <e> <s> it will depend on how much they can afford to spend <e> <s> naturally the priority goes to the patient rather than to the nurse <e> <s> one appreciates the importance of nurses having as good accommodation as possible but i think that your lordships will agree that the patient comes first <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble baroness knows many of these nurses live out rather than in hospitals or nursing homes <e> <s> so far as payment is concerned a completely new system is now operating <e> <s> it started on st april this year <e> <s> over a period of four years the charges for accomomodation are going to be gradually increased to the kind of levels which they would have to pay outside <e> <s> as these increases come on there will be abatement of the charges to the nurses depending on the state of the accommodation and this will be agreed by the whitley council with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that it is extremely important but so far as the figures are concerned it is actually only since that the figure i gave to the house has been available because those figures have never been available in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords following the good example of previous speakers i shall not detain the house for very long <e> <s> when difficulties arose last summer for the members of the womens institute market in stockton-on-tees my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services made it clear that in his view parliament had never intended that section of the food and drugs act should require the registration by local authorities of domestic kitchens used to prepare food for sale at such markets <e> <s> accordingly i welcome the bill on behalf of the government <e> <s> i am sure that the house will agree that it is right to correct this small but important anomaly and further that on grounds of equity registration should also not apply where domestic kitchens are used to prepare food for sale for what i shall call charitable purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really see the connection with the common market <e> <s> we are talking about stockton-on-tees <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is obliged to make payment in accordance with the legal entitlement determined by the independent statutory authorities <e> <s> if the noble baroness knows of any claimants who have been paid less than their legal entitlement their cases will be investigated <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness probably knows that my right honourable friend sent out a consultation paper about this last october in order to try to tidy up what is rather a patchwork arrangement where there is a grant an allowance and maternity pay <e> <s> no consensus was reached on this and we are now considering waiting until the new sick pay scheme comes into operation before reviewing the whole question of maternity benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords it was with that idea in mind that a complete review of supplementary benefits was undertaken recently and now i think the noble lord will find that it is very much simpler both for claimants and for those who are administering the scheme <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the crux of the matter <e> <s> certainly the sum of was fixed in and has never been altered <e> <s> one of the options for a review of the system is to abolish both the maternity allowance and the maternity pay and hugely increase the maternity grant <e> <s> there are several other options but it is fairly complicated and i doubt whether the house would want me to go into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that discussions are taking place within the university of london and its medical schools about the implementation of the various parts of the plans for the re-organisation of medical education which were agreed by the university senate and court in recent weeks <e> <s> the proposals are expected to result in savings to the university of some million overall but information about the breakdown of this sum is not available to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be unhelpful but i think that the noble lord should be asking this question of the university itself not the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the detailed information which the noble lord has given to the house <e> <s> i am grateful to him and i am sure other noble lords are also grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of the figures which the noble baroness has quoted <e> <s> i am afraid that i am in no position to say whether her suspicions will be proved to be right or wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble lords sympathy for the anxiety over this matter which is being experienced in many quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords there is evidence that advanced training may enable ambulancemen to provide an improved service to patients but it is not yet clear that the overall benefits are sufficient to justify the cost which would in any event need to be weighed against other claims on national health service resources <e> <s> the government will also wish to take into account the report we are expecting shortly from the national health service working party on patient transport services <e> <s> while this has not been considering training as such its views on the more general role of the ambulance service could well have implications for training needs <e> <s> a number of ambulancemen voluntarily undergo training in more advanced techniques and we are aware that some health authorities have their own schemes this is a matter for them to decide in relation to other claims on the resources available locally <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this matter is slightly more complicated than it seems to be at first sight <e> <s> first of all of the work of the ambulancemen less than per cent <e> <s> is on emergency cases <e> <s> the whole question of the role and structure of the ambulance service has just been reviewed <e> <s> the report is in front of the regional health authorities at the moment <e> <s> it will come to the secretary of state probably next month and the whole situation is being looked at <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the whole experience in this country of various experimental schemes and the experience abroad will certainly be taken into account <e> <s> i know that there are very successful schemes in australasia and america although of course they are localised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly aware that many lives have been saved by ambulance-men <e> <s> the noble baroness is asking whether further advanced training should be given to them <e> <s> this is a complicated matter which also affects the unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the brighton cardiac scheme and the successes they have had there <e> <s> the general view is that this must be for the local authorities to consider in line with the resources they have and it is questionable whether the number of lives saved is satisfactory compared with the cost of the service <e> <s> this is a very important matter and is one of the main aspects that will be considered <e>", "<cs> i am sure that is true my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to disappoint my noble friend but obviously this is a difficult matter when it comes to the rural areas <e> <s> as the noble lord lord winstanley mentioned the important thing is to get the ambulance to the patient very quickly <e> <s> to do that in isolated rural areas would seem a very difficult thing to do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords all the people who are interested in this matter will be consulted and in fact have been consulted on the report which is now going to regional health authorities <e>", "<cs> i believe the answer is that it varies my lords <e> <s> certainly it is the intention that all ambulancemen should have i think within two years refresher courses i am not able to say that they all have them <e>", "<cs> i would rather doubt that quite honestly my lords because we must consider the costs of quite simple arrangements and i think that to have helicopters flying all over the country to outlying areas would be a very advanced move and unlikely to be considered at any rate in the early stages <e>", "<cs> i believe they do my lords <e>", "<cs> i am glad to repeat what i said on second reading namely that the government support the amendment <e> <s> the amendment is not confined purely to scout and guide huts it relates to premises generally <e> <s> but i can assure the committee that this does not open the way for widespread circumvention of registration <e> <s> this is because the exemption granted by the bill will not apply if the person preparing the food is doing so in the course of his or her trade or business <e> <s> again if premises have to be registered because they are caught by section the fact that on occasion food is prepared in them for sale for charitable purposes will not exempt them from registration <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord plant for the careful way in which he described the bill including the background of the brodrick report which i think gave us all a very good idea of what the bill is all about <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate mr spearing on having initiated this bill in another place <e>", "<cs> disappointingly enough i am afraid i cannot accept this amendment reasonable as it looks on the face of it <e> <s> the new subsection to section already requires the secretary of state to ensure that the essential information relevant to the uprating is given the date his estimate of the increase necessary to restore the value of benefits and the actual increases which he proposes <e> <s> the new statutory requirement to make a statement is thus fairly comprehensive <e> <s> but in any case it has always been the practice for the uprating announcement to be full and reasoned and certainly no further statutory provision for this is needed <e> <s> the minister making it always has been and always will be anxious to explain what he is proposing and why and what is true of the secretary of state is also of course true of the chancellor who again by convention gives broad details of social security changes in the budget statement immediately before the secretary of states statement <e> <s> i hope in the light of that the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the current provisions relating to the date of the uprating require it to be not later than the end of the month in which the anniversary of the previous uprating falls <e> <s> last year it was the week beginning th november <e> <s> this years had to be before the end of november <e> <s> since different benefits are uprated on different days of the week this years uprating could not be later than the week beginning rd november the date announced by my right honourable friend on th march and precisely months after the last uprating <e> <s> these current provisions were introduced as recently as last year in the social security act <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to the week period <e> <s> this was to prevent the up-rating date creeping forward as it has been with consequential additional expenditure implications <e>", "<cs> what we are trying to do is to maintain the position we have now that the up-rating should be not later than the end of the month in which the anniversary of the previous uprating falls <e> <s> this year your lordships will see we are having precisely the same date as last year <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady jeger spoke most movingly on the subject of unemployment which worries all of us so much and so i should like to say a word about this matter in reply <e> <s> the government have repeatedly said that we shall consider what the rate of unemployment benefit should be when it is brought into tax in the light of all the circumstances at the time <e> <s> i understand of course <e> <s> the force of the arguments that the noble baroness has put forward that abatement must end when taxation starts <e> <s> those arguments will be high among the considerations of which we shall have to take account <e> <s> but restoring the abatement will cost some million a year and we must take that into account as well <e>", "<cs> it can be put in any way one likes but from a public expenditure point of view this would make a difference of million and at a time when we are having to constrain public expenditure as much as we possibly can clearly we cannot visualise this sort of expenditure at any rate at this moment with any equanimity <e> <s> what i have said is that we shall consider this along with the other considerations at a time when unemployment comes into tax <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised a very important point <e> <s> i entirely agree with him on the principle and certainly i know that all my colleagues feel as strongly as he does that the take-up of benefits should be improved in any way possible <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i should like to point out that my noble friend lady faithfull mentioned the citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> the director recently met the social security advisory committee to discuss common interests in this area <e> <s> i think that that is the type of move that we can make that will really help in this matter <e> <s> on the question of disablement benefits there is now a new poster in post offices featuring <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has drawn attention to the trap about which we have heard so much and it is a matter of great concern to all noble lords <e> <s> the subject was discussed in some detail at the committee and report stages of this bill in another place and the problem arises as the noble lord explained to the committee because entitlement to any one of the three benefits mentioned may prevent some people depending on their circumstances from ever <e>", "<cs> my lords the world health assembly which is the governing body of the world health organisation voted on st may to approve a resolution adopting an international code of marketing practice for breast-milk substitutes in the form of a recommendation to member states <e> <s> this resolution was passed by an overwhelming majority of votes to one with three abstentions <e> <s> the united kingdom delegation voted in favour of the resolution which the government see as an important contribution to the aim of improving the standards of child-feeding throughout the world <e> <s> the only delegation to vote against the resolution was that of the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he said about the governments attitude <e> <s> i entirely confirm what he said about the danger to babies where water is contaminated <e>", "<cs> my lords the delegation from this country made their views extremely clear and they fully supported what the world health assembly were trying to do in the code of practice which has now been adopted <e> <s> it was only adopted on st may and consultations will now be going on with the manufacturers and others interested in this matter <e> <s> so far as the attitude of the united states is concerned i think they know our views but i do not think we can do very much more than we have already done <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that the best food for babies is breast milk <e> <s> it has many advantages about which i do not think i need tell the house <e> <s> some noble lords may think that a more appropriate person than myself should be answering the question and that the combination of the noble lord lord brockway and i might be improved but still this is where we stand <e>", "<cs> my lords if the mothers are starving and have no milk they will no doubt be unable to buy substitute milk <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord and i shall certainly place this in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords vat is not chargeable on subscriptions paid by members of trade unions nor on the political levy <e> <s> this in fact accords with the eec sixth directive on vat article a <e>", "<cs> my lords the present situation is that it is not considered that non-profit making clubs of all kinds can well be compared with trade unions <e> <s> trade unions and professional associations where it is customary for people to pay subscriptions are considered to be on all fours but for instance the national liberal club or the carlton club though they have political test for membership would not be considered to be in any way suitable to a trade union <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has clearly done his homework on this my lords <e> <s> the exemptions are for non-profit-making organisations with aims of a political trade union religious patriotic philisophical philanthropic or civic nature <e> <s> i would suggest to my noble friend that perhaps one of the clubs he is considering produces many goods and services for which vat is chargeable and the political test of membership is ancillary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord was suggesting that there was something anti-trade union about the question <e> <s> i am quite unable to answer that question as i did not ask it <e>", "<cs> my lords the case for exempting from payment of prescription charges all those who are unemployed is not a strong one <e> <s> not everyone who is unemployed for example those receiving short-term unemployment benefit require assistance with the cost of prescriptions <e> <s> of the others many already qualify for exemption under the existing arrangements <e> <s> for instance per cent <e> <s> of those registered unemployed receive supplementary benefit and as a consequence are automatically exempt from charges <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to be going rather wide of the original question <e> <s> i do not think that i should reply on the whole economic policy of the government <e> <s> i would say in considering exemptions from prescription charges that there are many other groups represented by other people who come forward such as invalidity pensioners and also groups who are not included in the specified medical conditions which are also part of the exemptions <e> <s> there is no actual evidence that those unemployed require more assistance in this matter and probably noble lords will agree that those who already have other medical conditions would have a higher priority <e>", "<cs> my lords that is possible but i am in no position to answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is aware that all those on supplementary benefit and family income supplement get exemption from prescription charges <e> <s> furthermore there are many who are somewhat above the supplementary benefit level who are entitled to apply for exemption on the basis of low income <e>", "<cs> my lords this sort of situation is considered all the time in respect of the unemployed but other groups are also represented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords for their instructive comments and for the sympathy of the noble baroness concerning the complicated job that this is <e> <s> the noble baroness asked when the manual will be published and how much it will cost <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services announced that the s manual as it will be called will be published next winter <e> <s> i cannot go much further than say that i think that means that it will be in and not in january or february next year but i am not absolutely positive of that <e> <s> the cost of publication will be decided nearer the time <e> <s> i will certainly see that account is taken of the noble baronesss comments on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the controls which govern the supply of medicines and spectacles are designed to protect patients <e> <s> the differences between the controls in each of these fields reflect the different considerations which apply <e> <s> in the case of medicines the government on the advice of the medicines commission decided that people should continue to have the right to purchase freely universally accepted remedies to treat the everyday symptoms experienced by us all <e> <s> in the case of spectacles the government considered that the optimum correction of an individuals eyesight could not be achieved by a standard form of spectacles and that a patients defect of sight should be corrected by a personal prescription determined by a suitably qualified practitioner <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords point very well <e> <s> of course it does not harm the eyes if one wears the wrong spectacles one may get a headache but it will not harm ones eyes <e> <s> on the other hand as i have said many times before in the interchanges that we have had on the spectacle front it is a great advantage to have your eyes tested by a qualified man in order to see that you have not started some incipient disease to the eyes diabetes or hypertension <e> <s> of course the main worry is glaucoma <e> <s> as regards the department of trade as i think my noble friend knows my honourable friend mrs oppenheim is anxious to have a review of the opticians act in co-operation with the office of fair trading and is at present in communication with my honourable friend the minister for health <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i answered that question when i answered my noble friends question saying that it was important to have ones eyes tested in order to ensure that one does not have some incipient disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and of course the house will realise that the member of your lordships house who presided over that committee was in fact the noble lord lord crook himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl is sensible enough always to have a spare pair of spectacles with him and no doubt will have his prescription on him as well <e> <s> if he takes the prescription to any optician and quite a number of other places nowadays where they have qualified practitioners he will be able to get another pair <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend knows on st may the ban on displaying prices was rescinded by the general optical council <e> <s> a number of opticians are displaying prices but i certainly could not tell the noble lord how many <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been no developments since th june to change the answer i gave on that date <e> <s> the government have always been concerned that no one should be deterred on financial grounds from seeking the treatment he needs and for this reason on each occasion when the prescription charge has been increased the income level at which people may claim low-income exemption has been raised <e> <s> the government feel that by this method help is available to a far wider section of the community who are living on a low income than would be the case if help was restricted to specified groups many of whom have other resources <e>", "<cs> my lords this really does seem rather wide of the question <e> <s> the national health service is in no way run down <e> <s> it is one of the very few growth industries in the country today with more real money made available annually <e> <s> therefore i do not think i can answer the rest of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the average cost of a prescription is currently so the charge is considerably under one-third of the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of that and in inflationary times this is pretty difficult to avoid <e> <s> i would say that out of all the prescriptions and there are something over million per annum in england per cent <e> <s> are given free of charge and per cent <e> <s> are provided on the basis of prepayment certificates or season tickets as they are better known <e>", "<cs> this is a continuing worry my lords not only in this case but in all matters of benefits <e> <s> the government make strenuous efforts to make this information available <e> <s> it is of course well known in all the offices around the country but the question of take-up is a perpetual worry which does not apply just today but has always applied <e>", "<cs> i wish i could my lords but i am afraid i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers are always prepared to consider sympathetically requests which they receive for meetings with representative organisations <e> <s> in my honourable friend the minister for health issued invitations to a wide range of organisations to discuss with him matters of concern to the nursing or midwifery professions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord molloy when he asks a supplementary question not to give a lecture at the same time <e> <s> i am very keen to answer any questions which the noble lord might have but he does not have to make a speech when he asks them <e> <s> the noble lord is pushing at a door that was opened on st august by my honourable friend who

taken up <e> <s> my honourable friend the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that everybody agrees with the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> i believe that most of us regard nurses as being among the most respected of people <e> <s> they are frightfully good <e> <s> they always put their patients first and they have not at any time used their muscle at the expense of patients to get higher wages

did not know it and i will certainly write to the noble lord <e> <s> however his suggestion does not seem to conform with the fact that the number of nurses has been steadily increasing <e> <s> during the course of the past year the number of nurses has increased from to in whole term equivalents <e> <s> the number who completed their course of training was higher than it has ever been before and hence the increase in recruitment <e> <s> but i am interested in what the noble lord has said and i will write to him about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very happy to do so <e>", "<cs> no my lords it has not <e> <s> a non-departmental public body is only identified for abolition merger or being made independent of government when its function no longer needs to be discharged in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government took office out of quangos at that time have been abolished and have been identified for abolition in the future <e> <s> ten new bodies have been established <e> <s> one was the london advisory group which has already completed its work and been disbanded <e> <s> two the steering group on health service information and the working group on rickets have specific short-term remits and will be wound up when they have done their job <e> <s> four are replacements of one or more previously existing bodies <e> <s> an example is the social security advisory committee which replaced the national insurance advisory committee and the supplementary benefits commissions for great britain and northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is ranging rather widely but i entirely agree with him that the word quango is not a good one <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> my lords area health authorities are not quangos nor are they non-departmental public bodies <e> <s> they are integrated into the national health service <e> <s> i am certainly happy to produce the information for which the noble lord has asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not know the answer to that <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords this gives me an opportunity of saying that most of the people who are employed in quangos simply get travelling expenses and subsistence <e> <s> they do a magnificent job and it is not really a question of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords until the noble lord drew the matter to our attention we were not aware that cigarettes were advertised in pornographic magazines <e> <s> new restrictions on cigarette advertising were included in the voluntary agreement with the tobacco industry which my right honourable friend announced in another place on st november <e> <s> this agreement will last only until st july and we shall be considering what should follow it <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that all companies have responsibilities to the general public as well as to their shareholders <e> <s> however i doubt whether i should comment on whether or not tobacco companies should advertise their products in pornographic magazines <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should give a plug to the pornographic magazines in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i will try to get on <e> <s> it might also be wondered whether the health warning on advertisements in pornographic magazines should be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i know there are many people who take the same view that the noble lord takes <e> <s> my right honourable friend made a voluntary agreement last november <e> <s> he did not manage to achieve all that he wanted to achieve which is why the agreement is only going to last until july <e> <s> there are perpetual talks going on with the industry <e> <s> at the moment negotiations are going on about sports sponsorship the details of which are being kept confidential in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i really see the point of that question <e> <s> on the other hand i should like to say that the question seems to be directed to whether tobacco companies should advertise in these magazines and i should have thought that that also applied to other companies such as car manufacturers manufacturers of hi-fi equipment and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords they are certainly not advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords the vast majority of social security beneficiaries have continued to receive their full entitlement during the civil service dispute <e> <s> but i regret to say that since th june it has not been possible to pay child benefit for newly-born children <e> <s> since th july new retirement pensioners have been paid a

shall have to have discussions with my right honourable friend and go into this matter <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will join us in discussions after this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost to public funds resulting from the civil service dispute has been mainly in terms of interest on the additional borrowing resulting from delays to the collection of revenue <e> <s> up to the end of november the estimated extra interest amounted to million to million <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time when the strike was settled the outstanding revenue not collected was approximately billion <e>

additional expenditure <e> <s> it would be purely a guess to say what that figure would be <e> <s> it will depend on the level of interest rates and on the speed with which the remaining monies are collected <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there certainly was a loss of goodwill but i am glad to say that very good work is being done by the civil service in clearing up the outstanding problems and we are encouraged by the co-operation that exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord moiloy will be glad to hear that the government have said they will enter into negotiations for the settlement without a predetermined cash limit <e> <s> we have also said that if an agreed settlement cannot be reached we will accept recourse to arbitration but on the understanding that the government reserve the right if necessary to ask the other place to approve setting aside the tribunals award on grounds of overriding national policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be not committed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting debate on this matter with very divided views and i shall now give the views of the government <e> <s> i appreciate the weight of my noble friends argument that mental welfare officers have a very valuable input to make in decisions about the future of a mentally disordered person including decisions about compulsory admission to hospital or guardianship <e> <s> in most circumstances i am sure that it is right that this officer should be involved in discussions with the family before the final decision is taken to make an application under the mental health act <e> <s> in most cases it is the mental welfare officer who makes the application <e> <s> but the provision that the patients nearest relative may be the person to make the application should i believe be retained for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> this amendment seems to me to repeat conditions which are already in the act <e> <s> first section provides for an emergency application for admission for assessment <e> <s> the applicant and the doctor who makes the supporting medical recommendation must be satisfied that <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern of the noble baroness that no patient should be detained for six months or more under section without a thorough initial assessment by the responsible psychiatrist to see whether detention is really appropriate <e> <s> i do not agree though that this amendment is necessary to achieve that aim <e> <s> the purpose of section is to provide for short-term assessment and treatment of patients when it is not clear whether or not long-term detention is needed <e> <s> there are other cases though where there is no doubt about a patients need for long-term treatment in hospital <e> <s> a patient may have been detained in hospital on a previous occasion then discharged because his responsible medical officer thought he had made enough progress under treatment to manage successfully outside hospital <e> <s> if events show that the patient cannot manage outside and the mental welfare officer and doctors who are familiar with his case are satisfied that an application under section should be made it is quite unnecessary for an application to be made first under section <e>", "<cs> we will try to give that information to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern which lies behind the amendment that the two medical recommendations necessary for detention should always be completely independent of each other <e> <s> it would be a serious matter if this were not so because it is a persons liberty which is at stake when the making of a recommendation for admission under the act is considered <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with my noble friend in his view that the mental health act often places a very heavy burden on mental welfare officers <e> <s> we must remember however that under this act people are being deprived of their liberty so that every possible step must be taken to ensure that the procedures set down by parliament are carefully and properly followed <e> <s> ensuring that this is so undoubtedly places sometimes difficult responsibilities on the professional staff concerned whether they be the social workers who are acting as mental welfare officers or the doctors concerned <e> <s> while every profession must assume responsibility for the way in which they practice in this case there is also an additional responsibility for ensuring that procedures set down in law to safeguard the interests of individuals whose liberty is in question are properly observed <e>", "<cs> the first point i should like to make is that we were a little confused by the placing of the brackets in this amendment <e> <s> there is an odd number which seems hardly possible and so i think the amendment may be slightly defective in that way <e> <s> however that is by the way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure for five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> we have had a particularly interesting debate on this amendment with views from the medical profession from my noble friend lord auckland who i know has much experience in hospitals and from the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord lord richardson his views are closer to those of the government <e> <s> although we agree with the concern behind this amendment we do not agree that a statutory provision is needed to ensure that detained patients receive the medical investigations and treatment that they require for any physical malfunction in the way that this amendment proposes <e> <s> it is already good practice for all mentally disordered patients to have a thorough examination of their physical and mental condition and this includes a range of special investigations <e> <s> psychiatrists are well aware of the need to ensure that all the medical needs of their patients are considered and met <e> <s> where they suspect the existence of a condition which requires assessment or treatment by a consultant in another specialty they would arrange for a consultation as a matter of good practice <e> <s> and consultant psychiatrists are particularly careful in assessing a new patient to see whether there is an underlying condition which may be contributing to what seem to be symptoms of mental disorder <e> <s> there is no need and i am convinced it would be wrong to legislate or say in a code of practice how doctors are to set about performing their professional duties that is purely a matter for the profession <e> <s> diagnosis is the keystone of medical practice and is what doctors are trained to do a long and thorough training both undergraduate and postgraduate <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for reminding us of the importance of this aspect of medical care but i hope she will agree to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords because few noble lords intend to take part in this debate i do not propose to deliver the fairly lengthy speech that i had been planning to make <e> <s> if however any noble lord wishes to raise any matters relevant to the bill i shall be happy to respond later <e> <s> without further ado i shall come straight to the provisions of the bill <e> <s> the bill has two purposes <e> <s> the first is to increase british shipbuilders statutory borrowing powers and the second is to enable the shipbuilding redundancy payments scheme for great britain and for northern ireland to be prolonged for two years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the two noble lords who have spoken for their general welcome for the bill and i shall try to answer one or two questions that were put to me <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede asked about privatisation and how likely it was that it would take place during the lifetime of the present government <e> <s> i would draw his attention to the fact that i said that time permitting we would wish to take powers during the lifetime of the government i did not actually say that we would be privatising it <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained the purpose of this amendment is to enable self-employed people to be given some tax relief on their own national insurance contributions to correspond with the relief given to employers in respect of the contributions which they are obliged to pay on behalf of their employees <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will be grateful to the noble lord lord spens for having initiated this debate <e> <s> the subject has been discussed <e>", "<cs> rather to the surprise of your lordships i and not my noble friend will be speaking on this amendment <e> <s> i am afraid we do not agree with the noble baronesss approach to this subject and although we do appreciate how important it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains the view of the government that the compensation terms should not be altered retrospectively <e> <s> the government will be submitting their observations on the applications mentioned by the noble lord to the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot satisfy the noble lord by saying that we will not make further applications for more time before making our replies <e> <s> the conservative government were never in favour of the act the noble lord is discussing or the compensation terms but have decided that there is no way in which they can retrospectively fairly change those terms <e>", "<cs> well my lords i think perhaps in all quarters of the house it will be realised that it is not always easy and very often it is impossible for any government to repair the damage of a previous administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord realises that there are nine applications by shipbuilding companies to the commission and they will be examining the whole basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the best i can do is to say that i will pass on those wise words of the noble lord to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting short debate on this subject which has ranged widely <e> <s> i do not promise to go into all the alleys which have been opened up <e> <s> my noble friends unstarred question raises a number of related issues <e> <s> he speaks of the governments policy in the personal savings market on the one hand which of course principally concerns the approach to national savings <e> <s> he talks also of finance in the housing market and ties this in with the whole question of the governments funding policy <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an extraordinarily interesting debate <e> <s> quite a number of the issues are familiar ones but we have had many other quite new aspects spoken about today and many of these aspects think will be of great interest to the director general of fair trading who as your lordships know is now examining the whole position <e>", "<cs> my lords the manufacturing advisory service for small and medium sized engineering firms has been operating for four and a half years <e> <s> over this period her majestys government have been very satisfied with the operation and achievements of the service <e> <s> its continuation for a further four years from was recently announced <e>", "<cs> my lords the manufacturing advisory service is operated on behalf of the department of industry by the production engineering research association <e> <s> five pera staff are employed full-time on mas and there are about retired industrialists working part-time to introduce the service <e> <s> the expenditure on mas is about million a year <e> <s> i think i have answered all my noble friends questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm the figures that the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> during the course of the time that mas has been operating the cost has been about million and the benefits are understood to be between million and million <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i need tell the noble lord what a small firm is but the <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the noble lords continents to my right honourable friend <e> <s> very good work is done by this service <e> <s> i understand that per cent <e> <s> of the firms that have used the service are fairly satisfied and per cent <e> <s> are well satisfied

get another man days service <e> <s> the applicant will pay half the cost and the other cost will be subsidised <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can say that <e> <s> so far as i know this subsidised service is available to all engineering companies whose employees number from to <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord i could not quite hear what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish i could answer the noble lord but i am afraid i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has sonic figures which i do not have i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank the noble lord lord bruce for the courteous things he said to me and like my noble friend the chief whip to apologise for any discourtesy he might have thought there was in the short notice given in relation to the order <e> <s> ft was certainly not intended in that way at all <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord realises that i cannot answer him at this moment my lords maybe some answer will strangely come to me while i am speaking <e>", "<cs> i did not say that my lords <e> <s> in fact the closure of plants is not just something that is happening in this country it is an eec move <e> <s> an interesting fact regarding the price of steel the noble lord mentioned the per cent <e> <s> increase is that the price of steel today on average is back to about what it was in the per cent <e> <s> increase which has taken place only brings us back to just about the level in <e> <s> the price of our steel is still below that of america and japan <e> <s> i think i have answered all the points that were raised <e> <s> if i have missed any i will write to the noble lords concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate my noble friend lord st just on raising this important and difficult issue <e> <s> it is a fact that there has over the last few years been a substantial rise in the extent of drug misuse in this country <e> <s> we do not have precise figures of the number of individuals who misuse hard drugs but the indicators of a growing problem in terms of quantities seized and reported addiction clearly exist <e> <s> the number of addicts notified to the home office by medical practitioners has doubled in the last five years from in to in <e> <s> although the majority of notified addicts are currently in their late twenties there has been a significant growth in new notifications among the younger age group <e> <s> there are however many who misuse drugs who never attempt to seek treatment <e> <s> estimates for the total number of hard drug misusers range from to and the true figure probably lies somewhere between these two estimates <e> <s> my noble friend is very right therefore to bring this situation to your lordships attention this evening and i am grateful for the opportunity to reply to the many points that have been raised <e> <s> it would be wrong of me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft wool textile industry scientific research levy amendment order which was laid before this house on nd march be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bishopston will be pleased to hear that wira itself is very happy with this new development and sees the co-ordination which the noble lord talked about working very well on a voluntary basis with firms being able to tailor their research even better under the new system to the requirements of their individual companies <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the rundown in the wool textile industry as a result of this governments policy <e> <s> the really great days of the wool textile industry peaked in the s and i am afraid that there has been a falling off in wool textiles ever since those days with admittedly a considerable fall-off in the period of the recent recession <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for their reception of these orders and one or two points have been raised <e> <s> the noble baroness mentioned the employers contribution rise which was also mentioned by other noble lords <e> <s> perhaps she would like to know that an employee on average weekly earnings will pay an increased contribution of no more than p per week as a result of the per cent <e> <s> reapportionment of the contribution between employer and employee <e> <s> the noble baroness asked me whether this was the thin end of the wedge and whether this might go on in the future but i am in no position to give her any views on that subject <e> <s> the noble baroness also asked what the million was worth to the pension industry but the noble lord lord banks kindly answered that matter for me <e>", "<cs> my lords the unintended profits referred to are believed to have been made mostly on spectacles containing single-vision lenses <e> <s> from the overseas trade statistics and information from the industry it is estimated that the united kingdom imports roughly per cent <e> <s> of such lenses used <e>", "<cs> i feel i should set the matter in some perspective my lords <e> <s> the noble lord is concerned about the million which had been unintentionally overpaid to opticians <e> <s> on the other hand the department owes the optical industry something like million for underpayments of which about / million has now been paid <e> <s> negotiations are proceeding on both counts <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the noble baroness knows that new fees have been fixed since st april <e> <s> the fees that are now being fixed are interim fees while the negotiations are going on for a full settlement of all the outstanding issues <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be going a little far to say so but one might hope that when this large amount of money is repaid to opticians and million is a lot of money there will be a fair chance that the charges for private spectacles will not go up or possibly may come down <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the noble lord is ranging a little widely <e>", "<cs> my lords the difference lies in the fact that the cheap imported lenses make it possible for the opticians to make a profit <e> <s> that is really where the problem has arisen and where the opticians buy their lenses has nothing to do with the department <e>", "<cs> my lords unhappily i cannot give a precise answer to that point <e> <s> the office of fair trading has promised to report during the course of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords as from november mobility allowance will rise to a week tax free compared to its may level of a week subject to tax <e> <s> over people now receive the allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her comments about the allowance which has i think received particular help from the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the transport and vehicle group component of the retail price index has risen by per cent <e> <s> since may the mobility allowance has increased by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that mobility allowance does not give a passport for free travel but i am not sure that i quite see the drift of the noble baronesss supplementary question <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords <e> <s> the position is that when the last administraton brought in mobility allowance it was on the basis of pension age as the upper limit for women and for men <e> <s> since then gradually the age limit for women has risen from to and both sexes who become eligible for the allowance before the age of can continue to be eligible for a further years up to the age of <e> <s> but at this stage it is not possible to scrub the limit altogether because the cost of that would be million pounds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has put the case absolutely correctly <e> <s> anyone who qualifies for and receives the allowance before the age of will continue to receive it until the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble earl says is perfectly true <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment those who are eligible will continue to receive the allowance until the age of <e> <s> as i understand it it will be seven or eight years from today that the first of those people will become <e> <s> perhaps between now and seven or eight years hence it might prove possible to whichever government are in power to extend the limit from age to say age <e>", "<cs> not at the moment my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords over the past six months wholesale output prices have risen by per cent <e> <s> compared with a per cent <e> <s> increase for the previous six-monthly period <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with that but in looking at the retail price index though the fall in wholesale prices will of course be helpful there will be various other matters to take into account <e> <s> however the government estimate a per cent <e> <s> increase in rpi by the end of this year and a per cent <e> <s> increase during next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to indicate that it is not wholesale prices alone which affect the rpi <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an extremely interesting debate on this subject a very exciting project in which all noble lords are interested and nobody better to raise this matter than the noble lord lord beswick with his great experience in the industry and a person who has made such a distinguished contribution in the service of that industry <e> <s> the british government continue to give their support to airbus industrie within which british aerospace has a per cent <e> <s> partnership share <e> <s> we congratulate airbus industrie on the successes it has achieved <e> <s> it has shown that a european collaborative venture can rival the major united states manufacturers <e> <s> indeed airbus industrie is now second only to boeing as a producer of wide-bodied aircraft <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has explained this amendment is intended to fix a rigid time by which employers must pay statutory sick pay <e> <s> the intention is to require the employer to pay ssp on the same day that he would have paid the employee for that days work had he not been ill <e> <s> the amendment is rather inappropriately placed in clause since it is clause which deals with time limits for paying ssp <e> <s> it is also not too clear in its wording though the noble baroness has made the intention clear <e> <s> however even if these things were put right i am afraid we would not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> he is certainly entitled to supplementary benefit and of course when all these regulations are made out the position will be spelt out to all employers <e>", "<cs> one result of this bill is that there will be a great many regulations after it is passed <e> <s> may i give the noble lord an indication about the regulations in this particular matter <e> <s> one of them will be that statutory sick pay must be paid not later than the first normal pay day after the time for appeal has expired or if no further appeal is possible the first normal pay day after the decision reaches the employer and so on <e> <s> the first one is that regulations under clause will provide that where an insurance officer local tribunal or commissioner has issued a decision that an employee is entitled to statutory sick pay and no appeal has been made the time limits for payment will be as laid down <e> <s> there are four <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord would like me to read it all out <e> <s> i will willingly do so but there are a great many regulations coming along with this bill <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the employee could speak to the tribunal about it <e> <s> however i cannot quite see why the employer would wish to get rid of the employee when he is being entirely recompensed with all that he has to pay out in the statutory sick pay <e> <s> he gets the money back <e>", "<cs> i think the limit is days but i am not absolutely certain <e> <s> i shall let the noble lord know if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> i do not see why it should happen any more under the statutory sick pay arrangements than it does at present <e> <s> if an employer finds that one of his employees keeps on going sick and it is rather a nuisance he might under present circumstances before ssp have taken the same view as the noble lord suggests so i do not see that it is any worse with ssp and as i say he gets the money hack anyway <e>", "<cs> in the early part of her speech the noble baroness entertained the committee on the subject of pregnancy <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the noble baroness responds in that way <e> <s> she was suggesting that it was extremely difficult to know whether or not a woman was pregnant <e> <s> but the period which we are discussing when maternity allowance is payable is the weeks before the child is due and the seven weeks afterwards and i would say that in the former period there would be no difficulty in deciding whether or not a woman was pregnant <e> <s> i apologise to the noble baroness if she in any way thought that i was being facetious or rude i certainly was not <e> <s> i thought that she was actually entertaining the committee and i mean that quite sincerely <e>", "<cs> this is rather complicated and i may not have it right either <e> <s> but as i understand it the position of married women in this connection will be no different when we have ssp from what it is today when we have sickness benefit <e> <s> by introdu <e>", "<cs> the effect of these two amendments would be to raise the standard and intermediate rates of statutory sick pay by and respectively <e> <s> i should like to say a few words about how we arrived at the rates in question <e> <s> the main rate a week is roughly equivalent to the sickness benefit payable to a man with a dependent wife currently <e> <s> the intermediate rate of a week which was introduced as an amendment to the bill in another place is in our judgement the appropriate rate for those earning between and a week <e> <s> together with the lower rate a week to those earning between and a week we have a range of rates <e> <s> that range gives by way of statutory sick pay a reasonable but not excessive proportion of normal earnings at each level <e> <s> in particular it means that there is no disincentive to return to work at the end of an illness <e> <s> that is an important aspect <e>", "<cs> the is roughly equivalent to the sickness benefit <e> <s> if that were <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with two figures that are about the same and and as i was saying all parties have agreed over quite a long period that all income should be taxed including sickness benefits and sick pay <e> <s> therefore when we are comparing one with another it is not fair to say that one is comparing taxed with untaxed <e> <s> the intention was to tax the sickness benefit and it is that figure that one should compare with <e>", "<cs> i was not trying to suggest that <e> <s> it is true that national insurance will be payable on sick pay but let us not forget that the sick pay is limited to eight weeks and when one comes to look at what it would cost an employer it does not amount to a great deal of money in relation to sick pay <e> <s> the total employees contributions are million <e> <s> the contribution payable on would be <e>", "<cs> i regret that i cannot answer that but i will write to the noble lord <e> <s> we are in a quite complicated area here <e> <s> a number of points crop up and however hard one studies the bill one is not prepared with all the answers <e>", "<cs> i should like to say just one thing namely that there is available a financial paper with the notes on clauses <e> <s> it is an infernally difficult thing to understand but it contains a lot of information which perhaps we should study between now and the next stage <e> <s> there are many points which could probably be answered by a careful look at that paper but i should like to confer with my noble friend lord trefgarne on how we could best make the information available to your lordships <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lords suggestion is a very good one and if one of your lordships would put down a question we should be very pleased to answer it <e> <s> i have no doubt that there are people in the box who could answer it right now but i am afraid that i cannot <e>", "<cs> i think that we have now probably come to the end of this discussion <e> <s> i should like to suggest that perhaps the noble baroness will withdraw her amendment and that a question is put down for written answer <e> <s> we would reply to it as soon as we could and we would send a copy of the reply to any noble lord who wishes to receive it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i shall have to disappoint the noble lord lord banks by saying straight away that the government cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> as drafted the bill requires the secretary of state to look each year at the rates of statutory sick pay to see whether they have kept their value <e> <s> in practice this review will take place each autumn and the measure of inflation used will be the latest retail price index figures <e> <s> it is the intention to raise the rates of statutory sick pay broadly by the increase in the rate of inflation <e> <s> i say broadly in line with inflation since in order to keep employers administration of the scheme simple we shall have to consider rounding the rates and the earnings thresholds to a convenient figure <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained the effect of this amendment would be to allow an employer to deduct from his monthly payments of contributions not only the amount paid out by way of statutory sick pay but also an additional per cent <e> <s> this amendment as the noble lord made clear in his speech is aimed at helping employers with any additional costs arising from the scheme most notably the cost of administering it <e> <s> this would be achieved by giving employers an excess amount of money over and above the actual statutory sick pay disbursed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be helpful if i set out first the arrangements for the training of remedial gymnasts at the joint services school at the queen elizabeth military hospital woolich <e> <s> the school has established places for a two-year course commencing each september <e> <s> there are no formal arrangements for reserving places for civilians on the course <e> <s> indeed in servicemen began the

funds <e> <s> to deal with that issue i should like to describe the arrangements currently in force for the financial support of civilian students elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords this hospital will be surplus to nhs requirements following the opening of a new hospital in chester later this year <e> <s> the normal rules governing disposal of surplus nhs land would require that the property is disposed of on the open market for the highest possible price <e> <s> however we are conscious of the barrowmore village settlements historic interest in the hospital and my <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a surprising finish to the supplementary question <e> <s> i do not feel that i have a bad taste in the mouth nor i hope an ugly one <e> <s> it is true that this hospital was taken over without compensation by the nhs under the act but this government were not responsible for that act which applied to a very great many hospitals either taken from local authorities or from charities <e> <s> as i have said we are aware of the historic interest of the barrowmore settlement in this hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right <e> <s> if it is not possible for the government to sell surplus properties after more modern hospitals have been built that would very much inhibit the growth of the national health service which we support as well as does any party <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the background and the money spent by the settlement in repairing the hospital in <e> <s> we too are very much in favour of the development of this craft village <e> <s> my right honourable friend has a duty to try to get the full market value for any properties which become surplus <e> <s> the valuation placed on this property for use as a private hospital or an educational establishment is <e> <s> it may be that we will not succeed in getting that sum <e> <s> in that case we shall be pleased to have further discussions with the settlement with a view to making some concessionary arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord always has a persuasive way of making his point <e> <s> i am sure that he would be the first to agree that if this could be obtained it would be extremely valuable in enabling the local regional health authority to deal with many matters with which they should like to press forward for the benefit of nhs patients <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why the hospital is being closed there has been virtually no local opposition to its closure is because a larger more modern hospital is being built in chester at a cost of over million <e> <s> that is going to take over the job which is being done in this hospital and one or two other similar health activities in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is being rather difficult is he not <e> <s> first he says i have a rather nasty ugly taste in my mouth and then that i have no compassion in my voice <e> <s> i have no ugly taste in my mouth i do not think and i certainly feel thoroughly compassionate <e> <s> i also think that there are two difficult choices to make here one is the duty that the secretary of state has to get the best possible price for surplus property and secondly if he cannot get it and i have said quite clearly if he cannot get it he will certainly consider making concessionary arrangements with this hospital <e> <s> i cannot say more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my right honourable friend will read with great interest all that is being said today <e> <s> i cannot obviously go any further than i have on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the accounts for are currently being prepared but on british shipbuilders present estimates their trading loss for that year will be within their loss target of million which is well below their trading loss of million for <e>", "<cs> my lords british shipbuilders in order to get intervention fund assistance are required to give the department of industry an assurance in respect of each order that the order is being taken at break even <e> <s> financial assistance in respect of individual contracts is available to all shipbuilders in the united kingdom in both the private and the public sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a technical and i fear somewhat complex bill <e> <s> its principal function is to make certain changes to the law in order to allow the bank of england and the stock exchange to introduce a computerised system for the settlement of bargains in gilt-edged securities <e> <s> the bill is not in fact needed to set up such a system nor are the government themselves involved in the establishment of the computerised system which the bank and the stock exchange have in hand <e> <s> the bill is necessary because the law as it stands does not provide for computerised transfer <e> <s> in short it is an enabling bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who supported this bill both the noble lord lord terrington and the noble lord lord obrien <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord obrien that it is right that this house as a revising chamber should look carefully at bills of this kind <e> <s> i am very glad that my noble kinsman lord clitheroe is in his place today <e> <s> he was responsible for bringing forward the forerunner of this bill many years ago <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord terrington supported him on that occasion and i in turn supported lord terrington in the talisman bill so the team is at work a team which has been going for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords personally i am happy about the situation <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to pursue this matter at another stage in the bill of course he may do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for paying me such a compliment <e> <s> he must know that i am in no position to make any such statement either for this government or for any other <e> <s> i do not think that i have been asked any other questions <e> <s> i hope that i have dealt with those few that i have been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords the difference between weeks and three months is one week weeks as against weeks <e>", "<cs> that may be so but three months is a quarter of a year and is a quarter of so perhaps we can leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that very welcome answer and hoping that i am not showing unseemly haste in returning to this subject from my new point of vantage i should like to ask him whether the excellent example set by some opticians is likely to be followed by others in the future when the current negotiations on underpayments to opticians are concluded hopefully by the summer recess <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord mottistone in that i do not <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the press will go to all ccc meetings <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady fisher referred just now to the wessex water authority and to the fact that it is one of the smaller authorities and therefore might require different <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord rugby attempted in his private members bill to repeal section of the opticians act i was government spokesman at the department of health and social security and responsible for replying on behalf of the government <e> <s> although i no longer occupy this position i have by no means lost my interest in optics since i was recently appointed president of the federation of optical corporate bodies <e> <s> it is in this capacity that i want to make a few observations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a pity that the government have taken such an unconscionable time in getting started on the dhss review <e> <s> it transpires now that the process of selecting a chairman and members is under way and that the terms of reference are being revised <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is really talking about section <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would explain a little further i do not quite understand <e>", "<cs> well my lords the noble lord is obviously never satisfied <e> <s> i have told your lordships that we have had two lots of reductions at last after reasonable fees were paid of to per cent <e> <s> and then another to per cent <e> <s> this at least is something in the direction which no noble lord as far as i know has ever suggested in this house before <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just about to say that it might be of interest to the house to know that both hong kong and malaysia are at the moment considering legislation to go along the lines of our opticians act in the very reverse of what has been suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i will just carry on with my speech <e> <s> i enjoyed hearing the noble lord lord northfield who has been absolutely consistent on this over years <e> <s> he knows a great deal about the subject and i always used to feel slightly cagey about arguing with him in the days when i was on the front bench <e> <s> however i did enjoy his speech <e> <s> i cannot say that i enjoyed the speech of the noble lord lord rugby who i thought was quite unreasonably exaggerated in his remarks about the opticians <e> <s> i look forward very much to hearing what my noble friend lord trefgarne has to say in reply to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is no difficulty about that at the moment <e> <s> you can get your prescription and go to any optician you wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay the house by more than a minute <e> <s> i should just like to congratulate my noble friend lady faithfull on introducing the bill and on the way in which she did so <e> <s> i wish to support my noble friend lord mottistone in some of his rather forceful questions about the charity commissioners <e> <s> this has nothing to do with the parochial charity for the poor <e> <s> i had a difficult experience with the charity commissioners and i believe that as a result of the select committees activities the more we can hear about their work their method of operation their structure and accountability the better we shall all be pleased <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e> <s> this brief measure was introduced in another place by the honourable member for newbury <e> <s> it is i believe uncontroversial <e> <s> to explain what the bill would do i must give your lordships some background but unless asked to do so i do not propose to go through it clause by clause <e> <s> the community driving licence regulations which this house approved in october gave people who come to live in this country and hold other european community driving licences the right to exchange them for the equivalent british driving licences <e> <s> these arrangements came into force on st january <e> <s> these regulations were made under section of the european communities act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his welcome to the bill and even more so to my noble friend lord lucas who spoke for the government for his welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government abandoned their review of the nhs general optical service which was promised about months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would agree that the upstairs downstairs system on the buses has now been running for a very long time and has worked extremely well <e> <s> is it not really an excellent example of freedom of choice which i understand this government are very keen on <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords who have taken part in the debates on opticians for the last four or five years will i am sure share with me the feeling of relief that the end appears to be in sight <e> <s> it has gone on for a very long time and even though i do not agree with everything in this bill i am very glad that we have got to this point <e> <s> there is no doubt that there are parts of the bill about which opticians are not happy about which doctors are not happy and about which many members of another place were unhappy and about which from the debate this evening it appears that many of your lordships are unhappy <e> <s> my own views have not changed substantially since the period when i had the honour of being the spokesman in your lordships house for the dhss that is to say i fully support the government in opposing the rather extreme view propounded by my noble friend lord orr-ewing today and frequently propounded in the past by the noble lord lord rugby to legalise the sale of ready-made spectacles <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the situation varies from place to place and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear that the noble lord is satisfied with his glasses but i imagine that he is also concerned that others less educated than himself are not misled by people selling glasses who do not actually know what they are doing <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether after what he said about opticians he wants less well-trained opticians in the future <e>", "<cs> i just want to make one brief intervention and i promise i shall not give any views as to where i have just bought a pair of spectacles whether it was in wigmore street hong kong singapore or anywhere else <e> <s> i think that we have heard quite enough about individual pairs of spectacles when what we really want to be doing is taking a responsible view for people who are perhaps not so fortunate as other noble lords who travel all over the world and who need to get their spectacles on a reasonable basis which is what i hope they will be able to do in the future <e>", "<cs> with great respect that is a very interesting observation but it has absolutely nothing whatever to do with the amendment <e>", "<cs> in reply to my noble friend of course i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> i would say that the way in which these regulations are done is extremely important <e> <s> they will be very carefully examined <e> <s> many of us are highly doubtful as to how they will be enforced in so far as unqualified and unregistered opticians are concerned <e> <s> who will make sure that they are not selling spectacles to children not selling contact lenses or whatever when there is no way of actually knowing who they are what their address is or anything else <e> <s> however having said that i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i thank my noble friend for the very full reply that he has given to the amendment <e> <s> i should certainly like to study it <e> <s> i did not say so hut it was actually a probing amendment to find out what the government had in mind so far as monitoring the whole thing <e>", "<cs> i was saying that it was a probing amendment to see what the government had in mind <e> <s> when it comes to the regulations we shall see what in point of fact they do put down <e> <s> i am glad that we shall have proper consultation before those regulations are framed <e> <s> i should like to study very carefully what the noble lord has said and possibly come back at report stage if we are not entirely satisfied <e> <s> however at this moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend whether he is referring to what his right honourable friend mentioned about glasses on which there was a subsidy of or more <e> <s> is that the answer to the noble baronesss question just now as to what are and what are not expensive glasses <e> <s> this seems to be rather moving on to the amendment i was just going to move <e> <s> if we can get this cleared up now i shall not have to move it <e>", "<cs> i should very much appreciate it if i too could have a copy of that letter <e> <s> i have found myself in rather a muddle during the last two amendments <e> <s> i do not know whether my concentration wandered but on the previous amendment i understood my noble friend lord glenarthur to indicate that people with lenses with a subsidy or more could get the benefit of the general optical service <e> <s> i have always assumed that that meant that they would still receive the subsidy <e> <s> however as far as i can understand it under the bill those people will have the benefit of the general optical service but without the subsidy <e> <s> that will not be much use <e> <s> they might as well go into the private market <e> <s> therefore i find myself in rather of a muddle <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for making the governments views crystal clear <e> <s> it does not particularly surprise me but i am glad to haw it on the record <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend lord mottistone has put his finger on an extremely interesting point <e> <s> my noble friend lord glenarthur has given a long and full reply at which we shall all have to look very carefully <e> <s> i do not know how my noble friend will feel about this but i think it is something that we must look into extremely carefully <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment by the noble lord lord ennals and to add a little more detail so far as the opticians are concerned <e> <s> remuneration for opticians in the form of sight-testing and dispensing payments has always been negotiated through the optical whitley council machinery which has never been involved in the negotiation of reimbursement rates for nhs frames and lenses which have never been understood to form part of opticians remuneration <e> <s> the recoverable charges for the supply of optical appliances under the nhs have always been determined by the department in negotiation with the manufacturers and the ophthalmic prescription manufacturers association <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield and i do not agree on these matters as we well know <e> <s> this has been going on for quite a long time <e> <s> i would not have come back to this matter had it not been for the fact that this debate was not finished on the occasion when we had put down a whole lot of amendments <e> <s> this is one of a series that went together <e> <s> i was not going to withdraw it this evening because i still feel very strongly that it is not right that unqualified people should be given the same facilities as qualified people to deal with the public <e> <s> nothing will change my view although i know that the noble lord has held very different views over many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish only to speak briefly <e> <s> frankly we have heard these arguments not only in committee but over the last four or five years <e> <s> i await with what patience i can muster to hear whether my noble friend on the front bench agrees that there should be an inquiry into the health aspects and whether the medical and ophthalmological people agree that there is danger in what the amendment proposes <e> <s> i know that opticians would welcome it <e> <s> at least i think that they would <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will be prepared to agree to that <e> <s> the amendment with which i disagree entirely will i hope be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed that the noble lord lord northfield is not supporting this amendment <e> <s> i thought that he was <e> <s> several of us had that impression <e> <s> it would have been rather nice to have had one amendment on which we agreed <e> <s> there is something i should like to say and i have said it before but i never seem to be able to get the point across <e> <s> it is that reading glasses are not magnifiers <e> <s> there is a very minute magnification factor <e> <s> what the lenses do is to bend the light waves into the right position in the eyes so that you get a clear image <e> <s> it confuses the issue when people say that if you can buy an ordinary magnifying glass in a shop why can you not buy magnifiers in spectacles <e> <s> they are not the same thing <e> <s> if you have the right spectacles for your eyes and you then want to read something which is very small you will need a magnifying glass in order to read <e> <s> i say that once again in the hope that people will take it on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to support what the noble lord lord kilmarnock has said <e> <s> it seems extremely unfair that people who need very complex glasses should not be given some reasonable consideration <e> <s> i rather missed out at the committee stage <e> <s> i thought that the subsidy would continue for those people <e> <s> i was corrected on that the has disappeared <e> <s> there is no doubt about it that the cost of spectacles for people who have really bad sight will be considerably higher once the bill is passed <e> <s> so i should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it would be very nice if my noble friend could say that he will look at this again and come back on third reading <e> <s> i must say that nothing that he or his noble friend lord caithness have said during the passage of this bill through the house gives me the slightest hope that he is going to do anything of the kind <e> <s> it would be rather nice to have something different from what we have had all along <e>", "<cs> my lords in the briefest possible way i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> he has made his arguments extremely clearly and rather better than i did in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords that speech really leaves me with very little to say <e> <s> i think at last we seem to have some unity in the optical profession and i can only think that the noble lord lord ennals has had very similar briefs to the one i had <e> <s> he practically made my speech <e> <s> i have just one or two things to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord terrington both on his initiative in asking this question today and also on the strength and the clarity of the case that he has put to your lordships for the encouragement of wider share ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord and i shall certainly make it my business to read the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard for initiating this debate and for giving me the opportunity to make a very short contribution <e> <s> perhaps i should begin by declaring my interest in this subject <e> <s> for many years i have been chairman of the osteopathic educational foundation and as a result have been in close contact with the general council for the register of osteopaths or the gcro <e>", "<cs> i am grateful my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord mottistone on introducing this bill particularly at a time just after the transport committee on road safety has reported to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the voucher scheme will be introduced as planned on st july <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful both to the noble lord lord ennals and to my noble friend lady trumpington for their strong support for the bill <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for a lot of additional information that my noble friend gave us about the subject on which i am by no means an expert <e> <s> what i hope also is that the noble lord lord rugby will have been pleased to hear about the various safeguards that my noble friend mentioned and that as a result of that the bill may perhaps not be committed and will have a smooth passage through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> unless therefore any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is recognised throughout europe that tax should not be paid on the provision of medical or paramedical services and that the levying of such a tax is contrary to article al <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in the past declared an interest in optical matters as president of the federation of optical corporate bodies <e> <s> today i declare the same interest except that following organisational changes within optics the focb has now become known as the federation of ophthalmic and dispensing opticians <e> <s> altogether the members of the federation are responsible for almost half the optician activity in this country and do therefore make a very significant contribution to our optical services <e> <s> i will confine myself to clause of the bill although of course it concerns not only opticians but also other health service professions as well including doctors dentists and pharmacists <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to support my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i think that he has put the case extremely well <e> <s> i am not sure whether the period of two years is the right one but i certainly think that there should be some limitation on the amount of time in which the government can go back and alter previous determinations <e> <s> as it stands at the moment under the provisions of clause there will never be any such thing as a final determination and any negotiated settlement which becomes the subject of a determination by the secretary of state will be nothing more than a provisional decision <e> <s> that is extremely unsatisfactory for the practitioners and i look forward to hearing what my noble friend the minister has to say <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws his amendment if the noble baroness does not come back on report with something on the lines of the amendment of my noble friend it would be worth considering a different period <e> <s> when in support of my noble friend i said that i did not know whether two years was the right period my noble friend baroness trumpington said that that was too short a period <e> <s> i think it is worth considering three years <e> <s> at least that would give some limitation and would not make it possible for the department to go on year after year altering past determinations <e>", "<cs> that is a decisive reply from my noble friend <e> <s> i do not quite understand why the government have not themselves given a proper definition of what different information means <e> <s> other definitions appear in the bill and i think it is surprising that such a wide and vague expression as different information is not in any way defined <e> <s> of course i am not going to divide the committee at this time of night but i shall reserve my fire for report stage when i may well come back to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what she has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the government for the way that they responded to arguments on clause put forward by my noble friend lord mottistone and myself and supported by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> the compromise that was reached is i know considered fair by many opticians to whom i have spoken <e> <s> i should like particularly to thank my noble friend lady trumpington for the part i suspect the large part that she played in achieving the compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> it had been my intention to make two points only <e> <s> fortunately one of these has become unnecessary owing to the speeches of the noble lords lord ennals and lord winstanley <e> <s> i had intended to endeavour to bring to an end the endless accusations of opposition speakers and the media about cuts in the national health service but both noble lords were refreshingly realistic on this score <e> <s> they appreciate that national health service spending rises annually in real terms <e> <s> in fact i understand that since it has risen by per cent <e> <s> in real terms which is a very large increase <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships know of my interest in osteopathy as i have been chairman of the osteopathic educational foundation for many years <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord kindersley for setting the scene and thus providing me with an opportunity to give an account of recent developments in the osteopathic profession since our last debate on this subject in <e>", "<cs> i willingly withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i am just recovering from a sense of shock <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning for his support <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage and i shall possibly come back to it later <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i feel that my noble friend should look again at this matter because it seems to me perfectly clear that it would be good to have this amendment in the bill <e>", "<cs> no i was not <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure that i have taken on board exactly what the noble lord said but i shall read it in <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend and i willingly withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall study the reply of my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the reply from the minister needs much further thought on my part <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the

in favour of ready-mades <e> <s> the noble lord lord rugby and i have been on opposite sides of the house on this matter for about eight years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord ennals said about the government not reversing the decisions taken in this house on dental and eye examination charges <e> <s> i hope that we do not get the bill back again with just a few cosmetic changes <e> <s> that is not good enough <e> <s> the house made its view perfectly clear and that should stand <e> <s> i hope too that when the bill goes to another place honourable members there will remember that the bma has made it perfectly clear that it does not like the suggestion of charges for dental and eye examinations <e> <s> it is well aware that doctors are neither trained nor equipped to carry out the screening activities which up to now have been so well done by opticians <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do insist on their amendment numbered

times <e> <s> she had operations on both eyes <e> <s> i shall therefore be eligible for free sight tests as a result of this bill as the son of somebody who has had glaucoma <e> <s> therefore that is another interest to declare <e>", "<cs> following on what my noble friend lord nugent has said i have a feeling <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is better to compare like with like

up until now i have never taken an interest in the subject and am doing so this evening only because i received from the royal borough of kensington and chelsea the brochure to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> i suppose the reason that i received it is that i live in that borough <e> <s> most of the very few words that i was going to say have already been said by the noble lord <e> <s>
