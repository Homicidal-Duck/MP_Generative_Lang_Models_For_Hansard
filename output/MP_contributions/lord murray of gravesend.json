["<cs> my lords it always sounds very reactionary if you say that the time is not right to do something because throughout the ages politicians have been saying we should like to do it but this is not the time <e> <s> however i believe that this is not the time for what the motion of the noble lord lord banks is asking <e> <s> to talk of an extension of powers in the <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord seen the report in this mornings <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this the opportunity for the government to assist british rail in every way they can to bring people back to the railways and to take some of the traffic off the roads <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the point that the noble earl has made is the fact that the morgan crucible company were allowed to break the law quite flagrantly and other people were arrested <e> <s> is this not a case of one law for the rich and another for the poor <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope not to strike too discordant a note in this debate but there are one or two things i should like to say about this subject of defence <e> <s> it strikes me that once again in the matter of defence the tory party has played on peoples fears and emotions in the same way as it does with law and order <e> <s> i feel that the tory front bench both in this house and in the other place are eventually going to he hoist with their own petard not by the labour opposition but by their own supporters today we have heard from members of this place and there are also members in the other place who feel the same who want to spend more and more on defence and the noble lord the minister and his colleagues know that a limit has to be set somewhere <e> <s> notwithstanding what they were saying about defence before the general election <e> <s> they have ended up by adding just million to the costs set out in the defence white paper <e> <s> of course one of the things is that this debate is being held too early after the succession of the new government <e> <s> they ought to have been given a bit more time to say exactly what arc their proposals for the defence of our nation and our society <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that <e> <s> i am not ignoring those things <e> <s> what the noble lord must do is to justify his absolute <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord mean in the league of our payments towards nato <e> <s> the gross national product proportion that we pay is per cent <e> <s> that is only exceeded by the united states at something like per cent <e> <s> it does not matter whether we are the first second third or fourth <e> <s> we are one of the poor nations in europe anyway <e> <s> obviously if we increased our gross national product then it might well be a different story <e> <s> nevertheless it is per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords not on the last figures <e> <s> the last figures for the past two years have not been available in those terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not disagreeing with me he is disagreeing with <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are now facing the fact if we are to believe the experts that there will be an almost total dry-up of oil by the year is there not a case for greater state rather than private enterprise intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the minister agree that if a charitable organisation or indeed a political organisation holds such a fete it is rather unfortunate that someone can telephone the police on the day telling them that such a raffle or tombola stall is likely to be there and that then the police can immediately move in to stop it <e> <s> it seems unfortunate that people are not forewarned on these occasions about breaking the law <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord wedderburn in his very well put amendment <e> <s> i should like to declare my interest as a political levy paying member of natsopa <e> <s> i unlike the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith have not been present at any shareholders meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the introduction of legislation will mean the bringing about of more quangos <e>", "<cs> my lords was it not intended that on the setting up of independent local stations <e>", "<cs> my lords two former conservative prime ministers have used the theme of one nation <e> <s> i take the view that this bill is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness cannot get away with this <e> <s> she made a statement about a bad comprehensive system being forced on to people and then when she is challenged by my noble friend she does not answer the question <e> <s> it really is unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the question which my noble friend lord hatch of lusby asked will the noble lord not agree that the figure of compared with which the minister mentioned is just a blatant lie by the conservative political central office <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that it would be helpful if he accepted my noble friends suggestion because we are going to undergo a number of u-turns within the next few months and it would be helpful if the government could explain them to journalists <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that this is the second case within recent weeks which has been raised in this house of money intended to relieve refugee problems in various parts of the world perhaps not having been used for the purpose for which it was intended <e> <s> would it not be possible for the noble earl the minister to suggest to his right honourable friend the prime minister that they appoint a minister with sole responsibility for refugee problems and for ensuring that any monies are spent for the purpose for which they are being sent <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware of the fact that obviously the building of runways at airports is a very explosive matter for a lot of people living in the area <e> <s> will the minister make sure that the west sussex county council and the british airports authority are informed that the government are not bound by their decision <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the government are thinking of any methods to ensure wider ownership in the sense that the conservative party thinks of wider ownership rather than the present limited method <e>", "<cs> my lords ordinary people do not really deal in the stock exchange <e> <s> that is really the point <e> <s> i am wondering whether the government ought to think about wider terms of doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government give an undertaking that they will not attempt to reverse a decision taken last week in the house of commons regarding the maximum price of paraffin <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl give way at that point <e> <s> is it not the case that in st january falls on a thursday and that nd january is a bank holiday in scotland so it could be that he would be languishing in jail for four days <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first opportunity i have had in your lordships house to congratulate a maiden speaker and i should like to do so most sincerely for a very lucid articulate and concise speech <e> <s> the only thing i found missing was the controversy <e> <s> however i thought that in his opening the noble lord lord fairfax of cameron also felt that controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to add my congratulations to the four maiden speakers the noble lord lord harris of high cross and three of my former colleagues in the house of commons the noble lord lord stewart of fulham with whom i served in the european parliament the noble lord lord irving who is a neighbour of mine in north kent and the noble lord lord lever <e> <s> lord lever and i have something still in common after all this time out of the house of commons <e> <s> it is that he still makes erudite speeches on finance and i still cannot understand them <e>", "<cs> there are not so many noble lords over there either <e>", "<cs> but my lords why did not the government say this during the election campaign <e> <s> there was an absolute denial by mrs thatcher that she would increase prescription charges <e> <s> now we find they <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government received any representations from any other governments saying that they may well refuse the rights of british men who marry their female citizens <e> <s> also have any other countries applied or are they expected to apply reciprocal treatment to our citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords one point which the minister - <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord lord winstanley for having initiated the debate but having said that i always feel that there is an air of sadness about these debates <e> <s> one air of sadness is to hear the noble baroness who has just spoken of the individual problems that spending cuts raise and the fact that i genuinely feel sure that nothing is going to be done as a result of this debate <e> <s> i think that the conservative government are on a course of spending cuts and whatever we say here or whatever they say in that house across the way nothing will be changed <e> <s> we have to start and have a look at some of the things which my noble friend lord wells-pestell said about their election manifesto <e> <s> in the election campaign the labour party said that there would be cuts in the spending on health and the tories denied this but in fact we have been proved right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the noble baroness is wrong because at least per cent <e> <s> is needed to take up the demographic question of people living longer <e> <s> that has immediately overtaken your half per cent <e> <s> growth <e> <s> we ought to be looking to maintaining and improving the service <e> <s> the cuts also do not take into account the question of wage increases <e> <s> they do not take into consideration that the health service will be paying million a year in increased vat <e> <s> so i think that myth has to be dealt with <e> <s> again the cuts always affect the least well-off in our society whether they are the people receiving treatment or needing treatment or whether they are the people working in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at the reticence of the government on this in view of their shortsighted policies <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been mainly an economic debate <e> <s> i am not an economist and in view of the trail of false assumptions from here to the treasury and back again i am rather glad that i am not <e> <s> in fact i think that they all ought to shoot themselves <e> <s> but if their aim is as accurate as <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know who the noble viscount knows who is doing that <e> <s> there may well be peers in this house who are moonlighting i do not know <e> <s> this is one of the difficulties of assessing the whole matter <e> <s> we know that there are moonlighters but i reckon you would find it difficult to assess their earnings on the basis of their cheating the exchequer at something like billion a year <e> <s> there are not many moonlighters who have tax havens in the bermudas at least not in gravesend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very real pleasure to follow the right reverend prelate who made a magnificent and i believe non-controversial maiden speech <e> <s> it was non-controversial because virtually everything that the right reverend prelate said was right <e> <s> i hope that we shall not have to wait another four years before we hear him speak and certainly not another four years on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we shall be most helpful in getting legislation through particularly if we drop something like the useless trades union legislation in order to make it easier <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not say how many immigrants were involved in so-called exploitation of this act <e> <s> will he give us the numbers of local authorities who are complaining about the act and the weaknesses of the act and will he say whether the government will do anything about the act because more and more local authorities are now using the proviso about intentionally homeless to avoid housing people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that recognition by the united kingdom of another country is of great advantage to that country in the eyes of the world <e> <s> will he not in those circumstances ask her majestys government to consider getting certain guarantees from the pinochet regime on the question of dealing with dissidents and political prisoners and specifically that political prisoners should be dealt with democratically and in an entirely different way from people who commit what they consider to be criminal offences <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the governments exhortations that the cuts should be fairly spread would the noble baroness agree that it is now about time that the government abandoned their ludicrous scheme to subsidise independent schools under the guise of buying places <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister honestly say whether he understood his own answer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to be helpful to the house by burying this old blue herring of a chestnut by publishing in the <e>"]
