["<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the noble minister for the kind words that he uttered about myself a few minutes ago and i am also grateful to the house <e> <s> i am delighted to be able to respond by congratulating the noble earl upon his maiden speech from the government front bench <e> <s> of course my congratulations relate not to the content of his speech but to the form <e> <s> i look forward to many further encounters with him in his present office and to his speedy return to the place which i now occupy <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves the matter of the discussions may i ask whether he recalls that in relation to the third option an inquisitorial assembly for scotland his right honourable friend said in another place that proposals of that kind had been publicly current for some time but that in the governments observation they had signally failed to attract much support from any quarter and that the government did not wish to press such proposals in the all-party talks <e> <s> that is three of the four items dismissed is it not <e>", "<cs> this clause to which i extend a welcome enables a senator of the college of justice to be appointed as an arbiter and that is a wholly welcome development we have extremely good judges in scotland who are able thus to accept appointment as an arbiter <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister of state could briefly outline the kind of thinking that instructed this clause and whether or not he is led by that same thinking to the conclusion that we might well be advised to use our same senators of the college of justice to deal with some planning inquiries particularly planning inquiries of great national importance in scotland <e>", "<cs> i should like the noble earl to understand that i have great admiration for the judicial qualities of the senators of the college of justice and i feel it is rather unfortunate that they who spend much of their professional careers at the bar acquiring expertise in planning matters find themselves on the court of session bench dealing with matters of lesser importance <e> <s> it may be that we should somehow encourage these same judges to be involved as has happened once or twice in england in some of the more important planning inquiries <e> <s> i add that in order to make it clear to the noble earl that i make no criticism of the bill but merely wish to make the point that i think we are not using our judicial talent in scotland as well as we might <e>", "<cs> my lords since time immemorial noble ministers of state at the scottish office have risen to their feet at the government dispatch box here to move the second reading of a scottish bill only to be dismayed and disheartened to see noble lords rise in their hundreds from all parts of the house and pour out of the chamber as if they had suddenly remembered that they had some pressing engagement elsewhere and i fear something similar happened today <e> <s> this phenomenon is not produced by any lack of eloquence or lucidity in the ministers concerned <e> <s> they have all been lucid and eloquent none more so than the noble earl <e> <s> it derives rather from the comparative lack of interest here in domestic scottish legal matters <e>", "<cs> there must be more than one reason for everything my lords <e> <s> i believe the irony of the whole situation is that the apathy of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will allow me to say that i do not mistrust either the judges in scotland or the prosecuting authorities in scotland but i am human enough to know that people make mistakes <e> <s> it is possible and there have been examples of it in the past that a sheriff might get out of bed on the wrong side one morning and do something quite extraordinary <e> <s> this kind of thing happens from time to time <e> <s> the second point is that the judges in construing the subsection to which i made reference cannot look at <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl is constantly to refer to the terms of the bill which was introduced by the government of which i was a member i shall have a difficult afternoon <e> <s> but i am taking an independent line in the sense that if i think that words are unnecessary or that a provision is wrong i shall endeavour to persuade the committee of that <e> <s> the noble earl conceded that the phrase was unnecessary and thought that perhaps it was useful to make plain that we were moving over to a new system <e> <s> i should have thought that it was perfectly plain from clause <e> <s> however i have made my point <e> <s> i have not succeeded in winning the hearts and minds of those on the government front bench <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly intend with leave to withdraw this amendment but i do not think that the noble earl has answered my point <e> <s> there is something of a contradiction between these words and the provision of paragraph <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly intimate my content with that and will hope that when we come to matters of substance which we shall shortly do the noble earl the minister will be equally forthcoming <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is sufficient for me just to acknowledge the accuracy of what the noble earl the minister has said <e> <s> i agree that this is an improvement <e> <s> it does the kind of thing which i was trying to do in the earlier amendments but which the minister has rejected <e> <s> it makes the bill simpler <e> <s> it improves it and makes it more intelligible <e> <s> if the noble earl the minister were as consistent as i then he would have accepted my earlier amendments <e>", "<cs> by thinking that i was going to take amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> the noble earl reveals that he did not understand what amendment no <e> <s> was about <e> <s> the amendments are quite unconnected <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is concerned with the conditions which the court or the lord advocate is to impose <e> <s> there is no choice they have to impose conditions <e>", "<cs> i should like to get on to the next amendment <e> <s> i do not think that i am making heavy weather of it and i think if the minister will look at what i have said he will see that there is some substance in what i have suggested but in the meantime i will not press it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> let us take the instance where the accused is told that he must find a sum of money as one of the conditions say <e> <s> if the option were open to him and he refused if one takes the bill as it stands what he would do is that he would not find the and therefore the money will not be lodged as bail money <e> <s> what will they do with him then <e> <s> he will not have <e>", "<cs> surely that does not apply to tax frauds and company frauds and foreign fishing vessels <e>", "<cs> i shall not press this amendment at this stage but the noble lord is quite wrong to cite to me the average amount of bail which has nothing to do <e>", "<cs> but we are not talking about crime in general we are talking about tax frauds illegal fishing by foreign vessels and company frauds <e> <s> i would invite the minister to look again at what has been said today and consider whether he should give better guidance to the courts <e> <s> it is necessary to ensure that the court is not given a loophole to enable it to continue the system of money bail to which it has become accustomed over a long period of years <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before i turn to the substance of the amendment i am delighted to welcome the maiden speech by the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern the lord advocate <e> <s> when i drew attention on second reading to the fact that he had not yet addressed the house i did not believe that we would flush him out quite so soon <e> <s> but i believe that i have helped to do your lordships a service <e> <s> the noble and learned lord despite his apparent youth is in fact my near contemporary and is held in the highest regard in the legal profession in scotland <e> <s> if he feels that the committee stage of this modest bill is perhaps not the centre stage on which to make his debut i none the less offer him the comfort that i made my own maiden speech at dead of night at the second reading of the electricity financial provisions scotland bill before a <e>", "<cs> i am not in the least surprised that the governments proposal in this connection has provoked a reaction from the liberal benches <e> <s> indeed i am not surprised that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie was moved to intervene at the astonishing argument put forward by the noble earl <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie grasped that argument in its substance absolutely <e> <s> what the noble earl was saying was we might not he able to convict the accused of the crime with which he was originally charged and therefore this may be the only penalty available <e> <s> so we had better make it a nice substantial penalty so that we can punish him for being acquitted on the other charge <e> <s> that is the essence of what the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to press the amendment today because i feel that members of the committee <e>", "<cs> it certainly does not because what the noble earl is proposing is to double the sentence <e> <s> it makes it two plus two and there is no logic in the two years there is no authority for it or precedent for it in my submission <e> <s> i ask the government to think seriously about this again <e> <s> if they do not do so this may be a matter on which we shall have to divide <e> <s> the noble earl must take advice about what appears to me to be a confusion in his mind between contempt of court and the crime of attempting to defeat the ends of justice <e> <s> i think that if he takes advice on that he will see that the offence of attempting to defeat the ends of justice is a perfectly proper one in the law of scotland and one which would be appropriate in the kind of circumstances he has in mind <e> <s> subject to returning to the matter on a future occasion i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the lord advocate would look at subsection to which i directed attention because in that situation i think that we are dealing with a different point in time <e> <s> the subsection states <e>", "<cs> i think that i follow that but i shall read it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as to the first part of my amendment i am happy to accept the affirmation by the lord advocate that the burden does in fact rest upon the accused and it is unnecessary therefore to proceed with that part of the amendment <e> <s> so far as the other part is concerned i am also happy to hear him say that it would be perfectly proper for a person accused of this offence to make an approach through his lawyer no doubt to the procurator fiscal and that the procurator fiscal if shown a medical certificate or other evidence of that kind would be unlikely to proceed <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we leave clause may i simply direct attention to the opening words of the clause <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> if one looks at clause and one should look at clauses and what one sees is that these clauses seek to enlarge the powers of the police to grant bail <e> <s> i do not take <e>", "<cs> i do not doubt that the amendment could be better worded <e> <s> i wrote it on the shuttle between london and edinburgh <e> <s> i do not regard it as being the function of members of <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to receive that assurance <e> <s> i can contain myself and i shall endeavour to do so <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to acknowledge that the government have moved in the right direction here and improved the bill <e> <s> i need not rehearse what was said at the committee stage <e> <s> i acknowledge what they have done and i acknowledge therefore that my amendment no <e> <s> becomes unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is to be congratulated <e> <s> his explanation this time was considerably more convincing than it was the last time <e> <s> it would be even more convincing if the clause were now to read <e>", "<cs> my lords may i simply acknowledge that the government have in fact closed what might have been a loophole <e> <s> i also congratulate the noble and learned lord on the spirit in which he has done this <e> <s> as i understand it the purpose is to make it easier for the court to grant bail because it removes doubts about whether or not the person will be liable to the penalty if he answers to his bail on the first occasion but not on a subsequent occasion <e> <s> for both these reasons i commend this amendment to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly going to withdraw my amendment but i will not accept that i am such a bad draftsman that attempt after attempt of mine must produce all the dire consequences that have been predicted both at committee stage and now <e> <s> however i do hope that somehow the courts when they come to consider their proper duty in relation to the application of subsection of this clause will restrict themselves to the types of cases that have been mentioned in these proceedings and in another place <e> <s> in that hope i will with your lordships leave withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might deal with that last point the only point in the case is whether or not the man had a reasonable excuse <e> <s> it would be plain beyond peradventure that he had not turned up on the first occasion <e> <s> the only point at issue is did he have a reasonable excuse <e> <s> therefore the onus in the only matter at issue rests upon the accused <e> <s> that takes me back to the argument that the noble earl lord mansfield advanced at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to press this amendment to a division <e> <s> i regret that something has not been done in the bill but i hope and trust that the sheriff principals in scotland will read what the noble and learned lord has said here and what was said in committee and that when they find this situation arising as it may rarely do but it will arise from time to time they will make special emergency arrangements under their general power in order to prevent the detention in custody for unduly long periods of people who have not yet faced any charge <e> <s> with your lordships leave i beg to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the last time that i shall be on my feet <e> <s> i should like to acknowledge that the government have met the criticism that i made and i respectfully say so in the most sensible way <e> <s> with your lordships leave because i shall probably not be available when this bill comes up for its third reading may i take advantage of this last occasion when i am speaking on report to thank the ministers for their courtesy and help and for meeting some at least of my points <e> <s> i regret that they did not meet the main point but i trust that the new system will work as well as we all hope it will and i trust that in due course the house will give the bill a third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for his careful exposition of a long and complex bill <e> <s> it is not my intention to follow him through each and every clause <e> <s> at this stage the house should be considering the principle of the bill and this bill rests upon several disparate and unconnected principles <e> <s> may i summarise them in order to introduce the points i seek to make <e> <s> the principles as i see them are first of all that the police require new powers of detention and search <e> <s> secondly that an accused persons right to silence in court ought to be restricted <e> <s> thirdly that a number of largely unconnected changes should be made in relation to evidence procedure and sentencing in scotland <e> <s> fourthly that the appeal system should be improved and in some respects dramatically changed <e> <s> fifthly that the court should be given power in scotland to make compensation orders and sixthly that drunkenness and the throwing of bottles at and associated with sporting events not just football events but sporting events generally should be legislated against <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important matter and if the lord advocate will forgive me for intervening i should like to ask him to address himself to the question i asked <e> <s> in particular are we to be allowed to see the act of adjournal <e> <s> as he knows under the act the act of adjournal to be prescribed to deal with this matter is to be prepared by the judges <e> <s> it does not require the consent of the secretary of state it does not require to be seen by either house of parliament <e> <s> but will the house in fact see the act of adjournal <e> <s> before we conclude our deliberations on this part of the bill shall we be allowed to see the act of adjournal in draft <e> <s> in other words before we pass this measure shall we know what questions are to be allowed to be asked <e>", "<cs> my lords if the lord advocate would again forgive me for intervening he will recall that in one or two cases in scotland in the last few years there has been a contempt of court by a newspaper or a television broadcasting station which has said something about a trial before it has taken place <e> <s> in at least one of these cases the high court in considering the contempt proceedings has given an indication to the lord advocate of the day that he might not proceed with the trial simply because of the risk of prejudice <e> <s> given that the risk of prejudice might prevent a trial from ever taking place in these circumstances does the lord advocate not accept that there is such a risk a similar risk in the kind of situation envisaged by the bill <e>", "<cs> if i may respond from this bench to what my noble friend has just been saying and deal with matters generally <e> <s> i think we are in some difficulty as a result of being asked to take nine amendments together when the merits of the amendments are simply not the same <e> <s> first owing no doubt to difficulties in obtaining copies of the report referred to the matter is perhaps not yet as clear as it might be and i hope by quotation from the second thomson report to make the matter clear <e> <s> the thomson committee was set up in and deliberated for a total of some seven years but after nearly six years it produced the second thomson report which is the one giving rise to this part of the bill <e> <s> it dealt with the detention of suspects and that is largely covered by clause <e> <s> it dealt separately in chapter with the detention of witnesses and i should just like to quote from chapter in the absence of copies of the report <e> <s> it stated <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene to say why i had to support this proposal <e> <s> i argued within government in favour of putting these provisions into our bill <e> <s> that is the reason i support them from conviction and not because i happen to be trapped as it were on the front bench with a published bill <e> <s> the reason that i decided at that stage to support their inclusion in the bill was that i am humble enough to recognise that when a distinguished committee like the thomson committee makes these recommendations unanimously then it is something that the government ought to support <e> <s> that is the reason i gave and i also support the reason which the noble and learned lord lord wheatley gave <e> <s> however it is not <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl concludes on these matters may i ask him what his provisional view is on the question of the time of the offence <e> <s> as the bill is drafted and i direct attention to the opening words <e>", "<cs> so far as the half hour period is concerned it is a somewhat arbitary period and it may be rather difficult to deal with the matter in that way <e> <s> but i follow the noble lord lord foot in his drawing attention to the standard which was put forward by the thomson committee though in a slightly different context <e> <s> the context of paragraph on page of the report really relates to the detention of a suspect rather than to the detention of a witness but <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to intervene <e> <s> the noble lord said that he would think while he was talking and perhaps my intervention will allow him to think about what he will do in relation to this amendment <e> <s> i would ask him whether he can indicate whether he thinks it is the drafting that is at fault <e> <s> the noble earl has reminded us of the text on page of the report which contains the standard of necessity and the provision that the verification is to be done where it can be done rapidly <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord foot asked for my support <e> <s> the paragraph in the thomson committees report paragraph has my support but i would not have thought it was necessary to put into the bill a provision such as the noble lord proposes <e> <s> i simply think that it does not need legislation <e> <s> once a constable brings a detained suspect to the police station the normal police procedure would be that the officer in charge of the station or the officer in charge of the desk or if it is a case which is already being investigated the officer in charge of the case in effect would take over <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the construction of clause he will find that there is a careful distinction between the use of the definite article in relation to the constable in certain places and the indefinite article in other places in order to draw the distinction between the constable who has reasonable grounds and requires the detainee to go with him in the first place and the other constables who might search or do other things as set forth in the subsequent clauses <e>", "<cs> may i offer my answer <e> <s> i hope that i shall not have to come in on this matter again <e> <s> if an officer of the ordinary rank of constable brings to the police station a person under clause as a detainee and the sergeant on the desk the officer in charge of the station or the chief inspector in charge of the case says there is no need to keep him i cannot imagine the constable insisting on keeping the detainee there <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to trust ordinary police practice which i have seen at work at least at secondhand in many cases <e> <s> i am sure it is not necessary to go to the lengths of putting this ill the legislation <e>", "<cs> i am certainly not persuaded by that argument <e> <s> think that the noble earl is right in saying that these figures are arbitrary <e> <s> whether it is four or six they are in a sense plucked out of the air <e> <s> for example i notice that in england the police in evidence to the royal commission wanted a -hour period <e> <s> in some countries it is days <e> <s> thank god it is only six hours in the bill because if the noble earl wants to keep it at six hours that is how it will end up <e> <s> perhaps i should simply maintain my protest <e> <s> i shall not divide the committee on this matter because i do not propose to divide it on a matter of this kind where thomson recommends one thing and my view is different <e> <s> i must be consistent if i cannot persuade the noble earl and say that we must accept the judgment of thomson <e> <s> however i do not propose to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i have made my position clear <e> <s> i am not going to press this one simply because if the government will not accept it i am not going to try to move against the thomson report <e> <s> when it comes to the next amendment the government will find themselves in a different position because i have thomson with me and the government do not <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord replies may i say that it is a most astonishing speech to which we have just listened <e> <s> the noble earl is absolutely right to do what he proposes to do but i am astonished that we should have to wait until this stage to find out that he intends to do it <e> <s> the need for what he now proposes to do is plain and many of the amendments have made that plain <e> <s> it was also made plain at second reading <e> <s> indeed as the noble earl will recall i drew attention to the fact that his friend in another place now one of the ministers responsible for this bill mr rifkind denounced the earlier bill because he thought that it contained a provision which allowed re-detention <e> <s> i am surprised that the matter should have gone so far <e>", "<cs> may i remind the noble earl of what mr rifkind said in another place a year ago <e> <s> he said that he hesitated to make comparison with other countries but for example the notorious -day detention law in south africa worked in this fashion <e> <s> that was said by the minister who is responsible for this bill and that is why i accuse the government of tardiness in putting the matter right <e>", "<cs> certainly it would be better to substitute a sheriff but we do not have to substitute anybody if the noble earl proposes to prevent this happening at all <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly to say that i would support the noble and learned lord in this amendment <e> <s> i can do so quite shortly because i need add nothing to the reasoning he has put forward <e> <s> perhaps i may add just this that when this same matter was covered in the bill to which i have referred which was introduced under the last government this provision was not contained in anything like this form <e> <s> i think the effect of the drafting of the previous bill was not to touch the common law <e> <s> what the bill said was that a constable might take a person to a police station for certain purposes and one of the purposes was to enable the police to put questions to that person in relation to the offence <e> <s> i think that way of drafting it left the police subject to the ordinary common law and there could be no suggestion that they had been given some additional power under the statute <e> <s> i would invite the government when considering the noble and learned lords reasons also to consider whether or not they might go back to the kind of drafting in the previous bill which i think dealt with the point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson mentioned the possible desirability of putting prints on file but that is not what this clause seeks to achieve <e> <s> in fact it is the very reverse if the person is not charged the prints are supposed to be destroyed so it is not a question of compiling a file of fingerprints which might be of use to the police <e> <s> that is not the intention of the clause though the clause might result in that in some cases <e>", "<cs> we have been referred to paragraph of the thomson report and this is what was said in that report on this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the lord advocate for what he has said <e> <s> i do not think it goes quite far enough <e> <s> may i invite him to consider this if a record is made of the matters he has mentioned and the suspect is invited to sign that record will that not be of advantage to all parties because it cannot then be argued at the mans trial that he was not given the warning <e> <s> if he has signed the record it is evidence against him <e> <s> also it ensures that the warning is given at the time recorded at the time and signed at the time <e> <s> i should have thought that that would remove the possibility of unnecessary disputes about whether or not the warning was given <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord would undertake to give that further thought i should be quite happy to leave it like that <e>", "<cs> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few comments about this matter <e> <s> i accept of course that in the vast majority of cases that have come to my attention allegations made against the police are without any reasonable foundation at the very least they tend to be wildly exaggerated <e> <s> i am sorry that my remark should fall into that same category in the eyes of the noble earl <e> <s> but i believe that his amendment does have the following value it does protect the police against this kind of allegation <e> <s> it too often happens that a person after leaving the police station whether he has gone there apparently voluntarily or has been arrested but subsequently released turns up a day or two later before his own doctor or some other doctor exhibits the odd bruise or whatever and alleges that it was done by the police <e> <s> i believe that the government might be sympathetic towards the notion that the person should be medically examined if he requests it at the time <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate might have added that there is a good precedent for this provision <e> <s> i cannot recall the precise section but there is a section of one of the english criminal justice acts which uses these words <e> <s> it would be interesting to know if i am right about that whether their use of the word reasonably has given rise to any problems in the english context <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the lord advocate said but there is one point where he left the matter rather grey <e> <s> does what he said about the possibility of a tip-off apply to the right of a person in detention to have his solicitor informed <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said when he came to that part that some person named by the accused might be informed in this way and that would result in a tip-off <e> <s> does that apply to the solicitor as well <e> <s> is that what the lord advocate is saying <e>", "<cs> while we are on this point perhaps i could take it a little further <e> <s> the lord advocate says there are solicitors and solicitors which is a truism and i suppose we are to take some inference from that <e> <s> but there are policemen and policemen and some policemen simply do not trust solicitors who are accustomed to appearing in criminal causes and they may build up over the years a good deal of resentment against solicitors more particularly against those solicitors who tend to be reasonably successful <e>", "<cs> perhaps the lord advocate would allow me a few words before he replies <e> <s> first i would certainly support the noble and learned lord in this amendment and indeed apologise for not having had time to join my name to it <e> <s> i can add nothing to that particular argument but there is another point and that i believe is this <e> <s> the noble and learned lord referred to his view that if the accused person had very recently committed an offence under the prevention of crime act then he could understand the provision <e> <s> but the way this is worded has committed or is committing indicates i suspect that when one is talking about a person who has committed a crime one is talking about a person who is no longer committing it because if he is still committing it then he is caught by the words or is committing an offence under <e>", "<cs> clause is a clause which the government have put into this bill but which was not in the bill as introduced by the previous government and i want to advance the reasons why this power of search for offensive weapons in these terms was not included in our bill and why in my submission it should not be included in this bill <e> <s> the first arguments i was going to present are arguments which have already been dealt with in the discussion on the amendment which the noble and learned lord lord wheatley put forward and to which the lord advocate has just responded <e> <s> i pass over them because if the bill contains this clause on the next occasion on which we see the bill then we must consider the wording at that time <e> <s> but there are some quite general points <e>", "<cs> this matter must be brought to a conclusion and i only rise to remind your lordships that the vital difference between the power conferred by clause and the power conferred by clause is that the search under clause may take place in effect on the street or anywhere other than a police station <e> <s> it is really that point of difference which is of great importance here <e> <s> i would accept of course that there are arguments in favour of this power but one must balance those against the arguments against it <e> <s> no one dismisses the arguments put forward in favour of this particular power <e> <s> it is just that in our view they are outweighed by the arguments against it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might briefly respond to that question <e> <s> subject to hearing what the minister has to say in reply to what i have said it would be our intention on report to put down an amendment on these lines extending the period however to five years <e> <s> we do not think on reconsideration that three years is long enough to test the matter i suppose one would need to have the measure in force for some time and have a number of cases come before the courts and then it might be possible to make a better judgment <e> <s> however we undertake to return to this matter on report <e>", "<cs> the answer to the question is yes and i should have thought that the noble earl might have been able to give it <e> <s> of course there are other precedents as well for this kind of provision <e> <s> i do not want to take this matter at great length tonight but the noble earl says that the government do not regard these powers as dramatic innovations <e> <s> the point is that other people do <e> <s> the government ought to take account as they professed they would of other peoples views on this matter and this is one way of doing so <e>", "<cs> if i may address myself to this amendment it is as the noble and learned lord has indicated a probing amendment and a good many of the other amendments have that same character <e> <s> if this amendment were allowed that would cut out the amendments standing in the name of my noble friend lord ross of marnock and myself amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> therfore i ought to address myself to the broad question as to what kind of questioning is allowed here <e> <s> i am not sure that i agree with the noble and learned lord about whether or not a solicitor has a <e>", "<cs> for my part i am content with that and will not move any of the amendments standing in my name to clause nor will i oppose clause standing part of the bill <e>", "<cs> the amendments standing in my name and in the name of my noble friend lord ross of marnock will not be moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be fair to say that one cannot look at amendments nos <e> <s> and without looking at the associated government amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think that amendments nos <e> <s> and pave the way for the others <e> <s> the principal amendment is no <e> <s> and it certainly goes some way to meeting a number of the points made at the committee stage <e> <s> however i ask the house to accept that it does not really go far enough <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have the supplementary marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is concerned about the words all he reasonably could <e> <s> so am i if i may give a further example once every two years about welshmen come to watch their team play rugby at murray-field <e> <s> they will be coming not to attend a designated sporting event as i understand it <e> <s> close by is tynecastle where the heart of midlothian club play football or in the view of some attempt to play football <e> <s> large crowds of people go towards both grounds from time to time on the same day <e> <s> it commonly happens that many thousands of welshmen who cannot get in at murrayfield instruct their drivers to take them to tynecastle <e> <s> if tynecastle is host to a designated sporting event it means that the driver is engaged on a journey the principal purpose of which is to convey welshmen to and subsequently from a designated sporting event <e> <s> in these circumstances what is his duty <e> <s> what can he reasonably do to these welshmen most of whom have been in edinburgh for four or five days enjoying the local wine <e> <s> they could be a difficult crew to handle <e> <s> is he reasonably required to say i will not take you to tynecastle <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i agree with the lord advocate as to the effect of the amendments proposed to the amendment by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> i do not think they change the position very much <e> <s> secondly i <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not wat to repeat any stale jokes but this definition still in my judgment embraces the open container <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much that the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside said but i shall have some observations to make on the clause itself when we come to amendment no <e> <s> and will therefore confine my remarks at this stage to the limited amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> we are all against vandalism and no doubt the courts could play a part if they thought it proper by increasing the penalties under the law as it now stands but i am not in favour of giving the summary criminal courts the increased sentencing powers which amendments nos <e> <s> and envisage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i say that he used the expression the offences replaced by the statutory offence of vandalism <e> <s> i wonder whether he would care either now or in the course of dealing with the next clause to explain to the house whether he means replaced because this is a matter of some concern to me <e> <s> i understood that the ordinary common law offence of malicious mischief is not affected by clause and that this statutory crime of vandalism is an additional crime <e> <s> if that be wrong i should need to think very carefully about the matter and must at the next stage draw the attention of the house to the views of the faculty of advocates on thisbut perhaps the noble earl can give me an answer to the point either now or in the course of the debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to add very much to what my noble friend lord ross has said but there are one or two points i ought to bring to your lordships attention <e> <s> first of all at the committee stage prompted by a letter i had written to him my noble friend lord mishcon said at column on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may address the house the answer is that i do not know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords just a brief word to say that the government are to be congratulated on their flexibility here <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate was slightly more rigid when the matter was raised at a previous <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that my argument has been satisfactorily answered by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> what he said first of all was that this kind of prejudice or possible prejudice to a trial can happen at the present time <e> <s> well it can and it happens extremely rarely <e> <s> it may be that if it is bad enough one cannot proceed with the trial <e> <s> that has happened at least once fairly recently <e> <s> but under the bill it is almost built into this type of case because all these cases will or may have attracted a good deal of publicity <e> <s> so one is going to have it happening not rarely but very frequently in this type of case <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene to support what the noble lord lord renton has said <e> <s> the difficulty here is not simply one of following through the provisionsthere is the difficulty of having time even to attempt the task <e> <s> of course the government have notes on clauses for the benefit of ministers and those notes on clauses will undoubtedly contain at least the signposts as to what each provision will contain <e> <s> i should have thought that perhaps the proper thing for the government to think of doing at once is to put into the library the notes on clauses either on the whole bill or certainly on the so-called minor and consequential amendments so that those who are interested do not have to undertake the task for which perhaps the noble lord <e> <s> lord renton is uniquely fitted but the rest of us simply do not have either the qualifications or the time to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this change the government are <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house i would merely ask in relation to paragraph which proposes the addition of the following subsection which renders incompetent the procedure of certification what that was consequential to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i simply acknowledge with gratitude what the government are doing here <e>", "<cs> my lords this is perhaps not a very good example but the government have certainly in moving a number of their amendments and in accepting amendments proceeding from other parts of the house moved some way towards meeting the criticisms that were voiced on second reading and in committee <e> <s> i should like to acknowledge the help that was given to me by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate when he supplied me in good time with advance notice of a number of the government amendments particularly on important matters <e> <s> the government have yet the difficult task ahead of them of persuading us that the bill is entirely right and they will have an even greater task no doubt when the bill reaches another place <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make two points as regards that matter <e> <s> first the notes on clauses exist and there is no extra work of course for the draftsman <e> <s> i often felt when in government that they were born to blush unseen as it were and it was rather a pity because a good deal of work had gone into them and it would certainly help those who want to study the bill closely to see them <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating the noble and learned lord on his unaccustomed modesty may i ask him whether he accepts that while the scottish practice of concluding binding contracts by an exchange of missives has the great advantage of eliminatinggazumpingand uncertainty it involves one serious disadvantage namely that each prospective purchaser has before putting in his offer to commission and pay for a building survey by a professional surveyor acceptable to the prospective purchasers building society with the result that those whose offers are not accepted find themselves heavily out of pocket <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord invite his right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland to approach the law society of scotland the royal institution of chartered surveyors and the building societies to discuss this problem with a view to encouraging the seller before advertising his house to commission one such survey by a surveyor acceptable to all the building societies his fee to be paid by the successful purchaser only thus eliminating wasteful expensive and unnecessary duplication <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to mention just one little word and that is of which appears in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords may i respond to what the noble earl lord mansfield has just said by acknowledging the courtesy at all times and the occasional flexibility of the ministers who supported this bill in this house <e> <s> in particular may i single out the noble lord lord lyell who is not i am afraid in his place today but who was thrown at least on one occasion and perhaps on two into the frontline on a difficult issue and defended the indefensible with his customary good humour tenacity and charm <e> <s> if i seemed rather harsh at the time i hope that he will accept my apology <e> <s> i was incensed at the governments obduracy not at his presentation of the indefensible case <e>", "<cs> my lords as some noble lords may remember i am a devolutionist <e> <s> had the scotland bill been put into effect this bill would never have reached this house indeed it would never have reached westminster <e> <s> under the scotland bill housing was a devolved matter but i am quite certain that no scottish legislature would have <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the position is that once he has been in occupation for three years he can buy it at a per cent <e> <s> discount and then he adds per cent <e> <s> a year for the next years <e> <s> so it is years occupation i think <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think it is including three <e> <s> none the less there are a great many houses <e> <s> the point that my noble friend lord ross of marnock made is relevant here <e> <s> many of the most attractive houses those that were called in the other place cottage houses with a front door a back door and a garden were built a long long time ago and have been under the same occupation for a very long period <e> <s> many of those houses are the same houses which have required and in some cases have received improvement <e> <s> what encouragement is there to a local authority to improve such houses now when it knows that all it will do is encourage the tenants to buy them <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble earl the two situations are not quite comparable <e> <s> in a bill of this kind it is extremely difficult for either a person like my noble friend lord ross who has a great deal of experience in housing to understand the technicalities or a technical man like myself to understand the housing background <e> <s> therefore there is nobody who can come to it with any very clear understanding of what the provisions mean and what their effects are likely to be <e> <s> the notes on clauses do that and from my experience they do it in an impartial way <e> <s> i would hope that the government would find it possible to do for this house what has been done in respect of some of the clauses in the other house and make the notes on clauses available <e> <s> then the house itself will get a better service from those of us who see our main function as being to advise the house as to what its attitude may be <e> <s> the same applies of course to the housing bill in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i would ask the noble earl to withdraw the word threat <e> <s> i do not threaten anything <e> <s> i deplore any breach of the law and i deplore the intention of those already expressed that they will not implement this measure <e> <s> i believe it is the responsibility of elected members to implement the law whether they like it or not <e> <s> so i am making no threat at all and i deplore it and i am certainly offering no encouragement to it <e> <s> however i am prophesying that it is going to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble and learned lord for that reply which i fully accept may i ask him to deal with three points which arise out of the circumstances <e> <s> first is he aware that the issuing of this statement gave rise to some disquiet in scotland because in the statement the lord advocate appeared to be saying that he had received allegations and evidence of the commission by a distinguished public servant of criminal offences involving several women and that although mr skeen strongly denied the allegations the lord advocate was not going to put those allegations to the test principally because the women complainers did not want publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords on that last point if i may ask one final question the situation in which the noble and learned lord the lord advocate found himself was created by the publication in the press of information which the press should not have had <e> <s> in my estimation the circumstances point absolutely plainly to a deliberate leak by police officers in glasgow <e> <s> is the chief constable of strathclyde investigating that matter and if not why not <e> <s> because it appears to me to be a plain breach of duty by the police a violation of duty under the section of the act to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only right that i should acknowledge that these amendments do in fact improve the bill and certainly improve the rights of persons detained under clause <e> <s> i hope that the house will accept the commons amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl spoke to amendment no <e> <s> at the same time and that is the only one on which i have a point <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> i welcome amendment no <e> <s> as being an improvement to the bill <e> <s> it is the amendment giving the childs parent or the apparent childs parent the right of access <e> <s> but what is not clear from the bill as i read it is who it is who exercises the discretion and makes the judgment which requires to be made in the case where there is reasonable cause to suspect that the parent has been or may have been involved in the alleged offence <e> <s> is that judgment one which falls to be made by the constable who arrests or detains or is it a judgment that falls to be made by the officer in charge of the police station <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has spoken to eight amendments at the same time and certainly i would acknowledge that they improve the situation which is covered by clause <e> <s> but as your lordships will see this document before us contains no fewer than amendments to clause and there were amendments made to that clause before it left this house <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave the clause i say one word in reply to the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> acknowledge that i have never disputed <e>", "<cs> my lords as early as january i suggested that this provision in the bill was wrong <e> <s> in my absence my noble friend lord mishcon moved an amendment to the effect of the present amendment and the noble earl persuaded those behind him to troop through the lobby in substantial numbers to defeat the proposal which is now recommended by him to the house <e> <s> i am glad that he belatedly acknowledges the reasonableness of what we then proposed and i hope that the house will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords without asking the noble and learned lord to go into all the details i wonder whether he can assist me to understand one part of it <e> <s> i refer in particular to the use of the word or in the th line of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have noticed that this swingeing cut in public expenditure is directed exclusively at scots <e> <s> the noble earl may take some comfort in the fact that there is no member of the scottish national party in this house to criticise him for it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from this bench endorse what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> we are dealing with a very limited amendment at the moment <e> <s> i want to make certain remarks on the main argument and i was hoping to do that on amendment no <e> <s> c on the question of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will look at the marshalled list he will see that the next amendment to be taken is amendment no <e> <s> b standing in the name of the noble lord lord fraser of tullybelton <e> <s> thereafter the house can consider amendment no <e> <s> ba standing in the name of the earl of perth <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl is considering his position will he bear in mind that the right honourable secretary of state for scotland in col informed the house i quote what he said of this particular clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking from this position i speak simply for myself and not on behalf of the official opposition <e> <s> i want to make one or two points that i do not think have been properly made in the discussion which your lordships have heard this afternoon <e> <s> first of all there has been a considerable amount of criticism some of it happily withdrawn of the sponsors of this clause in another place and in particular of the decision to introduce the new clause at the report stage of the bill in another place <e> <s> it was not the fault of mr cook that this criminal justice bill was introduced into this house first rather than into the other place <e> <s> he told the house at column and those who have read the commons proceedings must be aware of this that when the bill came to the commons he had had discussions with many honourable members about whether it would be more appropriate to raise this matter on committee or at report <e> <s> he also informed the house that he had consulted one of the ministers on the team handling the bill and it was the unanimous view of those whom he consulted including the minister that it would be more appropriate to raise the issue on the floor of the house <e> <s> so i utterly reject the criticism of mr robin cook and the sponsors which has been put forward this afternoon by several of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords we prosecute many rape crimes in scotland without the evidence of more than one person who was present <e> <s> there are many other signs and circumstantial pieces of evidence which could prove the crime it is perfectly easy <e> <s> in scotland we do prosecute sodomy between a male adult and a male who is not adult <e> <s> so where the evidence is there we can and do prosecute but the lord advocate does not prosecute in the case of consenting male adults that is to say those over the age of committing the activities in private <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord i think that that is so <e> <s> i am more concerned with the fact that adults who choose to engage in homosexual activities in private in scotland know that they will not be prosecuted <e> <s> it is constitutionally absurd that they should be committing a crime and that the public prosecutor who prosecutes alone in the public interest should say i will ignore the commission of this crime <e> <s> that is what happens and logic demands that the law ought to be brought in line <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but we were assured by the noble lord lord campbell of croy that this house was able to treat that bill as an occasion for a gentlemanly discussion because everybody knew that it had not the slightest prospect of passing through another place <e> <s> that is exactly the point that i am making <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i bow to my noble friends knowledge of the procedure of the other place although mutterings close to me from other former members suggest to me that a bill of this kind has very little chance of seeing the light of day and passing through another place under the procedures to which my noble friend has just referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only refer to what was said by mr cook who made a very careful speech <e> <s> i am not a member of the church of scotland and i am not very familiar with its proceedings <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house the noble lord said that there is no evidence that this reform has the support of the scottish people <e> <s> does he say that there is no evidence that the practice of successive lords advocate in not prosecuting this crime has had the support of the scottish people <e> <s> if there is no such evidence does he suggest that the lord advocate or the next lord advocate should start prosecuting the crime that is covered by this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say just one word about this amendment <e> <s> i understand the reasons why this amendment has been brought forward <e> <s> until now it has been compe <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this house will not support the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton <e> <s> as he himself has made clear the new section a which is to go into the act in effect is intended to bring the law of scotland into line with the law obtaining in england since <e> <s> nobody suggests that there is any sound reason why in this matter the right to sue for damages for personal injuries the law should be substantially different in the two jurisdictions <e> <s> the new clause is rather simpler than the equivalent english section section d of the limitation act introduced into that act by the act <e> <s> in one respect the scottish draftsman has followed the traditional scottish practice of not writing unnecessary guidelines for judges and i hope that that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one point on which i would welcome the assistance of the noble earl <e> <s> i see from the solicitors scotland act that it received the royal assent on st august and this amendment is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do agree if it is consolidation it does make perfect sense <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the law is not confined to criminal law and that it is possible to provide by civil means a remedy for those who might feel aggrieved by the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us about the position in scotland <e> <s> if the justification for this division of responsibility is one of principle as he seems to suggest is it not the position that there is no such division in scotland and that the matters which are said to be separate and properly separable are in fact handled by one minister in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will forgive me if i raise a point which is not exactly central to this bill <e> <s> this bill is concerned with criminal <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord not considered more carefully that answer <e> <s> should he not do so <e> <s> if he looks at what has happened in scotland since the relaxation of the liquor licensing laws some five or six years ago i think he will find that neither the police nor the trade nor the opponents of liberalisation would say that matters had got worse they in fact substantially improved <e> <s> is not that a matter to be taken into account in considering the matter in the light of the erroll recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that his reply will cause surprise among practitioners in scotland albeit practitioners in scotland are conscious of the fact that the introduction of such a practice could give rise to minor problems <e> <s> does he not accept that they strongly believe that it would enable defence lawyers both to avoid unnecessary and expensive preparatory work and also to enter into agreements with the crown so as to reduce the areas of dispute at the trial thus achieving real and substantial savings in costs particularly to the legal aid fund <e> <s> does he agree that such savings could be achieved <e> <s> does he not think that it is time then to introduce an experiment by the crown and take a fresh initiative by introducing this practice experimentally in the high court <e>", "<cs> my lords first i congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord advocate on getting through his -minute speech in a mere minutes <e> <s> secondly i thank him for his rapid exposition of this small bill <e> <s> i realise however that it would be proper for me to declare an interest <e> <s> it is slightly difficult for me to define precisely what that interest is but a bill which has the practical consequence of diminishing the jurisdiction of the court of session and putting counsels fees including my fees firmly under the control of civil servants in st andrews house must have some effect and probably a fearful one upon all practising advocates <e> <s> so ones instinct is to dislike the bill <e> <s> however i put my instincts aside and look at the bill upon its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i just ask him whether he could comment on one matter <e> <s> he reminded us that the argument which he and his colleagues on the royal commission regarded as the most convincing was the better service argument <e> <s> you would get better service by taking divorces to the sheriff court <e> <s> but of course in those days he will recall the pursuer and his witnesses had to attend the court of session and give their evidence in court <e> <s> now that that system has been replaced with a system whereby the affidavits of the evidence are simply posted into the court of session does he think that the better service argument has not perhaps lost some of its force <e>", "<cs> my lords i had in mind when i made my observations on the subject the debate which took place on st december in the first scottish standing committee where the subject was dealt with at columns and <e> <s> it is extremely difficult for me and others i have consulted to work the proposal out <e> <s> it was suggested there that the ultimate policy was to recover the full cost of civil court services excluding certain expenditure on judicial salaries and the like <e> <s> i am not asking the lord advocate to deal in detail with that now but i hope that in committee we shall find some way perhaps on the question whether the clause shall stand part <e> <s> to clarify the intention of the government in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees with me that the clear and unambiguous line which he has taken on this matter not only today but especially in his written answer to my question of th march is likely to give satisfaction <e> <s> this is not only to those who fear that the law in scotland is in some danger of becoming obscure and uncertain in its application but also to those of us who were afraid that by stages we might approach a situation which is perhaps threatened in england in which pre-trial publicity might prejudice the outcome of important criminal trials in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble and learned lord nothing to say to the house about the situation in england given that recently well before any criminal trial there have been published in national newspapers circulating in england photographs of an accused person fully identifiable and handcuffed to two detectives <e> <s> is that a matter which he can view from the front bench with satisfaction <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may address myself to the amendment as worded <e> <s> at the moment i shall not take up your lordships time on the question of the concurrent jurisdiction of the court of session and the sheriff court which is a point which i think we can discuss in relation to later amendments <e> <s> i hope that the government will not accept this particular amendment as put forward by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside <e> <s> it enshrines a somewhat difficult proposition and one which i would find unacceptable namely that no action of divorce however complicated the issues it raises whatever the sums of money involved whatever the wishes of the parties should be allowed to proceed in the court of session <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is that if in fact you have a defended action which raises very difficult questions then you will find that many solicitors will in fact want to instruct counsel even in the sheriff court to deal with those cases and the fees chargeable by counsel for appearing in the sheriff court would be the same as or similar to those that they would charge in the court of session <e> <s> therefore if you have difficult questions which warrant the employment of counsel it seems to me that that employment has to be paid for whether the action is conducted in the sheriff court or in the court of session <e>", "<cs> everyone recognises that the effect of clause in giving jurisdiction to the sheriff court is to transfer much of the work from the court of session to the sheriff court <e> <s> there are to divorces a year in the court of session and everyone envisages that the bulk of those cases will in future be entertained in the sheriff court and it may be that the legal aid regulations will be of such a character that it will be difficult for people to go to the court of session with legal aid <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may just come back to say that no doubt it is my fault for not making the matter plainer but i was trying to be brief <e> <s> i agree with everything that my noble friend lord hughes has said in substance <e> <s> i am not suggesting that a list should be drawn up and only those on the list should be appointed <e> <s> i am not suggesting that and in fact even at the present time in the court of session where the judges may appoint any member of the bar or anybody else the majority of those who are appointed are not members of the bar <e> <s> i envisage a special kind of case where one is not simply looking at what one might call the facts because the facts are sometimes rather complicated and difficult but at questions of judgment where the parties may be in conflict about why the marriage broke up how the children of the marriage were treated and so on <e> <s> that is the kind of case which someone of a more judicial temperament is better able to resolve possibly than a social worker who has other skills and other experience <e> <s> i only wanted to make it possible for the courts to appoint people when in effect they want that kind of judgment upon disputed questions of fact <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the noble lord lord ross is puzzled by what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has mentioned <e> <s> all that i was after and i understand that the lord advocate is offering no more is that in cases where a judge whether he be a judge of the court of session or of the sheriff court feels that questions of custody access and so on cannot properly be investigated by a social worker or someone else that he knows and he wants to go to an independent person to get a judgment which will assist him in making up his own mind there will be available to him a list of persons <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what i am saying <e> <s> i am saying no more than that <e> <s> it is simply that when a judge wants to know who can i get to do this <e> <s> and he is looking for a lawyer he goes to a list of names and says i can appoint that person <e> <s> but if a sheriff and i suppose that this will be true in five cases out of six wants a local solicitor or more likely the social work department to look into the circumstances he will do what the court of session judges now do in the majority of cases and appoint someone from the social <e>", "<cs> i am indebted to the noble and learned lord lord fraser and i make my third and i hope my final attempt to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not want to press the amendment <e> <s> i am happy to accept what the lord advocate has said that he will take the matter of appeal a little further <e> <s> so far as the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside is concerned if he looks at the amendment contained in the act he will find that the great substance of my amendment is covered by it <e> <s> it has not been very much used but in cases of the kind to which i refer in subsection of the proposed new clause for example cases where there have been different decisions on similar questions by different sheriffs it is desirable to have any particular case referred to the court of session for a more authoritative decision otherwise in the same type of case there will be one result in kilmarnock and a different result in airdrie <e> <s> it is for these reasons that i wanted to draw attention to the existing provision and to the more summary procedure which might be introduced <e> <s> i am happy that the latter part will be dealt with <e> <s> i hope that by moving the amendment i shall have drawn the attention of sheriffs and practitioners to the existence of an amendment which went through in but which as i say has been much under-used <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg your lordships leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certainly not very happy with that answer <e> <s> the judges have disagreed about the effect of the section <e> <s> the lord advocate believes that the disagreements have been resolved <e> <s> that is not my reading of the judgments on the meaning of the section <e> <s> the other point is that section of the act was designed to allow a pursuer who was claiming damages in a personal injury case to be entitled to succeed even though he could not find a corroborating witness <e> <s> i had the case of a man who was injured while working inside a long metal tube <e> <s> there could be no possibility of corroboration as to the circumstances in which he came to be injured <e> <s> it was that kind of case which the legislature had in mind <e> <s> those were defended cases <e> <s> here we are talking about a class of undefended case <e> <s> it does not seem to me that one is talking about repeating the section provision one is just entitling the court to proceed upon uncorroborated evidence <e> <s> i see no particular <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble earl lord selkirk in this matter and i do so for one particular reason <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> yes i do feel able to withdraw it and with your lordships leave will do so <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that by referring to matters rather wider than the question that clause <e>", "<cs> for the reasons that the lord advocate has given and because he has undertaken to draw the attention of the other bodies to the idea behind this as well as because it is irrelevant to the bill as presently drafted i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> what the noble and learned lord advocate is saying to us is that it is up to the faculty of advocates to fix a price for their wares so to speak that will enable them to go to the supreme court committee and say you can properly having a proper regard for the need to protect public funds allow people to come to the court of session <e> <s> i entirely support that and i hope that the faculty of advocates will pay particular attention to what the lord advocate has said <e> <s> the lord advocate said that they may even be able to agree upon the same scale of fees <e> <s> i should hope that at a minimum they would be able to agree upon the same scale <e> <s> it may even be oddly enough that counsel will be able to charge less than solicitors would charge for doing certain work because counsel unlike solicitors do not have staff to hire and fire or premises to warm and insure and accordingly they really ought to be able to compete <e> <s> i believe and i am glad to hear that the lord advocate is really on the same side as i am on this point that it is up to the faculty of advocates to look closely at what they can do and compete for the business <e> <s> if the beneficiary of that is public funds so much the better <e> <s> however with those observations i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> so far as the first paragraph is concerned i have nothing to add that i have not already said in relation to my own amendment <e> <s> so far as the second part is concerned may i respectfully say that i agree entirely with this idea <e> <s> at present your lordships should know that a solicitor who obtains the benefit of legal aid for his client is entitled to claim a fee from the legal aid fund for spending the day in court on behalf of his client but he is not allowed to claim that fee or any part of it if instead of going himself he chooses to instruct counsel <e> <s> in other words counsels fees in the sheriff court in legal aid cases are payable if and only if the appropriate legal aid committee has expressly sanctioned the employment of counsel <e>", "<cs> briefly i should like to say a few words about this clause <e> <s> in my view the purpose of clause must be to enable the secretary of state to reduce the fees payable in legal aid cases <e> <s> i do not necessarily mean that he will take the present rates and cut them by half by a third or by whatever but i think that he will certainly use his new power to make the fees in legal aid cases less by comparison with fees in private cases <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate specifically dealt with <e>", "<cs> i constantly seem to be annoying people sitting behind me or beside me which is unfortunate <e> <s> it is my misfortune to have to come here and tell your lordships the truth <e> <s> we did have an excellent tradition in scotland which was referred to no doubt in appropriate terms way back in in the legal aid debates when i was not interested in these matters <e> <s> that was a tradition that nobody appeared in the high court without the representation of counsel but in those days before legal aid which counsel went <e>", "<cs> i am sure the lord advocate is doing what can be done here and i hope his efforts will be crowned with success <e> <s> i appreciate the point that the prosecutor should not be involved with legal aid but i am anxious to ensure that the lord advocate and his prosecutors do what they can to render it unnecessary for the defence to burden legal aid with the expense of precognoscing witnesses whose evidence is entirely formal <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the new clause was to encourage parties to use this type of procedure <e> <s> the lord advocate tells me that i can now agree to put in written submissions in place of oral <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate says that he does not see how this particular amendment could assist <e> <s> but of course i do not believe that the amendment of the bill would assist him to get matters right <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that because there are real grounds for concern that the sheriff courts will not be able to handle this business from the day to be appointed and because there may be serious interference with the rest of their business then it appears to me that it would be sensible for an amendment of this kind to be made so that the government can explain to your lordships that all these difficulties have been overcome <e> <s> however i do not propose to press the matter at this time of night <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before your lordships agree to that motion may i say one further word about the bill <e> <s> it is a bill which is modest in appearance but undoubtedly will effect substantial changes in the day-to-day practice of the courts in scotland <e> <s> its effects have been discussed in a somewhat anecdotal and speculative way <e> <s> i would repeat something i said earlier but i should like the government to take it on board and that is that many of us in scotland feel that the methods whereby the effects of such changes can be studied are inadequate <e> <s> in other words it is impossible to say with any confidence and accuracy precisely what the financial effects of such a bill will be <e> <s> it is impossible to predict with any accuracy what the effect will be upon the incidental business and the general business both of the court of session and of the sheriff courts in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the order itself the house will be grateful to the noble lord for explaining it <e> <s> with regard to the last sentence of what he had just said the house will see that the noble lord took the opportunity to congratulate the government because he gets such few opportunities to display compassion <e> <s> this extremely modest example of the governments compassion is welcome like a good deed in a naughty world <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord lyell sits down i entirely accept what he said about there being no definition of dwellinghouse because the act does not use the phrase dwellinghouse but occupied as a dwellinghouse <e> <s> therefore attention is directed at the character of the relationship between the premises on the one hand and the persons who use them on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords again the house will thank the noble lord for describing what these regulations do <e> <s> i think the house will appreciate that they do for scotland what the other regulations do for <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred to advice received that putting clamps on the cars of diplomats contravenes the vienna convention <e> <s> is he prepared first to tell the house from what source the advice was obtained and secondly to put a copy of it in the library so that lawyers in the house among others may study it to decide whether or not it is good advice <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are good legal advisers and bad legal advisers <e> <s> will he face the point that some of us bad and good would like to look at the advice to see whether or not it is misconceived <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister cannot answer my questions today would he kindly write to me and give me the answers <e>", "<cs> may i with all the impartiality of a scots lawyer suggest to the committee that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is absolutely right about the placing of the matter <e> <s> the answer i am sure he would give is that in the first subsection one is simply concerned to say that the rules enacted by this section take the place of other rules and the proper place to put the content as it were and the ambit of the duty is where the lord chancellor chooses to put it <e>", "<cs> i am not in the least surprised that the noble lord lord renton made that point <e> <s> i foreshadowed that he would <e> <s> i support him on it <e> <s> surely the position is that instead of going off to the strange phrases of reasonable grounds and believe and the philosophical and metaphysical complications that arise from the use of them we should simply go back to the words that generations of english and scots lawyers have become familiar with <e> <s> it is the judges who will have to apply these words and they know what they mean <e> <s> it took many decades before the english realised the terrible mess they had got their law of occupiers liability into and in the statute of they went back towards the old scottish rules which prevailed before the house of lords imposed english law upon scotland for some decades <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has misunderstood me <e> <s> the scots law was perfectly all right until the english house of lords imposed an english structure upon it <e> <s> the result was that we had to legislate to change it and parliament in got it wrong <e> <s> that is why the statute is so difficult for the noble and learned lord to understand when he hears the scottish appeal <e> <s> we ought to go back to the simplicity of th century scotland by using words we ought to know <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor about this amendment <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that if this amendment were allowed it would be a substantial retrograde step <e> <s> historically in england some duty was always owed to whoever came on the premises however malevolent his intention or however criminal the means by which he got there <e> <s> one could not set a mantrap for him <e> <s> if i am reading this correctly and i may not be the effect would be that one could set traps for people who criminally entered upon premises <e> <s> that surely would be a retrograde step <e> <s> am i wrong about that <e>", "<cs> i was intending to use the word trap in the sense in which judges have used it in the past any kind of a trap at all and not a man trap necessarily for the trespasser upon the premises <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might rise to support this amendment principally in order to ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether he could make clearer to me the meaning of this particular clause <e> <s> what the road authorities are required to do is to take such steps as they consider reasonable <e> <s> that on one reading imposes a duty to take steps and the discretion that is given to them is to determine what steps are reasonable <e> <s> so on one view it is a duty to take steps and then they have a discretion to determine what steps are reasonable and what might be unreasonable <e> <s> therefore if as the noble lord lord ross of marnock suggested no steps were taken at all would that automatically be deemed to be a failure in a duty to take such steps as are considered reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord replies may i say that i support this amendment for slightly different reasons from the reason given by my noble friend lord ross of marnock and a similar reason to that given by my noble friend lord hughes <e> <s> the point i am making is this <e> <s> i do not believe that an interpretation section is designed to be helpful <e> <s> it is designed to give precision to words used in the statute <e> <s> but there is no point in defining the words snow gate in the interpretation clause if they are not used anywhere else in the bill except in clause <e> <s> if they are used but once as i think they are in clause and are defined in that clause there is no need to put them in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in making those remarks has failed to appreciate the innerness of the contributions made by my noble friend lord ross of marnock <e> <s> he gave a clue to what that meaning was when he referred to noble lords in other parts of britain <e> <s> i think what the noble lord lord ross of marnock was pointing out essentially is that had we had devolution in scotland the bill would never have reached this house and your lordships would not have had to listen to this kind of debate on matters that we have had today <e> <s> i did not think of putting that forward as an argument for devolution at the time but now i wish i had done <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> i found the ministers reply to the debate surprising disappointing and entirely irrelevant to the debate and certainly to the amendment <e> <s> i do not want to repeat the point which my noble friend lord underhill has just made about the delay <e> <s> nothing in the amendment would delay the implementation of the governments scheme by a single minute <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few comments on amendment no <e> <s> which is being taken along with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i wonder whether it is really necessary to do it in this fashion <e> <s> this is a consolidation bill and therefore one would hope that when it becomes a statute one can look at the statute and find all the law as it then is on the day of the enactment <e> <s> but the curious provision in schedule that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister would tell me what he means by principles <e> <s> i have listened to the debates on different amendments <e> <s> i noticed in particular that the minister declined to accept amendment no <e> <s> which used the word details <e> <s> now in describing principles he talks about pay he talks about prices <e> <s> a few minutes ago he was talking about the appointment of political advisers <e> <s> i am afraid that as a lawyer ultimately it is the courts which will determine what these words in the statute mean i do not understand the word principles as it comes from the mouth of this minister or as it is in this bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry for intervening but i am afraid i have expressed myself extremely badly <e> <s> what i was endeavouring to discover from the minister is what he means by the concept of principle as distinct from the concept of detail <e> <s> the kind of gobbledegook that he is pouring out at this late hour of the night is not helping me to understand that concept <e> <s> i should like to know what he means by a principle <e> <s> can he tell us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the fact that i am a member of the faculty of advocates in scotland and that at the rate at which the government are raising members of that faculty to the peerage we shall enjoy a majority in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that the noble lord the minister has not allayed my anxieties in this regard <e> <s> i do not have a copy of the correspondence that we have exchanged but as i recall it from the examples that he was able to give me from the courts i was able to instance the normal situation in which a mother says to her child james dont do that <e> <s> james replies why not <e> <s> and mother replies because i say so <e> <s> then the because i say so in terms of the authority in the courts is a self-justifying proposition which qualifies the name of principle <e> <s> that is what the secretary of state means in this bill by the word principle you will do it because i say so <e>", "<cs> my lords this particular group of new clauses has received a welcome from all parts of the house but there is one aspect which worries me <e> <s> as the noble minister and the noble and learned lord lord denning have made plain we are moving from a situation in which criminal intent has to be proved to a situation of strict liability <e> <s> therefore as the minister told us the person who may became liable to pay a penalty fare includes the innocent over-rider the person who intends to pay the correct fare but by mistake has not paid sufficient for the length of journey he undertakes <e> <s> it also applies to the person who has lost his ticket <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister allow me to intervene <e> <s> i was suggesting to the noble lord that under the previous law as i understand it i may be wrong the police were arresting a person who was guilty or who might be guilty of a criminal offence <e> <s> it is no doubt right that in certain circumstances the police have power to arrest without a warrant where a person may be guilty of a criminal offence <e> <s> what this bill does is to give the police the right to arrest without a warrant somebody who is not committing a criminal offence but somebody who for example has had his wallet stolen containing his ticket and who cannot therefore produce either the ticket or any other means of identification and who gives the police a funny name like john smith which happens to be his name <e> <s> it is possible for the police to disbelieve even the most honest people <e> <s> it is well known that on one occasion when the lord president and the lord justice clerk of the court of session and they did not look like the lord president and the lord justice clerk because one was small and round faced and the other one was tall and bucolic announced to a policeman that that was who they were in order to get past a police barrier the policeman said well i am king kong <e> <s> that can happen to almost anyone it can happen in the situation that i have outlined <e> <s> can the minister not understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will undoubtedly be aware of the recent case in scotland in which without legislation the high court of justiciary held that it was a crime at common law to sell glue sniffing kits to children <e> <s> one notes from the ministers reply the intention to introduce legislation covering england and wales but do the government not think that it is somewhat unsatisfactory that in scotland there is such a crime the penalties for which might indeed be two three or five years imprisonment whereas in england no doubt the legislation would introduce much smaller penalties <e> <s> do the government not think it desirable that any such legislation should apply uniformly throughout the united kingdom so that the courts on both sides of the border are given guidance as to penalties which is to the same effect <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point may i just say that in asking my question i am not concerned about the children though of course <e> <s> i am very concerned about the children but about the penalties on the suppliers which should be uniform on both sides of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make one brief point and that is to support and underline the point made by the noble baroness lady darcy <e> <s> all this amendment seeks to do is to include in the duty of the authority a duty to have due regard to the needs for these facilities <e> <s> that is all it is <e> <s> it merely says that in law one should not take a responsible decision without having regard to these needs <e> <s> if the government cannot accept that one will be left in the greatest doubt about the sincerity of the words which the noble earl himself certainly sincere has just uttered <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to step into the shoes of the noble and learned lord lord denning but i think that the noble and learned lord might offer the explanation which i would humbly offer to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am certainly grateful to the minister for the promptness with which he has considered the matter and for the readiness with which he decided to change the provision and in particular also for his courtesy in advising not only myself but my <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house whether the allowances for members attending this house have been raised since <e> <s> if so can he explain why the government should not raise the allowances for these youth by the same proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords although my name is not on the list of speakers i hope that the house will allow me to make a short contribution to this debate from the front bench <e> <s> i will begin by thanking my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove for introducing this bill and by correcting something that he said <e> <s> my noble friend informed the house that there were two former lord advocates in the chamber <e> <s> there is only one and he is the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside who has just spoken <e> <s> i was a mere solicitor general a handmaiden of and a tool wielded byanother mr ronald king murray as he then was <e> <s> i want also to acknowledge the contribution made by mr alec eadie in another place in introducing this bill and by the scottish law commission which in effect drafted the bill which is to become legislation <e> <s> if it is indeed passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i noticed that the noble and learned lord lord scarman referred to the unlikelihood of anyone introducing into the united kingdom a certain rule <e> <s> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington referred to this country and the noble and learned lord lord denning chose to have a conversation with the lord chief justice of the united states <e> <s> it is rather a pity that your lordships did not cast an eye north of the border <e> <s> this new clause as drafted by the noble and learned lord lord scarman encapsulates beautifully the common law <e>", "<cs> my lords to save the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor rising too hastily to his feet may i say something about this <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has just indicated that he is going to give virtually the same reply to this amendment as he gave to the previous one namely that he will draw the importance of the matter to the attention of his right honourable friend i should like to ask him to widen that reference when he does so <e> <s> i say that because increasingly as i look at these amendments including this one which employs the concept of proof to the court beyond reasonable doubt which of course echoes the words of the clause itself and similar words are used in subsection when i see the word unreliable which has caught the attention of my noble friend lord elystan-morgan and when i hear the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor talking about the possible truth of the confession i detect in this clause a complete and utter confusion which is the cause of much of the problem and could be the root of a great deal of evil unless it is looked at properly <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for introducing this generally welcome piece of law reform <e> <s> as the report of the scottish law commission on which the bill is based extends to pages and took years from conception to birth we can hardly criticise the noble and learned lord for taking minutes to baptise the infant and indeed we congratulate him on his shared pride in its paternity <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i should like to draw his attention to one particular matter which he has dealt with in part and again i am just taking advantage of his kind offer to consider matters again in relation to penalties <e> <s> however what worries me particularly in relation to the statutory five-year imprisonment is that it is available in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for his explanation <e> <s> i certainly do not feel passionately about this matter <e> <s> i should like to think that the government have given it due consideration and having listened to the reply i am satisfied that that has been done and that there are reasons respectable reasons which can be considered <e> <s> if the law society of scotland wants to press others to have this change made then it can do so after consideration of the reply which i have just heard <e> <s> in the meantime for my purposes i do not want to press this amendment nor amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> clause deals with the permanent trustee <e> <s> in relation to subsection the same body to which i referred earlier the bankruptcy committee of the law society of scotland drew attention to the fact that the subsection states <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble and learned lord one question which puzzles me when i compare this bill with the bill that your lordships will in committee consider next <e> <s> subsection reads <e>", "<cs> i must confess i do not find the reply a very satisfactory one <e> <s> in the first place may i deal with the other provisions of the bill to which the noble and learned lord referred <e> <s> he referred to clauses and and these clauses permit the debtor among others to petition for the recall of an award of sequestration <e> <s> obviously if the debtors ship did come in if he did find himself otherwise able to repay his debts and to be solvent again then he could present this petition <e> <s> he could present it the next day after the award of sequestration <e> <s> unfortunately because of the way the bill is cast he has got to present a petition to the court of session <e> <s> he may have been sequestrated at the sheriff court he has got to come to the court of session with a petition which is expensive and it might also cause delay and considerable inconvenience <e> <s> so in any event by providing for an instant petition for recall as clauses and do the government effectively concede the argument that there may be circumstances arising on the spot which would enable the debtor to persuade the court to have the sequestration recalled <e> <s> of course in those circumstances the court is given a discretion <e>", "<cs> the sun has gone down early on the lord advocates spirit today <e> <s> i hope that the rest of the debate will not be as bleak as the answers that he has just accorded to me in respect of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however having secured no promise from him to look at it again i know that he will undoubtedly look at it again because he will read what appears in <e>", "<cs> this is the clause dealing with the appointment and resignation of the interim trustee <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> if i could make my blandishments sound more like threats i certainly would <e> <s> but i do not feel that today i can threaten the noble and learned lord in this particular matter <e> <s> i look forward with interest to his writing to me about the position of the official receiver to see whether or not he is obliged to advertise in the scottish newspaper the <e>", "<cs> the argument put forward by the noble and learned lord to the effect that the wording proposed will create many difficulties is an extremely bad argument <e> <s> i know because i have used it many times myself in exactly that situation <e> <s> the purpose of drafting and presenting amendments in this house is not to rewrite the bill but to raise the point of principle so that those who assist the lord advocate in the drafting of these bills may assist him to do it properly <e> <s> i do not even apologise therefore if i have got it wrong <e> <s> i do not regard it as any part of my task <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i should have added that i wish to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say just one word about clause <e> <s> i should perhaps have put down an amendment in relation to this matter <e> <s> your lordships will have seen in the earlier clauses that when the petition is presented to the court for the sequestration of a debtor it can go either to the court of session in scotland which is the higher court or it can go to the local court the sheriff court <e> <s> but under clause a petition for recall of an award of sequestration may be presented to the court of session but not to the sheriff court <e> <s> it is not easy to understand why that should be so and i wonder whether the lord advocate is able to explain why it is that under clauses and the jurisdiction is exclusively that of the court of session and there is no jurisdiction in the sheriff court <e> <s> i think this was a point which was raised by the committee of the law society of scotland in the document to which i have referred and i trust therefore that although i have not given notice of it by way of amendment the lord advocate will be able to deal with the point on the question whether the clause shall stand part <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether any of your lordships have played darts but if you throw darts at a dartboard and the first hit the wire you are very grateful when one eventually goes in even if it does not score <e> <s> so i am sorry that my enthusiasm for the early part of what the noble and learned lord said is now rather dampened by the quite unnecessary bleakness of the quite unnecessary remark that he made at the end <e> <s> however taking small comfort from what he has said i look forward to the noble and learned lord coming forward with what he would no doubt describe as an effective amendment <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to one or two points which the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has raised <e> <s> first one can easily read in the bill that the interim trustee has no power to enter someones house either in the middle of the night or <e>", "<cs> the lord advocate has specifically referred to the directions that may be given under subsection <e> <s> that makes matters worse for him not better because under clause <e>", "<cs> there is no amendment down in relation to clause but i want to draw your lordships attention to certain of its provisions because they have a bearing on an amendment which comes later <e>", "<cs> the lord advocate has sought to persuade the committee that what the amendment does is to place an impossible burden upon the prosecutor <e> <s> what the amendment does of course is to invert the onus and put the onus back where it normally is upon the prosecutor by saying that the creditor shall be guilty of an offence if the court is satisfied that he knew or had good reason to believe that the statement was false <e> <s> that is a very normal kind of burden which rests upon a prosecutor <e> <s> but the nonsense of the lord advocates reply with respect is shown by the very next line of the bill where it says under clause <e>", "<cs> may i just in relation to clause ask the lord advocate perhaps not on this occasion but on some other occasion or by letter to me to explain one point <e> <s> in clause it says that the permanent trustee may be removed from office and i look at clause lb where it says <e>", "<cs> i was in fact concerned with the position of the commissioners <e> <s> under schedule it says that a quorum at a meeting of commissioners shall be one commissioner and that the commissioners may act by a majority of the commissioners present <e> <s> i rather like that provision if you are the only one there you constitute a majority <e> <s> it seems a reasonable point but what is not clear is whether when you go to the sheriff you can go as a majority or whether the application has to be the application of all the commissioners <e> <s> it is a point of very small detail but i raise it because it arises out of the law societys observations <e> <s> i would be content if the lord advocate would deal with that specific point on another occasion <e>", "<cs> i am indebted to others who have spoken in support of the amendment because it certainly shortens my task but i do want to emphasise the point that my noble friend lord ross of marnock has just made <e> <s> it is a piece of nonsense to suggest that the argument is indisputable when the fact of the matter is that it is disputed by every body that has been consulted <e> <s> furthermore every argument that the lord advocate has put forward is in fact taken out of the scottish law commission report <e> <s> it provides a nice book of reference for all the arguments in favour of retaining crown preference and proceeds to demolish them with remorseless logic that obviously escaped the lord advocate and those behind him <e>", "<cs> i am indebted to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for explaining the matter <e> <s> i do not think that i require any further explanation from him <e> <s> i think however that if he considers carefully the argument that i have presented and his reply he will find that in one respect it does not meet the argument <e> <s> that one respect is this <e> <s> where you have a debtor who can demonstrate to the court that he is totally faultless that he himself has been the victim of circumstances which are quite outside his control and are essentially macro-economic circumstances or particular circumstances which have affected him in a way that shows that he has not mismanaged his business in any way then it seems unfortunate that he cannot get his discharge <e> <s> the obtaining by him of his discharge will not affect the administration the winding-up of his estate that can still go on <e> <s> but i think his case might be special <e> <s> i think that the scottish law commissions provision in their clause provided for that possiblilty <e> <s> it appears to me that it would be worthwhile the government just thinking again about whether they might not create the exception for the exceptional case <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i always found the lord advocate as convincing on these bills as i find him in relation to this amendment we could have risen a long time ago <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i might indeed but i do not think it is a question of simply leaving it to the courts <e> <s> if you have a provision of the kind that i suggest which places a time limit upon the attack on the agreement the matter would never get to the courts <e> <s> it would be dismissed as an irrelevant application if the application was one to unscramble an agreement more than years old <e> <s> what i am endeavouring to do with this amendment is to prevent unnecessary litigation to prevent people dragging others to the courts to blackmail them in effect by threatening to deny effect to an old agreement by an inquiry into all the circumstances obtaining at the time that it was entered into <e> <s> however in the absence of support for the provision <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the point there of course is that the same epithet ought to be introduced into clauses and <e> <s> one should not have people running to court simply because they can point to a change in circumstances one ought to put them to the task of showing that the change is material and that is regardless of the actual character <e> <s> had i done my homework more thoroughly i should have put this epithet into clauses and as well <e> <s> i hope the government might just consider using the epithet in order to discourage litigation <e>", "<cs> i certainly intend to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i am not at all sure how a court will measure the seriousness <e> <s> but when they come to do so they cannot of course look at the words of the noble and learned lord opposite at my own words or those of anyone else in the committee they will just have to do the best job that they can with the words that they have before them <e> <s> they will look in this bill and find the word serious and they will look in the act and find the word grave and they will have to conclude as they rightly would that the government or parliament decided to use a different word in order to achieve a different result and then in my view they will be no further forward because they will not know what that different result has to be <e> <s> so if you provide a long piece of string in one act and a slightly longer piece of string in another act i do not know what difference it makes <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am both glad and sorry that the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside joined in <e> <s> i am glad because i agree with what he said about the scottish law commission and i am sorry because that is what i was about to say myself <e> <s> i would put it this way <e> <s> however much we may admire the scottish law commission the scottish law commission is not a substitute for parliamentary scrutiny and for independent judgment <e> <s> a former chairman of the scottish law commission told me that he was deeply concerned at the fact that from time to time in fact quite frequently they had to take decisions which were essentially policy or political decisions with a small p in relation to the reform of the law and as there seemed to be very little help forthcoming from outside they took those decisions and incorporated them in their reports <e> <s> therefore we must not just look at those decisions and say that because the scottish law commission did it it is good <e> <s> in some circumstances one wishes that that were so but in this particular case it is not justified <e>", "<cs> i think that explanation will be extremely helpful to those who are interested in this matter <e> <s> it certainly clarifies it in my mind and i see no need to ask your lordships to amend the bill <e> <s> accordingly i seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who took part in an earlier stage of this bill perhaps i may acknowledge what was said by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate about the amendment which derives from certain suggestions i made <e> <s> it is

little to say <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recognise that in that statement the secretary of state asserted that the current arrangements for sharing responsibilities for services for the

amendments nos <e> <s> and prohibition of acting for both sides the principle of the level playing field requires that a rule of this kind which applies to a conveyancing practitioner applies equally to a solicitor <e>", "<cs> i had intended to speak at some length on this matter but the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna who addresses the committee with such laconic brevity that it is almost universally appreciated has dealt with all the points <e> <s> i need only say that the practice rules of the law society of scotland have evolved over a long period of time <e> <s> they contain provisions which have been tried and tested against particular cases <e> <s> eventually they have reached a certain form <e> <s> principally for that reason i say that this is the model and therefore i support the point that has been made that the provision is the wrong way round <e>", "<cs> i only want to say a word which echoes something which i and others said earlier <e> <s> the problem is that these amendments including this amendments are so substantial that it is becoming extremely difficult for members of your lordships committee to follow what clause is ultimately saying

wings to this debate read the new provisions and heard the undertakings given by the noble and learned lord as we go through the bill and amendments are moved and accepted this body called the board

shall be called the law society of scotland and practitioners shall be called solicitors <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i am out of order but i observe that the leader of the house is sitting on the government front bench and i should like to raise a point for his consideration together with his noble and learned friend the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add that i disagree with my noble and learned friend lord morton of shuna and agree with the noble and learned lord the lord advocate that there is a large measure of agreement and that it is proper that that agreement should be dealt with and recorded tonight <e> <s> i would certainly come back to the matter if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate sought to move on to controversial matters tonight <e> <s> it is extremely important that contentious matters should be dealt with when the committee is more fully attended <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene to say that i am happy that the government have chosen to accept the amendment <e> <s> it is perhaps unfortunate that the original print of the bill did not contain something of this kind so that a good deal of upset might have been avoided <e>", "<cs> i also rise to oppose the amendment <e> <s> i concentrate on the point just mentioned that it is designed to allow solicitors both to precognosce a case and then to conduct the case perhaps even to see witnesses in the course of the case and to reprecognosce them <e>", "<cs> i wish to add one point which i should have mentioned previously <e> <s> it explains the origin of the phrases used in the green paper <e> <s> the royal commission considered this matter particularly in the criminal context and that is the subject with which i am most concerned <e> <s> the conclusion stated at paragraph is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add three points to what has been said <e> <s> first i do not understand the concept of a solicitor being instructed in the same way as counsel is instructed <e> <s> when counsel receives a letter of instructions requiring him to be in a particular place at a particular time he is instructed <e> <s> i do not know what comparable concept would apply in relation to a solicitor <e> <s> that must be taken on board in the reconsideration <e>", "<cs> i have one other point to make in reply to what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> it is not a criticism <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord morton has said that he was a solicitor for years <e> <s> the noble lord lord macaulay was a solicitor for some years and i am also a fully qualified solicitor <e> <s> however none of us appears here to represent advocates <e> <s> we are not advocates either <e> <s> i used to be an advocate but i am now a judge <e> <s> my concern is not the interest of the faculty of advocates

interest in this i hope we can give a voice to it from our own experience as some of us have been solicitors <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> those provisions will be transformed by the amendments which stand in the name of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> it might therefore be better if we were to allow the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to proceed to the next amendment <e> <s> in that amendment he brings in provisions which oust the present subsections and and replace them with considerations which are quite different <e> <s> it may be that at this time of night we should not discuss the present subsections and at all <e> <s> i suggest that that would be a simpler way to proceed <e>", "<cs> i am anxious that the debate should proceed in an orderly fashion <e> <s> i draw the committees attention to the fact that amendment no <e> <s> which we are currently discussing takes out subsection <e> <s> in the following amendment the noble and

that is the matter that we ought to be discussing <e> <s> i see no point in discussing subsections and which we are all agreed ought to depart from the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate refers to an occasion when he was kind enough to accept an invitation from me to explain in advance his thinking on new clause a and b <e> <s> the committee will see that under the provision that we are now discussing the rules after being made by the council and approved by the lord president are to go to the secretary of state <e> <s> he then consults the director in accordance with clause a <e> <s> committee members will find that listed under amendment no <e> <s> h in the marshalled list of amendments <e> <s> clause a is on page of the marshalled list <e> <s>

purely from the point of view as to whether it restricts distorts or prevents competition to any significant extent <e> <s> it then comes back to the secretary of state <e> <s> under clause b the secretary of state considers the advice of the director and <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord for saying that he will look at the matter again but i must warn the noble baroness lady seear that it is dangerous to make the point that she made <e> <s> i made that point on second reading and was told that i was being mischievous so i have not made it again tonight <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to divide the committee on this matter <e> <s> the fact that we allow this to go into the record i shall not oppose this provision being inserted into the bill at this stage and thus appearing in the report print of the bill does not mean that i agree with it <e> <s> i need not go on repeating that point <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether to laugh or cry when i hear these answers <e> <s> parliament cannot be asked to enact a provision which lays duties upon public office holders such as the lord president the secretary of state and the director general of fair trading i do not include in that category the law society when at the same time the lord advocate stands at the dispatch box and says i have no doubt that these persons and the council will act properly <e> <s> if he has no doubt why is parliament being asked to enact a provision of this kind <e> <s> this is absurd <e> <s> i do not understand <e>", "<cs> in a previous incarnation if i may say that i stood at the very same dispatch box where the noble and learned lord now stands <e> <s> when i felt utterly ashamed of the proposition which i had advanced and which had been torn apart from in front from the side and from behind me i used to say that i would speak to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i am sure that the lord advocate could have said that <e> <s> however i do not require him to stand up and say that on this occasion because i hope he will say it another or times before the evening is out <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i also do not propose to divide the committee on this matter because the clause which we are asked to approve is an entirely different <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee perhaps i may say one or two words <e> <s> the purpose of our flexible procedure at committee stage is to allow members to ask the minister questions and to seek answers to those questions <e> <s> i did not ask the minister who approved this proposal <e> <s> i told him that the scottish consumer council approved it in a bald statement of eight lines long <e> <s> i asked him who suggested it <e> <s> that is the question to which i wish an

certain questions <e> <s> one of them i asked on second reading and i did not get the answer then <e> <s> but the questions are these and i hope that it is not bullying to ask the lord advocate of scotland who holds one of the five great offices of state of scotland a question in the house of lords <e>", "<cs> whether or not i am obliged to the answer is yes i have <e> <s> the noble lord lord morris attended the second reading debate and took part in an earlier debate on this matter <e> <s> if he reads the report of the second reading debate he will find that i asked the specific question

that i have asked are implicit in the amendments to which i have already referred relating to the better administration of justice and to the appointment of laymen to the high court <e> <s> these amendments arise later on <e> <s> they are all connected and that is why i mentioned them <e>", "<cs> the noble earl asked a proper question but i differ from him <e> <s> if we go straight to

way <e> <s> i ask the noble earls indulgence <e>", "<cs> it is a pity that i did not go into the details of the insolvency and bankrupty acts in order to illustrate my point <e> <s> those acts contain provisions which make certain things a criminal offence <e> <s> in this bill an insolvency practitioner may perhaps appear as an advocate in a criminal court dealing with insolvency matters <e> <s> i could give example after example of circumstances in which he may appear for the defence in a case of alleged breach of one of the sections of those acts and find that he was simply unable to deal with the matters which fall totally outwith his training and experience <e>", "<cs> i shall study that answer in due course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i have not made myself plain <e> <s> i did beg to move amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and that of my noble and learned friend lord emslie <e> <s> that is the amendment that i have spoken to it is

intended to be the subject of judicial review <e> <s> i do not ask the lord advocate to tell me this afternoon but to make the matter clear when redrafting the clause <e>", "<cs> having given notice

excellent libraries <e> <s> the writers to the signet have an enormous library and the solicitors at the supreme court have an excellent library <e> <s> the three libraries the advocates library and the two solicitors libraries have as it were common borrowing rights and share their books so there is no problem for solicitors to obtain access to books facts and consultation rooms <e> <s> however

what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said <e> <s> i had not appreciated that constitutional dimension of the matter <e> <s> however my instinctive feeling is that we do not need this

idea that a layman or any other person after a simple five years should be appointed to the high court bench is so absurd that even the noble and learned lord the lord advocate does not support it

observing the same standards as it were behind the scenes in the preparation and conduct of cases <e> <s> i support the amendment for all the reasons given by the noble and learned friend lord morton

said <e> <s> i apologise that i did not pick up the true import of amendment no <e> <s> to which we shall come <e> <s> however the house will appreciate that in common with other noble lords i was a stranger to about of the amendments until late last night when fortunately the noble and learned lord the lord advocate faxed me a copy of all his amendments <e> <s> i have been trying to digest them ever since and i have obviously not been entirely successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reasonably satisfied with what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said in relation to this subject <e> <s> the problem arises with a number of different amendments <e> <s> however i am still puzzled as i was at committee stage by a concept contained in this clause and repeated in the amendments <e> <s> the bill states in subsection page line onwards the concept of a solicitor being instructed to appear in a court <e> <s> in amendment no <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate refers to the solicitor determining whether or not to accept instructions <e>", "<cs> my lords another point that arises in connection with this matter is again one which i sought to raise in committee <e> <s> however it came out in rather a confused fashion in the report of the proceedings <e> <s> the position is that it is not simply a matter of precedence as between courts <e> <s> an advocate or a solicitor may be instructed if that is a possible concept to appear at a planning inquiry or before an industrial tribunal <e> <s> someone has to determine whether his appearance in a summary criminal court which may last for half an hour takes precedence over his duty to appear for his client in a planning inquiry which may last for half a year <e> <s> there must be some solution to a conflict of this kind <e> <s> i do not think that the bill as it stands at present addresses that matter at all <e> <s> i have found no trace of that matter either in the bill or in the proposed amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said that there is little to be gained by accepting it <e> <s> i wonder whether there is anything to be lost by accepting it <e> <s> possible and practicable in law almost certainly mean the same in a context such as this <e> <s> practicable means able to be achieved by known means and resources reasonably practicable introduces a concept of flexibility and allows for some tolerance <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to keep noble lords from their dinner but i should like to congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord advocate on using a gerund in the third line of the amendment <e> <s> i hope that this reformation in his character and syntax will pervade other parts of the bill in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may assist the noble and learned lord <e> <s> there are slight differences and i do not want to deprive myself of the right to add a few words in relation to the other amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the provision is anodyne or sinister it is just silly <e> <s> that is the point that i have sought to make from the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said that the questions raised in connection with the amendment are difficult and that it is far from surprising that they have caused difficulties <e> <s> they might have caused difficulties to the rest of us but they should not have caused difficulties to the government because the government should have reflected upon the impact of the bill upon article xix before the committee discussed the matter and i tabled the amendment referring to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate with the assistance of my <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not dwell any longer on this matter <e> <s> the position in scotland is different from that in

of justiciary as the clause permits the lord president should determine whether they pass the test <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord the lord advocate pointed out the amendment introduces subsection a which is to be found set out in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i have nothing further to say <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this

parliament might want to make representations on a particular scheme <e> <s> therefore i urge the government to consider this amendment positively <e>", "<cs> my lords it is to be hoped that when the bill finally receives royal assent it will be coherent <e> <s> i am sure that when the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and the secretary of state reflect on the matter they will see the

there is nothing i can add to assist the house <e> <s> i am happy to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather strange that the bill should deliberately contain a provision the purpose of which includes that the decision of the lord president on a matter of this kind or at least the decision of the secretary of state on a matter of this kind should be subject to judicial review <e>

division of the inner house <e> <s> that is unprecedented so far as i am aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not content that the balance has been properly struck but i recognise and acknowledge that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has moved some way in the direction of what is proposed <e> <s> at this time of night i merely content myself by asking leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i have failed to persuade the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i shall simply leave the matter in the hope that on further reflection between now and the passage of the bill through another place and its return here possibly in the autumn the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and his colleague the secretary of state will think again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am happy to accept what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said <e> <s> in the light of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment

<e> <s> does the ec directive cover that person <e> <s> that is the question i asked and i repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the amendment will certainly be withdrawn <e> <s> however i am happy that at last the noble and learned lord has acknowledged in plain terms that the provisions of the clause go beyond the requirements of the ec directives <e> <s> the only justification for the provision and it is shabby and unworthy is that there should be reciprocity <e> <s> reciprocity with what <e> <s> it is with provisions contained in the courts and legal services bill which nobody on either side of the border wanted and about which so far as i can tell nobody was asked <e> <s> i know of no one who supported it and the government have failed to tell us of anyone who did so <e>", "<cs> my lord i have no doubt that members of another place will in due course consider what has been said by the lord advocate and the noble lord lord coleraine tonight and compare that with what is said in relation to the so-called cab rank rule in the courts and legal services bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is in the rules of the house for anyone other than the mover of the amendment to speak after the minister has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly happy to hear what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said <e> <s>

elsewhere when i addressed myself to this amendment and missed the point i was making <e> <s> however i am sure that he will read it and if it is technically sound he will consider introducing an appropriate amendment <e> <s> i do not propose to repeat it because it is rather technical and it has nothing to do with the exchequer causes at all <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still slightly puzzled as to why the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who is a scot and is well known for his adherence to the church in scotland chose the interval between the committee and report stages to make his observations <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the last point there have been cases and i have been involved as a prosecutor counsel for the

pages <e> <s> it returns in that form and with pages consisting of amendments including new clauses and two new schedules <e> <s> eight clauses which were originally in the bill and were fully discussed in this house are to be dropped without a word of explanation <e> <s> many of those clauses contain useful miscellaneous provisions about law reform which enjoyed a certain amount of support in this chamber and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that the first committee day was postponed by hours in response to a request by the law society of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the debate on the general matter of principle <e> <s> one of the main justifications for the continued existence of this house is that it performs a revising function <e>

these sections <e> <s> but i find it comic that when the draftsman observed that and properly followed the house style of the act he did not at the same time decide that a charitable body should be plural <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty with that explanation is that it is incomprehensible to those who have listened to it <e> <s> i who have studied the matter certainly did not understand what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> that is partly because the grouping is wrong and we should not be discussing all these issues at the same time <e> <s> the matters dealt with by the noble and

same in relation to the high court of justiciary <e> <s> furthermore by omitting to differentiate between the high court of justiciary in its first instance role and its appellate role one also commits the error of omitting it in its first instance role <e>", "<cs> my lords as i stand on my feet now i am looking at the original clause which is the forerunner to the present clause <e> <s> i do not see the defect there <e> <s> it must have crept in along with a great mass of other amendments either on report or in committee and because of the way those stages were dealt with we have made
