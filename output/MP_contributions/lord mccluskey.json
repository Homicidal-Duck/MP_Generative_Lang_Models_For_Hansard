["<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be fair to say that one cannot look at amendments nos <e> <s> and without looking at the associated government amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think that amendments nos <e> <s> and pave the way for the others <e> <s> the principal amendment is no <e> <s> and it certainly goes some way to meeting a number of the points made at the committee stage <e> <s> however i ask the house to accept that it does not really go far enough <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have the supplementary marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is concerned about the words all he reasonably could <e> <s> so am i if i may give a further example once every two years about welshmen come to watch their team play rugby at murray-field <e> <s> they will be coming not to attend a designated sporting event as i understand it <e> <s> close by is tynecastle where the heart of midlothian club play football or in the view of some attempt to play football <e> <s> large crowds of people go towards both grounds from time to time on the same day <e> <s> it commonly happens that many thousands of welshmen who cannot get in at murrayfield instruct their drivers to take them to tynecastle <e> <s> if tynecastle is host to a designated sporting event it means that the driver is engaged on a journey the principal purpose of which is to convey welshmen to and subsequently from a designated sporting event <e> <s> in these circumstances what is his duty <e> <s> what can he reasonably do to these welshmen most of whom have been in edinburgh for four or five days enjoying the local wine <e> <s> they could be a difficult crew to handle <e> <s> is he reasonably required to say i will not take you to tynecastle <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i agree with the lord advocate as to the effect of the amendments proposed to the amendment by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> i do not think they change the position very much <e> <s> secondly i <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not wat to repeat any stale jokes but this definition still in my judgment embraces the open container <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much that the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside said but i shall have some observations to make on the clause itself when we come to amendment no <e> <s> and will therefore confine my remarks at this stage to the limited amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> we are all against vandalism and no doubt the courts could play a part if they thought it proper by increasing the penalties under the law as it now stands but i am not in favour of giving the summary criminal courts the increased sentencing powers which amendments nos <e> <s> and envisage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i say that he used the expression the offences replaced by the statutory offence of vandalism <e> <s> i wonder whether he would care either now or in the course of dealing with the next clause to explain to the house whether he means replaced because this is a matter of some concern to me <e> <s> i understood that the ordinary common law offence of malicious mischief is not affected by clause and that this statutory crime of vandalism is an additional crime <e> <s> if that be wrong i should need to think very carefully about the matter and must at the next stage draw the attention of the house to the views of the faculty of advocates on thisbut perhaps the noble earl can give me an answer to the point either now or in the course of the debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to add very much to what my noble friend lord ross has said but there are one or two points i ought to bring to your lordships attention <e> <s> first of all at the committee stage prompted by a letter i had written to him my noble friend lord mishcon said at column on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may address the house the answer is that i do not know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords just a brief word to say that the government are to be congratulated on their flexibility here <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate was slightly more rigid when the matter was raised at a previous <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that my argument has been satisfactorily answered by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> what he said first of all was that this kind of prejudice or possible prejudice to a trial can happen at the present time <e> <s> well it can and it happens extremely rarely <e> <s> it may be that if it is bad enough one cannot proceed with the trial <e> <s> that has happened at least once fairly recently <e> <s> but under the bill it is almost built into this type of case because all these cases will or may have attracted a good deal of publicity <e> <s> so one is going to have it happening not rarely but very frequently in this type of case <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene to support what the noble lord lord renton has said <e> <s> the difficulty here is not simply one of following through the provisionsthere is the difficulty of having time even to attempt the task <e> <s> of course the government have notes on clauses for the benefit of ministers and those notes on clauses will undoubtedly contain at least the signposts as to what each provision will contain <e> <s> i should have thought that perhaps the proper thing for the government to think of doing at once is to put into the library the notes on clauses either on the whole bill or certainly on the so-called minor and consequential amendments so that those who are interested do not have to undertake the task for which perhaps the noble lord <e> <s> lord renton is uniquely fitted but the rest of us simply do not have either the qualifications or the time to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this change the government are <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house i would merely ask in relation to paragraph which proposes the addition of the following subsection which renders incompetent the procedure of certification what that was consequential to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i simply acknowledge with gratitude what the government are doing here <e>", "<cs> my lords this is perhaps not a very good example but the government have certainly in moving a number of their amendments and in accepting amendments proceeding from other parts of the house moved some way towards meeting the criticisms that were voiced on second reading and in committee <e> <s> i should like to acknowledge the help that was given to me by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate when he supplied me in good time with advance notice of a number of the government amendments particularly on important matters <e> <s> the government have yet the difficult task ahead of them of persuading us that the bill is entirely right and they will have an even greater task no doubt when the bill reaches another place <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make two points as regards that matter <e> <s> first the notes on clauses exist and there is no extra work of course for the draftsman <e> <s> i often felt when in government that they were born to blush unseen as it were and it was rather a pity because a good deal of work had gone into them and it would certainly help those who want to study the bill closely to see them <e>"]
