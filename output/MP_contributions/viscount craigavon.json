["<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord alport for giving us a chance to debate this subject again <e> <s> this is the third time i have spoken about overseas students and i hope that the noble baroness lady young in her reply is going to confound my sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief at this hour and confine myself to just one point that is the long-term effects of the government actions <e> <s> i broadly agree with the robust realism of the noble lord lord annan <e> <s> i have been advocating quotas for many years <e> <s> i fear the academic world has hardly seen the beginning of the real cuts <e> <s> at the same time i feel that the noble baroness owes rational and coherent explanations of the governments position to many of the powerful speakers that we have heard <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble lord lord bellwin has said <e> <s> he said that he was striking a balance of advantage <e> <s> i am wondering whether he realised what is in one of the balances <e> <s> as i said earlier this is a grey area and he seems to rely on the fact that everyone will behave sensibly and will be perfectly reasonable <e> <s> one would hope that would be so but i have given three examples which would produce extremely awkward situations <e> <s> i should have thought they were examples of the sort of difficulties which would face local authorities and it seems to me that the noble lord also relies on the courts interpreting in a common sense way the words for the better performance of his duties <e>", "<cs> my lords can i thank the noble lord lord bellwin for giving what seems to be per cent <e> <s> of what i was asking for in my previous amendment and also thank the noble baroness lady faithfull for her significant influence in persuading the government of the desirability of this move <e> <s> without this amendment i think there would have been a risk of slow thrombosis in the social services in one or two years time <e> <s> this has now been avoided <e> <s> to take into account the amendment of the noble baroness lady birk i think the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton is saying that we should trust to this extent the local authorities in their discretion in rehousing <e> <s> i feel that the amendment as put down by the noble lord lord bellwin is sufficient <e> <s> i should like to know from the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord davies of leek for introducing this important motion in his usual robust way <e> <s> in my view there can never he too much discussion about these problems <e> <s> i find the statistics that we have heard today especially recently from the noble lord lord noel-baker rather mind-numbing <e> <s> i was looking at the debate in in which i spoke about population and development prior to the columbo conference to see whether things had improved since then <e> <s> i feel slightly more optimistic at least in that <e>", "<cs> may i speak in support of this amendment as i have a following amendment which would allow an even longer tenure of office five to eight years <e> <s> i am speaking with the support of the british computer society which is the leading professional organisation in computers <e> <s> it is concerned to reinforce the independence of the registrar <e> <s> it regards such political independence as most important and this is one area where it can be reinforced <e> <s> the bcs looks on this bill as a chance to reduce public suspicion and scepticism about computers in certain areas <e> <s> it does not require a person to be very politically aware to have suspicions about the independence of an appointee in these circumstances of three years <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> i am not sure whether the powers of discretion in clause cannot still he exercised even if my amendment were put into clause <e> <s> however i would like to read in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that very full answer <e> <s> i think the answer might be that the professional has a slightly different perspective on the whole process or registration <e> <s> however until i am able to see that full answer in <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly support the noble lord lord wigoder as my name is above the amendment <e> <s> i am advised by the british computer society that the wording in the bill as it stands would not be adequate <e> <s> the addition of the words data material is needed to make sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> but the way in which he tries to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his remarks <e> <s> while i should perhaps defer to the noble lord lord wigoder in this very legal field possibly the noble and learned lord can reassure us that there is no contradiction in the bill when it refers to damage and distress at one point and simply to damage at another point because i gave the example of the evidence at a tribunal where solely distress had been caused and there was no way in which this could be compensated for in the courts <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord like to answer that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that full reply <e> <s> perhaps between now and the report stage we should all look at <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i will study what has been said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the parties to the amendment at the previous stage may i thank the noble and learned lord for his acceptance of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble and learned lord for his acceptance of the basic principle of this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may press him slightly further because i discovered in the guidelines to the european convention that under point there is something called the individual participation principle which covers this point <e> <s> it says that an individual <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble and learned lords says <e> <s> in this amendment i was merely seeking to provide a small reminder to anyone who was in doubt that pensions in this context are often by their nature contingent <e> <s> i accept that it might be otiose to put this in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for what he says <e> <s> i was trying to point out that there were different interpretations under the existing law and i tried to highlight them by citing the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i too certainly support this bill <e> <s> i was going to make a fairly long speech encouraging the noble lord down a road which he has already in his speech indicated he is exploring <e> <s> i take his assurances in that regard <e> <s> it is the area of section and the per cent <e> <s> relating to residential property as well as the addition to clause to restrict the expansion of individual flats <e> <s> if the noble lord could produce an amendment on this point i should be extremely grateful as would the royal borough of kensington and chelsea which is prompting me and i believe the noble lord too <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandford for his intervention <e> <s> i go along certainly with what he says <e> <s> i am also grateful to the minister for the manner in which he has replied to the debate <e> <s> what has been brought home to me is the difference between agricultural and urban problems <e> <s> the sheer scale of the compensation in relation to the urban problem is a matter of urgency <e> <s> the noble lord lord middleton says that we should take our time and have full discussions <e> <s> the trouble is that in urban areas i gave examples the clock is ticking and large amounts of potential compensation are being built up <e> <s> i would say to the noble earl lord radnor that i was giving specific concrete examples to make my case <e> <s> i was not saying that they were typical of the whole urban problem <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord lord sandford for that emphasis on the fact that there is a real problem in this area <e> <s> it is not just this one pizza case but there are potential problems for whole terraces <e> <s> based on what the noble baroness lady birk said and also the noble lord lord sandford i hope that between now and the next stage we might all get together to see whether progress can be made in that direction <e> <s> but until then i should like to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl the minister for this amendment as well as to his department and the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> this is an important additional amendment to one of the major planks of the bill and i am extremely grateful to the noble earl for it <e> <s> i will certainly be withdrawing my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i may say that the royal borough of kensington and chelsea and their advisers will also be grateful for this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord montagu gives his opinion on the proceedings perhaps i should deal with my amendment to his amendment <e> <s> we should at least be grateful for the assurance now on the record about this process of consultation which is going to take place though i am afraid i think that is a small comfort <e> <s> where i seem to disagree with the noble lord the minister is on the extent of the compensation which is due to people who have incurred expenditure on residential properties as opposed to what the noble lord lord lloyd was saying about agricultural properties <e> <s> in my opinion the extent of that expenditure which needs to be compensated is very much smaller than the noble lord lord skelmersdale was leading us to believe <e> <s> with that and with a slightly heavy heart i should like to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for those remarks <e> <s> as i said at the beginning i will not pursue this amendment but it is useful to have had all those comments from the minister on the record as well as my example which i gave at the beginning <e> <s> as well as other things escaping from pandoras box <e> <s> i hope that a lot of compensation will not disappear between now and the time when the consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene at this stage of the bill but having taken part in all the other stages may i briefly welcome something which the noble lord the minister mentioned in his opening speech which was to do with retrospection <e> <s> if i heard him aright it is very good that he has put on the record that if necessary he is prepared to recommend to the house that there could be an element of retrospection in legislation which might be proposed if there is flagrant abuse of potential loopholes to which we were drawing attention at the previous stage <e> <s> anyone who is thinking of trying to abuse any possible loopholes should be aware that this has been said in your lordships house and is on the record and that there are many noble lords who would support any attempt to introduce retrospection in cases of flagrant abuse of the present system <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to raise a fairly minor matter which is not dealt with in the bill as it now stands and that is the environmental blight which is caused by estate agents boards <e> <s> the problem occurs mainly in london and seems to have been exacerbated by the recent large increase in property prices <e> <s> this has caused estate agents generally to lose any gentlemanly insticts for fair play that they might still have possessed <e> <s> so much is at stake especially when agents are trying to expand their businesses that such things as voluntary codes of practice are quite inadequate <e> <s> i understand that many if not the majority of estate agents would welcome major restrictions on boards or even a total ban <e> <s> but if a few agents behave irresponsibly others often feel that they have to behave in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that in the letter from the danish foreign minister in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to support the question which the noble baroness lady lockwood has tabled and the way in which she presented it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the words of encouragement from the two previous speakers concerning what i have to say <e> <s> i am happy to support this bill but i have one small concern about the effect of the cut-off date of th december which is mentioned in the bill <e> <s> my reason for speaking on this subject is that my concern was aroused on this point by a friend who is the managing director of one of the largest producers of generic drugs and incidentally he fully supports the general principle of the bill <e> <s> this is not a case of special pleading but of wanting to be fair among generic companies by which i mean companies whose main business is the production of generic drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate mentioned that those organisations were in his favour and he read out a list of the organisations <e> <s> can he say whether all of them and in particular the bma support the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to hold the proceedings up but i was told that the bma had written a letter to the right reverend prelate stating specifically that it did not support the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble duke refers to that practice being used in late abortions <e> <s> can he tell us what he means by late abortions <e> <s> i understand that what one might call very late abortions after weeks are no longer done in the private sector <e> <s> that practice was being carried on in the private sector whereas according to the report to which the right reverend prelate referred of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists in the prevalence of that in the nhs was only per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again <e> <s> i know i shall have a chance to speak later on but this is so essential <e> <s> it is very colourful language which people remember <e> <s> it is my <e>", "<cs> my lords i once again apologise to the noble duke for interrupting him as i did but i was afraid that the very graphic description he was giving of a method of abortion unchallenged would gain currency coming from him <e> <s> in fact as i shall explain later the method of abortion the noble duke was describing scarcely takes place any longer certainly not in the private clinics and certainly not after weeks which is the issue in the bill we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be a valid point but what i am referring to and what this bill is addressing is the problem of abortions after weeks <e> <s> to repeat the figures for the number of abortions affected was in fact two in this country <e>", "<cs> first i am particularly glad that the noble lord lord denham is present to listen to this debate on the very important issue of retrospection <e> <s> i have a fairly long speech to make but having said that i do not expect the noble lord to stay throughout my remarks <e> <s> i hope that he will be able to read my speech in <e>", "<cs> i am extremely sorry <e> <s> i was ignoring the clock and completely mistimed myself <e> <s> perhaps i may finally say that for parliamentary reasons which i have not been able to go into i should like to recommend that the committee stick rigorously to the requirement that the date of commencement stems from the date of royal assent <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> decides what to do with the amendment i should like to say on amendment no <e> <s> that i accept the suggestion of the noble lord lord northfield that this could be talked about during the coming weeks <e> <s> the noble lord accused me of contradicting myself <e> <s> i am afraid that he completely missed my point in that i said that everyone knew about the bill and knew that the bill was likely to come forward <e> <s> what was not reasonably expected was the transitional date and the effective date with which we have ended up <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully support this bill and i should like to make a few brief remarks about the carriage of bicycles <e> <s> some of your lordships may know that the government have already gracefully accepted a significant amendment relating to the carriage of bicycles moved in another place by the cycling fraternity led by sir george young <e> <s> i understand that that amendment was a good illustration of how a small change to the concession agreement has been possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord marshall of leeds for the way in which he introduced the bill <e> <s> i shall say something about the special cases that he mentioned <e> <s> i am glad to have the opportunity to raise the problems arising from the bill on the floor of the house and to be able to draw them to the attention of the select committee <e> <s> the problems to which i should like to refer affect of the petitioners against the bill those who are represented by rees and freres <e> <s> they are each concerned with one or more of the arches beneath the railway line between blackfriars station and holborn viaduct station <e>", "<cs> my lords to set the record straight i did have an informal conversation with the noble lord lord marshall as soon as i knew that he was taking the bill <e> <s> i have implied that i am very much an amateur in this field and the noble lord and i know that the various sides have been having informal negotiations <e> <s> therefore there would be absolutely no point in me as a relative amateur in that field joining in very technical discussions concerning property and redevelopment <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord speak in detail to those later amendments or has he already made his main speech <e>", "<cs> i make a few remarks on this amendment because i was involved with the issue of retrospection at the earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> briefly i am grateful to the noble lord lord northfield and the abpi for the amendments before us <e> <s> it is important that normal practice as regards retrospection has now been accepted and the time scale of the effect of this bill is now clear on the face of it and we should be grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i missed the opportunity to speak on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> may i speak on amendment no <e> <s> in relation to what the noble lord has said as i have been involved in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his comprehensive answer although i am afraid it has not satisfied me <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for having put his name to the amendment indicating support <e> <s> i have not tried to get up a huge bicycle lobby in your lordships chamber partly to save time and partly having regard to the timescale in which this bill is being discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> i said that i would not enter into arguments about the survey <e> <s> i dealt with that point in committee <e> <s> i cast doubt on what could be proved from the survey even if it went ahead successfully and on time <e> <s> what the noble lord said about providing a little space on daytime services was encouraging <e> <s> it is also encouraging that british rail was prepared to make that statement in public because it has been reticent about committing itself <e> <s> i am grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord marshall of leeds said that i intended to press my objections <e> <s> i hope that no one was led to believe by that that i intended to divide the house <e> <s> i have never given that impression no one has asked me that and it would be improper for me to do so <e> <s> the noble lord also told the house and me what kind of speech i was going to make and that i would repeat the arguments of second reading <e> <s> again that is not the case as will be seen <e> <s> i hope to make a constructive speech based on what has happened since second reading and on information that emerged in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the petitioners withdrew to fight another day <e> <s> there is no direct comparability with the whitbread case there was similarity but not direct comparability <e> <s> it was said that there was a test case partly of how whitbreads got on <e> <s> however my petitioners did not come to any agreement with the promoters <e> <s> they are coming back to fight another day <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for reminding the committee that i made a rather long speech on th february last year about retrospection <e> <s> i felt very strongly about it and i still do <e> <s> on that basis i oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> i may not have put it technically correctly but i refer to the completely free use of a patent <e> <s> when i say free i mean the sole use of a patent of a product <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have not expressed this very carefully <e> <s> i am implying that if the total length is years and the research and development by implication took four or five years then the drug has been on the market for the benefit of the company for years <e> <s> that is very different from the four to five years which we are told is an average figure <e>", "<cs> the noble lord implied that that policy of the abpi had changed since this blue document was issued <e> <s> can he confirm whether that is the case <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i wonder whether the minister can answer the final question the noble baroness lady nicol put to him about guidelines <e> <s> i served on the select committee and perhaps i may briefly refer to one answer given by mr david walley the chief witness from the department of the environment and a very good witness if i may say so <e> <s> answering on question referring to the sandford report he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to encourage the government to resist these amendments <e> <s> for some time i have spoken in this house about the aspect of pharmaceutical licences of right and i was involved in the bill to which the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down he spent most of his speech shooting the messenger of this report can he say whether he is in favour of the montefiore bill proceeding in this house because that was the impression he gave <e> <s> the report of the brightman committee gives closely reasoned arguments in respect of the defects of the montefiore bill <e> <s> therefore the noble lord lord houghton and his supporters were right to refer the bill to a select committee and in their wisdom the house and the government have come to the right conclusions through the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether those people not represented on the working party will be encouraged to make submissions on their particular aspects of knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies i must say that i listened with great <e>", "<cs> my lords given the fact that the government have rightly emphasised the international nature of the work in which this ship will be involved does the noble viscount agree that it would not be particularly embarrassing not to have a british ship especially given finnish experience in building international and specialist ice ships <e>", "<cs> i have put my name to amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to speak in support of most of these amendments <e> <s> my amendment draws the line after the first and second division clubs and will therefore exclude the third and fourth division clubs <e> <s> in my opinion it is not a wrecking amendment it is a reasonable balance to draw in terms of sheer practicality <e> <s> i believe that that is likely to make the scheme work and enable the scheme to solve more problems than it will create <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene briefly to help the noble viscount <e> <s> the reason why we have the limited exemptions in the amendment that we are discussing is that they were recommended in the working party document <e> <s> there is some rationality behind the limited exemptions that the government offer <e> <s> we cannot have an either/or situation <e> <s> we are trying to meet up with the real world and deal on a common sense basis <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord harris of greenwich said i have put my name to this amendment <e> <s> i fully support his very forceful speech and also the speech we have just heard <e> <s> i have a few brief remarks to make <e> <s> i have been reading the report stage of the bill and a speech of the noble lord lord hesketh <e> <s> it seems to me that he was trying not to deter the clubs from using the machinery of appeal by making it simple <e> <s> in my opinion the machinery of appeal is being made far too simple for the clubs and a balance is being struck in the wrong way <e> <s> i hope if that is the case that the noble lord will redress the balance <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister gives his answer perhaps i may make this point <e> <s> i believe that he said in his opening that he would speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not sure whether that is in the grouping on the list and whether amendment no <e> <s> a would also be included <e> <s> if he wants to refer to emergencies perhaps when he replies he can say slightly more about the nature and degree of the emergency to which he refers and what is in the mind of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is attached to this amendment <e> <s> i reinforce everything that the noble lord lord graham has said <e> <s> i believe that people outside the house will be interested to know whether as regards the testing of the scheme the minister can tell us what timescale he has in mind <e> <s> i believe that question to be important for many people outside the house <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble earls lord halsbury and lord lauderdale <e> <s> i refer to the guidelines in the latest report of the interim licensing authority <e>", "<cs> they have been in use for some considerable time <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that amendments nos <e> <s> and have been grouped with this amendment <e> <s> however she does not appear to have replied to

reasonable reply to the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord robertson <e> <s> the question was debated and the answer was given by the noble lord lord walton earlier this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i cannot see how the noble duke arrives at that figure <e> <s> however if he will disseminate those figures publicly it would be very useful to see the results <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak on this amendment but perhaps this will assist the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i understood that the question of licences was not simply black or white that a person is either given a licence or fails to be given a licence <e> <s> i thought a person was licensed for a particular activity <e> <s> when the noble lord refers to treatment i suggest that not all people applying for licences will do so for the purposes of treatment <e> <s> they might be given licences for other reasons <e> <s> so a diversity of people with different requirements might apply for licences <e>", "<cs> i do not want to take up the time of the committee further <e> <s> the ministers explanation is useful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i briefly follow up the line taken by the noble earl
