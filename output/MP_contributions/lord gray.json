["<cs> i welcome the governments introduction of this amending bill as did the noble lord lord ross of marnock when he spoke at second reading on tuesday night although he went on to give it what i think might fairly be termed a rather cavalier reception <e> <s> since listening to the noble lords second reading speech i have taken the trouble to read and re-read the report of proceedings in another place to which he referred in the context of the questions to which the answers he has quoted were given and <e>", "<cs> my lords while joining in the welcome for the reassuring nature of my noble friends reply may i question him in particular about the west coast lines which are my local lines <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether he is aware that there has been considerable rumour and public speculation lately that the oban line may be scheduled for closure and even the mallaig <e> <s> would he not agree that it is vital that an early decision should be reached by british rail and if the government are to intervene will he take that point on board <e>", "<cs> i do not want to rehearse arguments that have been gone over already but i should like however to make two points in support of the amendment <e> <s> firstly it has been referred to but i do not think quite in the way that i would have referred to it that if the government are to ratify and do ratify the bonn and the berne conventions we have been told that it will carry with it a commitment to legislate in this field <e> <s> but equally it has not been pointed out that those conventions refer to other matters and to birds fauna and flora on land as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a matter of principle here which as has been suggested at this hour of the night and in respect of this particular amendment perhaps we had best dispense with now <e> <s> it is a very real one and i think it is something that this house ought to return to in due course <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord hughes withdraws his amendment <e> <s> i should like to make two comments <e> <s> first the question regarding repair is surely covered by maintenance at the very beginning of the clause <e> <s> secondly i would say to my noble and learned friend that perhaps when considering this matter he could look at whether the words used adequately cover the powers in clause concerning the closing and stopping up of roads in so far as they are in part apparently vested in local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this series of amendments <e> <s> faced with the obscentity of the increasing traffic in drugs i think that we have a clear <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble and learned friend will look favourably upon the amendment <e> <s> whatever comes about it is important that this should at least be within the armoury of the bill <e>", "<cs> i cannot see that any disclosure of identities as has been mentioned is involved <e> <s> since surely the multiplier will have been fixed the person who is running the home is responsible for the payment of any charge <e> <s> surely this covers the twin points that have been made <e>", "<cs> is it possible that the point made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock can be met under the terms of clause <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i was surprised to find two separate definition clauses in the bill and of the items in clause duplicated in clause <e> <s> so far as i can see apart from matters referred to in lines to all are duplicated except for one problem which is left over <e> <s> i refer to the definition of year at clause which states <e>", "<cs> in clause line we have a definition which reads <e>", "<cs> in view of the comments that have been made about the possible effects of the community charge upon the student body in scotland and on the institutions which they will attend i should like to ask my noble friend whether he can answer one question and comment upon one point which i should like to make <e>", "<cs> since i employ no one i have no personal interest to declare <e> <s> however i am of course familiar with the agricultural circumstances which in particular have given rise to this amendment <e> <s> i recognise the weight of the arguments deployed by my noble friend lady saltoun in moving it <e> <s> however i am not fully persuaded that the special arrangements set out in the amendment should be made <e> <s> in part this is because of the many diverse groups of employers and employed which as has already been pointed out would be caught up under the provision of the amendment as drafted <e>", "<cs> there is one small point that i should like to raise <e> <s> i wonder what will happen to properties that are at present unfit for habitation and are awaiting repair or renovation <e> <s> it is a process that often takes quite a long time to complete when it involves obtaining planning permission and putting in electricity supplies and so on <e> <s> my reading of the bill suggests that those properties are left in limbo <e>", "<cs> not for the first time in our scrutiny of this bill we are faced with a passage which requires a remarkable degree of mental agility on the part of the reader before it becomes comprehensible <e> <s> i want to direct my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> rather than to the two which i understand are linked with it <e> <s> i am in some sympathy with amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> my interest is in the drafting of subsection and the inclusion of the words sole or main in it <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises a valid point for the reasons that have already been given <e> <s> i notice that clause provides for two prescriptions <e> <s> i hope that in addition to the other points we have mentioned the government will be careful to try to ensure that throughout scotland the forms are the same <e>", "<cs> while i am sympathetic to the spirit of the amendment i find the words as they are printed on the marshalled list unacceptable <e> <s> i shall direct my remarks to paragraph a in particular but in passing i mention that as paragraph b is worded i would receive a per cent <e> <s> rebate of my community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first thank my noble friend lord dundee and through him my noble friend the minister for the amendments which insert the word financial before the word year <e> <s> i suppose the lights went out at the shock of hearing the government accept amendments simultaneously from a back bencher albeit such comparatively insignificant drafting ones <e> <s> this series of amendments fully meets the point i made at committee stage <e> <s> it makes the effective sections and paragraphs absolutely clear as to what is meant by year and in consequence makes the bill more readable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is no meeting of minds between my noble friends lord campbell of croy and lord glenarthur on this point <e> <s> i had understood the amendment whether or not it is drafted correctly to intend to import into the bill the actual definition of domestic subject which is contained within clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise a drafting point <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend the minister would take note of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for readily accepting what is a very miniscule drafting amendment <e> <s> i put it down only because it brings this particular phrase into line with other phrases in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i patently have no support from any part of the house <e> <s> i am surprised that i have to make this journey back to clause <e> <s> however i have confidence in my noble friend lord dundee and am prepared to accept his explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if the noble viscount <e> <s> lord thurso takes a little exploratory trip through the bill he will find that the authority to whom he will pay will be the regional authority and that the district council will be absorbed into the charge which is levied on him <e> <s> he has to pay only one authority <e>", "<cs> my lords living very close to inveraray i must take slight issue with the noble lord lord morton of shuna on behalf of my most noble friend the duke of argyll about the fire <e> <s> the noble lord has produced a red herring which is simply not appropriate tonight or at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords when we debated in committee an amendment identical to amendment no <e> <s> i ab i explained that while i was sympathetic to the principle i found the wording unacceptable because it was drawn so widely that it would give rebate entitlement to many who were certainly not genuine crofters <e> <s> that remains my position <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and with the leave of the house i agree that the provision under the act was mandatory <e> <s> but it was subject to certain conditions <e> <s> one condition was that the person living in the house was engaged primarily in carrying on or directing agricultural operations on those lands and heritages or was employed as an agricultural worker thereon <e> <s> in other words he must obtain the main source of his income therefrom <e> <s> in respect of the noble lords comment and the remarks of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie the act extended within the crofting counties to lands and heritages situated within the counties to which that act applied being lands or heritages the area of which did not exceed acres or the rent of which did not exceed a year <e> <s> i merely enter that in the record for clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that as i was probably responsible for the problem which has arisen with the drafting in having caused the government to make amendments to this part of clause perhaps i should join the list and suggest that a should read <e>", "<cs> my lords having been so generously mentioned by my noble friend lord glenarthur perhaps i should say a few words <e> <s> i should like to associate myself with some of the remarks that have been made about the difficulties that will have to be faced in coping with the administrative tasks set by this bill as were mentioned by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i am grateful for the concessions and the understanding that we have received from the government especially on rebates to which my noble friend lord campbell of alloway referred <e>", "<cs> took the oath <e>"]
