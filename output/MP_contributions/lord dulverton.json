["<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to give the house the figures for planting by the private foresters over the same period as those covered by the question that is from until the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the widely accepted fact that past government actions have been mainly responsible for this very serious fall-off in private planting can my noble friend assure the house that the present government will take steps to restore the confidence and thus also to regenerate a high level of activitity in the private sector of forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall be careful not to detain your lordships <e> <s> however i should like to say how grateful i am to those who have taken part in this debate and especially to the minister who has taken as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has just said such infinite trouble to answer the enormous number of points that were raised during the course of the debate <e> <s> i very much enjoyed like other noble lords the maiden speeches of my noble friend lord gibson-watt and the noble viscount lord devonport who i see has had to leave the chamber <e> <s> i was glad to hear my noble friend lord gibson-watt inveighing against the bracken and commons of wales and i was interested to hear the views of the noble viscount lord devonport as a landscape architect and one who has studied the integration of hill-farming and forestry so carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to add my voice to that of the noble lord lord beaumont in expressing gratitude and congratulations to the noble lord lord northfield for the persistence with which he has engineered this bill through your lordships house twice already and now though in truncated form we hope for a third time <e> <s> we who are interested in the welfare of the deer of britain are immensely grateful to lord northfield for this and we must express our gratitude also to mr john parr who has been steering this bill through another place not without considerable work and great difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i take him up on one point that he mentioned earlier <e> <s> he said that the british deer society was the main promoter of the bill and was behind it <e> <s> the society is a charity and it is conceivable that the charity commissioners would think that we in the society had been acting improperly in dabbling in political affairs <e> <s> will the noble lord accept that in fact the situation is that a number of people who probably have been members of the deer society have been considerably active behind the scenes in assisting him in preparing the bill <e>", "<cs> in welcoming the whole of the amendment of my noble friend i would spring up for a moment if i may in defence of the goldeneye <e> <s> it has been said that it does not deserve all that much protection but there is a particular point which was briefly referred to earlier by one speaker <e> <s> as was said there are only a very few of them breeding in this country <e> <s> none of them ever did breed in this country until years ago <e> <s> they are rather peculiar though not unique as being ducks which nest in holes in trees <e> <s> i think there were or pairs nesting successfully here in the british isles during this last breeding season and something less than young birds were reared and fledged <e> <s> it would be the most awful pity if any of those birds got shot during the winter season because if we value having another breeding bird among our native species and most of us do every one of those home-bred birds that is shot will lessen the chances of their coming back and spreading the establishment of a healthy and hopefully one day quite large breeding population of goldeneye <e> <s> so i would put in a particular plea for them <e>", "<cs> i rise as a simple countryman with some experience of both these birds <e> <s> i do not think you can bracket the stock dove with the great black-backed gull <e> <s> i do not propose to say anything about the stock dove <e> <s> it is certainly not a pest in my part of gloucestershire or the parts of scotland i know well <e> <s> the black-backed gull is an entirely different matter <e> <s> it is not only in the highlands of scotland <e> <s> they are art extremely strong bird and they are most voracious <e> <s> it has been said that they will occasionally kill a weakling lamb <e> <s> they will not only do that but if a hill ewe gets cast for any reason the great black-backed gull will come down and peck out her eyes while she is still alive <e> <s> that has been known in many cases <e> <s> it is a completely different kettle of fish if i may mix my metaphors from the dove <e> <s> they are the most voracious bird and they do not only live in scotland <e>", "<cs> while having some sympathy with my noble friend in what he has just said may i say that the pine marten can climb fences of whatever height <e>", "<cs> i should like to rise momentarily to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> on this occasion i speak on behalf of the british deer society who have experience of the most fearful occasions of deer being maimed <e>", "<cs> it may be a very great sport but it is also a very fine weapon in the hands of the salmon poacher in scottish rivers <e> <s> i would suggest that in considering the point raised by my noble friend the duke of atholl it might be a good thing to consider banning these underwater weapons in fresh waters <e>", "<cs> may i add to those words from various sides of the committee and urge my noble friend on the front bench to deal sympathetically with this amendment <e> <s> we have been sympathetic to the badger amendment and after all the noble lord lord northfield did on a previous occasion get the approval of this chamber to the measures he is now proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down would he accede that there was possibly a slip of the tongue in referring to deer fencing when he said it cost a pound a yard <e> <s> i believe it costs a yard <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for one very brief moment <e> <s> the report which the noble lord lord taylor has been talking about was one to which i myself referred earlier before he was able to be here but i called it by a different name <e> <s> he was quite right in saying that it was carried out by edinburgh university but it has been published by the east of scotland college of agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to back up the words of the noble viscount lord thurso and i can speak with the same sort of experience that he has had of caithness both as to western inverness-shire and as to central inverness-shire <e> <s> the hen harrier is spreading in numbers and in geographical distribution <e> <s> i am not arguing one way or the other whether or not it should be kept on schedule but you cannot pretend that in scotland today the hen harrier is a rarity <e> <s> whatever the scientific friends of the noble lord lord melchett may say or whatever investigations they are carrying out those of us who walk the hills to any extent know from personal observation that they do in fact prey very largely on grouse <e>", "<cs> my lords it seemed just now that some noble lords were taking sides against the beautiful hen harrier <e> <s> i should like to say how much i wish to support the noble lord lord melchett and my noble friend lord cranbrook in what they have just said on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords i bearing the name that i do bear always feel that i owe the house an explanation when i intervene in purely scottish affairs <e> <s> i hope to explain the reason in a moment <e> <s> at this stage i want to raise only one point and i am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for having in fact already raised it but i should like to digress on it further for not more than two minutes <e> <s> i refer to those paragraphs of schedule which relate to timber preservation orders <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking following the noble lord lord sherfield on whose sub-committee of the select committee i had the honour to serve i wish at the outset to support him in the point he made about the possibility of bringing up to date the terms of reference of the forestry commissioners <e> <s> they have wide duties wished on them by ministerial pronouncements but i support lord sherfield in hoping that suitable wording will be found i appreciate it will not be easy to find the right set of words to give the forestry commission not only the statutory duty but the authority actively to promote the understanding and practice of what i would call the good combined uses of rural land <e>", "<cs> i think i quite understand what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> that is retained but where a tree preservation order has already been declared it is much more difficult to get a felling licence <e> <s> the point i was trying to make is that timber merchants are very unlikely to want to waste time inspecting measuring and bidding for a parcel of timber which they know is under a tree preservation order because they know they may never get it in the end <e> <s> my noble friend also asked whether anybody knew of any instances where tree preservation orders were causing bad inconvenience to people in scotland and i am <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is not very often that i find myself differing from the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe with whom i have worked for many years in the world of forestry <e> <s> in giving his support to the noble baronesss amendment i think he is getting too worried <e> <s> i know he has proclaimed his interest in the house before now as chairman of a commercial forestry enterprise <e> <s> commercial as they may be they provide very good facilities for the public in many of their large forests <e>", "<cs> having connections with gloucestershire it is only right that i should briefly say that i too have been approached by at least four rural district councils in and around the forest of dean as well as by gloucestershire county council to put the case before your lordships as the noble lord lord mcnair has done and i will not attempt to better his description of the problem <e> <s> i can see that feeling on the points he has described is particularly strong <e> <s> but i also appreciate that the minister is in some difficulty over this because if he exempts if that is the right word the forest of dean from this bill what is to prevent a number of other well-known and some of them old royal forests from asking for exactly the same treatment <e> <s> i can sympathise with my noble friend in respect of the problem we are putting before him but i should not like it to be thought among my friends in gloucestershire that i had failed to stand up and state their case as i do by concurring with the words spoken by the noble lord lord mcnair <e>", "<cs> although my name appears with that of the noble lord lord taylor to the amendment i have been preceded by such an explicit speech making the argument so clear that i need not delay the committee <e> <s> i agreed with every word the noble lord said <e> <s> i must at the outset apologise on behalf of the noble lord lord sherfield whose name also appears to the amendment <e> <s> he has informed me that other urgent business has prevented him from being here had he been here he certainly would have spoken to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as another member of your lordships select committee i must briefly intervene to back up and support my noble friend lord bessborough in this debate which has thrown up such contrary attitudes towards this amendment <e> <s> i will not repeat all that he said he set out the reasons for his change of mind as it were over setting down by statute these duties of the forestry commissioners <e> <s> but i will repeat that i personally am also persuaded although having been a member of the select committee which made recommendations along these lines that it would not be right to incorporate this amendment into the bill <e> <s> i would only say as a corollary of that and my noble friend said something about my interest in trying to get integration of farming and forestry among the hills which is an interest i have been pursuing for many years that on that particular subject there is not enough being done and not enough of a lead being given by the government <e> <s> we have paid lip service to it for years and years and it is left entirely to a few individuals in the private sector to make their own attempts at doing it <e> <s> it is very important for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords having recently retired from the scottish advisory committee of the nature conservancy and also being a keen nature conservationist i have sympathy with lord mcnairs amendment and also this applies to the countryside commission aspects <e> <s> while not trying to anticipate the thoughts of the minister is it not a fact that the forestry commission are already very well aware of the need to give consideration to these factors and are as we have heard earlier in very close touch with those two bodies <e> <s> i cannot believe they would sell any important areas without consultation <e> <s> the wildlife and countryside bill reinforces the powers in these respects and this amendment is required <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt my noble friend lord dulverton never shoots foxes <e>", "<cs> in view of the assurances which my noble friend has just given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble viscount i must congratulate my noble friend lord glenarthur on his introduction of this so badly needed bill to bring the scottish deer legislation up to date <e> <s> as other noble lords have said he set it out with great clarity and we must be grateful to him for that too <e> <s> i take issue on one point only which i may as well mention now <e> <s> he said that equal damage was caused in the forests as between the red deer and the roe deer <e> <s> i would say that whereas the roe deer can be very damaging when the trees are young and not very high the red deer can go on bark stripping and causing great damage almost right through the life of the crop <e> <s> with that point in parenthesis i would return to my general feeling of a great welcome for the bill and thankfulness to my noble friend for bringing this business before us <e> <s> i hope that in the light of your lordships experience during the long passage of lord northfields deer bill now the deer act this bill will have an easier ride <e> <s> that bill took a very long time <e> <s> i thought that the noble lords speech just now was most important and very interesting <e> <s> i can only think that there can have been few occasions when noble lords sitting on both sides of the house were more in agreement than during his speech a few minutes ago <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in support of what my noble friend said in relation to returns being made to owners for the better management of deer <e> <s> i should also like to confirm what both he and my noble friend lord burton said about the growth of deer management groups throughout scotland which are being encouraged actively by the red deer commission as a means towards better control and management of deer <e> <s> i think my noble friend has a point but it may be dealt with by a subsequent amendment <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like to comment on the point made by the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> he said that i had accused him of knowing not much about deer <e> <s> if i understood him aright very recently he passed a comment to me in this house that he did not know much about them but i am not accusing him in this regard <e>", "<cs> i was diffident about interfering with the noble lord lord northfield in his amendment but there is one point i should like to place before the committee in the wording i have suggested as an alternative to the five or six words in parenthesis <e> <s> i quite take the point made by the noble lord lord northfield that the words are somewhat repetitive in their sense with the words which appear in the act <e> <s> nevertheless i would advance the suggestion to your lordships that there is some merit in them over and above those used in the act and certainly those used in parenthesis here in this bill <e>", "<cs> if the over-stocking was purely by sheep and not by deer certainly the red deer commission would not countenance the shooting of deer <e>", "<cs> i should like most emphatically to welcome the amendment of the noble lord lord northfield for the reason that he has eloquently propounded to us <e> <s> i am not greatly worried about his not including a provision on not being able to round up deer with vehicles because on the highland landscape at any rate one cannot do that <e> <s> there have been cases where deer have been rounded up by helicopter but that is another matter <e> <s> however there is one question i should like to ask <e> <s> subsection a of the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> may i add another point to what the noble viscount has just said in relation to asking my noble friend to give further thought to this with particular reference to helicopters with which we know he is expert <e> <s> i have known of cases where a helicopter has been used to move deer in not very satisfactory circumstances or for very satisfactory purposes <e> <s> on the other hand i have known them to be used very usefully in cases where red deer have somehow broken into forestry plantations in their young stage and where it is frightfully difficult to move them out again even if you take a bit of fence down by the use of men or dogs because the deer nearly always break back <e> <s> but i have known instances where a helicopter has been used most successfully in driving red deer out of a planatation to which they have just gained access <e>", "<cs> although during second reading i expressed regret that this bill could not have contained provisions for the regulation of proper weapons with which to shoot deer on further thought i have come to the conclusion that we are much better to leave it as it stands in the bill although i have the greatest sympathy with the noble lord lord northfield in his expressions <e> <s> but i hope he will accept the advice which has already come from various parts of the committee that perhpas he might leave it to the secretary of state whom the bill charges to undertake consultation with certain interested parties <e>", "<cs> i said something about this at second reading <e> <s> i am a member of the red deer commission but i speak for myself and not the commission <e> <s> i did suggest that the district council should perhaps consult the commission because the commission have a very considerable intelligence service about people who are interested in and dealing with and dabbling in venison matters <e> <s> i would therefore feel personally that the noble viscounts amendment should be supported <e>", "<cs> the amendment seems to go some way in the direction of a carcase movement book a point we mentioned on second reading and i wonder whether my noble friend lord glenarthur or perhaps the minister could give some guidance on whether that idea will be re-opened bearing in mind as i took the opportunity of telling the minister outside the chamber the other day that i can state with the authority of the chairman of the red deer commission that that commission would have liked a movement order book and the amendment goes some way towards that though not quite so far <e> <s> it is also true to say that the scottish landowners federation who have a deep interest in the bill have been asking for a carcase movement book <e> <s> perhaps my noble friends jointly or severally would be prepared to look again at the point on report <e>", "<cs> may i add to what the noble viscount said <e> <s> the shooting of red deer calves out of season can and does happen but i think you will find it is covered in the exsiting act because you are allowed to shoot out of season to prevent suffering <e> <s> i think you are covered on that clause <e>", "<cs> when all is said and done i hope that my noble friend lord glenarthur will agree that what lord northfields amendment does is to fill in the reason why the right to shoot out of season was originally granted <e> <s> it was not granted or made available simply because it was a good thing that occupiers should be allowed to shoot deer which were possibly not doing any harm at all <e> <s> it was not for that reason that it was granted <e> <s> the noble lords amendment spells out what was the reason for giving this right in the original act <e>", "<cs> what i think the noble viscount has been talking about is not quite the same as what the noble lord lord john-mackie was talking about because the forestry commission are not thinking of shooting deer in the middle of the caithness midsummer <e>", "<cs> if i may be permitted to answer the noble lord lord john-mackie he said first that the forestry commission would authorise only good shots <e> <s> in fact the bill says and i hope it means that the deer commission would have to be brought in to authorise any operators <e> <s> he went on to say that he could not see any difference between shooting roe deer and red deer at night <e> <s> i can point out a few <e> <s> for example a red deer is about five times the bulk of a roe deer <e> <s> next the red deer are confined to fairly limited areas of very sparsely populated forest whereas the roe deer are ubiquitous they are to be found all over scotland everywhere and if we have people shooting at night in some places where the roe deer are that could be very dangerous <e> <s> one will miss roe deer at night and therefore lose them in the dark <e> <s> a good shot should not do that with a red deer so there are some differences <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it will be a slur upon us british with our european neighbours if we go in for legalising roe deer shooting at night but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking after the noble lords lord todd and lord john-mackie i wish to proclaim my feeling of responsibility in following such instructed people <e> <s> under the noble lord lord sherfield i was a member of the sub-committee of lord todds committee on science and technology dealing with forestry and i had many dealings with the noble lord lord john-mackie when he was chairman of the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give the relevant figures on hardwood planting grants for the last financial year the original question of the noble countess lady mar covered five years by the forestry commission the countryside commissions and the local authorities <e> <s> can my noble friend say what proportion this figure represents of all planting grants during the year in question <e> <s> can he further say when the response of the forestry commission to the recommendations of your lordships select committee on science and technology in relation to hardwoods policy will be available <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> there will be some concern on the part of some of us that so few of these cases lead to action <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware of the scale of nest robbing of the protected raptores especially peregrines that is known to the royal society for the protection of birds and i think also to the nature conservancy council <e> <s> is he also aware that over per cent <e> <s> of peregrine nests were robbed this year in addition to those of a number of kites ospreys goshawks and eagles <e> <s> moreover does my noble friend feel that the present maximum fine when as so rarely happens the miscreant is caught is adequate when it is known that falcons can be sold for if not more <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to take up only a few minutes of your lordships time particularly because so many of the points which i felt needed to be made have already been so ably made by a number of noble lords and ladies this evening <e> <s> i rise to declare an interest which i suppose i must do having riparian interests in two rivers in scotland and a good many years ago i was at one time chairman of the river lochy district fishery board <e> <s> i also have a foot well south of the border as my name implies and i shall detain your lordships just for a moment with this thought <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the feeling of dismay in some parts of the northern highlands that the macaulay is possibly being moved to edinburgh whereas as some have noted aberdeen itself is very strong in feeling <e> <s> however i think the feeling goes much wider than aberdeen and extends throughout the northern highlands who feel that aberdeen is in touch with them and their affairs whereas edinburgh is a little remote <e>", "<cs> my lords i indeed welcome my noble friends initiative in bringing this bill before your lordships <e> <s> there can be no controversy over this measure <e> <s> it is entirely to be applauded <e> <s> my noble friend has however referred to another clause in the bill as introduced in another place and there withdrawn because of opposition <e> <s> declaring my interest as i suppose i must as president of the timber growers of the united kingdom i must offer to your lordships with your great knowledge and wisdom in matters such as this my brief comment on what that clause which was withdrawn in another place was about and also the motivation behind the challenge that caused its withdrawal <e>", "<cs> i am <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but information which i have received quite recently is that the new planting in wales last year was no more than hectares <e> <s> that will not alter the face of wales very much <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a heartfelt thank you to those noble lords and the noble baroness who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i am flattered that i was followed by two ex-chairman of the forestry commission and my noble friend lord bessborough the president of the men of the trees <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the kind remarks which all noble lords have made as well as for those of the noble baroness lady white whose love of rural wales i know full well <e> <s> i could wish that she was as keen as i might be to see

respect the thoughts he has just given us <e> <s> i regret that this should be the case as he has explained and my noble friend the minister also has explained it <e> <s> i know this to be the case but i hope that some people outside this house may somehow get to know of the support <e> <s> i led off on this matter by saying i hoped the support would be coming from all sides of the house it has done so and i hope some people will take note of it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the deep concern felt by the red deer commission and
