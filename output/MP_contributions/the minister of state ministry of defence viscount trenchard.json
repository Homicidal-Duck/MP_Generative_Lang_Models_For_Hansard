["<cs> my lords we are aware that british newspapers have carried reports about accidents to united states nuclear weapons based on information attributed to pentagon officials <e> <s> there has never been a nuclear weapon accident involving the release of fissile material in the united kingdom and we are satisfied with the precautions taken to avoid such incidents <e> <s> british observers will be present at the exercise in nevada in april <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have noted this report <e> <s> the united kingdom ballistic missile early warning station at raf fylingdales has been alerted to such alarms and have been able to help in verifying errors <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i should like to repeat a statement made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence this afternoon in another place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the government remain determined to improve both conventional and nuclear forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord is referring to the planned deployment of united states ground-launched cruise missiles at raf greenham common berkshire and raf molesworth cambridgeshire <e> <s> my noble friend lord strathcona made clear in the house on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords a new building will be constructed at the atomic weapons research establishment at aldermaston to replace existing facilities for processing nuclear materials <e> <s> it is hoped that it will be completed in the late s <e> <s> contracts have not yet been let and it has been the practice of successive governments not to disclose detailed costs related to the defence nuclear programme <e> <s> the new facility is part of the continuing programme of replacement and improvement of the existing but ageing capital facilities at aldermaston needed to maintain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that without details of the numbers of men their roles and equipment and the additional nuclear capability which the noble lord envisages it is very difficult to answer the question in specific terms <e> <s> in order to deter the russians from starting a war we need to possess a range of capabilities from conventional forces the theatre nuclear weapons and ultimately to our strategic deterrent <e> <s> our aim is to provide balanced forces capable of meeting the threat at every level <e> <s> i should like to stress that i regard the planned replacement of our polaris force with the trident system as a highly cost-effective way of maintaining deterrence <e> <s> but i also agree with the noble lord about the importance of our manpower resources and we have increased the size of the regular armed forces by and the volunteer reserves by since we came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords all firm commitments will be honoured <e> <s> however the need to keep defence expenditure within cash limits for has necessitated our deferring some expenditure and improvements <e> <s> a policy of severe restraint on all but essential maintenance is being applied to works expenditure <e> <s> we have deferred the introduction of an improved assisted house purchase scheme and an arrangement to permit servicemen to purchase surplus married quarters at a discount <e> <s> we have however fully confirmed our commitment to maintaining the pay of the forces at a level comparable to their counterparts in civilian life <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not our practice to give details of this kind nor is it possible to calculate meaningful proportions <e> <s> activity in all three services has been reduced leading to some loss of operational training <e> <s> in some areas activity has been cut in others it has been maintained at or about normal <e> <s> levels of training will not be cut below those required for essential operational efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords the armed forces already have a few assisted house purchase schemes <e> <s> as my predecessor explained in the defence debate on rd december however the need to keep defence expenditure within its cash limit has meant that proposed improvements to these schemes will not be introduced as quickly as we would have wished <e>", "<cs> my lords mr brown did not disclose any official information which was not already public knowledge <e> <s> he took part in the programme having been refused official permission to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords technically the neutron bomb raises no new issues of principle <e> <s> it is as the noble viscount observes only a variant of nuclear weapon design with special characteristics which offers one possible way of enhancing natos ability to deter a massive russian armoured attack on western europe <e> <s> but it is understandable that any new nuclear weapon of whatever kind should be a matter of public concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the trident i missile like the polaris missile is a submarine launched inertially guided ballistic missile <e> <s> it differs in that it is larger feet longer and inches wider has three rocket motor stages compared with two and has a range of nautical miles with a full payload compared with <e> <s> it is designed to carry up to eight independently targetable warheads compared with the three warheads in polaris which are not independently targetable <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear in the debate in the house on th february we have studied this option carefully but to run on polaris would be very costly <e> <s> we would need to buy extra missiles with new motors and with the chevaline modification <e> <s> if they were to last into the next century they could well cost us more than trident missiles <e> <s> new polaris submarines would be unlikely to be cheaper than trident submarines <e> <s> the alternative of continually refitting the old submarines would from our experience be impracticable into the next century and would run the real risk of our being unable to maintain the continuous deterrent patrol <e> <s> in short it would be a dubious economic proposition for a force which would be likely to be ineffective in the longer-term <e>", "<cs> my lords these old army quarters are currently surplus to mod requirements <e> <s> they cannot be sold because they are situated within army barracks adjacent to a training area <e> <s> up to of the quarters will need to be demolished shortly as the site is required for buildings to meet our immediate operational needs <e> <s> we are still exploring any appropriate possibilities for the remainder <e> <s> we are in touch with the kennet <e>", "<cs> my lords a review of the royal navys requirement for a replacement for the sea king helicopter is now nearing completion <e> <s> should this confirm the projected anglo-italian eh aircraft as the preferred option it will be necessary for the united kingdom and italy jointly to conduct a detailed study into the feasibility of a collaborative solution to the respective requirements of their navies <e> <s> preparations for such a study have been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords planned expenditure on territorial army man training days will be higher in real terms in than but we are having to impose restrictions as part of the measures to contain expenditure on the defence budget <e> <s> i am aware of the concern felt within the ta about the possible effects but i do not expect adverse effects on training and efficiency nor on the ability of the ta to perform its operational role <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet received a copy of the report of the united states general accounting office but from contacts with american officials we are confident that by which is the planned in-service date any remaining problems will have been resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministry of defence including all its experts are responsible to the secretary of state who answers to parliament for defence matters <e> <s> he has given information on the cost estimates of trident on several occasions as i have also in this house <e>"]
