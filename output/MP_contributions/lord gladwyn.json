["<cs> my lords i have always found it rather difficult to compose a speech on this particular occasion <e> <s> it is customary i think to refer in two or three sentences to some of the most appalling problems which now confront not only the world but our unfortunate government so i imagine that some kind of <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody knows that the formal powers of the new european parliament cannot so far as this country is concerned be increased unless they are approved by all nine countries and by all nine governments <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government really think that as realists it is possible for the soviet government to abide by the non-binding obligations in respect of human rights of helsinki <e>", "<cs> my lords first i too would wish to congratulate the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal on confining his remarks from the front bench to i think minutes a notable performance <e> <s> i myself propose to speak for a little longer than the noble lord lord peart but i hope not to exceed a quarter of an hour by very much <e> <s> once again i propose to confine my remarks to the general strategy of our defence on which after all our future may well depend <e> <s> it was essentially because they had a defective defensive strategy that the french were overwhelmed in <e> <s> it was because theirs was almost equally unsound that the russians were very nearly vanquished in <e> <s> yet both the french and the russians are nations with a great military tradition and both had the benefit presumably of the advice of great military experts <e> <s> are we sure therefore that we ourselves have found the right way to avoid possible defeat in the years to come <e> <s> is our present strategy the right one <e> <s> i am afraid that despite the classical thesis developed by the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal i have considerable doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches would like to welcome the statement which so far as it goes as the noble lord who has spoken has said is impeccable <e> <s> but would the government not recognise that our efforts to get our contributions to the central budget reduced are slightly impeded by the fact that in as i understand it we entered into a financial mechanism which was based on the balance of payments of the various countries <e> <s> of course our own balance of payments now thanks to north sea oil which perhaps was not appreciated in makes it difficult for us to use that particular argument <e> <s> so i suppose our argument must be based simply on equity and i imagine that is what the government are now going to do <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government ruled out any possible consideration of the construction of a channel bridge <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt rightly the noble lord does not like machinery but might it not be desirable for the nations represented at the tokyo summit to appoint some committee of deputies or officials simply to follow up the decisions taken there and to see whether it might be desirable to have another summit conference on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be counter-productive to bring this matter before the security council when to do so would simply encourage the soviet union to apply its veto <e> <s> would it not be much more sensible by all means in our power to get them to attend this unofficial non-security council meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the leader of the house whether he believes that this is a matter which can be suitably dealt with in a question and answer period <e> <s> is it not really something which can be dealt with only by an unstarred question or a short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that it might be better for the younger pupils in our schools to be taught the multiplication tables at least before getting on to computer techniques <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo every word which the noble lord lord alport has so eloquently said and more especially if and i hope that they will not do so the government insist upon pursuing what i think is a thoroughly reactionary line <e> <s> i hope they will at least make provision for a very adequate hardship fund which was not the case previously <e> <s> once again we discuss the condition of overseas students in this country and once again as chairman of the united kingdom council for overseas students affairs ukcosa and a patron of the council for education in the commonwealth i should like to emphasise as indeed the noble lord lord alport emphasised that by and large these students represent a great potential asset to this country not only because of the many millions of pounds perhaps now about million they spend here annually thus assisting naturally our balance of payments but also because of the evident advantage to us of their making propaganda in favour of britain when they return to their own lands that is to say of course if they have been happy here during their stay <e> <s> to these advantages and this is something which i do not think the noble lord lord alport pointed out but which is very <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not recognise that these students bring in a great deal of money to this country <e> <s> is that not to be set off against the account <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that the majority of students from poor countries come from rich families <e>", "<cs> my lords we fully recognise the validity of what the foreign secretary said about the new situation which has undoubtedly been created by the formation in zimbabwe-rhodesia of a government with large black participation <e> <s> but however much we may all want to see a generally recognised government established in zimbabwe-rhodesia which will bring the present appalling conflict to an end we liberals anyhow believe that in practice this is likely to happen only when and if it is demonstrated that the new rgime will fairly shortly be controlled by blacks and not in effect run by whites behind the scenes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought mr smith had said that he was in charge as a kind of commander-in-chief <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the government have turned down the possible employment of cruise missiles as substitutes for the renewal of our polaris force in years time <e>", "<cs> my lords will sir james murray have power to negotiate with the south african government or is his mission simply for information <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that this is a matter which cannot be dealt with adequately by question and answer in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords will not any substantial reduction in the overseas services of the bbc amount in effect to <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we think that the government and more especially i suggest the noble lord lord carrington are to be sincerely congratulated on the progress made on these all-important talks and particularly on obtaining general agreement on a constitution something which as i think has already been said has never been done before <e> <s> the next step obviously will be to get general agreement on how to bring the constitution into effect and how to organise the elections at which i imagine it will in effect be put before the electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely happy to be the first to be able to associate myself with everything that the noble lord lord buxton of alsa has so eloquently said <e> <s> we are told and i only hope that this may be denied by the minister who is to reply that it is the intention of the government to cut the budget of the bbcs overseas service by per cent <e> <s> that is to say by million <e> <s> such cuts if made would we understand for reasons given in the speech by lord buxton result in the services concerned being permanently suppressed <e> <s> we are also told that it is likely that the government will in the circumstances recommend the maintenance of our admirable world service and retain also those directed towards communist countries in eastern europe and perhaps also those to the arab world thereby in effect accepting the proposals which were put forward by the think tank two years ago <e> <s> that would of course mean leaving million to be recovered on the remaining services <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> i have been following the noble lords argument with attention <e> <s> i understand his argument on this that there must be some cuts in the overseas programmes of the bbc because everybody is being cut <e> <s> on the other hand it is known to all of us and indeed to the noble lord that the defence departments have been exempted altogether from any cuts <e> <s> if that is so does he totally reject the argument advanced here tonight by myself and by others i think that the overseas programmes of the bbc are in effect in the front line of defence of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government confirm that this is the first time in history that any member government of the community has ever failed to accept and immediately implement any judgment of the court <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is in order to inquire at what <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies i should like to make one point and i shall take only two minutes <e> <s> i do not think that anyone the noble lord lord trefgarne or the government generally can have any doubt as to the unpopularity in this house at any rate of the proposal to wind-up the ministry of overseas development and to absorb it into the foreign office <e> <s> there may be as he says a logical reason for doing so and i would not dispute that <e> <s> but it certainly will not be a popular move <e> <s> the fact is that they have decided to do it <e> <s> it is going to be done and although people here may protest we must grin and bear it <e> <s> if we do not like it it is something that is over the bridge and we must recognise that it is going to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> may i ask her whether she is aware that the findings of this conference which no doubt she has read seem to be broadly speaking acceptable to all those responsible for higher education in this country <e> <s> therefore may i respectfully ask her also whether the government would agree to give a detailed reply to the arguments advanced by the conference in this paper so that we may all know the precise reasons for the assumption which has just been made an assumption without any good reasons supporting it apparently that the students are in reality now being subsidised by the state to any extent whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will be kind enough to read this report she will see that that is simply not so <e> <s> indeed the arguments that can be advanced against that assumption seem overwhelming <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness not agree that this is not an economy at all that it is the reverse of an economy <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to be associated with the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts in welcoming this very important and extremely satisfactory statement on the part of the government <e> <s> i must say that a month or two ago few people in this country thought that the noble lord lord carrington would get as far he has <e> <s> the fact that he has got as far as this seems almost to be approaching a miracle <e> <s> if he brings it off he deserves the congratulations of the entire nation <e> <s> it is quite true that there is now one outstanding point which is very difficult and which is of course the cease-fire and the arrangements for monitoring it <e> <s> we can only hope that with the arrival of president kaunda some kind of formula will be found at this stage <e> <s> perhaps we may even hope that it will be fairly soon <e> <s> of course everything else depends on that <e>", "<cs> my lords what my right reverend kinsman has so eloquently said in opening this debate will i think carry conviction with a great number of people who have the welfare of the nation at heart <e> <s> it is an excellent thing and i am sure we would all agree that he has brought it to our attention at this rather critical moment in our national affairs <e> <s> but even if all his arguments are accepted in principle as i believe they should be everything will in practice depend on what results from an expert examination of the subject which he very properly suggests might be undertaken under the auspices of the government by the royal united services institute <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i cannot agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> i think that if there were a serious nuclear war we would all be in the next world and it would not really be relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords we too welcome most warmly the important statement which has been made by the noble lord lord carrington <e> <s> it appears to be rather more hopeful than we had expected from a diligent perusal of the daily press <e> <s> i hope that impression is justified i think it probably is <e> <s> it seems that there are some substantial points still to be negotiated with the patriotic front <e> <s> however it is also clear that the noble lord believes there is every reason to suppose that they will be cleared up in the next few days i think he will probably say whether or not that is so and that thereafter there will only be minor points <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government not agree that in the event of general nuclear war the damage done would be completely irreparable that most of us would be in the next world and that therefore it is surely impossible to guard against this <e> <s> on the other hand is there not a considerable case for trying to organise some kind of defence a home guard if you like against the possible use of paratroopers in a conventional war in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like first of all to express our good wishes to the noble lord lord soames and to lady soames on their departure for this very difficult mission <e> <s> i am sure also that we can all agree that it is a very remarkable achievement on the part of the foreign secretary and his very able team of advisers to have got almost to the point at which there is a final agreement on a cease-fire which in itself would represent a successful end to the long-drawn-out negotiations that a few months ago few of us thought would have a happy ending <e> <s> it seems that the foreign secretary has practically no doubt that what he calls the final details of the cease-fire will be agreed tomorrow or at the latest the day after and we must all hope that his optimism will be justified <e>", "<cs> my lords once <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but why should a shrewd hong kong merchant however rich he may be who wants to send his son to the best university choose a course at a university here when he could equally send his son to america where he would receive a better technical education for half the price <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will certainly not be surprised to learn that we on these benches warmly welcome this nato decision since the parliamentary liberal party has already expressed its approval while accompany <e>", "<cs> my lords would the possibility of stationing them on camouflaged merchant ships be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords after that rather long interchange we come back to the subject of rhodesia <e> <s> as i see it it is a great pity that we cannot make our approval of this bill the occasion for expressing our gratitude to the government and indeed to all those who have assisted them in the recent negotiations including the commonwealth secretariat for having achieved a very remarkable settlement at least setting the stage for the possible emergence of a new and viable state out of the chaos and misery of a long civil war <e> <s> for this settlement is after all not yet in the bag though judging from the press the government are clearly confident that it shortly will be <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate my noble friends on these benches wholeheartedly with what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> we voted for this amendment in another place <e> <s> we should like very much that the government should to some extent anyhow revise their view <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that it is not just a question of having confidence in this government that possibly one may need to have confidence in another government <e>", "<cs> my lords we naturally also greatly welcome this statement and regard it as a splendid step forward <e> <s> we share the governments hope that the conclusion of a cease-fire agreement will give us a prospect of what we all hope will be a lasting peace <e> <s> we note however that we must still await formal signature even though this appears as i understand it to be practically certain <e> <s> my lords beyond once more congratulating the noble lord lord carrington and all those associated with him there is not much more that we can say now over and above the things which have already been said <e> <s> the way is now practically clear for lord soames to be able to deploy all his great diplomatic skill and all his innate authority in order to get everybody into line <e>", "<cs> my lords the point about good faith <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good that the noble earl lord kimberley should have succeeded in arranging for us to discuss what i believe to be the all important and even overriding question of our strategic nuclear deterrent and that we should be concentrating this evening on that issue alone <e> <s> usually it gets mixed up with such things as pensions the territorial army the highland regiments armoured personnel carriers or even the uniform for the brigade of guards in a debate on a general defence review which is unsatisfactory <e> <s> the real debate on nuclear weapons of course outside closed government circles is conducted not here but in learned journals in specialised groups and institutes and even occasionally in the quality press <e> <s> the general public regard it as a sort of impenetrable mystery unless of course they are pacifists in which case they are just against all nuclear weapons on ideological grounds <e>", "<cs> i said billion and in all probability much more should be devoted for the most part to the improvement of our so-called conventional forces that is to say new tanks new antitank and anti-aircraft weapons adequate reserves of munitions which is most important new aircraft new patrol vessels and new hunter killer submarines <e> <s> the reasons for this conclusion which must given the time limits imposed on our debate tonight be severely compressed i will now give <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and to the house for not having been in my place for the first minute or two of the noble lords speech <e> <s> i am afraid that i did not realise that the previous debate was to be over so soon <e> <s> i had been assured that it would go on <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not obvious that the soviet action in afghanistan has made ratification of the salt ii treaty by the senate virtually impossible <e> <s> therefore is it not unfortunately also obvious that in default of <e>", "<cs> my lords if we really want to assist the developing countries would it not be desirable for europe as a whole to go slow as regards the production of sugar <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the liberal party is firmly of the opinion that spending or million on the renewal of our so-called independent strategic deterrent is a complete waste of money and that this view is now shared by many responsible and independent people in all parties <e>", "<cs> my lords while not dissenting from the governments intention to restore diplomatic relations to a normal level as the phrase is after all if we have relations with totalitarian states on one side of the iron curtain it does not seem to make much sense not to have them with similar states on the other side which also violate human rights i should like to make one point which is more or less the point made by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> if we are rightly informed part of the reason for withdrawing our ambassador was the strange disappearance of a mr bosier a british businessman with a chilean mother <e> <s> he was as we believe on his way back to britain from chile when he was spirited away by the chilean police and detained because of the political activities of his sister <e> <s> an eyewitness has since said that he was subjected to torture <e> <s> mr bosiers case was reopened in april since when i believe we have had no further information <e> <s> do not the government think that they might make it a condition of restoring full diplomatic relations at least to be given information regarding mr bosiers whereabouts and perhaps that the torturers if there were torturers should be brought to justice <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to associate ourselves broadly speaking with what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts said subject to this generally speaking we feel that the progress so far made in the implementation of the cease-fire and in preparation for the coming elections is remarkable <e> <s> it might have been so very much worse <e> <s> there have been incidents but they have not been extremely grave and there is good reason now to suppose that the elections will be held on the appointed date <e> <s> however i suppose we have certain criticisms we always have of government action and as i say i do not dissociate myself from anything that the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said <e> <s> more especially i should like to back him up on the question of the parliamentary commission <e> <s> we would unhesitatingly associate ourselves with that for the reasons which he gave <e>", "<cs> my lords is it really impossible to contemplate the despatch of a small number of british troops armed with rifles it is true but have not the monitoring forces got rifles <e> <s> it is not necessarily to engage in battles but to control the bridge <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally we on these benches associate ourselves with the expressions of regret made by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts at this regrettable incident and should like to express our sympathy for the family <e> <s> but if we look at things from the practical point of view i should imagine that it is only too likely that some kind of incident of this sort may take place again before the elections next month and i should doubt whether on every occasion on which a similar incident occurs it is necessary to put down a private notice question and interrogate the government <e> <s> we must assume and i think we can assume that the governor is doing all he can within his means and powers to <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government recognise that perhaps the best way to step up efforts for peace in europe is to recognise that dtente has now been completely undermined by the soviet government and take the necessary action <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to congratulate the foreign secretary on the really magisterial survey that he has made of the situation arising out of the soviet occupation of afghanistan and on the clear indication of his general attitude towards this monstrous aggression <e> <s> before i say anything else may i say that though i believe that detente has suffered a very severe blow naturally we would not be opposed to but in fact would favour every effort still being made to achieve some kind of agreement on arms limitation if that is possible <e> <s> but i believe that if we are realists we must recognise that the probability is that the soviet government have now found themselves strong enough to throw down the gauntlet as it were towards the west <e> <s> both the occupation of afghanistan and the exile of sakharov show that now they could not care less what the west or the united states thinks <e> <s> the soviet government believe that they are strong enough to do more or less what they like within reason dictated by other events <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not recognise that the strong probabilities are that we shall not be able to get the games transferred from moscow and that being so would her majestys government not agree that the next alternative will be to take action such as that suggested by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in order to bring such moral pressure as they can to bear on the athletes not to attend <e> <s> would they also consider the possibility of by one means or another not giving any publicity in this country to the games <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government regard it as rather a pity that this resolution of the european parliament was not apparently supported by the socialist group <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to thank the foreign secretary for repeating this important statement <e> <s> may i say at the outset and i am sure i speak for all my colleagues that we are all horrified that our allies did not side with us in the security council resolution and that we were of course entirely right not to participate in the vote <e> <s> having said that i suppose we can all agree that the governor is doing his level best to control the situation in terribly difficult circumstances <e> <s> i imagine that one of his major difficulties perhaps the foreign secretary will confirm this is that whereas the leader of one of the main parties namely mr nkomo has apparently made all the right noises and indeed has apparently succeeded almost entirely in controlling his troops <e> <s> mr mugabe though he has himself also made the right noises seems to have very considerable difficulty in restraining some of his who are obviously not under control <e> <s> i do not know what will happen in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet government must have long considered the consequences before actually taking over afghanistan <e> <s> there was clearly the thought that the continued existence of a turbulent moslem neighbour inherently resistant to what they presumably think of as the modernisation of a neighbouring country was a potential threat to the stability and security of the central asian parts of the soviet empire <e> <s> i think it almost certain that that was the main reason <e> <s> but no doubt there was also the consideration that more especially with iran in a state of turmoil there could be long-term advantage in at least getting nearer to the famous jugular vein of the west in the persian gulf though i do not feel it was the major reason <e> <s> there is little reason in any case to believe that the soviet union wants to provoke an immediate military showdown and so i think any loose talk of war is both unhelpful and misguided <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not disagree with what the noble lord says at all <e> <s> all i was saying was that we must realistically consider the matter and realise that the games are going to be held with the absence of many delegations and we should ignore them as much as we can <e> <s> that was all that i said <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government not recognise that whatever the merits or demerits of conscription there is now in this country a very large body of opinion as manifested in a recent debate in the other place in favour of the organisation of some kind of voluntary national service perhaps to start off with some extension of the territorial army <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble lord for repeating this important statement <e> <s> i think that the whole house will probably join with me in expressing great sympathy for the unfortunate governor the noble lord lord soames who is in the most difficult of all possible situations at the present time <e> <s> i imagine that the government will also agree that one of the greatest difficulties is his relative inability to control the actions of one of the most important <e>", "<cs> my lords while naturally we would associate ourselves with what the foreign secretary has just said about the desirability of supporting lord soames in the action he has taken to cope with the dreadful situation with which he is confronted we should like nevertheless to associate ourselves broadly speaking with what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said <e> <s> more especially i should like to ask this question if i may if the inquiry into the recent incident when two members of the rhodesian army were apparently blown up opposite a church results in it being established that they were members of the selons scouts engaged in planting a bomb what action will the governor be expected to take <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble lord for making this statement <e> <s> it is difficult at first glance to grasp all the implications of this complicated subject but am i right in thinking that the general aim is as follows a larger proportion perhaps a far larger proportion of our aid is now to be devoted to tied aid directed towards the poorer members of the commonwealth with greater provision than now exists for protecting and advancing not only our own commercial but also our own political interests <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government agree that the maintenance of vat on theatres at its present high rate will certainly result in a considerable diminution in the numbers of plays and their performances in london and consequently in a considerable reduction in the number of tourists visiting this country and therefore that the treasury are likely to lose more on the swings than they gain on the roundabouts <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord explain to the house how a basket can provide an aegis <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches would like to thank the noble lord for making this most important statement <e> <s> we would also like to express if we may our admiration for the incredible success of the policy of the noble lord in this matter generally <e> <s> as the government are i think aware the liberal party has throughout regarded mr mugabe as the most likely choice for leader of the people of zimbabwe <e> <s> now that he has been so nominated would they not agree that while he is undoubtedly a socialist like so many of our friends on my left in the house here there is no particular reason more particularly in the light of the public statements he has made during and subsequent to the election to regard him as so to speak a marxist-leninist in other words a supporter of some kind of totalitarian regime <e> <s> is it not more likely that as a highly intelligent politician he will assume that politics is the art of the possible and do his best therefore to induce the white community to accommodate themselves to the new regime in which though no doubt deprived as they may be of certain privileges they will still be able to enjoy a good life in the new republic <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the present issue of <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble with these splendid reports and there are not many copies availablethis one is very bulky and has been duplicated but not printed rather like the mountainous productions of royal commissions is that governments rarely pay much attention to them <e> <s> in saying this i am not referring to spierenburg the adoption of which or otherwise is almost entirely the affair of the commission itself rather than of governments beyond saying that spierenburgs recommendations all of them appear to me to be very reasonable and i do not propose except in one respect to comment on them further <e> <s> what normally gives rise to these wide-ranging reports is that governments in this case the nine governments of the community get into difficulties <e> <s> the machine clearly does not workvital decisions cannot be takenthere is much public disgust about the functioning of the community as a wholeand the ministers feel that by having recourse to a report they can put off the fatal moment when something really must be done if the community is not to break up or <e>", "<cs> my lords what do the government understand to be the declared object of this request <e> <s> is it to educate the libyans in london or what <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider sending a telegram of congratulation to the noble lord lord soames on converting president machel to the doctrine of pluralistic democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not obvious that the government should not make a statement before but after the coming meeting of the european council <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to congratulate the foreign secretary most warmly on arriving at this arrangement with his colleague from spain which is after all extremely satisfactory from every point of view <e> <s> we also accept his view that the negotiations will go on for a con <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble lord the foreign secretary for repeating this statement <e> <s> broadly speaking in principle i should like to associate myself with what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said and in addition ask two further questions <e> <s> first do not the government believe that while we shall as i think that we on these benches hope now go along with the americans in applying the measures of pressure laid down in the relevant united nations resolution if anything further is contemplated would it not be such a very grave decision that it should have to be agreed both by the european members of the alliance and the americans jointly <e> <s> will the government further agree that the real danger for the west as we see it anyhow is not so much that presented by the wretched <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest and attention to the rather long statement made by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby but having done so and in spite of the short talk i had with him earlier in the afternoon i confess that apart from his apparent desire to have a full debate on the rhodesian question before the noble lord lord soames returns to this country i am still rather at a loss to know what he is getting at <e> <s> perhaps and this may conceivably be unfair he is trying to show that a conservative government do not deserve much credit for a settlement which as he believes ought only to have been achieved by a socialist government which might among other things have backed mr mugabe to the hilt from the start though i am not sure they would have <e> <s> in any case though it was not necessarily their fault that over many years the labour government were not successful in this matter the fact remains that they were not successful and that the noble lord lord carrington admittedly with the help of the commonwealth was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the government are going to do what they can to help the new regime in zimbabwe <e> <s> there is no reason to suppose that they will not <e> <s> they are going to give aid and so on <e> <s> what else can they do <e> <s> heaven knows <e> <s> all this will be difficult enough and it is still unfortunately possible that a considerable number of zimbabwe citizens of white complexion may decide to leave believing that a country ruled by blacks is not one in which they would still enjoy a satisfactory life <e> <s> i am afraid that that is still possible <e> <s> nobody can actually blame them if they decide to get out <e> <s> many no doubt were not responsible for the quite deplorable policies which ended in a civil war and in the destruction of much of the economy and the whole countryside of zimbabwe <e> <s> indeed i would say that there is even a case for compensating some who may come out with little or no means of support more especially if part or all of their holdings in the country have been nationalised or seized <e>", "<cs> a labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless in the event of the government agreeing that there should be a two-day debate would it not be possible to say that on the first day as indeed we say on the queens speech that the debate would be largely concentrated on matters of home defence and the second on strategical matters connected with the operation of nato <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am on record as suggesting from these benches a little while ago that the time had come to apply the measures proposed in the vetoed resolution of the united nations and i am glad that this is to be the case <e> <s> however would not the government agree that necessary though these present and prospective measures are and how much we must hope that they will be successful we cannot so long as the ayatollah is in command in qom be at all optimistic that they will result in the liberation of the hostages <e> <s> therefore would not the government further agree that if unfortunately this proves to be the case any further measures of pressure presumably of a military nature would not only probably result in the murder of the hostages but would also have far-reaching results which to say the very least could only be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all thank the noble lord lord noel-baker for giving us this opportunity of debating the great speech which the late lord mountbatten made in may of last year <e> <s> i feel sure that most of your lordships like myself will undoubtedly agree in principle with everything that the noble lord lord noel-baker has said <e> <s> unfortunately the possibility of world disarmament controlled and monitored is still far away <e> <s> the limitation of armaments is nearer and in both directions but particularly in the latter we should make every effort to make progress even if we do not think it is likely to come about fairly soon <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question which arises out of a point that i made <e>", "<cs> my lords while we must thank the foreign secretary for repeating this important statement i fear <e>", "<cs> my lords even before they have made up their minds on the individual proposals made in the brandt report why cannot the government say that they favour in principle a meeting of heads of state or government in january as proposed by the french <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this paper available in the library anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to limit my remarks today to the overriding nuclear issue which is dealt with rather summarily in this voluminous and well-produced review which however and i draw your lordships attention to this should be read in conjunction with the preliminary report of the house of commons select committee on this subject which has just come out and which i must say provides some additional and rather horrifying references to deficiencies in our present defences <e>", "<cs> my lords may intervene for a moment <e> <s> i am following the noble lords argument <e> <s> as i understand it he considers that nato is pretty useless as a system of defence and that we should practically withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i never asked whether we could afford it <e> <s> i never said that <e> <s> i asked specifically how we were going to finance it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for repeating this statement and to associate myself on behalf of my noble friends on these benches with everything that the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said <e> <s> we quite agree that our relations with libya can hardly improve unless it is clear that what seems to have been the declared libyan policy of murdering libyan dissidents resident abroad has been abandoned <e> <s> unless it is made clear that they have abandoned their policy our relations can hardly improve <e> <s> indeed unless this is clear surely our relations can only deteriorate even to the extent i fear of eventual ruptured relations whatever the effect of this might be on british trade and on british residents in libya <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to say anything very relevant on this sad affair which has not already been said at very great length just the other day in another place <e> <s> hardly anybody believes judging from the debate there that the economic action which we will now take against iran will result in the immediate release of the american hostages which is presumably the object of the exercise <e> <s> moreover when we decided together with our partners in the eec to take economic sanctions on th may on the broad lines of the vetoed united nations resolution of last january it was on the implied assumption that if we agreed to this the american government for their part would not resort to forceful measures an assumption which was unjustified in the event and has to say the least complicated the issue to a very considerable extent <e>", "<cs> my lords while also thanking the foreign secretary for his reply to the question we on these benches confess that we are a little bewildered by what appears to be the sudden reversal of a policy agreed unanimously by all members of the council of ministers of the european economic community <e> <s> there is no doubt that as a result of the debate which we had last thursday rightly or wrongly the impression was created that sanctions would apply only to future contracts that is to say those concluded after the sanctions act had actually come into force <e> <s> when the fact that they would be retrospective as from th november last was announced yesterday we were surprised but given that it was the result of a unanimous decision of the council of ministers of the eec we did not protest <e> <s> however i should now like with great respect to ask a few questions of the foreign secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords is this matter on the agenda of the council of ministers of the european economic community <e>", "<cs> my lords we also should like to thank the noble lord lord carrington for making this highly important statement <e> <s> we recognise along with the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts that there are various outstanding points which will have to be cleared up in the next year or two <e> <s> we entirely recognise that <e> <s> however while entirely recognising it we liberalsunlike the official oppositionwelcome the brussels agreement wholeheartedly and we sincerely congratulate the foreign secretary to whom i may perhaps refer without any risk of being misunderstood as our everpresent help in trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord recognise that the external services in practice represent our first line of defence and that in the governments own estimation defence is excluded from the cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for repeating that statement <e> <s> following upon what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said may i take it from the statement i think it is a legitimate inference that if shortly before th july which is the date that we the french and the local government have decided will be the date for the declaration of independence for the whole of the new hebrides the island of santo is still in a state of rebellion the governments of the united kingdom and of france will take all suitable steps to suppress the revolt including if necessary physical force <e> <s> secondly is there reason to believe press reports that this revolt has been primarily fermented by financial interests in america whose chief object is to create a tax haven <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the estimate of the number of applications purely provisional <e> <s> surely there is no reason to attach undue importance to it as it may be one way or the other in a month or twos time <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that a state of anarchy now prevails in uganda <e> <s> if that is true is it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to ask the noble earl three questions <e> <s> first have the united states given us any valid explanation of why this computer failed on two occasions <e> <s> was it perhaps because faulty information was fed into it <e> <s> secondly while deploring the highly dangerous failure which might well as the noble lord lord peart said have had appalling consequences can we not derive some mild satisfaction from the fact that at least what i suppose might be called the fail-safe mechanism installed in the computer functioned within a few minutes thus revealing the error <e> <s> thirdly supposing the computer had persisted in its error must we assume that the president would have been obliged to take such retaliatory action as seemed to him desirable including if necessary ordering the use of american nuclear forces against selected targets <e> <s> if so is there not a strong case for installing a second computer which at least could be checked against the other <e>", "<cs> my lords my approach to this very difficult problem i might almost call it a dilemma which now faces this country differs rather from that of the noble lord who has just spoken for various reasons that i shall attempt to give <e> <s> for a very long time in fact since that is to say almost half a century ago i have held the view that economic sanctions cannot work unless there is a will ultimately to employ force against the country which has offended against the international community or a substantial part of it <e> <s> as the charter of the united nations contemplates there will certainly be cases in which the use of force against a country which has offended in this way is justified nobody denies that <e> <s> however i think that most people would consider that in the present case the action of the persian government however reprehensible and horrible is not such as can possibly be rectified by the use of force <e> <s> it does not in itself represent a threat to international peace and security in accordance with the words of the charter and if force were applied to rectify this enormity it would in any case be entirely counter-productive because it would immediately result in the murder of the hostages which presumably is the one thing that we find best to avoid <e>", "<cs> my lords if the matter is not going to be raised in venice will the government see to it that it is raised very urgently at the council meeting of the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for repeating that most important statement <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware we on these benches are in favour of the stationing of these missiles on british territory as part of the nato reply to the threat constituted by the soviet ss s which is already upsetting the whole balance of power on which peace in the long run depends <e> <s> we also share the view of the noble lord lord peart that the decision acceptable though it is should involve increasing pressure even greater pressure than that suggested in the statement by her majestys government on the soviet government to agree to negotiate on the whole matter of tactical nuclear weapons long-range or otherwise <e> <s> this means in practice getting on with salt and i have never been able to see why salt should necessarily have to depend on the ratification of salt <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any prospect of the formation of an afghan government in exile <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble lord for repeating this very important statement <e> <s> there will i think be general agreement in this house on the tough line taken over afghanistan <e> <s> i do not think there is any divergence of opinion on that <e> <s> i do not know whether there will be complete agreement on the suggestion in respect of inflation that resources must be shifted from government spending to the private sector and from consumption to investment <e> <s> we would agree on these benches but i imagine the statement is not necessarily in accordance with socialist policy though it seems to have been approved by chancellor schmidt <e> <s> but of course everything depends on the oil factor on the immense increase in the price of oil which is now dominating the whole situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper and in so doing i would venture if i may to draw the attention of the house to the fact that no doubt owing to my atrocious handwriting the question has not been reproduced altogether as intended <e> <s> the words towards the end of the question should not be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> however does she not in her heart of hearts agree that this cheeseparing unimaginative and unwelcoming attitude is typical of the governments whole approach to the difficult problems presented by overseas students in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all be very glad that this important matter has been raised by such a young energetic and important member of the present european parliament as the noble lord

the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord say that the liberals would be just as pleased <e> <s> of course we are very pleased with the compromise arrived at in brussels <e> <s> the liberals are delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can she tell us whether the necessary statistics will be assembled more speedily than in recent years they have been very much delayed in recent years and how the various groups will be identified <e> <s> for instance will refugees and recently arrived immigrants in this country still be counted as overseas students <e> <s> and generally what do the government plan to do as a result of the whole exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion put forward by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham raises a very large number of tremendous issues many of which have been dealt with magisterially by both the noble lord and the noble lord the foreign secretary <e> <s> i wish to associate myself and my party with what the noble lord lord stewart said about <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she thinks the example of china is something to be considered <e> <s> they are more numerous than the whole third world about which she is talking and i should have thought they were pursuing a very effective policy of keeping their millions on the land and she seems to believe in it <e>", "<cs> my lords why cannot the government consider consulting parliament on the basis of a green paper clearly setting out the various options before reaching a conclusion on this extremely important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> the liberal party have for long made it clear as i am sure your lordships are aware that they are totally opposed to the renewal of our so-called independent strategic nuclear deterrent <e> <s> the reasons will be developed fully in any debate which we may have on the subject <e> <s> i hope that it will take place before the recess if that is possible <e> <s> this therefore is not the time to rehearse the arguments except in the very briefest way <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the role played by the commonwealth in securing the independence of zimbabwe would it not be possible now to have another small commonwealth conference in order to obtain agreement on joint projects for securing the independence politically and economically <e>", "<cs> my lords may we take it that these bbc broadcasts in the persian language are monitored and that translations of them are available in the foreign office if anyone cares to consult them <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the foreign secretary for making that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords can your lordships hear now <e> <s> is that better <e> <s> we should like to thank the foreign secretary for making this statement <e> <s> clearly it is very satisfactory that the two governments have now been successful in putting down this really rather absurd rebellion on the island of santo <e> <s> can we take it that there will now be no question of the island of santo becoming a tax haven for certain american financial <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better seeing that we are to discuss this very matter in a few days time to wait till then before pressing the government for any detailed statement of their point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask whether the real question is not whether or not we have an effective veto on the firing of these missiles <e> <s> this is really a more far-reaching question than that posed by present arrangements for the employment of certain nuclear missiles on aeroplanes by americans in this country <e> <s> seeing that it is a more important question and it should be firmly established whether or not we have a veto could not the government ask the americans whether they would not in these circumstances give us the right to have a double key system despite the fact that we are not going to purchase the missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether any government have as yet announced their intention to recognise the transfer of the seat of government of israel to jerusalem and whether there is any prospect that any government will <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may explain my proposal a little further i quite realise that the brandt report is being examined by that house of commons committee <e> <s> my proposal for a joint commission would be to examine the longer-term issues and to report periodically over a period of a year or two <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene for one moment is it not a fact that the report says that this project for a transfer of resources should be largely based on taxation for instance on armaments expenditure or even on certain forms of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we will agree that the great thing is to prevent the hostilities spreading and i am sure we have the greatest confidence in the foreign secretary to do everything possible to prevent that happening <e> <s> but despite the present surplus of oil in the world generally is there not a considerable possibility and a danger that fairly shortly supplies of oil from both countries may completely dry up <e> <s> in that case would it not be desirable for the european economic community who will be particularly affected to consult together very urgently as to what they would do in those circumstances <e> <s> should not the european council or at any rate the council of foreign ministers very shortly agree if they can on a common energy policy to be adopted in this deplorable event <e>", "<cs> can we understand my lords that the brandt report will be high on the agenda for consideration at the next meeting of the select committee on foreign affairs of the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords however great the lack of

general philosophy of defence which i continue to think is something which we ought to consider from time to time <e> <s> later in the debate my noble friend lord banks will give the liberal view on foreign policy generally and will no doubt comment on the excellent speech of the foreign secretary whose remarks on europe more especially i was delighted to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been following the noble earls remarks with great attention <e> <s> is not the real dilemma not in the possession of nuclear weapons which most are agreed that we should have in view of the present situation but in whether we should find it in our conscience or whether the noble earl would do so supposing he was leading this country to use them on the first strike against aggression <e>", "<cs> on the first strike <e>", "<cs> under certain circumstances certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords at least the liberal party did not pass by a large majority a vote in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament <e> <s> there was also a considerable majority in favour of the installation of cruise missiles in this country <e> <s> the labour party was totally opposed to anything of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is to be a political secretariat which i think would be a very good thing would the foreign secretary agree that it is essential that it should be situated in one place and not migrate from one town to another <e> <s> is it not possible that such a secretariat could serve equally well the european council and the european community of foreign ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i need hardly say that we on these benches go along with the governments statement that in this matter it is essential that we should be guided by the wishes of the islanders themselves and that any eventual settlement would have to be endorsed by the islanders and by the other place and presumably by this house also <e> <s> could the noble lord indicate supposing there was a solution agreeable to the islanders for exchanging the title of sovereignty against a long lease of the islands back to the british government how exactly that would result in releasing the potential of the islands

says is basically true but general mikhail milshtein speaking in an interview in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say whether he agrees that my own long-held belief that the spending of vast sums on trident instead of on conventional arguments is a dangerous waste of money and resources is now a belief held also by the noble lords lords chalfont carver zuckerman raglan and brooks of tremorfa <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not equally desirable to consider the possibility of a world political order <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct that the general assembly under the charter has no power to give effect to its resolutions and that is one of the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the best confidence-building measure be for the soviet union to clear out of afghanistan

his appointment <e> <s> i should also like to associate myself with what he said about the services rendered by the noble lord lord strathcona which we all deeply appreciated as i am sure he will realise <e> <s> in thanking the noble viscount for this statement i am sure he will realise that without much further study it is not easy in fact it is impossible to comment very intelligently on all the detailed proposals which it contains <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i was pleased to find from the statement that it was not the governments intention to go back on their obligation to increase their expenditure by per cent <e> <s> over the next two or three years <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied that their present attitude is in strict accordance with the doctrines promulgated by that great guru dr friedman <e>", "<cs> my lords what do the government imagine will be the likely reaction of president reagan if as hinted in the statement on tuesday under pressure of economic circumstances we fail to achieve all or some of the improvements mentioned by the noble lord lord beswick at the same time devoting million annually to a project which adds nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with great diffidence on this subject because i am in no way an expert on anglo-gibraltarian-spanish relations and i am not sure whether there is any very definite liberal party view on the matter <e> <s> certainly i can confine my very brief remarks to minutes and i suspect that i shall not speak for more than about five minutes <e> <s> indeed i hope to make only a few general remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how many of these offences were committed by children <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the

<e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply and appreciate the evident trouble which the department has taken in producing these complicated statistics <e> <s> does she realise that from my point of view the significant period is not the two years and which she quoted but the year starting st november and ending st november the figures for which i understand are not yet available but hopefully will soon be available <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one further supplementary question <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the commonwealth secretariat has appointed a committee to make constructive proposals regarding the fees paid by overseas students generally and will she be in touch with the commonwealth secretariat in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for those moderately reassuring figures might i again ask her whether it is not very satisfactory that they have not been brought up to st november that is the beginning of the present academic year because they will be the only significant figures in the present context <e> <s> in the circumstances does she not agree that it would now be very desirable for the government to set up some kind of machinery for consultation with the organisations active in this sphere that is to say the united kingdom council for overseas student affairs the council for the education of the commonwealth and the committee of vice-chancellors to concert with them if possible some kind of general policy in future for the admission of foreign and overseas students into this country in order to allay the anxieties if nothing else of the universities and polytechnics which are now as the noble baroness knows heavily down the drain as a result of the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government not realise that instead of saving money through this policy they are actually losing money <e>", "<cs> my lords do we export any fish to common market countries <e>", "<cs> my lords do we export any fish to our colleagues on the other side of the channel <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by saying that like the noble lord lord chalfont to whom we are so grateful for raising this matter today i am in no sense a nuclear disarmer very much the contrary as my noble friends are aware <e> <s> but unlike my noble friend i believe that the proposal to go ahead with trident is fundamentally and inherently wrong <e> <s> i shall try to persuade your lordships that is the case in the quarter of an hour not more available to me now <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that trident would be an anti-city weapon <e> <s> does the noble lord say it is not an anti-city weapon <e> <s> it is my view that it probably would be an anti-city weapon but i may be wrong <e> <s> anyhow one only has to see that the threat which is made to employ trident in whatever capacity is impossible to imagine <e> <s> the russians would in no way be deterred by such a threat for they would know that in view of the inevitable and total consequent destruction of our country no sane democratic ruler in westminster could possibly ever carry it out <e> <s> certainly the existence of trident as indeed the existence of polaris and the possibility of its use on a second strike would deter the russians from bombarding the united kingdom by nuclear means or even threatening to do so but in the presumed absence of any american support there would be no need for them to threaten anything of the kind <e> <s> for in that event we should to all seeming be quickly starved out by a naval blockade even before the russians reached the north sea as they no doubt would unless they were most improbably held up by the use of german tactical nukes which in view of the come-back would reduce the continent to a shambles <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount leaves that point would he agree that there will be equal enthusiasm in america and in our nato allies for our having trident if it is obvious that we have to cut down on our conventional forces as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to thank the foreign secretary for repeating the statement <e> <s> obviously we have not had time to consider all its very grave implications but i would say at once that we are very glad that the prime minister and the foreign secretary had such a good reception in washington and generally speaking we of course welcome the prime ministers declared intention to support the new american administration in their policy of resisting aggression and notably soviet aggression anywhere in the world <e> <s> apart from that we welcome the note of caution sounded i think as a result of the talks with the president as regards the relationship of the united states with el salvador <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to congratulate the foreign secretary and mr nicholas ridley very warmly on the success of the negotiations up until now <e> <s> i think that i am expressing the view of the whole house when i say that there has been great success <e> <s> i have only one question to raise <e> <s> so far as we can see the heads of agreement seem to cover all or nearly all the questions that have been at issue between the two countries in the last few years <e> <s> if that is not the case perhaps the foreign secretary can tell us what are the outstanding issues <e> <s> judging from the statement is there perhaps remaining only the question of the rights in the areas of the sea adjacent to the cays as may be agreed or are there other substantial outstanding issues <e> <s> in any case may we assume that there is now every reason to suppose that the negotiations will be finally terminated quite shortly and that the treaties will be signed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the fact that the united states government have recognised the revolutionary movement known as unita in angola <e> <s> if so is that not likely to have a certain effect on ovamboland and on events in north-west namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches should also like to thank the noble lord the foreign secretary for repeating this very important statement <e> <s> we note the quite satisfactory nature of the discussions on various social questions and on poland <e> <s> on fish and here i differ slightly in emphasis in what i shall say from the noble lord lord goronwy-robert salthough of course everyone is in favour of our trying to obtain the best possible deal for our fishermen no one would dispute that i think that the noble lord the foreign secretary might perhaps agree that this is really not the right way to run a railway <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for repeating this very important statement which on the face of it appears to discredit completely the insinuations regarding existing security made in the recent book by mr chapman pincher <e> <s> that is most satisfactory <e> <s> on behalf of my colleagues i should also like to share the indignation of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones at what has happened and to express our deepest sympathy with the family and relations of the late sir roger hollis <e> <s> i understand from the statement that the government have no reason whatever to doubt sir rogers loyalty but if the faintest doubt should still persist on that score then i imagine that it would be only prudent if it has not been done already to re-vet positively those members of the service who were recruited by him or when he was in a position to influence recruitment <e> <s> there would be no harm in doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords is there now some reason to suppose that the soviet government will agree to the international supervision of manoeuvres right up to the urals <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any prospect of the governments modifying their wretched policy in respect of students coming from poorer countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords thanking the noble lord for that reply is it not evident that the security council under the charter at any rate is the place in which this very grave matter affecting international security should be considered <e> <s> if the rumours are true i do not know but if they are to the effect that the americans and the russians are discussing some kind of agreement on the lebanon behind the scenes is not that an additional reason for someone raising this matter in

beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can we assume that as soon as evidence of any likely increase in the cost of trident is available it will be published by the secretary of state <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount another supplementary question <e> <s> at what point in the likely almost inevitable escalation of the costs of trident will the government be prepared to abandon this unfortunate project <e>", "<cs> my lords although i entirely agree with the foreign secretary that everything depends on our agreement with guatemala supposing that the agreement is put to the people of belize in the form of a referendum and is turned down i imagine that it will lapse <e>", "<cs> my lords has this dangerous situation been discussed or raised in the council of foreign ministers of the eec <e> <s> if so might it not be desirable to have a common european policy whichever it may be on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unfortunate event of somebody wanting to go abroad who has a passport which is out of date and which cannot be renewed owing to industrial action will that person be allowed through the customs by being able to plead <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible now to verify by satellite the movement of every single soviet soldier and tank in any area <e> <s> and if that is so surely we know exactly what is happening in the caucasus <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever your individual views i think that your lordships will agree on one thing namely that aid is a controversial complicated and on the whole rather unpopular subject which cannot however possibly be ignored without very considerable risk for our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the prime minister receives no satisfactory response from the russians in respect of the representations that she made last march are we to assume that our relations both political and commercial with the soviet union will then be the same as they were before the invasion of afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government agree that efforts of our representatives in the united states have had much success in influencing in every way and inducing the free press of america to give expression more to the views of her majestys government on the situation in northern ireland and not on making heroes of the ira

successfully it would have to be compulsory <e>", "<cs> my lords why do not the government take the risk of initiating the necessary legal proceedings against this firm with a considerable chance of success <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever may be the legal justification for the israeli action and some people maintain that there is still a state of war existing between israel and iraq world opinion seems quite rightly to be unanimous in condemning it <e> <s> this being so and in view of the obvious dangers arising <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a good thing that the noble lord lord ohagan has raised this question today partly because as has been said it conies on the eve of the british presidency of the council of ministers and it may be useful for the government to have the views of this house

made clear from the speech of the noble lord lord bruce of donington that the eec is almost as responsible for our present ills as are mrs thatchers economic policies <e> <s> labours remedy as we all

necessarily as i shall proceed to argue to go in for what can only be described as nationalistic socialism import controls more nationalisation capital levies unilateral disarmament a greater increase in bureaucracy in a word something which can only be put into effect by what is commonly known as a directed economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite hear what the noble lord said <e> <s> if i am supposed to have resisted something i have to hear it <e>", "<cs> who me <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord is not agreeing with lord boothby <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this great matter cannot be discussed profitably on a parliamentary question and that rather we should await the statement which is to be made tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords this very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the foreign secretary for repeating this statement <e> <s> it is however very difficult to make any reasonable comment when one has hardly had time to read it in advance <e> <s> i do hope that in future we shall at least have five minutes to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be advisable not to use the expression third world in this connection <e> <s> nobody seems to know exactly what it means <e> <s> it comprises highly developed and extremely undeveloped countries <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that these programmes once they are discontinued will be very difficult if not impossible to restore the audience having been lost <e> <s> are they also aware that the soviet government will be overjoyed by the news that these programmes are being discontinued that they will have the field to themselves and that they spend two or three times as much money on this kind of thing as we do <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to thank the foreign secretary for making this statement <e> <s> i am sure we can all agree that although the result of his mission was not satisfactory this was in no way due to the foreign secretary himself but only i am afraid to the continued intransigence of the soviet government <e> <s> did the noble lord by any chance represent i imagine he did to mr gromyko that the continued presence of soviet troops in afghanistan will hardly be consonant with the maintenance of what is called dtente and that if the soviet government really wish to have any kind of dtente they must contemplate some kind of arrangement of a satisfactory nature with regard to afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords to what extent are these directives of the eec binding on her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise that i do not propose to detain your lordships for more than a quarter of an hour which is rather more than the six minutes which seems to be sufficient for the leader of the opposition <e> <s> i shall not examine in detail the decision of the minister of defence to scrap or mothball something like a third of the navys ships and eventually to replace frigates and destroyers with new frigates and to some extent with hunter-killer submarines <e> <s> nor shall i attempt to judge whether that is to our advantage because frankly we have not had the time to go into it in detail <e> <s> it may well be that given our limited financial resources and provided that we really are not as a result and perhaps the government will tell us about this in the winding-up speech going back on our nato obligations to increase our real expenditure by per cent <e> <s> the government have only said that they have not pointed out how it is to happen the new policy would be the best way to prevent the soviet murmansk fleet from getting into the atlantic <e> <s> or perhaps not <e> <s> other noble lords who are better qualified than i am will no doubt pronounce on that in the course of the debate

ignorance of whether we are going to bomb them by nuclear means or not <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in my opinion of course we could have a nuclear deterrent in order to deter the russians from bombing us but if war breaks out and it might break out tomorrow we cannot expect the russians to surrender because they might be under the impression that they might nevertheless be bombed by us <e> <s> if they are bombed by us and we start it off of course they bomb back and everything is lost anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to associate myself with what has been said about lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> i too have the most affectionate memories of interrogating him on the subject of our entry into the common market when he was in the government <e> <s> i always thought he was extremely fair <e> <s> indeed he was always fair and we greatly miss <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that this statement must be read in conjunction with the much longer statements which have been placed in the library which i have just had an opportunity of glancing through and which are on the same subject <e> <s> with regard therefore to the statements as a whole i may say that it appears to the ordinary uninformed observer that although the conference covered an immense number of subjects and there was a considerable amount of agreement on general principles it really did not get us very much further in any particular direction <e> <s> perhaps that was impossible in the circumstances <e> <s> i do not say that it was a bad thing to have the summit nevertheless it cannot be said that it was anything except a little disappointing <e> <s> on that i agree with the noble lord who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised the matter of gas lines from siberia <e>", "<cs> my lords should it become clear next thursday that the house is opposed to these foolish proposals will the government be prepared to withdraw them and not fall back as i have heard suggested elsewhere on the alternative scheme for making similar economies in the money devoted to transmitters for the bbc which would be obviously cutting off their nose to spite their face <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that everybody in the house irrespective of party will shed a tear that the noble lord lord soames is no longer our leader for he was invariably sympathetic and helpful and anxious that there should be a fair apportionment of time between the parties <e> <s> besides one had the impression that he believed in the role that the house of lords might play in our national life and was even prepared to give expression in cabinet to what might be called the mood of this house when he thought that it was sensible and necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government noted with pleasure nevertheless the statement by two american ex-presidents that subject to the qualifica <e>", "<cs> my lords the general direction of our foreign policy must clearly be conditioned to a large extent by the behaviour of our principal and acknowledged adversary the soviet union <e> <s> i have always thought that the objective of the russians while seeking such outposts as they can acquire without risking any general hostilities and safeguarding of course if they can their glacis as it might be called in europe is not to overwhelm the anti-communist west by military means because any kind of general war even if it were a non-nuclear war would probably be counter-productive but rather to undermine our free societies from within and if possible to produce a situation in which a discouraged united states would withdraw her troops from europe and then make if they can suitable arrangements with pro-soviet rgimes in western europe resulting of course in soviet hegemony over the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that if the policy of the cnd movement is as described by the noble lord lord chalfont it cannot he reconciled with a desire to stay in nato <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a nuclear-free zone in europe would involve the denuclearisation of the soviet murmansk baltic and black sea fleets <e>", "<cs> my lords while i hardly expect the foreign secretary to agree that the soviet union is the state best qualified to denounce crimes against humanity would he not agree that the first use in war of nuclear weapons on either side would be likely to be entirely counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do my best to confine my remarks to six minutes <e> <s> i believe that this debate has arisen largely by reason of the recent contradictory remarks made by various american leaders notably president reagans rather unhappy observation that a nuclear war might in certain circumstances be confined to europe and possibly also by increasing doubts on this side of the atlantic about the continuing validity of the doctrine of flexible response to say nothing of fear arising from the possible installation of cruise missiles and pershing its in europe the whole resulting in a great increase in and demand for unilateral disarmament a fatal proposal for surrender to the soviet union <e> <s> to combat and reverse this mood and to stabilise our relationship with america i should like to make the following short suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord make some reference to the possibility of some conversations on security and the general aegis of the forthcoming genscher-colombo plan <e>", "<cs> my lords during his speech the noble lord lord morris who i am afraid is no longer in his place made some reference to what he understood the foreign secretary had said regarding the great importance of broadcasting in the english language in the overseas programmes of the bbc <e> <s> i understood the noble lord lord trefgarne to say that he would like the passage verified and i think i have found it <e> <s> the foreign secretary said <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord referring to radio my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not myself experienced such a tendency in the bbcs programmes and in any event we are this evening talking about the overseas programmes <e> <s> in respect of those i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say that the majority of those who listen in the vernacular are not capable of listening to and understanding it in english more particularly in spain where there is very little english spoken and likewise in italy which i know very well <e> <s> i think that the great majority of those listening while they might be able to speak a little english would not be able to follow the details and implications of an argument conducted very quickly in english <e> <s> yes i should say that the immense majority of those who listen in the vernacular would not be able to understand the world service in english <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is not on the list of speakers but i thought i ought to say a few words before the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe rises and i have given her notice that i intend to do so <e> <s> i speak for the reason that i now feel that the matter raised by the noble lord lord paget of northampton is an extremely grave one and one which we simply cannot push under the carpet <e> <s> it must be considered at some stage and therefore i feel that some words from these benches would not come altogether amiss <e> <s> i propose in any case to speak only for a minute or two <e>", "<cs> my lords we are greatly indebted to the initiator of this very interesting debate <e> <s> it is indeed necessary to have a debate limited to one great issue in fact the greatest of all issues the nuclear issue rather than to stray over the whole field of defence if we can avoid it <e> <s> so as i have said we are very much indebted to the noble earl lord cathcart for raising the matter in the way that he has done <e> <s> as i understand it his aim was twofold <e> <s> in the first place he wanted to make the case for our own nuclear power for trident so far as he could <e> <s> in the second place if i am not wrong he wanted to contest the general theses of the campaign for nuclear disarmament which he thought were very dangerous

my lords we too should like to thank the foreign secretary for this important statement <e>", "<cs> my lords if the greek government insist on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from greek territory

from the whole operation or what will be the result <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the foreign secretary for making this important statement but on these benches at any rate we would regard the outcome of the meeting of the council of ministers as on the whole with certain exceptions to which i might make a reference pretty lamentable <e> <s> i would ask is no proposal for limiting our contribution to the budget including perhaps some extension of the present system which after all has not worked out so unfavourably from our point of view as i understand it acceptable

result anticipated <e>", "<cs> my lords by a minority of one <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should like to ask him three questions <e> <s> in the first place are the government fully satisfied that it is legally in order for one institution of the community to take another institution to the court <e> <s> if it is in order then can the noble lord say or confirm that it would be in order for instance for the parliament or indeed the commission to take the council to the court for not abiding by the terms of the treaty of rome <e> <s> and if that happens as i imagine it might happen would the government please tell us whether they would accept the verdict of the court <e> <s> in any case could we be told how many and preferably which members of the council were prepared to accept the eec budget as adopted by the parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may repeat the question that i asked to which the noble lord lord trefgarne did not reply <e> <s> in the governments view would it be legally possible for the parliament to take the council to the court for not abiding by the terms of the treaty of rome <e> <s> if it did so would the government be prepared to accept the verdict of the court <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the report indicates how many of the million people in europe alleged to be living below the poverty line inhabit europe east of the iron curtain <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing broadly speaking with what the minister has just said may i ask the government whether they agree that to pay too much attention to public opinion polls which in any case fluctuate wildly would be not only foolish but also essentially undemocratic <e>", "<cs> my lords will the trident project be equally welcomed by all the members of the alliance when it becomes painfully clear that it can be proceeded with only at the expense of all our conventional armaments in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed that according to the press this morning almost the entire population of poland seems to think there will be a revolution in the spring and that the west will then somehow come to their assistance against whoever it may be the government or the russians <e> <s> is it not therefore high time we had a debate on the subject to find out what in fact in face of this grim situation the policy of the government is likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to thank the noble lord lord elton for repeating the statement <e> <s> we naturally welcome the concession which has been made in respect of overseas students they are considerable concessions certainly but we still consider that the proposed contributions to the national health service during the first year of these students residence here will bear very heavily upon them more particularly in view of the highest fees in the world which they are at present suffering <e> <s> notably it will affect very unfavourably those coming from the poorer commonwealth countries <e> <s> it also seems rather odd to us that total exemption will be allowed not only in respect of eec countries which is right and proper under the treaty of rome but also to those coming from eastern european countries notably the soviet union while those from deserving commonwealth countries such as malaysia or kenya will apparently be stung <e> <s> that seems to us to be paradoxical to say the least <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government any idea and if not could they find out <e> <s> in how many states of members of the united nations human rights are being either violated or not fully carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that in the opinion of many noble lords on this side of the house the one redeeming feature of their proposal to produce an expensive weapon which would be superfluous in the event of a war in which the americans were on our side and useless if they were not is that having opted for the more expensive version of trident they will have then to spend less during the initial stages which will make it easier from the financial point of view for an incoming government to cancel the project when they come to power in two years time as will doubtless be the case <e>", "<cs> we should like to associate ourselves with what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the party or at any rate the bulk of the party which landed from an argentinian ship has now been withdrawn together with the argentinian flag with only a small party of a few men remaining <e> <s> if the argentinian government were to ask permission for that small party to remain i imagine that request would be granted while if permission were not sought i suppose a constitutional issue would arise and that conceivably in certain circumstances it could become acute <e> <s> in the circumstances would the minister agree that there is a case for referring the whole question of sovereignty to the international court and abiding by its decision <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government not agree that it is in any case quite wrong to refer to the attitude of the eec as if the community is something outside ourselves to which we do not belong and is as such pursuing a policy hostile to <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to associate ourselves with what

will be arrived at without further delay <e>", "<cs> my lords while i quite understand the reluctance of the foreign secretary to cancel his proposed visit to israel will he take the opportunity of the visit to express to his israeli hosts his strong displeasure and i should hope also that of the european economic community at the recent dismissal of many <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the foreign secretary for making this statement more especially since i understand he has come rushing back from brussels especially to inform the house of what is happening <e> <s> i have only two short points to make <e> <s> we must all hope of course that diplomacy will continue and will succeed in solving this dispute but of course in the event of diplomacy failing i imagine that we must all assume also that the government have contingency plans for if necessary settling it by other means <e>", "<cs> my lords we too congratulate the noble lord most warmly on his appointment <e> <s> i do not think that this is the occasion for me to say anything other than we all hope that the measures now taken by the government will be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords when we last discussed this matter in relation to the private notice question asked by the noble lord the leader of the opposition i made what i think must have been the shortest speech i have ever delivered in this house saying that i doubted whether it was the right occasion to say anything other than that we all hoped that the measures taken by the government would be successful <e> <s> i was rather tempted to stick to that line this afternoon <e> <s> indeed i believe myself that it might have been better not to have had this debate at all that is my personal view <e> <s> but it is after all now a question of a statement of the governments position for which i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> so it looks as though all parties should now make their general attitude abundantly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would allow me to interrupt for a moment my chief point was that i was not going to discuss any of these possibilities <e> <s> i only made some reflections upon proposals regarding the possible involvement of the united nations <e> <s> that was all <e>", "<cs> it is labour party policy <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the doctrine of flexible response is being increasingly questioned by great experts on both sides of the atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful to the noble lord for repeating this statement which for reasons which we completely understand does not add very much to our knowledge <e> <s> however and here i agree with the noble lord lord shackleton i believe that the great majority of people in this country feel that there is hardly likely to be any peaceful solution of <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government totally reject the idea of forming some kind of home guard for the purposes indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> i am sure also that the foreign secretary will leave on this important mission with the goodwill of the entire house behind him <e> <s> we only hope that he will come back with a satisfactory solution <e> <s> but would the government not agree that if an armed clash with the argentine forces which however necessary and however successful and i repeat however necessary and however successful would have some very unfortunate consequences is to be avoided they will have to give some general indication of the sort of eventual peaceful settlement which they contemplate and how and where negotiations to this end would be conducted <e> <s> i hope that i have interpreted what was said at the beginning of this statement as meaning in effect that the government accept that view <e>", "<cs> if by this phrase is meant their ability if necessary by a simple majority to render inapplicable and hence to veto any solution emerging from discussions perhaps under a neutral or a united nations chairman as i think the noble lord lord shackleton suggested which might be held by us at any rate to protect their essential interests <e> <s> of course if by paramount is meant that the interests of the islanders should be fully safeguarded i think there would be no dissent from the use of the term <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> i suppose that everybody here will welcome as such the forcible ejection of argentine troops from a british island which they seized by force in flagrant defiance of argentines obligation under the charter and over which the argentine government had never pretended to have even the faintest shadowy claim <e> <s> we must also surely extend our warmest congratulations to the royal navy and the marines on a splendid military operation <e> <s> to have transported at only three weeks notice over miles of ocean sufficient force to undertake the operation successfully with no casualties and in appalling climatic <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last couple of days the impression that we have rightly or wrongly derived has been that some kind of forceful action on our part designed to compel the argentine government to withdraw their troops from the islands is imminent <e> <s> in many utterances both in the other place and on television the prime minister herself has dwelt on the fact that time is running out that it would be impossible to keep a task force going for long in appalling and worsening climatic conditions that we cannot go on negotiating for ever and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i only hope so <e> <s> the position up to this morning anyhow seemed to he as i related it <e> <s> if the labour party have changed their official mind i shall be the first to congratulate them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i said in my speech that i should very much welcome a decision by the government to submit this matter to the international court though recognising that a judgment would take a considerable time to become effective <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us exactly how the united nations administrator will be appointed to whom he will be responsible and what chance there will be of the russians and chinese agreeing on this particular appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to associate myself and my colleagues on these benches with the tribute that was paid to the great efficiency and courage of our forces on the spot by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> i thank the noble lord the minister of state for repeating the statement <e> <s> there has been very little time to consult my colleagues and <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government agree that some very influential commonwealth governments whose interests have been adversely affected by the recent huge rises in the fees payable by their students here are particularly keen on the initiative which has been referred to by the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> and in any case is it not highly desirable that at a moment when these governments are giving us such spendid assistance in connection with the argentine aggression we should lean over backwards in order to give them as much satisfaction as we possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what are the criteria for acceptance as a special constable <e> <s> or is any applicant accepted without question <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government perhaps agree that with hindsight their recent policy in the agricultural council has been really misconceived <e> <s> not only for the reasons advanced by my noble friend but also for the fact that linking it so tightly with our subscription to the budget and holding up the whole process of agricultural policy for so long apparently indefinitely not unnaturally infuriated most of our colleagues and that at the moment when their help was obviously desirable in connection with the falklands crisis <e> <s> furthermore despite what my noble friend speaking from the sdp bench said would he not further agree on reflection that the gradual abandonment of the famous luxembourg compromise far from damaging our long-term interests is really the only way <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i think the charter says the interests of the inhabitants should be paramount <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that there have been two rather overriding points which have emerged during the welter of discussion on this subject in the last six weeks or so <e> <s> the junta in buenos aires seriously miscalculated the effect of their military occupation of the islands on this country which was doubtless the result of their need for some popular external adventure to distract attention from their disastrous internal economic situation <e> <s> they probably now recognise their error but having aroused public emotion to the extent that they have there is a point in the process of climbing down beyond which they cannot go without being i should have thought in some danger either of assassination or of their being replaced by some perhaps even more regrettable rgime of a semi-communist nature which would probably try to form some connection with the soviet union and cuba <e> <s> this no doubt accounts for the juntas intransigent and prevaricating attitude in general <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the government agree that the idea that a radioactive cloud could one day drift over the continent is conceivable only in the event of the total annihilation and vaporisation of either the united states or the soviet union or both in which case of course we should obviously in this country have been vaporised too <e> <s> therefore would not the government come to the conclusion that any precautions taken in this country against the effects of nuclear war are a total absurdity and the money should be devoted to other purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the inability of noble lords or some of them to keep within their allotted time which is put forward for the good conduct of the debate has given me exactly two and a half minutes to reply <e> <s> that is obviously insufficient and therefore under mild protest i shall not make any speech at all but will make way for the noble lord lord belstead

the whole would like to congratulate the foreign secretary on what he has achieved at this last meeting <e> <s> it seems to me to be extremely satisfactory on almost every point and more particularly perhaps in regard to the implementation of the agreement of th may on refunds for <e> <s> i think we can only hope that the french will agree and i believe there is every reason to suppose that they will <e> <s> the only point which perhaps might have been made and was not discussed was in regard to poland <e> <s> i am not quite certain why they did not discuss what action if any they might take in regard to poland in connection with the latest moves of the government there <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate which has now resumed is as usual concerned with two vast even if inter-related subjects and in the quarter of an hour which is all i am going to devote to them it is possible to make only some very general and indeed unqualified remarks on some aspects of them <e> <s> these will be on east-west relations the european community the middle east and the aftermath of the falklands operations <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister finishes with the middle east can he say something about the possible attitude of russia and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> in the long run my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that fairly satisfactory reply <e> <s> may i however ask him whether the government agree that almost any iranian who returns now to his country after a reasonably long period in this country may be in some danger of being judicially murdered by the existing government on the grounds that he is doubtfully islamic in his outlook <e> <s> will not therefore the government at least see to it that the existing regulations can be stretched as far as possible so as to avoid adding to the already long list of assassinations by the ayatollah khomeini <e>", "<cs> my lords we too thank the minister for repeating that statement and speaking personally i have some sympathy with the proposal made by the noble lord lord bruce to the effect that we should have a debate before christmas on the very grave situation in which the steel industry finds itself when we would have an opportunity of saying how far we agree with the efforts of the government to put it right or how far we do not <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be desirable not always to concentrate entirely on what are considered to be british interests but sometimes to consider what are the interests of the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement and in many respects we welcome the result of the foreign ministers conference <e> <s> notably i think we would welcome the fact that the budget solution is being actively studied <e> <s> here i would merely repeat what i said the other day namely that we do not think that we ought to go out for per cent <e> <s> satisfaction of our claims but we ought in the long run to consider some reasonable compromise on the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by saying that for reasons which i have explained to the noble lord who is to wind up this debate i may not be able to stay until the very end although i hope to do so <e>", "<cs> with the eec <e>", "<cs> that is quite true but what is significant i think is that the proportion has not varied very much since then <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a possibility that in these protracted negotiations in vienna undue emphasis has perhaps been put on the achievement of exact parity <e> <s> for instance does it matter if the russians have a considerable advantage as regards tanks provided we have enough anti-tank weapons with which to knock those tanks out <e> <s> is not the only thing that really matters the achievement of some kind of conventional defence in the west which is able on the face of it to resist any attack by conventional means from the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords we too thank the minister for repeating this important statement <e> <s> we on these benches note with satisfaction the apparent belief of the government that on the whole it was a good thing that the european parliament precipitated this issue of the community budget <e> <s> would the noble lord and the government not agree that this was in no sense and could not possibly be interpreted as a move directed against the united kingdom as has been i think unfortunately suggested recently by certain newspapers and indeed by certain politicians <e> <s> is it not high time that the necessity for some reform of the common agricultural policy was squarely faced together with the question of the proportion of the communitys expenditure that should be fairly attributed to the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by apologising for having missed the splendid oration of my noble friend lord mayhew although broadly speaking i think i knew more or less what he was going to say <e> <s> i was late because i thought the statements were not going to be taken when they were <e> <s> in the minutes available i shall simply make a series of generalisations which i fear some of your lordships may find contentious but which i myself believe to be relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that a great many americans do not themselves approve of the policy of their president and say so most emphatically <e>", "<cs> my lords i associate these benches with everything that has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government agree that a lot of this talk about nuclear preponderance is irrelevant and even absurd <e> <s> all that is necessary for an effective nuclear deterrent is the capacity for a second strike to be able to inflict unacceptable damage on the adversary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that not unexpected reply may i ask him in view of statements which have already appeared in the press whether he can possibly deny that unless the government change their present attitude we may quite well be committed to nuclear war with all its appalling consequences against the will of this country as expressed in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords if we can believe the press is it not a fact that the americans have agreed in principle to our having a dual control or dual key provided that we agree to purchase the missiles <e> <s> would it not therefore be in our interests to spend a few hundred million pounds in order to have control of these missiles rather than the reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to thank the leader of the house for repeating this obviously very important statement <e> <s> we would also like to join with the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos in congratulating my noble friend lord franks on producing this clearly intelligent and far-reaching report in the time laid down by the government <e> <s> it is clear also from the statement that the conclusions of the report as quoted by the prime minister are satisfactory from the governments point of view <e> <s> the only point that immediately occurs to me is that if nobody in the government is apparently to <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that most of your lordships will hold that given its rather narrow premises or terms of reference the conclusions of the excellent and as i think the noble baroness lady young described it formidable report of my noble friend whom we are so glad to have with us today on these benches are probably about right <e>", "<cs> i did <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he can possibly tell us the broad conclusion of his paper of which i am sure he will recall <e>", "<cs> my lords when they resume negotiations with the spanish government on the question of gibraltar would the government be prepared as they were with the argentine at least to discuss the question of sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords in the event of an assault by guatemala on belize could we be certain of united states support as in fact we were when they supported us during the falklands campaign <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will scarcely be surprised to hear that i warmly welcome these on the whole very satisfactory proposals dealing with the problem posed by the education of overseas students in this country <e> <s> as i understand the statement <e> <s> it accepts almost entirely the proposals recently made by the overseas students trust <e> <s> my only reproach and it is a serious one is that the government did not appreciate before now the grave damage to our national interests already caused by their original proposals to charge what was always referred to and quite incorrectly as the full cost of educating these students in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the phase joint decision effectively mean that these missiles cannot in practice ever be let off except with british consent <e>", "<cs> my lords how many platoons would this force comprise when at full strength <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not going to take this motion to a vote as suggested very kindly by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> i support and indeed welcome it in so far as it relates to the possession by nato of a nuclear deterrent that is to say a deterrent against the first use of nuclear weapons by the adversary <e> <s> i need hardly add that i am just as opposed to unilateral disarmament as the noble lord lord carrington is or the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> but the mere rejection of the cnd thesis essential though this is will not of itself result in a lessening of the very grave dangers that now confront us <e> <s> for as the synod of the church of england has now very rightly concluded for reasons so admirably expressed by the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham we should no longer whether on moral or practical grounds accept the fearful risks inherent in the strategy of flexible response which as even its advocates admit in the present state of our defences involves the almost certain use in war by nato of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> our policy has been pointed out by mr steel and other leaders my lords <e> <s> it is perfectly clear <e> <s> i am sorry if the noble lord has not read of them <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not stand in the same place as the labour party and the noble lord must realise that <e> <s> we are not in favour of unilateral disarmament <e> <s> the liberal party does not stand for that <e> <s> we want multilateral disarmament <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord has understood that at last <e>", "<cs> nonsense my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said is that it was very unwise to adopt the doctrine of flexible response which committed us to making the first use of the nuclear bomb in the event of war <e> <s> i said that in the policy of my friends from whose pamphlet i quoted it was not possible for us to make a declaration immediately to that effect but that we ought to work towards it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> it is not a question of obtaining parity all the time <e> <s> you need not have parity to have a perfectly good defensive system <e> <s> you do not have to have the same number of tanks as the russians you have to have enough anti-tank weapons to counter the tanks <e> <s> parity is an illusion in conventional matters <e>", "<cs> in time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government in our opinion on these benches have a quite deplorable record on overseas students <e> <s> instead of reducing the admittedly excessive total number that at one time threatened to put a strain on our resources by for instance some suitable scheme of quotas discussed with all the educational establishments concerned they firmly turned down the suggestions of the united kingdom council of overseas students affairs and the council for education in the commonwealth for some kind of commission to elaborate a sensible overall policy for submission to the government <e> <s> instead of that they suddenly put up fees to cover what was always called the full cost of educating overseas students which besides being based on largely bogus <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of discriminating against poorer countries so much it is discriminating against poorer students <e> <s> there can be poorer students from rich countries of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to start with a declaration of interest because like the noble lord lord walston i was myself a member of the academic council at wilton park for a number of years and when i was there i spoke quite often at meetings at that centre <e> <s> i was also i hasten to say a great friend of that magnificent man heinz koeppler who transformed wilton park from its original function as a body i understand for re-educating nazis into one of the most influential political conference centres which exist at the present time <e> <s> nobody did more than did koeppler to re-create some form of understanding between the british and the germans after the war <e> <s> more than that the late warden was a splendid advocate of his adopted country more particularly perhaps in the united states where the friends of wilton park as they are called is an organisation which he personally created and is still an important element in the fabric of anglo-american relations <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the noble lord right he said that the cruise missile was a second-strike weapon <e> <s> does that mean it could never be used on a first strike <e>", "<cs> my lords is it part of the duties of ds to explain to a rather sceptical public the advantages of the trident programme <e>", "<cs> my lords do the figures given by the noble lord lord lyell in respect of and refer in both cases to the present members of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the minister for making this statement <e> <s> i would venture to associate myself with the various questions which have just been put by the noble baroness <e> <s> for my part i would simply say on behalf of those on these benches that this is rather typical of the on the whole rather ungenerous attitude towards overseas students that has been consistently manifested by the present government <e> <s> i see the noble baroness nodding her head <e> <s> i suppose it is not much good protesting on this particular decision which on the whole was probably expected by most of the people involved unfortunately <e> <s> the real question is what is going to happen in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government really saying that we must take these fantastic ideas of space wars in years time seriously in the context of negotiations for the elimination of nuclear armaments <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is a dual key system for cruise missiles would it not in logic be necessary to have a similar system in respect of the airfields where there are based american aircraft with a nuclear capability <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising that it is essential for the west in principle to have adequate nuclear weapons in order to deter the use of nuclear weapons by the other side would not the government agree that any attempt by us to make first use of nuclear weapons in other words to initiate a nuclear war would be both absurd and self-defeating <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that it will be in order for me to speak for approximately minutes which is what i originally intended to do <e> <s> may i begin by saying that i agree with a great deal of what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has said <e> <s> for my part as an acknowledged non-expert i would venture greatly daring to try to draw certain conclusions in respect of the very difficult and contentious problems dealt with in this excellent report which is before us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that with taiwan and south korea their economy has benefited by enormous subsidies from the west <e>", "<cs> i do not mind my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all think that the noble earl lord cathcart has done well to draw the attention of the house to what no one denies is an important and potentially sinister development over the last few years <e> <s> i agreed with a great deal of what he said in that respect though i think he rather underestimated the fact that the soviet union has also lost very much of its ideological appeal to the nations of the world <e> <s> but i also agreed with a great deal of what the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos has said <e> <s> i am in a way perhaps between the two noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> as i understand it his thesis is that the leaders of the soviet union are guided entirely in their foreign operations by the principles of marxist-leninism <e> <s> how is that compatible with what we hear namely that hardly anybody now in the soviet union believes in communism any more <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government insist on their view that british and french nuclear forces are not in practice intermediate weapons in exactly the same sense as the sss in russia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not nevertheless a fact that in the absence so far as the cruise missile is concerned of any dual operational control the americans can always in the last resort i repeat in the last resort retain the possibilty of discharging these missiles without formal british consent and that this is in practice a possibility which they are reluctant to abandon <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble lord whether the denial of his noble colleague lord belstead on rd may last that cruise missiles were first strike weapons because <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government be prepared at some stage to put this question to a vote in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to associate these benches with what has been said about the staff <e> <s> as regards the future parliament all i can say is that if we are confronted as may happen by a government intent on abolishing this house we may have more work to do than was contemplated <e> <s> as to the staff i am sure that we all pay the greatest tribute to their devoted assistance <e> <s> their work often in the middle of the night when most of us including myself are safely in bed is beyond praise <e> <s> i suppose the only satisfaction is that they undoubtedly serve what in my view and i am sure the view of many of your lordships is the most efficient second chamber in the world in its revision of legislation and in constantly giving wise advice to the government perhaps even on a non-party basis <e> <s> with those remarks i hope that we shall come back perhaps in a slightly less cantankerous mood in a months time <e> <s> it is certainly possible that places may have changed <e>", "<cs> my lords since i propose to deal to a considerable extent with stuttgart in the remarks which i shall make during the forthcoming debate i shall not say much now beyond observing that the real problems have still to be solved and that the million rebate which we have obtained from our rather reluctant colleagues is not as i understand it to be regarded as in any way a final and definitive settlement but as one which unless i am wrong will have to be negotiated after agreement has been reached on the new budget at the end of the year which the community evidently requires or perhaps in the course of the negotiations on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords at this very late hour your lordships will not expect me to take up so many of the very interesting points made in this excellent debate <e> <s> i agree almost entirely with the excellent and indeed statesmanlike speech of the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> i found myself in substantial agreement with almost all his points aid williamsburg the middle east the falklands dtente and even arms limitation <e> <s> i hope that none of my colleagues on this side of the house will take that against me <e> <s> it did so happen that it was the case on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think we shall all welcome the reaction of the ministers and indeed of the community <e> <s> to the most unfortunate united states curbs on imports of certain types of steel and wish them well in their efforts to change or indeed discard these altogether <e> <s> likewise we welcome progress towards lom <e> <s> i shall be most interested to hear the reply of the noble baroness to the specific question put by the noble lord lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness did not quite understand my question <e> <s> i asked whether the government would say here and now that in principle provided we got agreement on the major outstanding issues we should favour an increase in the general resources of the community not our own resources in order to finance an industrial and regional policy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount explain why it is that so many members of the tory party are in favour of proportional representation <e>", "<cs> my lords since there may be difficulties in the way of general acceptance of a nuclear freeze more particularly in part of the united states would not the government agree that it might be more helpful and more productive to concentrate on the alternative proposal for a withdrawal of so-called battlefield nuclear weapons over a certain area on both sides of the dividing line <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches too should like to associate ourselves with the expression of sympathy to both the united states government and the french government as regards this appalling incident and indeed to the relations of its victims <e> <s> we should also like to express approval of the action of her majestys government in giving such instant help in the way of affording facilities for the wounded in cyprus and elsewhere <e> <s> that was very welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble baroness whom i thank for repeating this statement will realise that we have had very little time to reflect on this train of events and so far as i am concerned to consult with anybody about the attitude we might take up <e> <s> may i however ask just one or two questions <e> <s> we must assume that at least some of the non-grenadan and presumably mostly united states citizens are in considerable danger as a result of recent events and certainly the gang who shot the last government do not inspire any particular confidence <e> <s> therefore we must assume that some united states citizens at least are in considerable danger <e> <s> but if so presumably and i should like the noble baroness to confirm this the united states and caribbean forces will be withdrawn when the united states and other non-grenadan citizens are evacuated or their condition is considered to be tolerable <e>", "<cs> my lords since we last discussed defence there has been an incident which undoubtedly increased east-west tension and even seemed to bring rather nearer the grim prospect of war <e> <s> hence a general sense of unease which has encouraged the peace movement with its unthinking and dangerous calls for unilateral nuclear disarmament <e> <s> more particularly in america the shooting down by the soviet air force of a korean airliner seemed to be proof positive of inherent soviet aggressive tendencies <e> <s> certainly the official soviet excuse for this dreadful act namely that an airliner with passengers on board and a united states congressman was on a spying mission deliberately organised by the cia is obvious nonsense <e> <s> on the other hand it is conceivable and i only say conceivable that the airliner was shot down by mistake at a moment of panic <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i believe dr johnson said that it concentrated the mind wonderfully <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that not very encouraging reply <e> <s> the idea behind my question was to suggest that they should take the initiative <e> <s> in all circumstances they should be responsible for bringing this matter to the conference in new delhi for the purpose of debating it <e> <s> i am not sure whether that is the case <e> <s> but are not the government anyhow fully aware of the great importance of encouraging trade and hence the whole economic development of the poorer countries by making use of the latest teaching techniques and notably what is called distance teaching involving the use of video tapes and so on <e> <s> do they realise that it would eventually pay them handsomely if they here and now were to offer to make some special financial provision to further this desirable end <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i have found this an absolutely fascinating debate <e> <s> as i understand it the house is divided almost equally into two halves <e> <s> irrespective of party there are those who might be called thatcherites and those who might be called reaganites <e> <s> the reaganites argue on the basis of <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that this is a hypothetical question but let us suppose that the negotiations on intermediate weapons continue in geneva and we all hope that they will and let us suppose that during these negotiations the russians come forward with a further offer apparently they have already offered to reduce their weapons to or to reduce them to say <e> <s> in order to facilitate these negotiations would the government contemplate halting the importation of cruise missiles reserving their right however to resume the importation if after all the negotiations fail <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put two supplementary questions to the noble viscount <e> <s> first i see that very rightly they are looking forward to elections in grenada <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount whether the intention is that the elections should be held before the american troops evacuate the island or afterwards <e> <s> if afterwards will elections be held in the presence of a commonwealth force <e> <s> will somebody keep order during the elections <e> <s> my second question is related to the assistance given to small states and to the general idea that the commonwealth should in certain circumstances act in much the same way as the president of the united states acted in regard to grenada <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government be prepared to accept the possibility that in a moment of panic the local soviet authorities were not aware that they were actually going to shoot down an airliner with passengers on it <e>", "<cs> my lords rightly or wrongly the newspapers are full of rumours to the effect that profiting apparently from the illness of president assad the american and israeli governments have come to some agreement to use force to compel the evacuation of the lebanon by the syrian army <e> <s> while i have no reason to suppose that these reports are accurate will the noble baroness say that if by any chance they are the government will make it clear at once that they are entirely opposed to such a dangerous policy which could very possibly lead to an armed confrontation between the two super-powers <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the powerful argument developed by the noble lord lord buxton of alsa to whom we are all very grateful for introducing this subject for debate this afternoon speaking for the benches behind me i should like to put forward what might be called the counter-thesis to the general argument developed by the noble lord <e> <s> in our view the time is now or at any rate very shortly to reconsider our whole policy towards the falkland islands <e> <s> at the moment the attitude of the government appears to be the noble baroness lady young who is to follow me will no doubt correct me if i am wrong as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put this to him <e> <s> i did not suggest that if there were negotiations we should agree that sovereignty would inevitably pass to the argentine <e> <s> i said that if there were negotiations we should not exclude discussion of the question of sovereignty with the object of arriving at some compromise on that question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government agree that if there is to be agreement under a french presidency next year as we all hope and indeed as i myself believe there will be to some extent all members of the community will have to change or modify their present attitudes <e> <s> for instance mr mitterr and will obviously have to go back to his earlier proposal for a reform of the cap and push it strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating the government on their new regulations which we all <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the noble lord correctly he said that there were some countries which do not give any diplomatic immunity to foreign representatives <e> <s> if that is so why do we give them immunity here <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the only conceivable point of deterrence is to have the assured capacity on a possible second strike to inflict totally unacceptable damage on a possible nuclear adversary and that accordingly no attempt should be made to attain what is called nuclear superiority <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating this important statement but speaking i hope with the agreement of noble lords on these benches i am afraid that the general impression created by it in my mind anyhow is that western governments at the stockholm conference were to some extent whistling to keep up their spirits <e> <s> nothing in the statements by the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble baroness will allow me to intervene on one further point of clarification <e> <s> i will read what the statement said <e>", "<cs> my lords contrary to what the noble lord lord vaizey so kindly suggested i fear that i am no expert on unesco in fact i know practically nothing about it <e> <s> i would just say at the start that if what is reported in the article on the director general mr mbow which appeared in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to make what i call a model speech of four minutes expressing therefore in tabloid form the general thesis i have been developing over many years now <e> <s> president reagan says that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought <e> <s> he forbore to say this in and his language almost led one to suppose the opposite <e> <s> but assuming that this apparent change of heart really represents the view of the republican administration what follows <e> <s> it follows logically that if by any chance we have to fight we cannot fight with nuclear weapons <e> <s> that is presumably what it means <e> <s> if so although we need not make any declaration to that effect we must at least act on the assumption that we should not have first recourse to such weapons even if <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that if we are forced into a nuclear posture it means committing suicide <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question necessarily of an attack by the soviet union <e> <s> war may happen by mistake <e> <s> it is quite possible <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords in the immortal

<e> <s> indeed even though i did not hear much of what he had to say i naturally approve of it whatever it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> may i ask whether he really thinks that a policy which would effectively exclude all american atomic weapons and bases from this country and lay down that you will never use nuclear weapons even on a second strike would not provoke a withdrawal of the american forces from germany and hence a break up of the nato alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been press reports that we have been supplying to the iranian government certain material useful for the purposes of war notably rolls-royce engines <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether or not those reports are true <e>", "<cs> my lords in the temporary absence of our own most respected farmer my noble friend lord mackie of benshie it falls to me to make a few observations and i can only hope that they will be considered moderately relevant <e> <s> first it must surely be obvious that on what i might call the overshadowing question of the reform of the common agricultural policy very little progress has been made <e> <s> final agreement if it is ever reached will have to be reached at the next european council meeting not at the next agriculture ministers meeting at the end of march perhaps as a result of some bargain which none of the agriculture ministers will find acceptable or even agreeable <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful to the noble lord for repeating this important statement <e> <s> it is indeed satisfactory that the european parliament has now agreed the regulations regarding our agreed refund of million but it is if i understand the situation correctly necessary to achieve unanimity in the council before these regulations are finally approved <e> <s> it is regrettable that i believe france and italy there is not much secret about that should be reserving their position on this extremely important matter <e> <s> even if they come along on tuesday evening next to a hastily-summoned meeting of the council of foreign ministers after agreement is reached if indeed it is ever reached on the major outstanding points considered by the european council <e> <s> it will still be necessary for the european parliament to agree with the commission on the transfer of funds <e> <s> but i imagine that in such circumstances agreement in brussels in the european council there is unlikely to be much opposition in strasbourg to this transfer of funds <e> <s> perhaps when the noble lord replies he will answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by congratulating the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury on what seems to me and on what i am sure seems to all of us an excellent report <e> <s> i should also like to say how much i agree with the last speaker that if we are to enter into any kind of negotiation and particularly this kind of negotiation we must be prepared to compromise that is to say we need not necessarily stick to our original thesis or proposals whatever they may be <e> <s> i do not know if that is the policy of the present government but i only hope it is <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we have to get together to resolve these difficulties <e> <s> nobody disputes that <e> <s> but as i understand it the policy laid down by the labour party is that our membership of the common market is not good in itself under the present conditions that it must be totally reformed and therefore we must get out of it and negotiate something better <e> <s> that is how i understand it to be <e> <s> perhaps i am wrong and i stand to be corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government maintain that the provision of these engines to iran does not in any way help the ayatollah khomeini in the prosecution of his war against iraq <e> <s> would they not admit that if by any chance the ayatollah khomeini won the war against iraq and occupied iraq the effect from our point of view would be totally disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords in the statement read out by the noble viscount <e> <s> it says that presumably as part of a deal which includes some agreement on the common agricultural policy the united kingdom was invited to accept a five-year <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government agree that if there are to be discussions with a very well disposed argentinian government they are not likely to make much progress if they take place at all unless the government admit without committing themselves on the question of sovereignty that in the long run and in the end such discussions would not exclude the discussion of the political future of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness and indeed sympathise with her for having to repeat this wholly deplorable statement <e> <s> i have only one substantial question to put to her <e> <s> have the government no apprehension that if we go on digging our heels in and refusing to make any concessions as i understand it on our original demand for a refund of million more especially given the very small sum which is apparently now involved in the long run our nine partners might be tempted to proceed in accordance with the original treaty of rome and take a decision on an increase in the vat ceiling by a qualified majority vote <e> <s> that is an action which i believe they might feel justified in taking in spite of the so-called and unofficial luxembourg compromise <e> <s> incidentally i imagine that such a procedure might eventually be resorted to if the irish remain in a permanent minority of one in their demand for unrestricted milk production <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be quite wrong but i thought i saw it stated in the press that the latest decision of the agriculture ministers welcome though it is on general grounds is likely to raise the cost of the common agricultural policy during the coming year by something like billion unless i misread the figure <e> <s> if that is so seeing that as we understand it the community is already at the end of its resources or practically so how are the additional funds to be raised <e> <s> where is the money going to come from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> in the event that mr savimbi who i understand is holding these hostages would say that our intervention on behalf of the hostages constitutes some form of recognition the government should firmly repudiate any such suggestion since my understanding is that nothing of the sort arises in the event <e> <s> but i imagine that out of the release of the hostages he would try to make such political capital as he can <e> <s> i hope that the government will be able to resist that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the soviet navy is now fully equipped with anti-ship missiles of the latest type and very efficient ones too i understand and is that not reason for the <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches we too are obliged to the noble baroness for repeating the answer given to the private notice question and would like to associate ourselves with the expressions of sympathy to the victims of this disaster to their relations and to everybody else concerned on the islands <e> <s> i am sure that there is very little point in trying to track down who if anybody was responsible for this unfortunate fire <e> <s> i do not think that anything will be gained by doing so <e>", "<cs> is it not becoming clear that the maintenance by her majestys government of what might i suppose be properly described as a gaullist attitude towards our contribution to the budget is becoming increasingly untenable <e> <s> i may be wrong but as i understand it the general formula governing the long-term contribution of members to the budget has now been more or less agreed and the outstanding point apparently is the actual amount which separates our estimation of what we should pay from that of our nine colleagues <e> <s> i believe this is only about million <e> <s> why not therefore just call it a day and say we will accept a compromise whereby we go fifty-fifty and accept million instead of million thus probably ending the controversy straight away <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the noble lord aright when he said that we would never in any circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons or indeed any other kind of weapon but in any case a nuclear weapon <e> <s> is that what he said <e>", "<cs> therefore including a nuclear weapon my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if those negotiations do not succeed could not her majestys government consider setting up a station on ascension island <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question relating to the future <e> <s> until recently i should have thought that what the libyans have done might constitute a virtual act of aggression under the united nations charter and should therefore be taken by us to the security council <e> <s> clearly

raising this question at this moment <e> <s> we have not debated it for some time and it is a very good thing that we should debate it now <e> <s> i think i can agree with everything the noble earl has said <e> <s> i doubt that we are being unduly complacent perhaps we are but i should like to think that perhaps we are not <e> <s> i am going to make certain suggestions later on as to what we might do otherwise i agree entirely with what the noble earl has said <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the whole idea of an air land battle plan is a highly controversial strategy

rightly paid to our ambassador and his staff whose conduct throughout the whole of the recent period seems to us to have been impeccable <e> <s> i myself do not wish to criticise the actions which the government have taken since the terrible incident in st jamess square but i believe that many noble lords will join me in thinking that the government should have acted when the embassy was taken over

"<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that as i said in my speech scanning is absolutely useless unless having detected something in it one has the right to open the bag <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government come to the view on reflection that the conclusions of the scientists are justified or even partly justified is not the conclusion obvious that no government can take the initiative in using these weapons even in the event of war <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand from the press though we may be wrong that president reagan was reproached by some of his colleagues though not apparently by the prime minister about the maintenance of the enormous us deficit of some billion dollars and the consequent maintenance of high interest rates which according to some are destroying us all <e> <s> was he reproached by any including the prime minister for the principal reason for this deficit which is his vast expenditure on nuclear armaments such as mx the new trident programme thousands of cruise missiles star wars stealth bombers and everything else which unless for first use are useless from the long-term political point of view and at the same time are economically disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not becoming clearer and clearer that when negotiations are resumed as indeed they must be short of a disaster the british and french so-called nuclear deterrents must be discussed at the same time as the discussions on the question of intermediate nuclear missiles because really that is what they are <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government agree that

to come rather closer to the solution which our colleagues are now proposing themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords this agreement though as we think much overdue is certainly very welcome to all those who believe in the development of greater european unity and indeed in the future political development of the eec <e> <s> the next step as has already been said by several speakers will be to get agreement among the finance ministers as to the so-called budgetary discipline <e> <s> this we all admit will be difficult though not impossible <e> <s> but on the assumption that real progress is now at last possible i would simply ask the noble viscount whether the scheme recently approved by the european parliament is going to be discussed in this house and in another place <e> <s> it may not be totally acceptable but we think many of its features are clearly desirable if not essential if we are to advance towards the political goals which have already been accepted by all the governments concerned <e> <s> notably of course the system based on the continuous and abusive use of a national veto must be greatly modified if we are to avoid complete stalemate when the eec is enlarged by the addition of spain and portugal <e> <s> so i repeat my question my lords when if at all is the european parliaments scheme going to be debated in this house and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords we

that if as i believe is the case the nigerian government deny all responsibility for this outrage it is up to them to do their best to discover who is responsible and if possible to bring them to justice <e> <s> if on the other hand the nigerian government by any means implicitly or explicitly admit responsibility surely it is for them to express great regrets and to say that so far as they are concerned it will never happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating this important statement and to express our dismay at the fact that the talks so evidently necessary have now for whatever reason broken down <e> <s> the first question that i should like to ask the noble baroness is this <e> <s> was the specifically agreed arrangement as it is called that sovereignty should not be discussed formulated in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would agree to publish the documents in which the agreement was arrived at <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble baroness for repeating that important answer <e> <s> i think we would all agree that the european parliaments recent action is quite deplorable and doubtfully legal

respect of the budgetary negotiations now in progress <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that if my information is correct it may not be but i hope it is the english peerage law lays it down that and i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing of course that there was no question at yalta of dividing europe into spheres of influence would the government not agree that even given that the conclusions of that conference were not actually binding on anybody the existing frontiers in eastern europe were at least <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in assuming that the difficulties now

ask him whether he is prepared to reply to my inquiry about the desirability of a freeze on the production of nuclear weapons and also the desirability of mutual withdrawal of battlefield weapons from the centre of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not evident even before the publication of this report that civil defence provision against what might be called a strictly limited nuclear war which i think is very improbable need not greatly exceed the provision of civil defence against conventional weapons whereas any provision for defence against any serious nuclear attack will be absolutely money wasted because such defence is quite impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords there are four altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches too can only deplore and condemn this apparently gratuitous assassination and extend all our sympathy to the family of the unfortunate victim <e> <s> it only shows to what dangers our foreign service representatives are now exposed all over the

shortly have an opportunity in his house of discussing whether the public pronouncements and i repeat the phrase public pronouncements of president reagan on the subject of star wars are fully in accord with what we understand to be the spirit at least of the camp david agreement might i at this point merely inquire whether the government are satisfied that british participation in research on this as i think totally misguided project will not result in a brain drain or at any rate in the deflection of british scientists from the study of what i believe to be much more profitable and

called the western union not only a secretariat but a secretary-general functioned entirely successfully in london until nato got going and quite often formulated a common foreign policy notably as regards the conduct of the cold war <e> <s> do noble lords not also think it is rather paradoxical that nato which has no supra-national content whatsoever has both a large secretariat and a secretary-general while the european economic community on the political side which is supposed to further european union has had nothing of the kind up to now <e> <s> will the government now put all their interests in spite of any objection on the part of the commission behind the establishment in brussels of not only a very small political secretariat but a proper political secretariat with a proper secretary-general <e>", "<cs> my lords could the government in any case make representations to the bbc respecting their as i think totally inadequate and indeed misleading presentation of star wars in panorama last night which consisted largely of bangs fireworks and rather bogus predictions serious arguments for and against being reduced to bald statements mostly in favour of president reagans appalling plan the real opponents of the scheme whether labour or alliance being restricted to a couple of sentences uttered by dr owen and mr healey respectively right at the end of the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the conclusions of the helsinki final act although morally binding on the signatories are not legally binding on the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose we can all have our personal opinions on the situation in nicaragua and it may well be that these will differ to some extent but most of us irrespective of party would probably feel that whatever its limitations and the possible dangers inherent in the sandinista government although i think with all respect to the noble viscount who has just left us it can hardly be described on any rational basis of estimation as marxist leninist it is at least preferable to the appalling and corrupt dictatorship of somoza whose tough agents known as contras are now doing their best to overthrow it with considerable american support <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be but all i can say is that the americans still regard it as their back yard even though it may be miles away <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a case that if we stop testing our own weapons in america there might be some chance of persuading the french to stop testing their weapons in muroroa but otherwise there is not a chance at all <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating this important statement <e>", "<cs> for making this important statement i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i thought that the house of commons was back and of course it is not <e> <s> however there are some things which remain rather obscure in this extraordinary and i must say highly regrettable affair <e> <s> is it a fact for instance that the general formula on the basis of which the plo representatives had apparently agreed to participate in the talks which was reproduced in the statement made by the noble baroness was publicly repudiated only a few hours before the talks were supposed to take place by only one as the noble lord who has just spoken said and not by both of the palestinian representatives <e> <s> next was it really agreed when the plo leaders were invited to take part in the talks by the prime minister that this formula on the basis of which they agreed to participate in the talks should only be published immediately after the talks had ended <e> <s> if so why <e> <s> if agreed in principle why was not the formula published when the invitation was actually issued <e> <s> after all if it had been formally and publicly agreed by the jordanians and the palestinians then it could hardly have been repudiated later <e> <s> are we consequently obliged to assume that the talks were at <e>", "<cs> why was it not agreed before <e>", "<cs> my lords i well remember during the war writing papers in the foreign office on the possibility of forming some kind of western european association after it <e> <s> when the war was over i even found myself soon negotiating under the direction of mr bevin the famous treaty of brussels which set up what was called the western union on the council of which i then represented her majestys government <e> <s> after that i actually drafted a great deal of the charter of the council of europe <e> <s> when i arrived in paris as ambassador i witnessed at close range the sad collapse of the european defence community which on reflection was no doubt too idealistic in conception <e> <s> i witnessed also with expressed dismay our own failure to associate ourselves with the negotiations for what eventually led to the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not obvious that if we really want to stop an increase in the production of nuclear weapons we must arrange for all concerned to stop testing weapons in other words to indulge in what is called a nuclear freeze <e> <s> that is the only logical way to stop it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one short question regarding the final sentence in this important statement <e> <s> we understand from that that the president revealed to the prime minister and her colleagues the general nature of his approach to his important meeting with mr gorbachev <e> <s> surely on her return the prime minister will have revealed what the general nature of his approach was going to be <e> <s> i can hardly imagine that that would not be so <e> <s> without asking any indiscreet questions what i should like to know is whether the general support given by the prime minister to this important approach by the president contains also support for his attitude to the vexed question of star wars in the forthcoming talks in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords as the secretary to the preparatory commission of the united nations which made all the arrangements for the holding of the first general assembly in london in january and which recruited a considerable number of civil servants who went on to new york with the new secretary general mr trygve lie then as acting secretary general for a period of two or three weeks when the assembly met in london i may i suppose be expected to say a few words about my broad impressions of how the world organisation has progressed if indeed progressed is the right word during the ensuing years <e> <s> i fear that i have largely confided my views on this point to the media already but i shall endeavour to insinuate in my remarks a few original ideas <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords for reasons which i shall give i am extremely grateful to my noble kinsman lord thomas of swynnerton for allowing me to take his place on the list of speakers <e> <s> the fact is that shortly after returning from my visit to new york where i was celebrating the th anniversary of the united nations i was advised to go slow for a period and in any case to go to bed very early <e> <s> i am not sure whether that is due to the journey or to the celebrations <e> <s> however i fear that i shall be prevented from hearing the noble lords winding up speech <e> <s> if he considers it appropriate not to refer to my remarks then i shall entirely understand <e> <s> however in the circumstances he may be prepared to make an exception <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason because we are living in a nuclear age that we should indulge in any obviously absurd policy <e> <s> i described the whole effort of president reagans initiative recently as the ultimate absurdity of the scientific imagination and that is what i firmly believe it to be <e> <s> therefore we must still if only faintly hope that what i suppose might be the combined efforts of mr shultz <e> <s> mr reagan and mr paul nitze will when it comes to the point prevail over what might be called the perleberger school of thought perhaps to the extent of letting it be known to mr gorbachev that in practice star wars can only be pursued to the extent that funds provided by congress allow and that if he is eminently reasonable on strategic and indeed on intermediate nuclear weapons those in congress who fundamentally favour some arms limitation deal will see to it that the presidents vision vanishes with his term of office or even before he resigns his office <e> <s> i say faintly because the very considerable amount of money already being spent on this fearful scheme may well imbue it with a momentum which congress many of whose constituents will greatly benefit from it financially may find it impossible to stop <e>", "<cs> my lords in what circumstances do the government think it will ever be possible to have a ban on nuclear testing <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has twice quoted the passage in the statement which states that <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to confine my remarks to an aspect of higher education in which i happen to retain an interest that is the desirability of providing profitable educational facilities in this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it that the noble earl will reply in writing to the various questions i put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble baroness nevertheless agree that progress towards a settlement in the middle east is unlikely until such time as the americans and the russians get together and once again summon a conference in geneva under their joint chairmanship <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not every reason to suppose that whatever experiments the russians may now be conducting they are just as unlikely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords once again thanks to my noble friend lord kennet we have the opportunity of considering the disastrous star wars project launched some three years ago by a no doubt idealistic president of the united states largely on the advice of the so-called father of the hydrogen bomb the violently anti-soviet doctor edward teller <e> <s> the project is also enthusiastically supported on purely political grounds so far as we can see by those mostly west coast republicans who are keen above all on heavy united states nuclear rearmament and who rightly see in it the possibility of scuppering the arms limitation talks at geneva and the consequent abandonment of the proven doctrine of mutual assured destruction in favour of the so-called doctrine of mutual assured security which as i have said repeatedly in this house affords no security for anyone except possibly the americans and very doubtfully even for them <e>", "<cs> my lords it surely means that one side cannot go ahead without the permission of the other <e>", "<cs> my lords it has now been said that in no circumstances will the american administration subject themselves to a russian veto in such discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us exactly what is meant by sport <e> <s> may we take it for instance that chess is sport <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the appalling economic situation that will confront the unfortunate new president of the philippines will the government assist in any efforts that may be made to alleviate the debt repayments of the philippines that now amount i believe to billion dollars <e> <s> will they also assist in any efforts that may be made to recover any of the vast sums appropriated and exported by the late frightful president <e>", "<cs> my lords if by any chance which god forbid because we must all hope that the protestants will eventually see reason and accept the anglo-irish agreement there would be what would amount to a rebellion in northern ireland would the government in the last resort and if necessary i repeat in the last resort and if necessary be prepared to overcome such a rebellion by what would amount to the force of arms <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house what is the exact position regarding the discussions or otherwise at geneva of asat that is to say anti-satellite activities and the possibility that each side might shoot down the others satellites <e> <s> that is a very important aspect <e> <s> what is the position <e> <s> is it being discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the noble baroness that asat is now being discussed at geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government believe that the american government are justified in regarding a whole series of terrorist attacks against their nationals not all of them inspired by the libyan government as an armed attack coming within the scope of article of the charter would it not equally be possible for us to argue that years of terrorist outrages against us by the ira are the equivalent of an armed attack on us and that we <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the prospects for our exports be brighter if we were now able to join the european monetary system <e>", "<cs> my lords contrary to the opinion of some of my compatriots i do not regard the recent bombardment as a crime <e> <s> it was undertaken because a large majority of the american people sincerely believed that colonel gaddafi was the enemy of all civilized society and that peaceful efforts to restrain his activities having demonstrably failed military means had become absolutely necessary <e> <s> however it was the wise talleyrand who observed that a certain decision of napoleon was <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble baroness lady young for repeating this statement <e> <s> the measures taken against libya by the council of ministers and announced in this statement are obviously good as far as they go <e> <s> but why should not members of the community be prepared like us to sever all diplomatic relations with the libyan government so long as that government maintain their insane policy of terrorism <e> <s> after all in our case even in the absence of any diplomatic relations our nationals in libya do not seem to have suffered in any particular way and our trade with libya seems to continue quite happily <e> <s> therefore why should members of the ec not follow our example and confide their interests as we have confided ours to some neutral state such as switzerland <e> <s> if they did so they would not be worse off and the pressure on colonel gaddafi would i should have thought be very great <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house how far existing prison officers salaries compare with equivalent grades in the police force <e> <s> if that information is not immediately available will he let me have it in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the whole idea of a separate sdi for western europe if that is the intention which even if practical against strategic missiles which is highly doubtful could not possibly defend us against cruise missiles whether launched from aeroplanes or from the ground or indeed against low trajectory missiles an absurd illusion and a complete waste of money <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree with what the noble lord lord cledwyn has said may i ask whether the government agree that there is unfortunately no chance of the israeli government accepting anything like the venice proposals as a basis for negotiation unless the united states government are prepared to exercise some pressure on the israeli government <e> <s> if experience is any guide that is the last thing that i should think we might expect them to do <e>", "<cs> my lords what do the government think of the chances of the proposed legislation for extradition from america of alleged terrorists what does the noble lord think about the prospects of it going through in the near future <e> <s> will the government bring all pressure to bear on the administration and on congress to have such legislation passed <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any reason to suppose that the inhabitants of gibraltar any more than the inhabitants of the falklands should have a veto on any decisions as to their future that may be arrived at after negotiation which in the opinion of the parliament in westminster are in the interests of those inhabitants of this country itself and indeed of the peace of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords what evidence is there in the possession of the government that the present iranian government are behind and are supporting the activities of revolutionary shiite movements in other countries of the middle east and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness be so kind as to make a reply in writing to the supplementary question that i put <e>", "<cs> my lords discussion of defence in this house to which i agree more time ought to be devoted often concentrates on details rather than on general principles <e> <s> so today while saluting an admirable introductory speech by the noble lord lord trefgarne i should like to dwell on one broad factor namely something that i consider to be a potential long-term danger to the alliance inherent in certain transatlantic attitudes <e>", "<cs> my lords what are the crimes that these men are supposed to have committed <e>", "<cs> my lords what offences are the men supposed to have committed <e> <s> of what are they accused <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine myself to a few general reflections which might conceivably bear on action <e> <s> i start with a personal experience <e> <s> at the beginning of now just over years ago i was appointed by mr eden as he then was to be a member of a league of nations sub-committee in geneva set up to consider and make recommendations about the application of sanctions which was a new term then taken in principle by the league of nations against italy because of the flagrant violation of the covenants inherent in her invasion of ethiopia <e> <s> it was one of the most futile committees i have ever attended and that is saying a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches are sorry that the foreign and commonwealth secretary is not now going to south africa though it seems that he may go later in the month <e> <s> we must surely recognise that if and when he goes to south africa there is only a very faint chance of his achieving anything by so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government not agree that while tension between east and west chiefly owing to the very nature of the soviet regime is likely to continue almost indefinitely there is no reason why we should not arrive at a perfectly good and durable understanding as regards nuclear weapons and arms control generally <e> <s> it is obviously in the interests of both east and west to promote it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government agree that partial sanctions are unlikely to be effective and that only universal sanctions will ever have the required effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the reaction of noble lords on these benches to the statement which we thank the noble lord for repeating differs rather materially from that taken up by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> we think it is satsifactory that there should be agreement on the budget in the negotiations now taking place in geneva <e> <s> it is satisfactory as such <e> <s> it only shows what the community can do when it sets its mind to it or perhaps i should say when it is really up against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i must thank the noble baroness for a moderately satisfactory reply <e> <s> would she not however agree that of the many innovative measures as they are called agreed in nassau there were i think no less than eight only a few are now being vigorously pursued <e> <s> would the noble baroness also agree that at the moment when the commonwealth seems to be in some danger of disintegration it is all the more important to proceed with measures which even if they may not be of the first importance are designed in the long run to encourage greater unity among commonwealth members <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government agree that the only sensible way to end the war between iraq and iran which otherwise may go on for ever to say nothing of the palestinian problem would be for the two super powers jointly to summon a conference on middle eastern affairs generally <e> <s> that would mean accepting that the soviet union had at least a role to play in middle eastern affairs <e> <s> if that is not possible at the moment and it is not likely to be possible until the end of the russian occupation of afghanistan will the government say that they approve in principle of such a development which i need hardly say is welcomed by mr gorbachev <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not probable that progress in this important direction would be much more likely if the government now agreed to negotiate with the argentine government on all outstanding points including not necessarily the vexed question of sovereignty but at any rate the political future of the islands <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness speaks about consultations does that mean that we shall be told what line the president will take up at reykjavik in regard <e> <s> for example to a matter which notably concerns us namely intermediate weapons <e> <s> if we are being told what line he will take up have we an opportunity of saying what we think on this very important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give us an assurance that this house will have an opportunity of discussing the situation arising from the reykjavik conference soon after it ends <e>", "<cs> my noble friend and colleague lord banks is in charge of this bill so far as we are concerned and consequently he will deal with any individual amendments as and when they arise <e> <s> however in view of my -year association with what i might call the european idea and indeed european institutions generally it has been thought suitable by my colleagues for me to say now just a few words only a few words on the basic and fundamental decision which will confront the committee when it votes this afternoon <e> <s> therefore i propose to intervene now in this debate once only and i shall not except of course by my vote contest any of the numerous individual amendments proposed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington along with those of the noble and learned lord lord denning all of which i regard as simple wrecking amendments designed as it were to tear the guts out of the recently concluded single european act <e>", "<cs> we have a moral right to do anything however foolish it is <e> <s> all i said was that if the committee passed the amendments we should not be able to renegotiate the document <e> <s> it would fail and the consequences would stare us in the face <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not paradoxical that the american government as i understand is the case should still have diplomatic relations with the government in nicaragua which on the face of it they now seemed pledged to destroy <e>", "<cs> my lords irrespective of the short discussion that we may have on the private notice question on wednesday will it be possible for this house to have a formal discussion of a greater and larger nature on this event of world shaking importance namely the icelandic conference <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not obvious that in the present political circumstances it is more and more in the interests of this country to come in with european concerns and industry generally even if the actual commercial prospect is not altogether alluring <e>", "<cs> my lords is this conference if held likely to have any noticeable influence on public opinion anywhere except possibly in denmark <e>", "<cs> my lords i have three very short questions to put to the government <e> <s> in the first place is it not rather odd that in spite of an unparalleled propaganda campaign the president is facing widespread criticism in the united states whereas in this country where nuclear arms limitation means so much many people including it would seem our own prime minister are seemingly finding excuses for his insistence on the full operation of his as i think absurd star wars programme even imputing blame to mr gorbachev for as it were being too clever by half <e>", "<cs> my lords how long has this matter been outstanding <e> <s> is not the law taking a great deal of time to make up its mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that whatever natos decision may be if there is an attack by the russians anywhere in europe in which only conventional weapons are used whether to use nuclear weapons to check that conventional onslaught will in practice depend upon the president of the united states <e> <s> he may indeed seek our advice but whether in such circumstances nuclear weapons are to be employed will be an american decision <e> <s> personally i think that it is doubtful whether they would use them <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to assume that the european defence ministers assembled at gleneagles were unanimous in approving president reagans totally uncompromising stand on sdi <e> <s> is that or is it not a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords this i suppose is the occasion on which to make a few general remarks on the vastly important and rather alarming subjects of foreign affairs and defence <e> <s> in the time available it is not possible to say very much and so i shall limit my remarks to what i regard as a few contentious subjects <e> <s> in any case it is surely absurd to consider foreign affairs and defence together <e> <s> we should certainly have a full days debate on defence <e>", "<cs> my lords if you think that two fishery vessels are going to police this area satisfactorily well you can believe that if you like but obviously it will not be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government really going to insist on the fact that there cannot be any negotiations with the argentines unless we include on the agenda sovereignty it being obvious that we need not give away anything on sovereignty <e> <s> but we could discuss all kinds of variants of sovereignty which have been widely discussed in the press and president alfonsin has already said that he is prepared to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he is going to ignore totally the argument put forward about linkage <e> <s> do the government really think that there can be no agreement on arms control unless the soviet union agrees at the same time to notable concessions in human rights the evacuation of afghanistan and so on <e> <s> does the noble lord not believe that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am right in thinking that the soviet union does not recognise the recently proclaimed fisheries protection zone are we to assume that in the event of violation of that zone by soviet trawlers it will result in a confrontation between us and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to put one or two short questions to the noble viscount <e> <s> we welcome the fact that agreement was reached that priority should be given in the arms control negotiations to an inf agreement on the terms suggested <e> <s> but do the government think it at all probable that mr gorbachev for his part will agree to such a solution in the absence of any modification of the present united states policy on research and deployment of star wars <e> <s> secondly if effective nuclear deterrence is a cornerstone of nato would not any zero/zero solution in regard to ballistic missiles which was apparently contemplated in reykjavik if put to effect cause this cornerstone of nato to disappear <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by saying that unlike my usual custom and greatly to my regret owing to a long outstanding engagement which i cannot avoid i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> i shall therefore entirely understand if the noble lord who is to reply for the government does not make any mention of my speech but i should be very grateful it as was the case with my speech during the debate on the queens speech the other day he will he able eventually to reply in writing to my various questions and indeed to the points that i am now about to raise <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former member of the european parliament and as one of the presidents of the european movement i feel that i ought to put my personal views on record <e> <s> it appears to me extraordinary that a government who profess to be european in outlook should in effect decline to accept in advance any proposals for universal suffrage in the european parliament in accordance with a uniform procedure in all member states if such proposals should include election by some form of proportional representation <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord dacre whose speech we all so greatly admired i should perhaps start even after the lapse of about half a century and subject of course to the official secrets act by declaring a certain limited interest <e> <s> during and the early part of i was in fact as private secretary to the head of the foreign office sir alexander cadogan the sole direct link with what is now i understand known as mi but not with mi which was responsible to the home secretary <e> <s> in that capacity i was assisted by one lady typist and as war approached by an elderly retired diplomat <e> <s> that was all the assistance i had <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible that these vast debts might one day be repudiated <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what percentage of the vast total stocks more particularly of butter it is now contemplated will shortly be given away to the poor and needy <e> <s> what is the physical percentage <e>", "<cs> my lords is ireland the only state which has not yet ratified <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the government agree that it would to say the least be counterproductive to sell arms or anything which could materially increase its striking power in war to this wholly deplorable and profoundly anti-western government <e>", "<cs> my lords may we perhaps know how many measures for the completion of the market are now outstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that moderately reassuring reply <e> <s> i hope that he <e>", "<cs> first is it not obvious that the broad interpretation of the abm treaty on which mr weinbergers plan is based whereby you reverse what the treaty says on the simple grounds that new techniques now exist for accomplishing what it expressly forbids <e>", "<cs> is a repudiation of the treaty and must be so considered by all fair minded people <e> <s> in the second place <e>", "<cs> will not the government also agree that if this interpretation is approved it will result in a failure of the arms limitation talks at geneva <e> <s> finally if mr weinbergers plan is thereafter put into operation <e>", "<cs> would it not result inevitably in a kind of nuclear war in space which some people in america would probably desire <e>", "<cs> my lords i have frequently heard more than one supplementary question put by the initiator <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that many people in this country are at this moment rather confused and indeed rather apathetic about defence which is thought to be terribly complicated and controversial <e> <s> no doubt it is <e> <s> the fear of nuclear war is less than it was <e> <s> even cnd seems to be losing some of its emotional appeal <e> <s> like my noble friend lord mayhew whose excellent speech i warmly support i do not mind if cnd loses its appeal <e> <s> but i worry about existing apathy for i feel the situation is now much more dangerous than is commonly thought <e>", "<cs> my lords will the trident missile be targeted on soviet towns or on soviet missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government at least agree that any proposals in connection with sdi for nuclear tests in space would in the absence of agreement with the russians be a clear violation of the abm treaty of <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government feel that the recent substantial quantity of arms provided by the american administration to the government of the ayatollah khomeini will have any noticeable result on the outcome of this unfortunate war <e>", "<cs> my lords may we take it that if peace studies are undertaken they will include not only the propagation of cnds views but also an examination of the dangers of those ideas from the point of view of the preservation of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> where exactly does that indisputable evidence come from <e> <s> from what source is it derived <e> <s> do the government believe in any case that the russians are ceasing to construct at krasnoyarsk <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the interpretation of international treaties something which under its statute the international court of justice is specifically entitled and indeed expected to undertake <e>", "<cs> my lords we assume that the company concerned is fully insured against any loss arising out of this dreadful disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the well-known agreement between the prime minister and the president at camp david do the government welcome the very considerable opposition which is building up now in congress against a so-called broad interpretation of the abm treaty of <e>", "<cs> my lords in minutes or so anything that one says on the all-important subject so appropriately raised this afternoon by the noble lord lord home of the hirsel can only be rather summary and dogmatic <e> <s> it cannot be anything else <e> <s> but perhaps i might begin in the same sort of way as the noble lord began his speech by saying that if i remember correctly it was oscar wilde who said that britain and the united states had everything in common except of course the language <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness i think that i did not say quite that <e> <s> the americans perhaps i had better write to her about it <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that a representative of nato presumably could only be the noble lord lord carrington <e> <s> would it not put the noble lord lord carrington in an impossible position if he attended these meetings in the absence of any complete unanimity on arms control by any representative of nato <e>", "<cs> my lords instead of merely waiting for a consensus which may take years why cannot the government tentatively put forward in a green paper their own ideas for discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords could we not have a system <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may echo what my noble friend lord diamond said about the evident success which in many ways attended the visit of the prime minister to the soviet union <e> <s> it was certainly a most remarkable effort on her part and we are especially glad that she found herself able to express a degree of trust in mr gorbachev <e> <s> we can only hope that this degree of trust will be reciprocated by president reagan and the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied that the work undertaken by the united states government at fylingdales is in strict conformity with the narrow interpretation of the abm treaty of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government not agree that if they should accept in principle the proposed east-west deal on intermediate nuclear weapons the risk as suggested by some of ultimately putting western europe at the mercy of the russians is quite unreal always supposing that the american army remains in europe and that the west retains sufficient protected nuclear capability to attack both the russians armies when and if they invade and the soviet union itself <e>", "<cs> my lords even at this late hour will the government consider issuing some kind of order prohibiting the publishing of the results of polls during the fortnight preceding a general election <e>", "<cs> my lords to what extent are the recipients of this poison notably norway and germany blaming us for its production <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount agrees with his noble friend lord renton that nuclear war is highly unlikely and even impossible what is the point of organising civil defences against such an eventuality <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the two vast subjects of foreign affairs and defence are as i think misguidedly taken together <e> <s> without unduly boring your lordships i propose to deal chiefly with the basic theory of defence the <e>", "<cs> my lords further to what my noble leader said does it not emerge from this deplorable incident that the prime minister is left in a minority of one on a highly important issue involving the whole future of the community <e> <s> does it not emerge that it is her belief that the community should be run on the lines of a successful shop whereas in practice in a collection of sovereign states common decisions can only be reached for the common good provided they are reached at all on the basis of hard fought political compromises some of which will not always be acceptable to other members of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government at least admit that some revision of the official secrets act is now really necessary in the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the few surviving drafters of the charter of the united nations i need hardly say that i greatly welcome this <e>", "<cs> my lords while associating myself very largely with what some of my colleagues on this side of the house have said i should like to ask the government whether they agree that if the approach recommended by the noble lord lord molloy was successful it would presumably mean the fusion of armenians living in turkey with armenians in the soviet republic a similar fusion of azerbaijanis in iran with co-nationals to the north the creation of a large kurdish state against the will of iran turkey and iraq and the possible secession of khusistan from persia <e> <s> if so does the noble lord suppose that all that would diminish tension in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that as matters stand the best and possibly the only peaceful solution to the problems of the gulf would be co-operation in respect of some possible arms embargo on iran always assuming that iran does not abide by the original security council resolution on armistice between the soviet union and the united states <e> <s> would not the best way of achieving that be to push in the security council for some resolution which would be accepted by all the five permanent members of the security council plus four others <e> <s> it is not impossible to imagine that <e> <s> what is our security council representative doing if anything to push that concept <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the present discussion must relate to the bp share issue <e> <s> may we have the noble lords assurance that we shall have an early opportuntiy to discuss the reasons and responsibility for the stock market crash <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps at this point i may be permitted to say that as the great great grandson of hal dundas the first viscount melville i particularly welcome the appointment of a scot to the office of lord high chancellor of this kingdom thus emphasising as i see it the essentially federal nature of our constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that iraq is prepared to have a cease-fire agreement and iran at the moment is not <e> <s> therefore if there is going to be an arms embargo surely it must apply to iran and not to iraq <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not evident that if we are to proceed on the general lines laid down in the single european act we shall before long be obliged to agree that all matters concerning vat policy shall be decided in the council of ministers by means of a qualified majority vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by adding to what seems to have been a chorus of praise in which i think the noble lord lord plumb participated in his very powerful maiden speech for the committee and its chairman on what seems to me as a non-expert to have been a really first-class report <e> <s> i again as non-expert wholly agree with all the conclusions in this report <e> <s> i only hope that her majestys government when they come to reply to this debate will announce their ability to do so too <e> <s> if not i shall be very interested to hear exactly why they object to any of these conclusions so that we may know where we stand <e> <s> i may be wrong but i think that her majestys government have already accepted have they not <e> <s> the proposal that in principle members contributions to revenue should be based on gnp rather than on vat <e> <s> if that is not so i shall be interested to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords how far will this refusal on the part of her majestys government affect the possible production in this country of the well-known hotol aircraft which is capable apparently of reaching australia in an hour or two <e>", "<cs> my lords as the soviet government have recently permitted american experts to inspect a similar installation at krasnoyarsk will the government suggest to our <e>", "<cs> my lords what are the governments views on the nuclear defence policy of the western world <e> <s> does the minister agree that it is now absolutely essential for the european members of nato to make immediate progress in the direction of a common conventional defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with attention to the interesting speech of the noble lord lord kennet and i am in very great measure in agreement with him <e> <s> however i think that he will understand that my own approach may be a little different <e> <s> one can have different views on such a tremendous subject <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government really believe that if the americans leave europe and go back to america and we by any chance find ourselves at war with the soviet union we could induce the soviet union to withdraw its troops by threatening to use our trident bomb on moscow or other cities in the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> but does she admit that the government and the commonwealth secretariat have been painfully slow in pursuing the admirable objective of distance learning <e> <s> and will she note that i still cannot understand why the government do not admit the desirability of situating the university in london especially since it would then have at its immediate disposal the services of the bbc with its unique experience in distance learning <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in assuming that all the government have done is to give a half assurance of the contribution of a very small amount along with barbados and botswana to this very creative project <e>", "<cs> my lords may it not have been wiser to invest a substantial proportion of the billions emanating from north sea oil in the rehabilitation of our industries and major towns in this country rather than investing it in overseas assets <e> <s> the value of these assets is decreasing by leaps and bounds <e>", "<cs> my lords although i agree with a great deal of what the noble viscount the leader of the house has said will he not admit that the only way in which a body such as the european community can be successfully run is by a willingness on the part of all members occasionally to make concessions to other peoples point of view in order to arrive at any agreement <e> <s> is it not the case that our very dynamic prime minister has a tendency to regard any possible concessions on her part as inadmissible fudge <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that we must all congratulate the noble lord lord cledwyn on his extreme prescience in selecting this day for his debate <e> <s> i cannot think how he did it <e> <s> in view of the limitations on time i shall not repeat what has already been said by many noble lords and notably by the three excellent maiden speakers about the extreme significance of the treaty signed yesterday and the hopes it holds out for further nuclear disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will forgive me if i profit from this occasion of not longer than five minutes i assure your lordships by recalling that my own opposition to star wars dates from its actual inception in march <e> <s> although the president may as we know be among those very few who sincerely believe in his dream that it will result in the total abolition of all nuclear weapons i assure your lordships and i have assured you before that in my view the real object of the promoters of this unfortunate project was and still is in the first place to make immense sums of money for the armaments industry and all those institutions and persons associated with it <e> <s> then next to spread abroad the impression that the republican party is in favour of what is called peace <e> <s> finally to block any limitation of nuclear arms on the legitimate assumption that the russians will never willingly agree to any effective violation of the abm treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether or not the prime minister agrees with the broad interpretation of the treaty <e>", "<cs> my position remains exactly as it was <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the intervention of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls is it not a fact that industrial development in the regions of this country is often materially assisted by substantial grants from the european commission acting under the general authority of the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government say what in their view is the ideal solution to this terrible problem <e> <s> do they think it would be sufficient if there was just autonomy that is to say practical independence for the west bank and for gaza in some kind of relationship with israel or would they contemplate the formation eventually of some israel/arab state with joint responsibilities and joint rights for both races within the boundaries of the old palestinian mandate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord able to say whether the government are aware of the opinion of the british commissioner in brussels lord cockfield as regards whether or not satisfactory progress is now being made towards the attainment of a single internal market <e> <s> is he entirely satisfied with the attitude of her majestys government in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that there is no possible protection for the population in the event of nuclear bombardment <e> <s> is it not absurd to imagine that there ever could be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether in his view it is really out of the question for the security council to constitute some force under the auspices of the united nations for patrolling the gulf which of course it is fully entitled to do under the united nations charter <e> <s> if so will they consider urging sir brian urquhart to rejoin the united nations for a period in order to preside over such an admirable operation <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the admittedly virtuoso performance of the prime minister in brussels prove the point that the council of ministers of the community are condemned to agree since failure to agree on any very important matter would clearly be worse for all of them than acceptance of some of the features with which they for their part disagree as for example the acceptance by mrs thatcher of million tonnes for agriculture the possible disadvantages of which have been so well brought forward this afternoon by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that not unexpected reply <e> <s> but is he aware that mr dukakiss dim view of star wars is broadly speaking shared by the bulk of informed scientific opinion in america <e> <s> is he also aware that in subsequent declarations mr dukakis while happily expressing support for nato and the continued presence of american troops in europe has declared his intention if elected of actually scrapping sdi and urging his european allies to follow his proposed example of spending less money on nuclear weapons and more on conventional defence <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i shall only speak for a few minutes on a single point not considered i think <e> <s> up to now and in doing so i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i speak rather slowly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which was not unexpected <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord home to whom we are all grateful for initiating this debate i am all for the indefinite continuance of the north atlantic alliance with the early negotiation of which in april i had myself something to do <e> <s> however if it is to continue the presence of united states troops in europe even if somewhat reduced in numbers is essential <e> <s> it is their presence even more than the so-called balance of terror which has kept the peace during the past years or so <e> <s> events have surely shown that the last thing the russians want is war with america <e> <s> only in american absence might they be tempted not so much to invade western europe though that is possible as to employ their great potential power for the purpose of neutralising the federal republic probably without permitting the reunification of germany <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to say a very few words regarding the possible effects of recent events on the north atlantic alliance and hence on the european community <e> <s> the prospects for both have i believe been improved by president bushs very welcome initiative <e> <s> it is true that agreement between the super powers on the limitation of their conventional weapons in europe weapons comprising aircraft tanks and for the first time men may well take longer than he suggests <e> <s> but if as we must all hope the negotiations are at least partially successful then talks on short-range nuclear weapons will certainly start <e> <s> i agree at least on this with the prime minister that once they do start the day of the so-called third zero will not be very far off <e>", "<cs> my lords there can hardly be anyone who does not rejoice at the destruction of the infamous berlin wall and at the explosion of popular emotion which occasioned it and which bids fair to result in the establishment of some kind of democracy in the ddr <e> <s> these events in east germany will also undoubtedly assist in the general revolt against one-party communist rule which has already been successful in hungary largely successful in poland and even bulgaria and which will probably soon move to czechoslovakia too <e> <s> however at the same time we can hardly avoid being disquieted by the possible results of this revolution for that is what it is unless it is handled with the greatest care <e> <s> in europe was in turmoil but things hardly worked out in the way the revolutionaries wished <e>", "<cs> my lords no one can deny that if the ddr becomes genuinely democratic and changes over to a free market system it will be able to join up with the federal republic <e> <s> but these are big ifs and in any case the process if it takes place will take some time <e> <s> nor is reunification invevitable <e> <s> here i venture to disagree with the noble lord lord callaghan and other noble lords <e> <s> it may happen but it is not inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all sincerely congratulate the noble lord lord home on <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord jenkins i believe that opposition in this country to our becoming a full member of what is now an incipient european political community is as was evident from the speech of the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon largely based on the fear that we should thereby inevitably become a mere state in some kind of federation closely resembling that of the united states <e> <s> that fear though widespread is in my view groundless for the following reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are eventually to spend on defence surely depends on the agreements with the soviet union on arms limitation which we hope to arrive at during the next year or so <e> <s> success in these negotiations has obviously now been practically assured by the spectacular accord arrived at in the caucasus yesterday by president kohl and mr gorbachev <e> <s> however there are a few resultant conclusions which we shall probably have to accept in the fairly near future and they are as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords some of your lordships may possibly recall that in our debate on th july on the defence estimates i said at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever our views we must surely now all admit that war with iraq in the comparatively near future is now unfortunately a distinct possibility <e> <s> failing some climbdown on the part of the present allies which would in fact be a victory for saddam hussein no peaceful or diplomatic solution of the crisis is possible unless iraq conforms to the various resolutions of the security council of the united nations chief of which is that demanding the immediate and unconditional evacuation of kuwait <e> <s> the iraqis have now flatly rejected this maintaining that kuwait no longer exists or as they say that it is part of iraq for ever <e>"]
