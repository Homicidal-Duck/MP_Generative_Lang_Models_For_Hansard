["<cs> my lords i ask the indulgence of your lordships as i speak here for the first time <e> <s> it is over years since i made my maiden speech in another place but i must confess that today i feel rather more apprehensive than i did then <e>", "<cs> i need some assistance from the noble baroness on the front bench <e> <s> i was chairman of the standing committee on the education bill in introduced by the previous government and but for the unfortunate result of the last general election clause of that bill would have excluded the necessity for the parental choice to be restricted to the area in which the child lived <e> <s> i think there is a great deal to be said for giving a wider choice <e> <s> one argument that i know is very practical refers to the fact that a child might be living in the first house on one side of the boundary and across the road perhaps yards down there is a first-class school which can be reached within a few minutes walk <e> <s> i take the view that local authority boundaries are not sacrosanct <e> <s> they are lines on maps and we <e>", "<cs> at this early hour iwill not detain your lordships on the general principles of this mean clause but i have to raise one or two points with the minister <e> <s> the first question i wish to ask is whether it is with her knowledge and with her authority that conservative local authorities are already pre-empting the decisions of the house by sending out circulars to parents in anticipation and taking it for granted that your lordships house and another place will pass the bill as it is before us <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will allow me is she saying that payment has to be deferred until because of administrative reasons or because of financial reasons <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend lord janner <e> <s> i am amazed that the noble baroness refers <e>", "<cs> i strongly support this amendment <e> <s> anyone who has had much experience of trying to help people as i have done both as a doctors wife in the east end of london and as a member of parliament for a long time must be concerned about the low take-up of means-tested benefits <e> <s> often when a whole family are on supplementary benefit they are in contact with advisers and with their local offices and are more likely to get to know about the whole range of help available through that contact than are families in work <e> <s> therefore we often meet families who complain that they are worse off while the husband is going to work than the man next door who is collecting the whole range of assistance and benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords having also spent some time in belize may i ask the minister what is the present position about the supply of arms to guatemala and training by the united states government <e> <s> when i was in belize this was a matter of great concern to our troops <e>", "<cs> my lords supposing two spouses have been living together for about years and then just before the death of one or the other one of them goes off for a bit of a party with somebody else <e> <s> at what point does that disenfrancise the delinquent spouse from being regarded as eligible under the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords just to get the record <e>", "<cs> my lords in assessing the needs of problem areas is the minister bearing in mind that many of these problems are imported <e> <s> may i ask him whether he has considered a borough such as camden in which i have served in local government for many years <e> <s> because it happens to have three main line termini it is natural that there is an enormous number a disproportionate number of homeless families who because they arrive at these termini report to the nearest town hall <e> <s> the centre of our city is the focus for unmarried mothers from all over the united kingdom <e> <s> we have an enormous number of homeless families many of whom have followed the prime ministers advice to come to london looking for jobs which they have failed to find <e> <s> so why should the ratepayers of camden be shouldering a disproportionate amount of what is really a national problem imposed on it by the governments policies <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i do so mainly because as a life member of the national union of journalists i am very concerned about the effect that the case referred to by my noble friend is having among people who work for the press <e> <s> it is very many years since i did any court reporting but certainly we were given to understand and appreciate that there were strict rules that had to be scrupulously adhered to <e> <s> i am puzzled by the present situation <e> <s> a court reporter takes down in his own shorthand a statement read out in open court <e> <s> it is then transcribed and i was always given <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord help further by telling a poor journalist what is the difference between a report and a feature article <e> <s> they are very close together <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend lord mishcon for muttering dissent behind his back <e> <s> i want to say briefly that i am sure that members of my profession and my union are not asking for the support of this amendment for any special category for journalists <e> <s> if read carefully the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with hesitation among so many legal luminaries to speak as just an ordinary member of the public <e> <s> it seems to me that <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the honour and pleasure of serving on this committee and i should like to add my congratulations to our chairman not only for the marvellous summary he has given the house today of what was a very complicated report but for his wise and patient chairmanship through our many sittings <e> <s> i must confess i was overwhelmed with the distinction of my colleagues on the committee <e> <s> they either seemed to be frs or very experienced foresters and i am neither of those things <e> <s> but i listened very carefully and i learned a great deal <e> <s> when i got too tired and could not understand anything more i lay back and thought of edmund blunden who wrote <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely want to ask the noble earl what sanctions the government will have on land that has been sold particularly if it is sold to investment companies and foreign buyers including eec buyers to impose these conditions particularly if these purchasers do not apply for grant and therefore there would seem to be no room for conditions to be applied <e>", "<cs> my lords was the noble lord made aware as i was when i was in belize of the very real fear of these poor and virtually unarmed people arising from the arming and training of guatemalan forces by the united states which they felt was a real menace to them <e> <s> in view of the appalling record of guatemala regarding human rights has the noble minister been able to consult the united states government on this aspect of the problem and perhaps ask them to associate themselves with the guarantees of the integrity of belize <e> <s> i ask that question because it seems to me that there will be a very contradictory situation if the united states continues to arm and train forces in guatemala at the same time as we are trying to give some confidence to the people of belize regarding their peaceful future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister have some consultation with the local offices to ensure that women are fully informed about this position because i hope he will take it from me that not every widow in the country has heard of an assessing tolerance <e>", "<cs> my lords may not the comparatively successful outcome of these talks have something to do with the fact that the president of nigeria was once an overseas student himself in this country and does that not indicate that the calculations should not be entirely financial <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two brief questions for elucidation <e> <s> when the noble lord the minister said that the boroughs did not have a right of veto surely that is only another way of saying that they had no right of consent either <e> <s> this means serious inroads on the democracy of local government <e> <s> it is one more example of the apparent intention of this government completely to destroy local democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that the noble baroness lady faithfull for whom i have a very great personal regard sounds very much more satisfied with the situation than anyone else who i know in the social services today and i know very many of them <e> <s> she started her speech by referring to feeling deeply but by the end i felt that she was letting arithmetic rule her warm heart <e> <s> i appreciate her point of view although of course i do not share it that there are people who say that we must give the conquest of inflation priority <e> <s> but what does that mean to an autistic child <e> <s> what does it mean to a blind old man who will not live through this winter <e> <s> in my view this is a totally false conception <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him whether he can explain why this change was made and whether her majestys government appreciate what unfair pressure is being brought on children especially where their parents are unemployed to leave at easter so that they can immediately collect their social security whereas if they stayed on and took their examinations in june they cannot get benefit until september <e> <s> will he undertake to monitor this carefully if not to look again at the whole scheme which i think is intolerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may crave your lordships indulgence as i speak for the first time from this strange unwonted place <e> <s> however i must declare our opposition to this most unwelcome and miserable little bill <e> <s> it must be noted that in six sittings of the standing committee in another place not one amendment was accepted by the government although amendments came from members of all parties including supporters of the present government many of them very wise and experienced in forestry <e> <s> after nearly years in parliament on and off and many years spent as chairman of standing committees in another place i have yet to see a bill which could not be improved in any way by any amendment <e> <s> i think that the failure to take on board the very real points that were made in previous discussions is a rare example of a pig-headed administration which is more concerned with fiscal dogma than with rational arguments about an important industry which is working well and which has great promise for the future <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will show more wisdom and sense and insist that amendments which will no doubt be proposed from all sides of this house at committee stage are passed because there are many ways in which this bill could be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped that i was saving your lordships time but that one sentence seemed to me to make sense <e> <s> if it is incorrect i am sure that there will be an opportunity for the noble earl to contradict it although it was not contradicted when it was quoted in another place <e> <s> if the noble earl wants this to happen and i know that he would not have made a specific commitment without meaning it i hope that he will be the first to enshrine this commitment in an amendment at the committee stage <e> <s> i can assure him of the support of many of my noble friends and i am sure that many of his noble friends would welcome it <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first thank warmly the noble baroness lady faithfull for the clarity and brevity of her presentation of this complicated report <e> <s> on this side we would wish to thank all members of the committee for the work they have done on this matter <e> <s> i must say that i read the report with great care and concentration an exercise which i found so exhausting and demanding that my expression of appreciation to the committee is sincere indeed <e> <s> certainly my heart went out to one exchange on page <e> <s> my noble friend lord plant asked the question which i echo <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not accept that these price differentials are often to do with currencies and exchange rates <e> <s> they also have to do with the differing price controls which take effect in different countries <e> <s> for instance the price levels between this country and western germany are very different and must contribute to the difference in prices as well as to the competitive marketing element <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble earl did not hear what i said <e> <s> i thought i made it clear that amenity provisions referred to forest cabins camping sites forestry trails and caravan sites <e>", "<cs> i should be modest to a fault were the drafting of this amendment to be questioned and if there had been any constructive suggestion from the minister i should most happily have received it <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord inglewood and the noble lord lord dulverton whose sympathetic approach to this problem i very much appreciated that when this amendment was drafted in a form of words referring to existing public access that did not mean in my mind or i am sure in the minds of my noble friends that every single footpath must be maintained exactly where it is <e> <s> access is a much wider word <e> <s> access means that people can get into a wood <e> <s> it does not mean that if there were new plantations to which the noble lord lord gisborough referred the owners would not have the right to say access is not to be here <e> <s> will you please take your ponies up there <e> <s> i am sure that that is the only sensible way to interpret the term public access <e>", "<cs> i must take issue with the minister on that point <e> <s> this amendment was put forward with all goodwill and i thought moderately and with the support of many people <e> <s> the correspondence i have had from many conservation societies certainly echoes much of the debate which we had on the countryside bill a little while ago <e> <s> i think it was an abuse of the committee for the minister to speak as he did <e>", "<cs> i was emboldened to support the amendment largely because of a statement made in another place on january th by the secretary of state when he said <e>", "<cs> i have it written down <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the whole house will have appreciated the moderate and persuasive way in which the noble lord lord mcnair proposed this amendment <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that i am speaking very much in a personal capacity when i give it my strong support <e> <s> i do not know by what malevolence on the part of official channels we are taking this bill today because had it not been for the bill i would have been a member of a parliamentary delegation visiting the forest of dean <e> <s> today i would probably have been at cinderford and tomorrow at <e>", "<cs> i apologise that i was not here to hear the minister refer earlier to the forestry transfer of woods act <e> <s> i am very puzzled about this matter because i have here a copy of that act from the library <e> <s> there is therefore a certain amount of confusion in my mind <e> <s> in supporting the amendment i had in mind the fact that in the united kingdom there are seven forest parks with a total area of acres <e> <s> it seems to me that we ought to be able to ensure that at least that land remains free from any sales under the bill <e>", "<cs> may i just take a moment to explain that some of the confusion has arisen as a result of my bad writing <e> <s> i have the original manuscript of my amendment which quite clearly says to me from the crown commissioners and not to the crown commissioners as appears in the marshalled list <e> <s> i am blaming nobody and i take responsibility for my bad writing and i am sorry for any confusion which it has caused <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply but i must ask him another question <e> <s> he says that the right of pre-emption can be written in when the forestry commission sells land but i want to know whether that is to the next one or the one after that <e> <s> does that right of pre-emption get written into every sale and every subsequent sale until the third fourth or fifth generations <e> <s> i think the noble minister is shaking his head <e> <s> i do not know what he is doing with his head but i shall give way if he explains at this point <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister because that is very helpful it does make it absolutely clear that this amendment is essential if we are not to see the loss of forestry land arising after second sales <e> <s> in moving this amendment i went out of my way to say that i accepted that theoretically the forestry <e> <s> commission already had the right to buy this land but i am concerned and so are my noble friends because of the treasury restrictions on forestry commission purchases and also because we felt that if we write this into the bill it would make it absolutely clear beyond peradventure that the forestry commission was to be available at first hand <e>", "<cs> the brevity of my remarks is no real measure of the sincerity and seriousness of my support for the amendment <e> <s> i too had the honour to serve on the select committee <e> <s> all of us agreed on the need for the change that has been ably proposed by the noble earl lord bessborough <e> <s> we had much evidence before us especially from edinburgh of the practicality of forestry and agriculture working more closely together and it would be to the advantage of forestry agriculture water conservation and leisure facilities if such closer integration were to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will wish to thank the noble baroness the minister for repeating this statement but there are a number of questions arising out of it <e> <s> while we are glad to accept the partial retreat of the government in the face of widespread opposition to the original proposals there are some difficulties which arise for many people <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether it is possible to look again at some of them <e> <s> it seems clear that the option which we welcome for pensioners is not to be extended indefinitely to mothers receiving child benefit <e> <s> although the statement makes it clear that the general theme running through many letters was that mothers should be able to make a voluntary choice between weekly or four-weekly payments it appears that the government are asking mothers who want to take up this option to opt in <e> <s> it seems to us to be much fairer to ask mothers who want to opt out to take the initiative <e> <s> it always seems to me to be much fairer that people who want to depart from the norm should have to make the effort rather than that it should be the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for those replies <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask a supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two brief supplementary questions if the minister will allow me <e> <s> she referred to new mothers <e> <s> i was not clear whether she meant new mothers or new babies <e> <s> what is the position with regard to a mother who is already receiving child benefit for two or three children and then has a new baby <e> <s> if she is getting a weekly payment will she in respect of the new baby now have to come under the monthly rules <e> <s> secondly i tried to attend very carefully but i did not hear the noble baroness reply to my point about the payment in arrears for certain retirement and widows pensions <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is a low sum in the view of the government it may not be a low sum to the individuals concerned <e> <s> is it not possible to make this at least a six-monthly payment so that someone could perhaps have a little holiday or a little pleasure or perhaps buy some new curtains <e> <s> surely to an old person a year is a very long time <e> <s> i wish to press the government on this <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that there is a movement away from institutional living especially as many more of our nurses both men and women are married and want to lead a non-institutional life <e> <s> is not the answer to this question of accommodation to be found in providing better salaries so that these men and women can choose where they live like any other workers <e> <s> i am not referring to accommodation for student nurses which is a special problem <e> <s> alternatively might there be some subsidy for their accommodation rather than putting them all into institutions such as one where i stayed with a home sister who made life not very jolly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure noble lords will wish to thank the noble baroness lady young for the usual swift efficiency with which she moved the second reading of what purports to be quite a short bill <e> <s> the difficulty with the bill however is that it cannot be considered in isolation it is but another piece in the tapestry of the governments social policies which in the view of some of us deliberately make life hardest for the poorest people in this country <e>", "<cs> or perhaps he posted a couple of second class letters allowing too something for the envelopes <e> <s> while the government are dedicated to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very confused as to what result the present government policies are having in increasing the wealth of the country in view of what we have seen over the weekend and the increase in the numbers of the unemployed <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that however much the wealth of the country increases redistribution has no part for a government with any social conscience <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness leaves the point of prices can she answer the point raised by more than one speaker <e> <s> of what was it per cent <e> <s> was it per cent <e> <s> of the general level of prices per cent <e> <s> of the rpi or per cent <e> <s> of the pensioners estimated budget <e>", "<cs> i am not totally satisfied about the present governments interpretation of the word reasoned but in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but i assure noble lords that we shall watch like cats watching sparrows to see what sort of statements come out <e>", "<cs> the short answer to that is that i am confident there will be a very different government in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord stated that this amendment would cost million <e> <s> that means that the government admit to taking million away from the people who need it most <e> <s> i really am impatient as i am sure are many of the pensioners and invalids in our country at hearing reference to the poverty of the government in not being able to meet these needs <e> <s> we had a budget that gave away million to those who needed it least and then we are told that we cannot afford million to save doing the poorest people out of a couple of weeks money which they deserve <e> <s> i am sorry but in view of what has been said i cannot beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i hope that there will be strong support on all sides of the committee for what is a very fair and proper amendment <e>", "<cs> i have already explained that i am very deficient when it comes to figures but in the figure that the noble baroness has just quoted relating to the total cost is she taking into account the higher amount of money to be spent on unemployment due to the tragically increasing numbers of unemployed rather than speaking in terms of individuals being better off <e>", "<cs> i do appreciate that the noble baroness is trying to help us very much in this very complicated situation <e> <s> can she give us any information as to when the taxation of benefits to which she has referred is likely to take place <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has just referred to a figure of million if i heard it aright <e> <s> that means that the unemployed are being deprived of million <e>", "<cs> this debate will have brought no cheer and no consolation to those outside who will be wondering what your lordships are going to do to mitigate the hardship under which many of them are suffering <e> <s> the only note of comfort we have had from the noble lord is that they can look forward to the time when they have to pay income tax on their benefits which seems to me to be something of less than cold comfort <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to what the noble baroness and the noble lord have said and i do appreciate the complicated way in which these amendments have had to be dealt with <e> <s> in view of all that has been said i will ask leave to withdraw the amendment for the moment <e> <s> we feel very strongly about certain of these matters and we shall want to come back to them again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise for the fact that i did not hear the beginning of the reply of the noble baroness <e> <s> however i did hear her say that the previous government had agreed that to link pensions to the retail price index was the best answer <e> <s> may i <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness give the committee any information as to when the report of the social security advisory committee might be expected <e>", "<cs> in anticipation of receiving that useful information i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a special pleasure to follow the wise words of the noble baroness lady faithfull who speaks from such great experience of these problems <e> <s> indeed during the whole of this debate we have heard in every speech wisdom experience and concern <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations to the noble baroness lady lane-fox <e> <s> she has brought to this place commonsense humour and courage and this place will be the better for having her with us <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear often from her <e> <s> i was especially interested in her perspicacious reference to the language question in this bill because i think that it is very important not to over-simplify the question of language <e> <s> there are many children from other countries who are imitative and who are quickly seen to have picked up english <e> <s> but that is quite different from having comprehension of a language for understanding the imagery and the references <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to pledge the support of my noble friends and myself to this amendment <e> <s> it seems only logical and fair that if we are to have this connection between the value of pensions and the amount of pensions paid we certainly have to look at the value of the pension <e> <s> we have had previous debates about the effect of the present bill on pensions and other benefits <e> <s> i shall not go over those arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble baronesss courtesy in giving way <e> <s> i am very puzzled about the prime ministers statement in view of the fact that the financial effect of this bill is to save <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to add our support to the amendment about the forest of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl allow me to intervene <e> <s> i was encouraged to put the amendment down again by the fact that he had been so kind and welcoming to the forest of dean situation and therefore i thought it only right to raise again the question of the new forest and other similar forests <e>", "<cs> it is a new situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am willing to accept in all modesty criticism of my drafting abilities but i <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has dealt very thoroughly with the bill and i do not propose to take up your lordships time on it <e> <s> i shall speak only for a moment so that silence does not imply consent to the bill <e> <s> there are parts of it which we welcome <e> <s> we welcome especially clause which alters the number of days which people have to be away consecutively <e> <s> we know that this will help in particular people who are on dialysis treatment and other disabled people who need short periods of assistance <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her clear exposition of the difficulties of which i am well aware <e> <s> in fact i was encouraged by section which gives the secretary of state power to make regulations to hope that we might have heard that she proposes to make regulations regarding the training of teachers who will work within the scope of this bill <e>", "<cs> before i decide to do that i wonder whether the noble baroness the minister can tell me if there will be any monitoring of this requirement <e> <s> earlier in the debate there were requests that there should be some sort of follow-up monitoring of the bill <e> <s> i am genuinely anxious that this phrase should not be used by dilatory authorities <e> <s> i should be influenced in my decision if the noble baroness could tell us whether there is going to be any way of keeping an eye on the use of this phrase as regards the provision of special education <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble minister that we on this side shall use our best endeavours to keep an eye on the implementation of the clause <e> <s> having given the noble baroness that assurance and not having had a very satisfactory one from her i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are very sympathetic to this amendment <e> <s> it seems that if a child has been assessed as having special educational needs that suggests that he is not totally ineducable and is not one of the very sad cases with which it is only possible to deal in special hospitals or institutions <e> <s> therefore this child must have some education as prescribed by this act <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble lord has said about children in hospital but of course this clause must also be linked to children who are home-bound <e> <s> i am wondering whether the minister could say something about children who are being very much assisted in their education by voluntary organisations by the sort of homes run by the spastics association the british epilepsy association and other such bodies whose homes often cannot strictly be defined as schools <e> <s> i very much hope that this clause would include any of these what i might call learning places and that once the child has been found a suitable place in which to learn then there is an absolute duty on the local authority to see that he gets the education which has been prescribed <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with the intentions of the noble baroness lady faithfull and i shall listen with great interest to what the noble baroness the minister has to say <e> <s> i have spoken to some of the teachers involved in home teaching <e> <s> some of them find the prospect of spending hours a week with the same child too much for them and too much for the child <e> <s> it really means spending three hours a day with the child and some of these children are so disturbed and difficult that they certainly cannot benefit from three consecutive hours of one-to-one teaching <e> <s> it might do these children more good if someone took them out for a game in the park <e> <s> i feel that there has to be some flexibility so far as individual cases are concerned <e> <s> two hours tuition a day would come to ten hours tuition a week but as the noble baroness herself has said it is difficult to put these things into the statute <e> <s> i know that this goes against most of what i have been saying on <e>", "<cs> i am anxious to get this right <e> <s> is the family doctor to get in direct touch with the education authority and not go through the local area health authority <e>", "<cs> i should just like to say to the noble baroness lady faithfull that that is what is supposed to happen <e> <s> i am talking from some rather harsher practical experience <e> <s> i appreciate what the minister has said <e> <s> i still think there will be a great deal of communication needed with the medical profession and with the area health authorities many of whom are quite unclear about the impact of the bill on their work their status and duties <e> <s> however i thank the minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness and i shall read tomorrow when i am rather more wide awake what she has said <e> <s> with that reservation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw attention to the fact again that when the noble lord lord banks used the word reasonable in an amendment he was told that it was inappropriate because people could not quantify reasonable so now i have to ask the minister how she can quantify unreasonable <e> <s> this seems to be leaving the door very wide open to subjective judgments however much they may be made in good faith <e> <s> what is one mans reason is another mans nonsense <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> if we can just finish the evening on a happy note of agreement in this connection we shall not have done a bad days work <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for a moment <e> <s> i noticed with interest that the noble baroness used the word vexatious in regard to requests from some parents on rare occasions <e> <s> maybe she could look again at the use of the word unreasonable in the clause because that seems to me to be a point of difference over which we ought to be able to meet one another <e> <s> i do not think it is at all wrong for parents in this situation to be unreasonable or to seem unreasonable because the stresses and anxieties can often make parents and the children themselves seem to behave unreasonably to those who have the administration and the bureaucracy to deal with <e> <s> i have never thought that being unreasonable was a sin <e> <s> it often happens in this house and it is not held against us <e> <s> so i am wondering whether in spite of the praise that has been given the noble baroness could look again at this wording and see whether there is some way in which she could meet our anxieties <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has said that these regulations are complex and certainly his honourable friend in another place at col on th june said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say as a life member of the nuj that i share the anxieties of many of my ex-colleagues about these arrangements <e> <s> i should like to ask this question <e> <s> i think i heard the noble lord say that agreement had been reached with the editorial staff but there are many unions involved in the production of a newspaper and i should like to know whether the other unions concerned with the production have been consulted or involved and are agreeing because some of them are at least as powerful as those who write <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i am sorry that i have to spell it out but i was thinking of people like printers <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that i did not have my name down on the list of speakers but i was not certain that i could be present <e> <s> speaking in the cool comfort of this chamber on what might seem sometimes esoteric points of nationality law and constitutional affairs looks very different and feels very different to the steamy jungles of belize <e> <s> i had the privilege of being in belize for some time particularly to see how our troops were carrying out what could have been a very difficult job <e> <s> i should like to start by saying that i heard nothing but praise and gratitude from the people of belize for what our forces were <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly in order to support the noble lord on this amendment <e> <s> i am sure it is absolutely essential for the successful carrying out of this bill for there to be the closest co-operation between the social services and the education and health services <e> <s> it seems to me that we shall be losing an opportunity of encouraging the closer integration of the services <e> <s> i have myself seen from the town hall level how with the best will in the world officers in different departments working to different budgets even though they may meet for case committees do not always maximise the potential help available because of these divisions <e> <s> therefore i think if we can somehow get across the joint responsibility of the other authorities and not leave this clause as it is apparently relating to the area or district health authority only it will be beneficial <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for a moment to get this absolutely clear <e> <s> would it not be better to put into the billwith a medical officer of the authority because as it stands it could be a clerk or any non-qualified person who would have the duty <e>", "<cs> of course there has been a considerable increase in group practices and we are all very pleased about that <e> <s> indeed it was referred to in the warnock report <e> <s> but within many of the group practices and partnerships people do register with one particular doctor and i think that the use of the words family doctor is still relevant whether he is in a group practice or in a partnership or working as some do individually <e> <s> i am sure that i would be out of order if i went on to a further examination of the organisation of the national health service <e> <s> i have used the words family doctor because i think everybody understands what they mean <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i must disappoint the noble baroness because i do not really feel that she has answered all the points that were raised <e> <s> for instance i still do not know what is to happen to the child who goes from the family doctor to the hospital consultant <e> <s> i think that throughout this bill we are getting too much guidance and too little law <e> <s> time after time we have raised from all parts of the committee very serious questions about the bill only to be told that it will all be put right in guidance <e> <s> the noble baroness has done that again this morning <e> <s> in fact she says that in the guidance they will make sure <e>", "<cs> as regards that i should gladly have withdrawn my amendment if the noble baroness had accepted the underlying anxieties and had promised to do something on report or at a later stage to cover these points <e> <s> she said in one connection that there was this problem of confidentiality between doctor and patient but that must apply equally when a school doctor or a hospital doctor is involved with a patient <e> <s> yet that does not seem to me to come into consideration <e> <s> i am sorry but i must press this amendment to a division <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> we wish to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> because it has been moved so comprehensively and so ably by the noble lord i propose only to say that we completely endorse what he has said <e> <s> i will save your lordships time by not repeating the arguments he has put forward except to say that of course we look forward to the time when our schools will come into line with most european countries and forbid corporal punishment altogether <e> <s> i have never been able to understand why our children are supposed to be naughtier than those of countries across the english channel where corporal punishment in many cases has been totally forbidden <e> <s> i do not think there is any evidence that it does the child much good and certainly it does the teacher no good especially in the prospect of a teacher beating a handicapped child <e> <s> that must suggest something very unacceptable about the teacher <e>", "<cs> what the noble baroness has said is exactly what the minister said in when we waited for five years while nothing happened <e> <s> i am pleased to hear from her that on the other hand she hopes to bring in some of these provisions before my modest date of st september <e> <s> i assure her that we shall keep a very close watch on the bringing in of such regulations before that date and with this in mind for today at any rate i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while i recognise that governments of neither party have been able to solve this difficult problem may i ask whether the minister is aware that his practice of giving extensions in exceptional circumstances causes a lot of strain and anxiety particularly where education is concerned <e> <s> in the case of many of the cypriots who apply for but are refused the exceptional extension it seems that very subjective judgments are brought to bear <e> <s> would it not therefore be more fair to look again at the refugee provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the difficulties of the present situation and the delicate talks that are going on i must say that i have heard that for the last seven years <e> <s> it is never the right time to do anything about cyprus and may i ask the noble lord whether he would not agree that thinking back to what the noble lord lord caradon said about the recent meeting in london between greek and turkish cypriots that has never been the trouble <e> <s> is not the trouble that the turkish government are giving mr denktash his directions and that however helpful mr kyprianou tries to be it is ankara that makes these decisions <e> <s> in view of greece turkey and cyprus all being associated in the eec is it not quite unacceptable that turkish troops should be on the mainland of another member state of the eec <e>", "<cs> i too hope that the government will accept the amendment because we should try to look at this from the point of view of the people of <e>", "<cs> may i remind the noble lord who never pontificates that we are having to spend more time on the bill today because government business managers brought it on in the house of commons between oclock and oclock at night for second reading committee report and third reading all in two hours <e> <s> it does not lie in the mouths of govern <e>", "<cs> i intervene only briefly to say that there are some difficulties about this amendment <e> <s> i do not see that it is for this committee or for another place to insist that the people of belize must have a referendum <e> <s> equally i maintain that we should take no action which prevents them from having a referendum if they want one <e> <s> like the noble baroness lady vickers i have received many telegrams such as this saying <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord referred to something which i said i do not want to be misrepresented <e> <s> the situation is obviously very complicated and has been complicated by some statements made in another place <e> <s> i take the noble lords point that the referendum was to be about the treaty and not about independence but on th june in col mr ridley said <e>", "<cs> my lords as an old member of a local authority i cannot understand the objection to this amendment <e> <s> we have to make plans for drains sewers roads housing and all kinds of aspects of our work in local authorities <e> <s> we have to do that if only so that we can budget and get our costs and priorities sorted out <e> <s> i find it quite incredible that it is suggested that the message should go forth from this house that the bill can be implemented without local authorities doing any planning <e> <s> i should have thought that any concerned and good local authority would do this as a matter of course because it is the only way to work <e> <s> by giving the amendment the blessing of this house we should be helping local authorities to take the idea of planning in this sphere as seriously as they take the mending of sewers <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble minister has said and i know that she is the last person in the house to be complacent about the situation <e> <s> however it is a fact that the warnock committee found that the situation was not totally satisfactory and there are references to the disabilities and serious difficulties which ethnic minority groups are suffering due to lack of understanding of language and of resources available <e> <s> i do not feel that we should push that on one side and say well we hope that by sending out some guidance things will go better now <e> <s> we put down the amendment because of the situation as we understand it to be at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for the care and thought which she has given to this very important and difficult matter <e> <s> i have only one brief query which concerns the wording of the amendment <e> <s> is there any significance in the use of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords we support this amendment <e> <s> most of the arguments have already been very well deployed <e> <s> in the first place i agree with the noble lord lord renton that by beginning this clause with the word if there is the possibility of creating an alibi for some official who may not be per cent <e> <s> in keen pursuit of his or her work <e> <s> we do think that putting in a time limit is important <e> <s> also the linking of government departments public bodies and voluntary organisations all together in the clause would i think go some small way towards more integration and co-operation <e> <s> for these reasons we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord renton will not be carried away by the sunshine of our support for his previous amendment because on this occasion i cannot advise my noble friends to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that we are putting the local education authorities in a very difficult position <e> <s> any group of people can band together and call themselves a voluntary organisation <e> <s> they might be some of the less desirable or more desirable people connected with fringe medicines or various cults <e> <s> to use the words voluntary organisation leaves the whole thing far too wide open <e> <s> if it is the local authority that has advised the parents to contact a particular organisation and the organisation does not in fact help the child it might even and i have known such sad cases have had a deleterious effect on the health of the child that is no ones fault <e> <s> people working in voluntary organisations very often give up their spare time and do not always become fully associated or acquainted with the complications of those whom they are trying to help <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness lady young replies may i say that i had hoped that this was much more than a drafting amendment because it seemed to me that if we widen the definition of the word child to include people in need up to the age of whether or not they were registered at a school we should be fulfilling one of the main objectives of the warnock committee <e> <s> one of the committees priorities was to year-olds whom that committee found to be very neglected unemployed lacking in facilities for special training and lacking enjoyment of life in many ways <e> <s> it seemed to me that insisting that a child comes within the definition of this bill only if registered at a school is going to exclude thousands and thousands of children who most need help <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but that does not bear out our earlier debate of the th july when the noble baroness lady young said quite clearly at column <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to give way for a moment <e> <s> my amendment asks that the bill should come into force not later than st september <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not recall when i previously put down an amendment proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i do not think we have made any progress in this connection this afternoon <e> <s> the noble baroness seems to be living in a totally different world from the world of the people on the education authorities and on the school staffs and of the anxious parents of handicapped children who are seeing day nurseries shut nursery schools closed down and all sorts of facilities contracting whereas the warnock report urged priority for the under-fives and for the over-s and when we talk to education officers and teachers about these things they are in despair about the reductions in services which are being forced upon them <e> <s> so when the noble baroness says that she looks forward hopefully to the implementation of some aspects of this bill by and that certainly she hopes for fulfilment before i think that with great respect that would get a horse laugh from any director of education or any chairman of an education committee who i know at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by echoing what the noble baroness said about the late lord boyle <e> <s> i had the privilege of being contemporary with him for many years in the house of commons <e> <s> we were all impressed by his ability understanding and his deeply civilised approach to the problems of our difficult society <e> <s> also combined with that there was a personal kindliness which many of us knew at first hand and deeply appreciated <e> <s> his early death is a great tragedy for many people who have benefited from his wisdom and friendship <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly to refer to one aspect of foreign policy which is especially a matter of concern and responsibility to the british government <e> <s> we may not have as much clout as we would wish in afghanistan or el salvador <e> <s> certainly alone we cannot be effective in solving the drastic problems of the middle east <e> <s> but i refer to the question of cyprus without apology because this is a matter of foreign policy which is especially the concern of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords turkey is in the process of doing so <e> <s> i said to some degree or other that is because i realise that there are negotiations about association going on <e> <s> however i think that the question of the eec must come at the top of the agenda <e> <s> i appreciate the concern that the noble lord the foreign secretary has shown and the discussions which he has been having about the general question of tension in the middle east <e> <s> but of course cyprus is part of that question <e> <s> it is the middle eastern policies of the great powers that has made a football of cyprus throughout history even before richard i used it as a victualling post on the way to the crusades <e> <s> the people of cyprus have never been left alone to work out their own future <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that it would not seem advisable for the foreign secretary to intervene is he saying that her majestys government do not regard themselves any longer as a guarantor power of cyprus which was put into the treaty of independence <e> <s> surely we have a special responsibility <e> <s> would it not be helpful if when the foreign secretary is touring the middle east he could spare some time to take this problem on board and perhaps visit cyprus <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the remarks of lord scarman about the need for greater sensitivity on the part of the police in these difficult areas can we be assured that the government will not put financial obstacles in the way of enlarged training of officers <e> <s> i have in mind the question of sending police officers to the countries of origin of many of the people who are now living in our cities <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that a small group of officers including a police officer from my previous constituency which was very cosmopolitan spent some time in trinidad where they were able to see how the carnival worked and were able to get some sense of the culture and feelings of the people in their own country <e> <s> it seems to me that this is the kind of enlarged police training which would be very valuable and i hope the minister can assure us that money will not stand in the way of that kind of programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for intervening but he just said i think i heard him correctly that the membership would not be large <e> <s> at an earlier stage of the debate it was suggested that there might be members <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness lady david who has made it possible for us to have this debate today <e> <s> i am especially glad to follow the noble lord lord alexander of potter-hill who talked such good sense to us <e> <s> i am a little <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord in reply to my noble friend lady birk referred to something called constant prices <e> <s> can he explain to a simple housewife what is a constant price nowadays <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether that increase is due to inflation and rising costs or whether it is an increase in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords this is clearly a treasury bill and a bad treasury bill at that <e> <s> no one could say worse of any piece of legislation that comes before your lordships <e> <s> in our view it is a mean and regressive measure the main purpose of which is to reduce the treasurys contribution to social security and to load an increased burden on to contributors <e> <s> for reasons of order obviously we must concentrate today on this destructive little bill but i would remind the house that it has to be read in the context of other policies and other measures by which this government are deliberately impoverishing increasing numbers of our people <e> <s> it has to he considered against a back-ground of high inflation intolerable unemployment increased rates and rents a decrease in the real value of many benefits higher prescription charges and increased charges for many social services <e> <s> this bill shows a totally insensitive approach to the casualties of this governments policies <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might interrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very fair-minded as i remember almost with affection from the other place <e> <s> would he apply what he was just saying to what has happened to the workers at invergordon <e> <s> surely it was not the fault of any trade union activities at ivergordon that we had the statement we heard this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> he said that he did not wish to add to what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said but i do <e> <s> what is it other than deliberate impoverishment when we know that the unemployment pay has not kept pace with inflation and that retirement pensions on the governments own admission are below what they should be and the government have agreed that these should be increased to take care of this mistake <e> <s> i do not think that the word deliberate is amiss in that context <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i must interrupt because i did not use the words investment income in my contribution at all <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am sure the whole house will be grateful for <e>", "<cs> may i make a point on that because when we were drafting this amendment we had it in mind in using the words <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness a question <e> <s> surely the possibility of offering varying ways to help the patient is really a matter for the family doctor <e> <s> it has been my experience that a conscientious family doctor takes the greatest care to put the alternatives before the patients and families concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord has quite rightly said that the government are seeking to improve the national health service can he tell the house how the health service is being improved by the expenditure of a year on keeping st georges hospital empty and on proposing to sell this very valuable site for peanuts for <e> <s> surely that does not help the national health service <e>", "<cs> may i ask for a little clarification on this <e> <s> am i right in thinking that even without this amendment there would be nothing to prevent a patient from saying that he wanted to get a letter from his own doctor or from presenting a letter about his history and that that would obviously be taken into consideration <e> <s> am i right in thinking that there is nothing to prevent a patient from making such an application <e>", "<cs> of course this is not a party point <e> <s> we all appreciate that careful thought has been given to this but speaking personally i do not support the noble lord lord winstanley which is a very unusual situation in which to find myself <e> <s> i can recall cases where for instance patients have had to be very heavily sedated and the period of hours is all too short in fairness to the patient concerned <e> <s> to leave it at hours as a maximum is probably fair enough to all concerned <e> <s> i hope we can leave it at that and i speak in no party spirit at all but am thinking from the patients point of view how short a time is hours for some people who have been through the most traumatic and disturbing experiences <e>", "<cs> this is a very important amendment <e> <s> it may seem that we are trying to amend a different act under the terms of the bill which is now before your lordships and it may be that we ought to try to get to work in a different way <e> <s> nevertheless i believe it would be fair and right to give some thought to this problem this evening <e> <s> the whole tendency of this bill and of our thinking on the treatment of mental illness is to make sure that as many people as possible live in the community they will live at home or they will live in hostels they will have addressees they will be on the electoral register because i cannot see anything in present law that forbids someone in such circumstances from being on the electoral register <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could answer specifically one of my questions <e> <s> i appreciate the sympathetic way in which he has spoken <e> <s> however when people come out from the hospitals and are in community hostels or in whatever kind of social service situation they find themselves will those addresses he valid for purposes of electoral registration <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister gets too complacent about that situation may i ask him how much of this total increase is due to the fact that there are more people applying for benefits and therefore the <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for asking another question but i did not hear the noble lord answer my question about what the government are proposing to do about the admitted fall of per cent <e> <s> in pensions for single and married people getting invalidity pensions <e> <s> are the government going to make up that shortfall or not <e>", "<cs> i will speak as briefly as is consistent with the importance of this clause and explain why we arc moving to leave out clause <e> <s> in the first place clause increases workers contributions at a time when there are many other increases in the cost of living for working people in this country <e> <s> we accept that the treasury needs more money and we all know why the treasury needs more money because the unemployed under this governments policies have now reached the figure of million and it looks like going higher <e> <s> therefore we are all the time narrowing the income base for social security benefits because the fewer the number of people we have at work the government are saying the more per head they have to pay at the same time as government policies are increasing the number of those people who are not at work <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord is not chiding me for saying things that i said on second reading <e> <s> that just proves the consistency of my argument and it would be remarkable if i said something different today from what i said then <e> <s> i feel it would tire <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his courteous explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to follow the noble baroness because in this area which is very sensitive so far as public opinion is concerned the more discussion and the more public examination there can be the better <e> <s> i would crave your lordships indulgence by giving one or two examples of why i think it is so important that there should be open discussion of these cases <e> <s> recently a very distressed lady came to me for help <e> <s> she had been told that it was the governments policy to get people out of mental hospitals and that her husband was being sent home the following week <e> <s> this lady was elderly and disabled <e> <s> she was already caring for a mentally handicapped daughter at home <e> <s> her husband was sent back home presumably into what we call community care <e> <s> this lady came to me and said tell them up there i am sorry if that is a discourteous description of your lordships that the community does not care <e> <s> im the bloody community <e> <s> she felt such a sense of inadequacy isolation and strain that i am sorry to say this lady died absolutely broken down just before christmas <e>", "<cs> i much appreciate the courtesy of the minister i was using that case to illustrate the need for reports to parliament of what is happening because unless we keep a close eye on the results of this legislation we shall be failing in our duty <e> <s> the relevance of my remarks was that the amendments suggest that there should be reports to parliament and i very much want to see this amendment carried through <e> <s> whichever amendment we take it is absolutely essential that we monitor this bill and do not let it get into the publics mind that it is government policy to send people out without ensuring that there is support <e> <s> in monitoring it we ought to ensure that the support is adequate because we know that in these restrained times for local authorities it is not always possible for them to provide services <e>", "<cs> my lords we have examined this mean little bill thoroughly and today i do not propose to take up your lordships time unreasonably <e> <s> but we must put on record at this stage our continuing opposition to and anxiety about it <e> <s> we deplore the increase in contributions that come from workers only at a time of mounting pressures on the lower paid <e> <s> we regret the reduction in treasury contribution be <e>", "<cs> my lords while we welcome the increase in nursing recruitment can the noble lord refer to the number of nurses who are unemployed <e> <s> is he aware that in another place the figure for last september was given as over nurses many of whom are seeking employment which they cannot get because of cuts in the money available <e>", "<cs> my lords does that not imply <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that though there has been an per cent <e> <s> increase in the allowance for november to november inflation has gone up per cent <e> <s> in the same time <e> <s> is he satisfied that p a day is sufficient for keeping a child up to years of age <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very informed and useful debate and we are all grateful to my noble friend lord wells-pestell for making it possible for us to take part <e> <s> i was particularly interested to hear the remarks of some if i may so call them older doctors because i do not remember in my young days those junior doctors always being so exhausted that we never had any good times at all and i am very sorry that occasionally a note of gloom has come into the debate about the lack of resilience and staying-power of many of the young men and women who are working with such dedication in our hospitals <e> <s> i say that not because we ought to take advantage of them but because i think it is very important to try to get a wide focus look at this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me is he not aware that one can do exactly that now <e>", "<cs> i have done it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank the noble lord lord rugby for giving us the opportunity to have this debate but without being discourteous i do not thank him for this bill <e> <s> i should make it clear that although i am speaking from the <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that no law can make a good doctor out of a bad doctor <e> <s> hope that the noble lord lord winstanley for whom i have the greatest respect in all sorts of ways including his professional expertise will not press this amendment because it is really not helping the patient if we try to legalise many more procedures <e> <s> i like to <e>", "<cs> it may seem strange my lords but we support the governments view on this matter <e> <s> it would not be practicable to change the six hours to three <e> <s> one need only think of the bad weather we had recently and i do not know whether it is indelicate for me to mention this the problems of the rail strike from which we have all suffered to realise that both made communications very difficult <e> <s> we feel therefore that to change the time to three hours would be wrong and we agree that six hours is about right <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is impossible from our point of view to support this amendment and it may be unseemly for her majestys official opposition to be interfering in this argument that concerns parties other than our own i should like to say that we strongly support that section which provides that a person shall be eligible to receive legal aid <e> <s> however as we have amendment no <e> <s> down on the subject of legal aid we shall be returning to that matter later <e> <s> in opposing the amendment we do not want it to be thought by your lordships that we are against the question of legal aid <e> <s> that is the only point that we would wish to make on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we shall return on amendment no <e> <s> to the question of legal aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether this is the right moment to raise a particular point <e> <s> in view of the statement made yesterday about payment by overseas visitors to this country for national health service treatment may i ask what would happen if someone were taken mentally ill in this country <e> <s> under which part of the bill would they come <e> <s> would they be asked to pay full fees for hospital care <e> <s> this is a very important question <e> <s> many people might come here who need mental health care as much as physical health care <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords although we are all grateful to know that the department have obtained sufficient funds to carry on for one year does not the noble lord the minister agree that it is absolutely impossible to continue sophisticated highly-specialised research in a unit which has taken years to set up on the basis of one years expectation of life <e> <s> will he not look at this again and appreciate the point of view of the staff in this matter <e> <s> i noticed that the noble lord the minister himself referred to only one year <e> <s> on the continuation of the work may i point out to the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is aware that this department has a great international reputation that it works for patients from all over the world and per cent <e> <s> of the work on vitamin b comes from patients outside the hospital many from outside this country <e> <s> is the minister satisfied <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware of how many lives are to be put at risk for the sake of a year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister kindly told me that there were other national health service hospitals where this work was being carried out <e> <s> is he aware that the general information is that this is an unique piece of research concerning pernicious anaemia some forms of blindness and cancer <e> <s> will he tell the house where else this work is being carried on <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord hunter for giving us the opportunity for this debate <e> <s> we have strayed down long byways and highways perhaps beyond the intention of the noble lord when he first put down this subject for discussion and i will deal as briefly as i can with a few of the important questions which concern particularly noble lords on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not inconsistent of the government to forbid straightforward cigarette advertising on television but to allow the indirect advertisements which appear as the backdrop to every sponsored sporting campaign <e> <s> if the government thinks advertising does not make any difference why not lift the whole ban <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord st just for bringing this subject before the house <e> <s> i would remind noble lords that the question tabled by lord st just was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we on this side of the house would like to join in sending our good wishes to the noble baroness lady lane-fox with our hopes for a speedy recovery because we do so enjoy having her with us <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether the government have worked out how much they are saving <e> <s> because women who stay at home and who give up a career and a good job to look after a relative who is an invalid save the government money <e> <s> if a married women did not undertake that responsibility how much would it cost from social security funds or the national health service to place a disabled elderly relative into care <e> <s> surely these women are saving the government money and is it not really most unfair that their goodness should be taken advantage of in this mean way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying it would cost more or less than million if all these elderly disabled relatives were put into institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government giving any general consideration to the funding of research which is of national and international importance and which at present is having to be met out of the decreasing funds of individual hospitals <e> <s> because this is the root of the problem at westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing could look duller on the order paper than the listing of these two orders before your lordships tonight and it would he very hard for people who have not taken a special interest in these matters to realise that we are dealing with orders of intense human interest which affect millions of people as regards the standard of living they can expect when they come to retire <e> <s> so i want to ask the noble lord a few questions and make some observations on what sounds a very arcane and complicated matter with which one is tempted to deal rather formally especially in view of the considerable business still before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that on th february he told the house that the director-general of fair trading was examining the whole position and that talks were going on with the optical whitley council because many of your lordships felt that a fee of for examination and for dispensing was rather inadequate and perhaps a temptation to find expenses in other ways <e> <s> it would reassure many of us who are concerned with the matter if the minister would say what point the talks have reached <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> i do so in no party sense because these rules have been accepted by successive governments <e> <s> i find that there is an increasing sense of unfairness among people who receive the mobility allowance they fear that when they reach pension age it will be taken away <e> <s> if the noble lord will confirm that it will not be taken away so that the only people who will be deprived by the rule will be those who apply for it after pension age that would be of interest to many people in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships for long but it is important that we on these benches should associate ourselves very firmly with the views put forward by the noble lord lord avebury which i was glad to see were supported by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> it seems to us that in a situation in our society where racial tension <e>", "<cs> did i get it wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge that and thank the noble lord for what he has said to make the position clear <e> <s> i had thought that what my noble friend lord pitt had said was rather nearer to what the noble lord lord avebury had said than apparently was the case in the view of the noble lord lord campbell <e>", "<cs> my lords surely those payments were made when naturalisation was granted <e> <s> they were not demanded when the application was first put in <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble minister clarify one point <e> <s> he refers to the number of civil servants who are to be reduced and he has just told us that the town halls will have to deal with more of these cases so does it not mean that while he reduces civil service staff he has to increase local government staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that this side of the house cannot commend the bill to your lordships for many reasons which i shall try to set out as briefly as possible because i accept that this is a second reading debate and this is very much a committee bill as it is very detailed and technical and we shall want to come back to many points at committee stage <e> <s> i would not want your lordships to think that we on this side are taking an old-fashioned luddite view of national insurance because national insurance must be an evolving sector in our society <e> <s> we can go back to <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> that is why i put it in an interrogative form <e> <s> i cannot add up i am totally innumerate <e> <s> nevertheless i do not think that fifteen bob is to be entirely disregarded <e> <s> the point i raised when i interrupted i hope not discourteously the noble lord the minister is that the reduction in the number of civil servants might well be balanced by the increase in local authority staff <e> <s> if you say to people that they cannot ask for housing help from the dhss and that they must go to the town hall the town hall will have to provide for their reception <e> <s> at least i hope the town halls will <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noticed the figures in clause because i have been living and sleeping with this bill for the past week or two as i am sure the noble lord has <e> <s> i was referring to the present <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord hawke for that intervention <e> <s> i do not know who these people are but the official figures show that there is this number of low earners in our country <e> <s> this may come as a surprise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> not necessarily my lords <e> <s> they may be in part-time employment because they are single parent families or people who cannot otherwise work full-time <e> <s> that does not mean that they should be discriminated against when they are sick <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make my position perfectly clear <e> <s> i was not saying that the benefit should not be taxed <e> <s> i was saying that benefit should not be brought into taxation while there is this per cent <e> <s> shortfall in the payment of unemployment benefit <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because i think it is fundamental to the freedom of the press in this country <e> <s> i should like to start by saying that there would have been more members of your lordships house on these benches tonight had it not been that in another part of the palace of westminster at this very time there is a memorial meeting going on to our late friend lord ritchie-calder <e> <s> i know he would have supported this amendment tonight because i discussed it with him not many sad weeks ago <e> <s> i felt that i should be here rather than attending the meeting at which i would have very much liked to be present <e>", "<cs> as we are in committee i was speaking to an amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> i think that i must be in order <e> <s> it may be that other members of your lordships committee are not in order but i cannot see how i am being disorderly in what i am saying <e> <s> i shall not take up the committees time by going into detail in answering what the noble lord lord george-brown has said because of course we all know that there is this type of all-round reporting the odd job that anyone who works on a newspaper has to do <e> <s> it is quite impossible in law to make these differences apply <e>", "<cs> my lords although my noble friends question referred specifically to unemployed young people can the minister assure the house that there will be no age bar and that people of more mature age will be encouraged and not disadvantaged if they take up further study <e> <s> secondly can he say what is to happen after the hours of classroom work to the young man or woman who goes home with a library book and does some study <e> <s> are they prejudicing their right to benefit whereas if they went out to play bingo they would keep to the hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the minister answer my first supplementary about whether there was in effect any age bar notwithstanding that my noble friends question referred specifically to the young unemployed <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his as ever courteous reply <e> <s> can he tell us what will happen to a worker during the period while all these negotiations and appeals are going on <e> <s> will he be entitled to supplementary benefit to meet his immediate needs and will this be made absolutely clear in the publicity which i hope will be sent out regarding this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that there are a great many regulations coming after this bill is passed <e> <s> it is the opinion of many of us that there are too many regulations and we would have preferred many of these regulations to be written into the bill so that we could have discussed them today <e> <s> however without prejudice to our future action at later stages of the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a short question to ask about the clause and while i think i know the answer to it many people do not and it would be good to have it on the record <e> <s> under subsection period of incapacity for work means four or more consecutive days <e> <s> does that mean that for the first three days off work an employee gets no sick pay and if he is away for a week he gets sick pay for only four days <e> <s> it is important that that should be made absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord and to make it absolutely clear for people outside employers and employees may i repeat the question <e> <s> if an employee is away for three days and returns to work on the fourth he gets nothing whereas if he manages to stay sick for the rest of the week he gets seven days sick pay <e>", "<cs> i was not seeking to entertain the committee <e> <s> i was bringing before the committee a very serious problem which affects thousands of women in this country <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for his careful reply but i am not sure whether i heard him clearly enough <e> <s> i should like him to repeat if he has already said it that the rules relating to pregnancy will not be enforced until the non-contributory maternity benefits have been introduced <e> <s> if they come into force before the non-contributory arrangements come into force then according to the noble lords own minister in another place working women will be disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> again i thank the noble lord but of course it is not only married women who become pregnant and that is a cause of anxiety <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment without promising that i shall not come back to it on another occasion <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that explanation but i am afraid that it does not answer my concern about people who work for only a few weeks or months during the year and who during times when they work pay national insurance contributions but because the period is too short are disqualified from national insurance sick pay and appear to be disqualified under this bill <e> <s> i appreciate that this <e>", "<cs> this really is not good enough <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord the minister is trying to help the chamber and he has suggested that these <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the difficulties of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i know that he is circumscribed in what he can say by people in another place and i am sure that if left to himself he would be much more forthcoming and reasonable as he always likes to be <e> <s> but it really is not good enough <e> <s> his reference to the narrow point on which my noble friend lord mishcon made his submission does not answer the question because though it might be said that my noble friend was making a fairly narrow point it was within the context of this bill and what is to happen to people under it <e> <s> therefore it cannot be dismissed as something irrelevant about which a note can be sent to my noble friend <e> <s> as i said earlier this is a question which affects too many people for it to be dealt with by correspondence <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord but i must point out that if he had turned over the page he would have seen that amendment no <e> <s> page line is to leave out paragraph <e> <s> so i am doing as the noble lord advises <e>", "<cs> it is all right the bill is very confusing and the amendments are even more confusing <e> <s> i was even more confused when in part explanation the noble lord said that it would be better if the government did not become too involved in these disputes <e> <s> i am trying to help him <e> <s> by taking out sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord mottistone for his helpful interjection <e> <s> i can only say that a very clever accountant told me that he could tell <e>", "<cs> while the minister has referred to the cost of raising child benefit may i ask him to say on the other hand how much more the government will collect as a result of charging people national insurance contributions for the first time in history on sick pay <e> <s> how much is the worth minus the national insurance contribution <e>", "<cs> what about national insurance contributions <e>", "<cs> it is important for thousands of people that we get this clearly on the record <e> <s> i was asking especially about the national insurance contribution <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that the is equivalent to on which no national insurance is paid he is therefore telling the committee and the workers of britain that they pay only p national insurance and i do not think that can be correct <e>", "<cs> the arithmetic is very important to people working on low budgets <e> <s> the minister gave the figure of so we must deduct that from the which brings the sick worker way below the present level of which is surely to his detriment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his helpful remarks and i thank the minister for suggesting that we might get some information by means of a question for written answer <e> <s> some time ago i read in a newspaper how much it costs to answer a parliamentary question <e> <s> as always i am keen to save the government money except at the expense of the welfare state and i should like to ask the noble lord the minister whether he cannot now answer this point since semi-numerate and semi-literate though i am i think that i have an answer <e> <s> there is a reference in the bill to a sum of as payment <e> <s> the minister has told the committee that from that there must be deducted for national insurance <e> <s> so i suggest that the committee stops talking about because in effect according to my arithmetic subject as always to correction the man or woman is receiving <e> <s> so let us talk about whether is the right amount <e> <s> that partly explains why we wanted to increase the amount from to which was to uplift it by leaving the sick employee to find just p extra but certainly not leaving a man on sick pay of to have to contribute and to be left at the end of the week if i have got it right with <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord just one question <e> <s> when he refers to per cent <e> <s> of workers being in schemes already can he confirm whether or not that is per cent <e> <s> of full-time male employees which was the figure i found out in my researches <e> <s> if women are included the percentage is very much lower than per cent <e>", "<cs> may i say briefly that we support the noble lord lord banks in his amendment <e> <s> it seems to us unfair that the initiation of this new scheme should not be accompanied by an updating of sickness benefit to restore its real value <e> <s> there are many people in the country who expected this to happen <e> <s> i know that there are many alibis about the state of the economy <e> <s> in view of the fact that my noble friend lord underhill referred earlier to the extra sums which the government are going to collect by charging national insurance contributions on sickness benefit which is a new windfall to the treasury we would have thought that that could have helped the government to make the uprating in sickness benefit which would have made this bill slightly more acceptable if i may put it this way <e>", "<cs> i intervene only briefly because we have had a very full debate on many of the details <e> <s> i want just to reaffirm our objections to this clause which lays down statutory rates of sick pay which we think are grossly inadequate especially in view of the fact that national insurance has to be deducted from them <e> <s> we are also concerned about subsection which provides that for the purposes of subsection <e>", "<cs> i support what has been said by the noble lord about the need to get ahead with the regulations as quickly as possible <e> <s> i repeat that we on this <e>", "<cs> i must interrupt the noble lord on that point <e> <s> if i heard him aright he said that some people might pretend to be ill when they are not <e> <s> surely there are provisions in the bill for certification <e> <s> surely it is not possible for there to be people claiming sickness benefit without deserving it <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply was most disappointing <e> <s> we tabled the amendment in all seriousness and if i do not paraphrase the ministers reply wrongly he said this was not a time or opportunity for change <e> <s> i would remind him that it is not the amendment which would make a change the government are making the change to which we are objecting <e> <s> we are saying let us not change the situation so that a man or woman in receipt of sickness benefit has to pay in contributions out of that benefit <e>", "<cs> yes indeed and in the sewers as my noble friend reminds me <e> <s> that is a very important place of work and i hope all those who work in the sewers earn more than or even and do not have to stay at home to make a profit <e>", "<cs> may i associate my noble friends on this side with the amendment that has been put forward <e> <s> many quotations have been brought before us about statements from various ministers on the question of bringing taxation into benefits when benefits were up-rated <e> <s> but what we are dealing with tonight in this amendment is the situation where it is proposed to tax these benefits without up-rating them <e> <s> this seems to us absolutely wrong and we therefore support the amendment <e> <s> we very much hope that the government will abide by the indications which they gave in the other place that there was to be a link between the taxation of benefits and the up-rating of benefits <e>", "<cs> this amendment is so technical that my noble friends and myself could not possibly have any objection to it <e>", "<cs> we cannot understand why this was not properly set out at the previous stage but as the government have obviously recognised that there were mistakes and have now brought the matter to us in a more proper way we will certainly agree <e> <s> we hope this amendment will now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the urgent necessity for the authority of the united nations to be upheld at the present time are the government aware that there is growing disillusionment and cynicism in cyprus having regard to the fact that these talks have been dragging on since and that resolutions passed by the united nations since requesting the withdrawal of foreign troops from the island have been ignored <e> <s> will the government not take an opportunity at the next meeting of the general assembly to try to get some movement into this very sad complicated and difficult matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be a better way of increasing productivity in the nhs if the government would take some positive action to bring this industrial dispute to an end <e> <s> surely that is the most destructive aspect of the productivity problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his courteous reply <e> <s> he should not apologise for its length <e> <s> nor do i apologise because as the noble lord has said this is the heart of the bill and it is very important for us to try to get it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> that point has not been made clear in previous debates and it is a considerable reassurance <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments are indeed compelling and i thank the noble lord for making them so clear <e> <s> i just wanted to ask him one question <e> <s> in this reference to territorial waters i find myself thinking about people working on oil rigs who might be without this statutory definition of territorial waters although they might be working for british firms <e> <s> i am just wondering how far this question of territorial waters would go for deep sea divers and other workers on oil rigs whose work may take them some distance away <e> <s> would they be covered by this amendment <e> <s> i very much hope we might get some information on this <e> <s> i put the point purely interrogatively <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome this improvement to the bill and are glad that help is to be available for the older workers and for those whose <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lord molloy for the way in which he moved the amendment <e> <s> as a wounded ex-service man himself who saw a very rough time in the last war we know that he is speaking from experience <e> <s> of course we appreciate the improvements that have been made by the government <e> <s> i would take slight exception to the noble lord having referred to ex-servicemen not bothering to make their claims <e> <s> there are all sorts of reasons why there are late claimants <e> <s> it may be that the symptoms did not manifest themselves for a considerable time <e> <s> it is not always because the late application is due to people not bothering <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord was not implying any fault on the part of these late applicants <e> <s> i am not very impressed that the figure of six years was chosen because that is the period for claiming back income tax i think the noble lord said <e> <s> that seems a total irrelevance <e> <s> i found myself wondering when thinking about this amendment what was the medical magic in six years rather than four five seven or as we suggest <e> <s> i do not think we can take this discussion much further today but i hope that in other places and at other times it may be further considered because it seems to me very fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his explanation but i remain unconvinced <e> <s> i would take him up especially on the point that if a man is sick obviously he is not participating in the dispute <e> <s> but my amendment has to be read with paragraph on page which says that he did not participate in or have a direct interest in the trade dispute in question <e> <s> this seems to me to be an unanswered point <e> <s> the employee can be sick and have an interest in the trade dispute <e> <s> as a result of the trade dispute he might get a rise or better conditions even though he may be unconscious at some point during the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has been so ably moved by the noble lord lord banks and with such a wealth of expert detail that i rise only to say that the amendment has our fullest support <e> <s> we think that the problem of child benefit has not been taken on board in this bill and we hope very much that what the noble lord lord banks has said will be taken into account by the government <e> <s> it certainly has our support <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept gratefully and with appreciation the amendment that the noble earl lord avon has moved <e> <s> but i must put on record some anxiety <e> <s> i am sure that all our thoughts tonight are with the soldiers sailors and airmen in the falklands <e> <s> some of them might lose their lives some of them might be wounded <e> <s> why should it be that if one of them lives in wiltshire and another in gloucestershire there should be a difference in their housing benefits <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord has said about the importance of having local authority decisions but it seems to me that when men are fighting together and working together on a common project it is absolutely wrong that the benefits which they will get in their housing should depend on where they live <e> <s> this seems to me to be quite irrational and unfair <e> <s> although i am sure that we do not want to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to emphasise what the noble lord lord trefgarne has said about the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne <e> <s> we have often co-operated consulted and worked together and i very much hope that whoever succeeds him will find that there is co-operation on these benches in the interests of the community of this country in this very important field <e> <s> i can only say to him i hope i am not embarrassing him that i have much enjoyed working with him <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell the house what steps are being taken to try to get a peaceful solution in this area rather than a situation of competing armament <e> <s> particularly can he say what talks are going on with the united states of america <e> <s> are they still sending arms to guatemala and trained personnel or have they now switched to belize which in either case must escalate the tension in what is really a very vulnerable and naturally peaceful area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered my question about united states involvement with belize <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that while we should all like to see more women in higher positions those of us who have worked in the foreign service would not have wanted our appointments on the basis of statutory women on grounds of sex <e> <s> we look forward to many more opportunities <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord agrees that that is the most constructive approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to associate myself and my noble friends with this bill <e> <s> the honourable member in the other place and the noble baroness lady faithfull have put the house in their debt and have rendered a service to parliament by drawing attention to what was an omission in the protective legislation <e> <s> also they have put the social services of this country in their debt <e> <s> we are glad to join in the support for this bill and hope that its implementation will be effectively carried out <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister what he would say to a student at birkbeck earning his or her living during the day and paying fees for night study which is not an easy thing to do out of taxed income who through no fault of his own loses his job and therefore has no money to continue paying his fees at a time when he would have more time to study <e> <s> surely we ought to make it possible for students in that position who may be within a very short time of taking their final degrees to be able to continue whereas if they are out of work they have no financial back-up to pay the fees which are essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement though i am sure he will appreciate that we do not welcome it <e> <s> of course we share the governments anxiety and concern for the welfare of patients and i am sure that that anxiety is felt by many of the staff concerned <e> <s> but the government cannot escape responsibility for the situation which has caused this terrible dilemma in our health services <e> <s> this has been made worse by the information to regional health authorities that they will have to find one-third of the increase in pay mean though it is because the health authorities are not fundraising authorities and they can provide that money only by reductions in their services <e> <s> this must be a government responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the minister seem to criticise trade union leaders who quote the increases available in terms of basic pay <e> <s> surely it is basic pay which we are arguing about <e> <s> if the minister is basing his figures on overtime earnings surely it means that the governments policy is one of compulsory overtime in order for these people to earn a decent living <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again but the noble lord the minister did not i believe answer one of my questions i know i asked several <e> <s> is it not a fact that many nurses and other residential staff will be faced with considerable increases in charges for their meals and accommodation which may more than absorb this modest increase <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister had time to look at the report of the public accounts committee which was published today and which indicates that there are beds in new hospitals which are empty not because of industrial action but because of lack of funds <e> <s> does not all this add up to the fact that the government are not giving sufficient priority to a fundamental review of the need for financial changes in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming this modest development may i remind the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he needs to be reminded that per cent <e> <s> of our children leave school without taking any examinations at all <e> <s> in view of that is it not possible that this new scheme could start before september <e> <s> is it a fact that it is not to involve pupils until the fourth form <e> <s> surely they are the very pupils who would benefit more if they were given special assistance earlier <e> <s> why is the scheme as i understand it being limited to only seven or eight local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for the lucidity with which he has put these propositions to the house <e> <s> they are very complicated and it is not easy to follow them in detail <e> <s> however i must put to your lordships that i cannot understand why these regulations are described on the order paper as up-rating measures <e> <s> these measures in the context of the governments policy will leave many people worse off <e> <s> many people will be down-rated as a result of the measures which the government have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point may i ask him whether the rpi includes national insurance contributions which have gone up so much and which make such a difference to peoples income <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister help me a little on this <e> <s> will it be for an individual tenant who feels that he is suffering from this expensive and inefficient heating to apply or must the application be made through the local authority and does the money go to the individual tenant or to the local authority <e> <s> i think that this will affect many people <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that this document can no longer be regarded as confidential <e> <s> is it not a nonsense to refer to it as a confidential document <e> <s> would it not be preferable for the government to publish it so that we know whether or not what we have read in the press is correct <e> <s> secondly i thank the noble baroness for referring to the national health service but this document purported to deal with social security too <e> <s> therefore may i ask the noble baroness whether the per cent <e> <s> shortfall in unemployment benefit is likely to be restored in the near future and what other proposals the government have in mind relating to the social security suggestions in the report <e> <s> i understand that the report is supposed to have so reported <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister say whether any thought is being given to the possibility of passengers picking up their duty free goods at the port of arrival so that there is a great saving in the shuttling of bottles all around the world <e>", "<cs> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as a governor of one of the colleges of london university i must press the minister further <e> <s> when we are given a triennial figure in ordinary english that would make us feel assured for three years <e> <s> the minister now appears to be saying that that is not the case <e> <s> is he aware that it is impossible

given to young people between the ages of and who were the subject of special statements under the education act because of physical or mental handicap <e> <s> will he also include consideration for young people between and years of age who become handicapped either physically or mentally after they have left school but who need educational facilities up to the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord has given us total figures will he not agree that there are more old people and sadly very many more unemployed people and that therefore the benefit per head is if anything reduced especially in view of the governments failure to reinstate the per cent <e> <s> abatement which was imposed on benefits in <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that some of the noble lords rather intemperate words this afternoon will have further entrenched the apparently invidious divisions that are being made within the national health service <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord on which side of the line are the very skilled essential and highly trained theatre and laboratory technicians to fall <e> <s> surely it is quite wrong for the government to propose a divide-and-rule basis for settling claims in the national health service in which everyone must work together <e> <s> in view of the length of training of the laboratory and theatre technicians i should like in particular to ask the noble lord where he puts them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are greatly indebted to the noble earl lord longford for giving us the opportunity to debate the subject before us this evening <e> <s> he gives us all an example of combined idealism with practical help which is most instructive <e> <s> his interest in homeless young people is only one of the many subjects on which he spends a great deal of his time and energy <e> <s> it is a privilege to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of bath and wells on his maiden speech <e> <s> i remember that when i had to make a maiden speech the only comfort i found was the thought that one can only make a maiden speech once in your lordships house <e> <s> it is one of the few experiences of life that can happen to

proper bonus payment if it were to retain the original value <e> <s> how are the government protecting the value of pensions in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very wide-ranging and important debate and it is rather difficult to wind-up from this side <e> <s> my only comfort is that it will be much more difficult for the minister opposite to reply to all the points that have been made in this debate though i can see that he is probably better briefed than i am <e> <s> we are all indebted to the noble lord lord wells-pestell who once again has shown his sympathy his compassion and his expert knowledge and concern for disabled people <e> <s> i do not want to be invidious but i was especially glad and i am sure that this is something which i share with all other noble lords

only delay your lordships to say that having discussed the principles of this matter at earlier stages we accept and acknowledge that this tidying-up process is essential <e> <s> we hope that sympathetic consideration will be given to all these heating problems and that the technical changes in the regulations will go through as speedily as possible and will be helpful to all concerned

will have to be an extension at queen marys and that the money which is now being spent at tadworth will have to be spent at queen marys <e> <s> surely the very close liaison between great ormond street and tadworth is very important <e> <s> secondly may i ask the minister to look again at the funding of a very special hospital like great ormond street <e> <s> it was in my constituency <e> <s>

that point <e> <s> i have many friends who have been to this hospital and who having been diagnosed as early cases have had to undergo only a small operation and not a mastectomy <e> <s> their lives have been made bearable and have gone on for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again but this is so important <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be relieved to learn that i do not propose to follow in great detail the marathon explanation that we have just heard <e> <s> the amendments are consequential on earlier legislation that we discussed very fully in the previous session and the noble lord the minister has made it quite clear that with very few exceptions the effect of the regulations is to increase as from april the contributions which employers and working people have to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by saying that of course it is perfectly within the right of the noble lord lord robertson to bring his anxieties about the abortion legislation before your lordships <e> <s> i think we should all accept and welcome the fact that he has found it possible to bring his anxieties before the house tonight <e>", "<cs> of course it does my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we read about it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will allow me he said that we must ask whether in the cases that he has mentioned abortion is justified <e> <s> because he has asked the question i must be allowed to say no and i hope that when he cites cases of this sort he will also bear in mind the situation of desperate middle-aged poor women living in slum conditions with five children in one room <e> <s> those are the sort of women about whom we care <e> <s> it is very frivolous of him to put these examples before your lordships tonight <e> <s> i am sorry to interrupt in this way but i feel very strongly that my noble friend for whom i have great respect is being very frivolous tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords he does not want to listen to this rubbish <e>", "<cs> my lords he is the one who is not listening <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will support this amendment tonight <e> <s> i must say that i share the confusion of the noble lord lord hayter about some of the wording of the bill but it is not unusual for wording which is brought forward as an <e>", "<cs> we share some of the anxieties to which the noble lord has referred and i would like to put one or two points to the minister about these two amendments <e> <s> in the first case i wish to make it clear <e>", "<cs> may i briefly ask the minister what happens to a doctor who is working in two localities and has surgeries in two different districts <e> <s> in which locality or territory does he function <e>", "<cs> on these benches we support this amendment and i am very surprised to find that the british medical association itself has written me a letter of support for this amendment <e> <s> this is an organisation with which i do not always agree but i am glad that they agree with me on this matter <e> <s> it does not seem right that the secretary of state should have direct appointment of both the chairman and the vice-chairman <e> <s> that is a change from the present practice and i do not know the justification for the secretary of state now wanting to appoint both the chairman and the vice-chairman <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord referred to a contractor chairman having a non-contractor vice-chairman and <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly just to associate my noble friends with the amendment <e> <s> the ground has been very well covered as it certainly was in part on second reading when the noble lord the minister agreed that rawp was a very blunt instrument but that it provided for the cross-boundary flows <e> <s> but clearly things are not working satisfactorily <e> <s> i shall not detain your lordships tonight beyond mentioning hospitals such as the national hospital for nervous diseases moorfields hospital and great ormond street hospital <e> <s> they are hospitals for the whole world as one can see when one visits them <e> <s> when one tries to speak to the patients it is difficult before it is time to leave to find one who speaks english <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the figures he gave relate only to the hospital <e>", "<cs> further to that point can the minister say whether he will be expecting the disregards to apply for capital for purposes of supplementary benefit <e> <s> which disregards do not include the surrender value of life policies or leases of ones home as distinct from owner occupation <e> <s> if that is so there will be considerable hardship <e>", "<cs> while the minister is looking for the answer may i say that as it was the will of the committee earlier that the words having regard to his means should be expunged it is surely for the government to take them out of their position here in the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask another question because this seems to be giving a new meaning to the phrase asset stripping which is not usually associated with this type of care <e> <s> an old person might well have some ancient furniture or possession which because of the state of the antique market turn out to be quite valuable <e> <s> supposing that old person bequeaths them to a relative or wishes in his will to bequeath those family goods to relatives is the minister saying that the relatives must be penalised or that the old person had no right to give away things which he specially wanted to keep in the family and which he would not want to sell for all kinds of reasons <e> <s> if that is to be included under this clause then i think that it is unworkable and totally unjust <e>", "<cs> this seems to become more and more confusing <e> <s> when i go into an old persons home i am going to give my car for example to my nephew <e> <s> the noble lord referred constantly to the word deliberate <e> <s> i shall deliberately give the car to my nephew <e> <s> how is the court to prove that i did not give the car away in order that my assets would be reassessed and that i was only giving he car away to get out of paying the dues

subsection where there is reference to the fact that the secretary of state may pay different fees <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lord glenamara for giving us the opportunity of talking about education this afternoon <e> <s> i intervene very briefly on one specific point <e> <s> i want to ask the government what has happened to the education act <e> <s> in case

in <e>", "<cs> my lords although we must all welcome any increase however mean and inadequate in sickness benefit i would not want your lordships to think that we on this side of the house have relaxed in our objection to the whole scheme <e> <s> however your lordships will be relieved to know that i do not propose this afternoon to repeat all that was said when the legislation was going through the house <e> <s> the noble minister has made it clear that this small increase is related to the retail price index <e> <s> i want to submit to your lordships that the retail price index is not always the best guide to the cost of living for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister and all noble lords who have contributed to this debate <e> <s> may i say straight away to the noble baroness lady faithfull who has such experience of these matters that i tried to anticipate her criticism of its legality by saying that there would have to be subsequent amendments of the child care act and that these would take on board her problem about which section of the legislation was being referred to <e> <s> i cannot agree with the noble baronesss reference to the strain that this would put upon parents of having to go to the juvenile court <e> <s> this seems to be an argument for the abolition of the juvenile courts <e> <s> parents often have to go to the juvenile courts <e> <s> i am not sure that the strain of a court appearance in a juvenile court where the issue can be discussed is as much of a strain as a parent receiving a letter saying that a committee has passed a resolution denying his right of access to his own child <e> <s> to be told this by people with whom you may not have come face to face by means of an official bureaucratic document seems to me to be the most traumatic experience of all <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord trefgarne gets too pleased with himself in view of what the noble lord lord renton has said may i ask him why although i welcome the amendments as improvements to the bill we could not have had them if they are so essential <e> <s> at the committee stage since that would have been the proper stage at which to discuss them in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> we have discussed this matter before and i have been told that the reason why this provision is in the bill is that a vice-chairman might one day become chairman and therefore it is important that the minister should have that prospective patronage <e> <s> but surely if the vice-chairman is good enough to become chairman and it happens that he is appointed in a different way and not by the minister the question provides its own answer <e> <s> the case has been very well put by the noble lord <e> <s> lord kilmarnock and i wish to register our support for it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies may i say in support of my noble friend and partly in answer to the noble baroness that it would not be a new principle <e> <s> local authorities have set tables for application for rent rebates and rate rebates to apply for family income supplement the details are set out and generally available <e> <s> therefore it is not a new principle <e> <s> it would give some guidance to potential applicants and make the situation known to the people in the area which i think is perfectly right <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i will read it all i was only trying to save the time of your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the kindly way in which he has dealt with my insufficiencies but i still think that there will be some difficulties for people who try to understand this bill <e> <s> i just leave two problems with the noble lord <e> <s> he assures us that section of the national assistance act is the basic act containing the powers under which regulations will be made <e> <s> would it not be helpful to have something in the bill to that effect so that the assessment of assets will be made under regulations to be prepared and laid by the secretary of state <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill as it stands which refers to regulations for assessing assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord and yes i am satisfied <e> <s> but i want to ask just one question <e> <s> let us suppose that a qualified barrister or solicitor who has been in practice then turns as i know people have done to the academic world and becomes a professor of law <e> <s> is he then disqualified or does the fact that some years before he was in practice as a barrister or solicitor cover him even if he has gone into academic work in a faculty of law <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister most sincerely for taking us through this labyrinth <e> <s> i am sure that so far as this side of the house is concerned he need not apologise for the way in which he has sought to clear up some of these difficulties <e> <s> i had hoped that the minister would be able to tell us when the new regulations are likely to be made available <e> <s> i believe that he said <e> <s> later this year <e> <s> as it is now only february later this year might be many months away and we shall want to know when we may expect the new regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister about the logic behind the differential <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name

country i should like to ask why the government did not take up the suggestion of the select committee on education in <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that there is a very uneven burden on local authorities in this connection in that there are more single homeless people in some areas than in others <e> <s> this does create local difficulties <e> <s> further does the noble lord not recognise that the mean level of supplementary benefit to homeless people because they have not got an address only perpetuates their homelessness <e> <s> without an address and without adequate benefit it becomes progressively more and more impossible for them to find anywhere to live <e> <s> finally is there anything the noble lord the minister can do i know he is sympathetic to hurry this up <e> <s> it is a disgrace to this country and to parliament that there will be people sleeping in cardboard boxes outside charing cross station and other places tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all agree that the noble lord lord wells-pestell has put the whole house in his debt today <e> <s> he speaks not only with compassion and sympathy but with a practical knowledge of the subjects which we have been talking about today <e> <s> i am sure that whatever opinions noble lords hold about these problems they will agree that it has been a very useful exercise and that we are grateful to my noble friend for giving us this opportunity <e> <s> the terms of the motion are drawn so widely that i was reminded of what ernie bevin used to say in another place coo <e> <s> weve ad a bit of a tour dorizon <e> <s> we certainly have from the economic situation of the world to the individual problems of many of the disadvantaged in our society <e> <s> it would be intruding on your lordships sleeping time if i were to go into detail on every point that has been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i will just repeat what my noble friend behind me has commented not enough <e> <s> having decided that the prime minister wants people to live their lives as they want to live them with enough money with a home and a job and with care for their children i think that the government opposite have fallen far short of what was promised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not recall that he also told the house at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to follow this up again but that is a totally unrealistic reply <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that every inhabitant of rowton house is vulnerable otherwise he would not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say why a person without an address receives whereas a single person with an address receives plus housing costs <e> <s> is he aware that it is more expensive to be homeless than to have a home <e> <s> this is because of having to eat out and make do in all kinds of ways <e> <s> secondly is it the departments policy that if a homeless person finds some lodgings that the department will advance the rent which most landlords demand quite properly in advance or are these people pushed around in the complications of the new housing benefit regulations so that they end up losing the chance of the lodgings that they have found <e>", "<cs> but my lords i was asking that they should receive the same not higher <e>", "<cs> my lords if children are let out and go wandering around the streets looking for their dinner in cafes is there not a danger that this might contribute to truancy <e> <s> will the minister try to monitor what is happening in schools where authorities have abandoned regular school dinners to ascertain whether all the children come back to school in the afternoon or whether afternoon truancy increases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all indebted to the minister for the clear way in which he has tried to lead us through all these complications <e> <s> successive governments have found that it is very difficult to express regulations referring to social security matters in clear and understandable terms for the people most concerned that is the beneficiaries <e> <s> i very much hope that the minister will be able to say that the department will be publishing translations in leaflet form which are intelligible to those most affected who are often those least able to follow the regulations with their frequent cross-references which are put before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not being rude he never is <e> <s> i was not sure about the clock as to whether the regulations had actually gone through the house of commons yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for setting out so clearly what is before us <e> <s> i wish only to clarify one or two points <e> <s> it is a question of making clear to those concerned what the government have in mind <e> <s> the draft scheme is an expensive piece of paper costing p <e> <s> that is extraordinarily inflationary <e> <s> article amending article of the principal scheme states in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome as i am sure we all do what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> i am sure the minister will be glad to hear that i do not propose to go into any of the details <e> <s> the whole question of the insurance situation of married women and widows is a very large problem and it is not to be dealt with in regulations which are coming before us tonight <e> <s> i know that many womens organisations and i hope many members of her majestys government are giving great thought to the fundamental problems involved in the insurance position of married women and widows <e> <s> we welcome these small improvements tonight and hope that your lordships will agree to them <e>", "<cs> my lords when these changes come into effect could the government look at changing the rule which causes the cashed-in value of life policies to be included in the capital resources of the family <e> <s> surely it is only prudent and i should have thought it would have appealed to the government that people should provide for the future and to include even child endowment policies in the capital sum seems to be very unfair <e> <s> secondly is it a fact that the value of the owner-occupied house is disregarded but that no similar consideration is given to tenants and leaseholders <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to seek some further information on the work of the consumer councils <e> <s> i am concerned about the position of people who can get rate rebates and rent rebates but apparently can get no rebate for their water charges <e> <s> i wonder whether this question would be within the terms of reference of the consumer councils <e> <s> i ask this in all sincerity because i put down a question on th april and the noble lord lord trefgarne told me in a written answer that there was no provision under the housing benefits scheme to help in the payment of water and sewerage charges <e> <s> we must all know that these charges are becoming an increasing proportion of the domestic expenditure of many people and for many households a worrying proportion of the household expenses <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only briefly in this debate and i should like to say how glad i am that my noble friend lord caradon referred to the signing of the treaty because i was there in the ledra palace on that day <e> <s> i hoped as did many others that the agreement would bring peace and progress to that lovely island <e> <s> on one side of the noble lord lord caradon sat archbishop makarios and on the other side sat

matter for some regret to those of us who have studied this report carefully and who hoped that it was to be the subject of tonights debate <e> <s> those of us who have survived many debates on this subject will regret that the matter does not seem to have been taken much further forward <e> <s> we have to agree that there must be some revision and some changes in this set-up <e> <s> this report should have taken us a step forward on that way <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord the minister will be able to point us in the direction that the government have in mind <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is too late and the noble lord spoke a great deal longer than i intend to speak <e> <s> he has often taken longer than i intend to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in

other wars <e> <s> although they may have accepted with sadness the arrangements which were not retrospective a new situation has now arisen with the falklands arrangements arrangements which were quite rightly made in my view <e> <s> will the government not look at this matter again with some sensitivity and sympathy for the sake of people who feel equally bereaved wherever their loved ones were killed and whatever may have been the date when this happened <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that a woman whose husband was killed in burma has a less right to visit her husbands grave than a woman whose husband is buried in france <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord the minister has said about the negotiations <e> <s> but will he explain why the negotiations are only between the local authorities and rowton hotels <e> <s> surely we have to recognise that this is a national problem <e> <s> is it not most unfair to leave it to the local authorities <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister say what is the governments estimate of the figures of homeless single men sleeping rough in london tonight <e> <s> did he see an estimate in the evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for making this obscure bill as clear as possible <e> <s> my first criticism which relates to the cost of living is that this bill consisting of three and a half blank pages and three and a half printed pages costs <e> <s> i know that this is not the responsibility of the minister but many people are very concerned about what seems to be the increasing cost of official documentation <e> <s> i very much hope that an opportunity will be taken to look at this matter <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> he has moved it so clearly and so ably that there is little need for me to go into a great deal of detail <e> <s> i noticed that when the minister was replying to the earlier amendment he referred to the extra cost that would be incurred if the changes that we wish for were made <e> <s> if there is an extra cost to the government that must mean a loss to the beneficiaries <e> <s> when he talks about all these thousands of pounds being a charge on the government it makes us feel that we really ought to look at those thousands of pounds of which beneficiaries are being deprived <e> <s> it cannot work both ways <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he say whether the government will provide any recompense for people who have had an underpayment of benefit because of inflation and who then because of getting a job never apparently obtain recompense for the period during which they have been underpaid in relation to inflation <e>", "<cs> i apologise for not making myself clear <e> <s> i was not talking about pensioners <e> <s> i thought i referred quite clearly to the unemployed who will have been receiving unemployment benefit at a rate below inflation but who if they get a job before the year of reassessment is up will never get that loss of money paid back <e>", "<cs> then train them <e>", "<cs> this is a very difficult and sensitive problem and i think we all appreciate how the noble lord lord hunter and the noble lord lord kennet have endeavoured to meet it <e> <s> on balance however i hope that the noble lord lord hunter will not press his amendment <e> <s> it seems to me we can only legislate here for the courts of this country and how difficult it is going to be for the courts of this country if we put before them judgments which have to be made on the ritual cultural or traditional reasons which are extant in other countries <e> <s> i feel that is putting an onus on the courts that would be most impractical and most unfair and while appreciating the motives for it i very much hope the noble lord <e> <s> lord hunter will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> of course this is a non-party bill and i must make clear that i am speaking only for myself <e> <s> i would be appalled if this amendment were accepted <e> <s> i very much hope that it will be withdrawn for further consideration <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord is scoring in his own goal because he is writing into the bill other circumstances in which female circumcision is to be allowable <e> <s> he is broadening the reasons for this mutilation to take place <e> <s> it seems to me that by accepting the fact that there are physical conditions for instance some forms of cancer where it is necessary for an operation to be performed in this way we really are opening the doors wide to abuse by suggesting that a couple of psychiatrists can find that it would improve the mental health of a woman to be mutilated <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the example of the minister and speak not only to amendment no <e> <s> but also to the other amendments before us <e> <s> this is no way for important legislation to be dealt with <e> <s> a bill that affects so many thousands of our people should have received more thought and more concern <e> <s> in fact i would have preferred that the bill had been allowed to fall so that whichever government come into power next month could have begun again and looked at matters in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether in the light of what seems to be the agreed view that inflation is likely to rise not least due to the increases in petrol prices and mortgage rates the government will give more generous treatment to the level of supplementary benefits and other ways of helping people such as through assistance with heating costs <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether the government are paying any attention to the pensioners price index as distinct from the retail price index and if they are not why are they keeping the pensioners price index in existence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say with apologies that i think the noble lord did not answer my first question which was whether there would be brought in more generous levels of supplementary benefit and help with heating costs in order to compensate for the virtual drop in pensioner income <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure the house that local authorities will not be penalised if they spend money on this excellent objective

impoverishment of the poorest people in the country <e> <s> how many tenants are involved in these changes <e> <s> does she know how many of them are pensioners and how many are unemployed young people <e> <s> has she talked <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble baroness again <e> <s> we are trying to help some of the poorest people in this country <e> <s> if they are going to take away from them million surely this should be looked at again <e> <s> i sympathise with the difficulties of the noble baroness in dealing with all these questions but surely that difficulty indicates the need for the government to look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether in view of the muddle and delay over housing benefits there is some delay for certain people in receiving their heating allowances because of the processing of the housing benefit claims <e> <s> can he tell the house who is supposed to assess the heating needs of people at a time when the government are telling local authorities to cut their staffs <e> <s> what is the delay between the application from a person for such an allowance and actually receiving it <e> <s> how many claims are still waiting in this cold december and have not yet been processed <e> <s> would it not be a good idea for the government to keep the charges down for everybody and spend more money on insulation and other housing improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has quite rightly said that this is a routine exercise <e> <s> it is a routine exercise which some of us regret because the routine seems to be disregarding some of the fundamental thinking that is necessary about the whole social security situation in this country <e> <s> the emptiness of your lordshipschamber indicates the reaction of many people to these rather arcane and complicated matters although they affect almost the whole population of the country and deserve more consideration <e> <s> however this morning is not the time to go into the deeper problems and as i see it into the necessary revision of some of the legislation to which these orders relate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no surprise to your lordships to know that as we fundamentally opposed this scheme we are not particularly concerned with the details which the noble lord has put before the house this morning <e> <s> we are much more worried <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house whether the government agree with the estimate of the low pay unit that about million employees are receiving less under this scheme than under the previous national insurance sickness benefit scheme bearing in mind that under this scheme workers have to pay a national insurance contribution and income tax which did not apply to national insurance sickness benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the employee who considers himself underpaid has to take the employer to the county court <e> <s> is that not a gross infringment of the rights of an employee who happens to be ill <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that those child benefit books containing notices are going to the per cent <e> <s> who already receive child benefit <e> <s> my noble friends question referred to the remaining per cent <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have any knowledge of any racial or linguistic problems <e> <s> are there any leaflets in languages other than english which might help people to be more aware of their rights <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble minister recall that in the consultative document which was put out it was stated that the equivalent value of the death grant would in have been <e> <s> can he tell us what it is now in january <e> <s> can he say what practical steps the government are taking to reopen the consultations which failed so disastrously in <e>", "<cs> the committee is in some difficulty tonight <e> <s> as the noble lords will recall the bill has in effect had two second readings <e> <s> there was general welcome on all sides of the house for the bills intention <e> <s> i very much hoped that it would go smoothly on its way but it is totally necessary to oppose the government amendment on the grounds that they have introduced the term mental health in the amendment <e> <s> the original provision referred to physical health which covered all the points raised about the possibility of cancer deformity and other difficulties <e> <s> we were totally agreed about that <e> <s> suddenly we find the words mental health in the amendment <e> <s> this is most unfortunate <e> <s> it takes the bills intention into very shadowy places <e> <s> it is an invitation for every charlatan in london to crawl out of the woodwork and say this woman has a mental difficulty <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble baroness is clear on that but i think that we must ensure that all your lordships are clear that the reference to mental health permits surgery on grounds of mental health and should not be acceptable to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friends will agree that we should wait for the statement <e> <s> however just for the record as i understand it the noble lord has not given a full list of the representations that have been received <e> <s> have not the government received representations from the citizens advice bureaux describing the scheme as inequitable and unworkable from the conservative members of parliament from the governments own advisory committee on rent rebates and rent allowances from shac from the london housing aid centre from the institute of housing which described it as a nightmare from the child poverty action group and from the parliamentary group for pensioners <e> <s> surely it would be fairer if all the representations could be put on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for making that statement <e> <s> first i should like to express on behalf of my noble friends and myself our regret at the news of the death of sir arthur armitage <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are very complicated and i am sure that all of us want to see this bill go through with its original intention carried out namely the prohibition of female circumcision <e> <s> i feel that we are being sidetracked by a great deal of talk about midwifery procedures which are not strictly relevant but which may be incidental <e> <s> it is not very helpful that some of these considerations have been brought in <e> <s> in my view they are not strictly relevant <e> <s> we all know what we are trying to do <e> <s> we are trying to stop this terrible mutilation being carried out in this country <e> <s> we are not concerned with the accepted procedures carried out by professional people in the course of normal health care and midwifery <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house when we might hear the governments response to the oglesby report which dealt <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side are very glad when anyone gets any money from the government for anything <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he can tell the house about the number of exclusions the completions of the exclusion form the sspe <e> <s> this entitles an employer not to pay sick pay under this scheme <e> <s> also what information can the noble lord give the house about non-payment of ssi <e>", "<cs> my lords it was to ask whether the noble lord will be able to tell the house at some time about the number of exclusions and the effect on employees of these regulations which relate mainly to low pay <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very much indebted to the noble lord lord banks for bringing this important question before us this evening <e> <s> i do not want to detain the house for long but i assure the noble lord the minister that the brevity of my remarks is not proportional to the seriousness of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord on having read such a grotty brief so well <e> <s> when we are considering such proposals before the house i think it is very important to try to find out what is the basic philosophy behind them <e> <s> we are told that under the housing benefits regulations there are problems of public spending and because the government underestimated the number of people who would need housing benefit help we now have to hold back on those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether it would be possible for him to give an assurance tonight that the review will be published and that it will relate not just to housing benefits but to the whole question of housing finance including tax relief on mortgage payments and other aspects of housing finance <e> <s> many of us believe that if the review relates only to housing benefits it will not be doing its job <e> <s> i hope the minister can reply tonight but if he is unable to do so i am prepared to wait for an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the noble lord say that the government recognise the importance of voluntary organisations in the housing field at a time when the government are making it more difficult for local authorities to contribute to those schemes and more difficult for voluntary organisations to carry out the work that he says is important <e> <s> does he not agree that public contributions to the special housing for which most voluntary associations are responsible will be discouraged if potential donors feel that the houses they help to provide will be sold off <e>", "<cs> my lords before speaking on the motion i have listened carefully to what has been said and i very much appreciate so do all my noble friends the care and consideration which has been given from all sides of the house to this legislation <e> <s> i hope that we can count on the government not only giving the bill a fair wind but seeing it safely into harbour <e> <s> i see it and so do most of my noble friends as an important bill for just two reasons which i should like to put on the record briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i realise there is a temptation to turn discussion on a statement into a debate especially when it is so important and wide-ranging <e> <s> but i shall absent myself awhile from that felicity and hope that through the usual channels a debate may be arranged soon because this is a very wide-ranging and important statement <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting that these anomalies have persisted under successive governments does not the noble baroness understand that while she is affirming that these pensions should apply to people in this country it is very difficult for canadians to understand why there are other countries including the united states of america which are exempt from these restrictions <e> <s> can she also confirm that pensioners from the civil service and the armed forces are allowed to receive their upgradings wherever they decide to live <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister help the house by telling us what informa-tion he has about the difficulties experienced by local authorities in the changes that were brought about in april <e> <s> would it be possible for the government not to bring in further changes in november until the report which we have been promised is made available <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the anxiety in the house about the increasing cost of funerals and all of us recognise what a difficult job this is for those who do this work would it be possible for the government to refer the matter to the office of fair trading so that perhaps we could get some report on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say what this unified fund will be <e> <s> is it the intention of her majestys government to break up the existing glc superannuation fund <e> <s> surely that would not be financially satisfactory <e> <s> further is it the intention of the government to abolish the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> can he say whether the government will try to suggest to the crown commissioners who i understand own this uniquely beautiful site that whoever takes possession of it some consideration will be given as to the public good and that this lovely site will not be used for speculative and profiteering purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to square what the noble lord has just said with page of the conservative manifesto of april which says quite clearly <e>", "<cs> does it not say quite clearly that they will phase out the earnings rule during the next parliament <e> <s> now we are in the next parliament but one and apparently the noble lord still cannot fulfil that promise <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that the linking of pensions to the retail price index rather distorts the budget of most old-age pensions because many of the items that come into the retail price index are not particularly relevant to elderly people <e> <s> can the noble baroness say whether the government are giving any consideration to this point <e> <s> while old-age pensioners are linked to an index which includes gin and fur coats we shall not get a very realistic idea <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer my noble friends question about the possibility of using the retirement pension book to set these claims out more clearly <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord is aware as i am of the smallness of the print at the back of the pension book which gives this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to this debate <e> <s> perhaps i may say especially to the noble lord lord spens who has only just returned to the chamber that i may not have been here for every minute but i seem to have been here for a lot of minutes <e> <s> i should like to say how happy i am to see the noble earl lord caithness on the front bench opposite <e> <s> i hope he will enjoy his new appointment and that we shall enjoy many interesting arguments as time goes by <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> before the minister leaves that point may i ask him something very quickly <e> <s> he referred to the problem of people needing specially expensive glasses <e> <s> can he tell us how special is special and how expensive is expensive <e> <s> what kind of sum are we thinking about <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why the government appear to be taking no notice of their own social security advisory commission which said quite clearly <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> the logic of what the noble earl has said is that the blind allowance should be abolished altogether <e> <s> he has said quite clearly that it is not justified as a special allowance and that it is the policy of the government to concentrate help according to disability and not according to any particular category <e> <s> it would be more honest if the government were to come out clearly and abolish the blind allowance rather than say that it can stay at the miserable sum it is and cannot be increased <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord banks in his proposition <e> <s> it seems to me that in this clause we have an understanding of the governments attitude to the problem of the abolition of child dependency and child allowances <e> <s> the whole problem of child support is of the foremost importance in dealing with the question of family poverty <e> <s> in fact many of us want assessments not only increased to keep pace with inflation but also to transcend inflation because there will never be a real rise in the standard of living unless people are able to receive more than the increase in inflation <e> <s> we want to look forward to an enriching of life for the whole family <e> <s> it is in that context that some of us are looking at the question that clause stand part <e>", "<cs> it is all very well for the noble lord to say that it is not right to regard unemployed men over as retired but the policies of this present government are retiring very many men over <e> <s> they are conscripting these people into unemployment <e> <s> then to say calmly that the government do not regard them as retired is really a very ungracious and unfair assessment of the situation <e> <s> the noble lord seemed in a hurry <e> <s> he seemed to consider it late <e> <s> i can tell him that those of us who have been honed in another place do not feel that this time of night is a bit late <e> <s> we feel that these are very important matters and that the lateness of the hour should not detract from the importance of these questions <e>", "<cs> in support of my noble friend we appreciate the ministers explanation but it does not answer all the queries <e> <s> the noble minister said that it was not the governments intention to reduce trade union representation but to increase representation for disabled people and single-parent families <e> <s> i cannot understand why disabled people and single-parent families cannot be members of trade unions <e> <s> this chopping up of people into separate divisions is not helpful <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his courteous intervention but i have to ask him what is meant by area <e> <s> what is meant by persons living or working in the area <e> <s> with the amount of commuting that there is in present days and we have been talking a lot about the glc in your lordships house recently and there are london boroughs is where you live relevant or where you work <e>", "<cs> may i answer the noble lord because he put a question to me <e> <s> i tried to make the point that living or working is the crux of this whole matter <e> <s> one might be living in westminister and working in camden and be on a tribunal in camden <e> <s> then one loses ones job <e> <s> then one is neither living nor working in camden <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will make clear when he replies what an area is <e> <s> is it a county <e> <s> is it a borough <e> <s> where is it <e> <s> in parts of the country it might be a very wide area <e>", "<cs> to save your lordships time i would say only that we strongly support the amendment which has been moved by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> my economical use of time this evening might not be repeated on another occasion but i want to make it clear that we support the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> in discussing the bill with many people i have found that the fact that the title of the bill is health and social security has not conveyed to the members of the public the information that it has anything to do with optical appliances or optical services <e> <s> as the long title of the bill states that it is an act to amend the opticians act i can see no possible objection to the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to sum up this debate because it has covered so many different subjects but i shall start by thanking the noble lord lord wells-pestell for giving us an opportunity to discuss this matter today <e> <s> he has brought to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly only to thank the noble lord for his sympathetic hearing of this case <e> <s> however there are one or two problems that worry us <e> <s> the noble lord has said that it is the governments intention that cases shall be considered individually according to personal circumstances <e> <s> but if the age of is written into the bill that produces a rigidity which surely makes it impossible for personal circumstances to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only briefly to express our support for this amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ennals has reminded us this benefit was first introduced by a labour government and many of us were looking forward to its extension <e> <s> i should just like to ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> when he gives the estimated cost has he taken into account the offsetting expense involved if all these caring married women send their senile old mothers-in-law into institutions and long-stay hospitals <e> <s> surely there is a great financial benefit and not only a social benefit for many of these old and invalid people when they are cared for at home <e> <s> that ought to be offset against the sums which the noble earl has mentioned <e> <s> i see that the noble earl is nodding <e> <s> perhaps he has tried to cost it must be difficult indeed the savings to the state of all the voluntary caring work that is done in thousands of homes up and down the country by women who as the noble baroness has reminded us often give up their own prospects of marriage and find that by the time they have cared for their elderly parents they themselves are about ready to qualify for their old age pension without having built up proper contribution records <e>", "<cs> my lords in our view what is wrong with the matters before us is that they should not be in the bill at all <e> <s> late at night we have tacked onto a very complex bill matters concerning these pension rights which are of great public interest and concern to every working person in this country <e> <s> we are inserting five new sections after section of the social security pensions act without full and proper discussion <e> <s> as i said on an earlier occasion this habit of legislating by producing a mix-up of bills of unrelated subjects is not the best way in which to serve parliament and to serve this house in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> we support the amendment and the noble lord was certainly reading my mind correctly in saying that i was not satisfied by the noble lords reply to my previous question at an earlier stage about the absence of any worsening under the provisions of schedule <e> <s> i remain unassured <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill seems to have been with us for a very long time <e> <s> it is right that this should have been so because it is a bill that affects hundreds of thousands of people in this country <e> <s> it is right that your lordships should have given careful and close consideration to its varying proposals <e> <s> i welcome the end of this unwelcome muddle of a bill the end at least until the next labour government takes it all to pieces again and puts things right <e> <s> we await four promised reports on the social services <e> <s> we can only hope that there will be maximum public involvement and treasury involvement and that we shall be able to look more closely at the wider aspects of the health and social security provisions within which the provisions of this bill play a comparatively small part <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i cannot see why it is not relevant to the bill before the house when a large part of this bill concerns eyesight the preservation of eyesight and the endangering of eyesight <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks it would be fairer of me i will read out the whole letter <e> <s> i see that he is shaking his head <e> <s> of course i know that schedule to the national health service act applies <e> <s> i have been around a long time and i too know that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not let that comment go on the record <e> <s> i said absolutely nothing of the sort <e> <s> i was talking about what would happen after this bill comes into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for putting these complicated matters so clearly before the house <e> <s> the fact that it is friday afternoon and that the majority of your lordships have found it agreeable to go to fresh fields and other pastures does not exempt those of us who are here from putting one or two points which affect hundreds of thousands of people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord make clear how it works <e> <s> i appreciate his explanation but if a child hides his money box under the bed or lends it to his grannie or something of that sort how do the insurance officers find out <e> <s> is it only the honest parents who produce their childrens money boxes who are penalised while other children might go off and buy a stereo or as i have said hide their money <e> <s> i am asking because i am worried about the officers concerned <e> <s> how do they hope to go around finding out what has happened to childens money boxes <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord just make clear whether the figures he mentioned are per week <e> <s> he referred to people losing p is that per week <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say whether the services of acas have been invited to help solve this difficult dispute <e> <s> secondly while thanking the post office staff for all that they have done to help pensioners over this problem can the noble lord say how much it is costing the government to keep this strike going by having to make extra payments to the post office for the further work that they are doing <e> <s> can he give an assurance that the november benefit increases will be honoured <e> <s> will he further confirm or deny that the cost of these <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for asking another question but the noble lord the minister has said that acas is involved <e> <s> can he tell the house whether acas has put forward some definite proposition and which side has refused to agree to it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady ewart-biggs has put the house in her debt tonight by raising this very important subject <e> <s> i am sure that the house appreciated the wisdom and experience of all who have spoken <e> <s> my noble friend lady ewart-biggs we all know gives very unselfishly of her time as do many other members of your lordships house and so they are speaking from practical knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for promising to pursue the matter <e> <s> when he talks about finance do he and the government take into account the fact that most of these elderly people are widows and widowers who left this country to go to stay with married sons and daughters and to make a home in canada and that thereby they are saving our social services a great deal of money and use of manpower <e> <s> can the noble lord not therefore include in the balance sheet some of these savings and perhaps feel able to be a little generous very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord the minister who has set out this very complicated situation as clearly as possible <e> <s> i want to ask him only a few questions <e> <s> i understand that under section of the act there has to be a treasury supplement that is agreed <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has told us that the contribution of per cent <e> <s> has been reduced to per cent <e> <s> and i have to ask him why <e> <s> is this reduction in order to balance the books and is he balancing the books <e> <s> because there are many old people especially old people over years of age who are to lose their heating allowances <e> <s> how many reductions is he making in housing benefits in order that he can make this reduction from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> how many strikers families are going to be worse off so that he can reduce the contribution from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> i hope he will tell the house how he can explain the invention of a -week calendar year <e> <s> this -week invention saves million a year and this really cannot be acknowledged to be for social security purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating that long and complicated statement which i am sure we shall have to discuss at greater length at some other time <e> <s> i must say however that underlying the statement there seem to be suggestions that somehow too many people are getting too much money out of the system <e> <s> while not condoning fraud or deceit i have to say that the real sadness is that much of this syndrome is symptomatic of the malaise and demoralisation of today especially the despair of continuing unemployment among many young people who see no hope of ever getting a job <e> <s> they feel that society does not care for them so why should they care for society except to get what they can out of it <e> <s> therefore the pity for us all is first of all that the skill the ingenuity and the intelligence which they could contribute to enriching their own and the nations life is squandered in what some of them call working the system <e>", "<cs> my lords i can agree with at least one point in the ministers speech we welcome the changes affecting the disability allowance <e> <s> however these changes seem to indicate some inefficiency in that this particular allowance has only very recently been introduced <e> <s> it must he confusing for claimants to find that already the government are having to bring forward amendments and tidy up these matters <e> <s> this indicates the terrible muddle which is to be found in the whole area of social services at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i would remind him that we asked him a lot of questions <e> <s> can he let us have the figures for homeless families who are really such a large proportion of those in the bed and breakfast accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by wishing the ministers on the government side a happy christmas but i am not sure whether all the recipients of statutory sick pay will want to offer the same wishes <e> <s> however because of the time and the situation i shall only say to the noble earl the minister that when the social security bill comes to us in the new year we shall want to go into the whole matter in more detail <e>", "<cs> whatever it is my lords i am cold <e> <s> anyhow it was very cold <e> <s> it was the lowest temperature recorded this century <e> <s> caring as i do about my friends in scotland i put down a question to ask what the minister was doing for cold people in cold scotland having read that the temperature was the lowest this century <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur in a written answer on th february replied <e>", "<cs> my lords he is in the middle east so perhaps that is why he does not know how cold it is in scotland <e> <s> one of my noble scottish friends told me that the problem is that in scotland they take the temperature at dyce <e> <s> if dyce is warmer than braemar braemar has to freeze <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side would like to thank the noble earl and congratulate him on his reading ability without spectacles which some of us need on the nhs <e> <s> i should like to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate <e> <s> i only wish i could feel that the government will take any notice of some of the comments that have been made because they were very genuine and very sincere anxieties <e>", "<cs> also my lords briefly for the record i do think that the noble earl was unfair to my noble friend lady fisher <e> <s> she certainly did not suggest that putting people from mental hospitals into community care was a cheap option <e> <s> in fact i got the impression from what my noble friend said that she had an anxiety that that might be the attitude <e> <s> the anxiety on this side of the house and i am sure that many other noble lords share it is that with rate capping it is not possible for local authorities to do all that they would wish to do in community care <e> <s> it has been asked and i do not think we have had an answer if those elements in local authority expenditure which relate to community care will be exempt from rate capping whether those matters are taken care of by voluntary authorities who are now being helped by local authorities or directly by local authorities <e> <s> i know that it is not in order to ask the noble earl to reply again but i would just ask him to take those points on board and perhaps when there are further discussions he will bear the points that i have made in mind <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the well-informed leaks in the press come from ministers or from civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords not being totally disconnected with many newspapers in this country i think that i might find the answers for myself <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether it is a fact that people who are working on these reviews have been instructed that there must be a nil cost effect in regard to anything that they suggest <e> <s> further i wonder whether those involved will be able to consult the treasury so that we can at last get fiscal policies taxation and social welfare integrated in a way which will be most essential if we are to make any progress <e>", "<cs> my lords while i want to agree with the government about removing abuses i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can say whether he and his colleagues are taking into account the alternative accommodation which will be necessary for many people if these regulations are imposed as suggested <e> <s> at a time when local authorities are being restrained in their expenditure what is to happen to people who can no longer stay in the accommodation that they are using at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all welcome any extension of assistance to people suffering from industrial disease <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister one or two questions <e> <s> the amendment scheme before us today has to be cross-referenced with the principal scheme <e> <s> i noticed that schedule to the principal scheme is to be amended so as to provide that benefit will apply where death is after st april <e> <s> it seems to me that where people have not only lung cancer but also suffer from other distressing diseases surely they should warrant the kind of assistance which will be given to people who manage to live until after st april <e> <s> i am sure that that would be the wish of all noble lords <e> <s> i am very sorry if i have misread anything but i have looked very carefully at schedule to the principal scheme and at the amendment of schedule which is before us today <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend would care to speak at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he telling the house that a man has to die after st april before he can benefit from this scheme <e> <s> and how does he benefit from it if he is dead <e> <s> is the only benefit to be that of the plus whatever increment there might be to his widow and family <e> <s> it would be a good thing if this matter could be looked at again <e> <s> i cannot withdraw my regret about this aspect of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back but this is a question of schedule of the principal scheme which states dates after which death from diseases must have occurred <e> <s> the amendment before us today provides that st april shall apply for the matter we are discussing <e> <s> as for retrospection surely in the case of war injuries and certain industrial injuries we do look back a bit <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain why his noble friend lord avon told me on th january in reply to a question that the government have no information about the number of homeless people and that local authorities have specific duties to provide appropriate assistance <e> <s> when i ask local authorities about what assistance they are providing the only response i get is that because of rate capping they cannot provide this assistance <e> <s> if the government do not know how many people are sleeping rough why do they close these places which provide people with somewhere to go <e> <s> surely it is quite wrong if the government do not know how many people are homeless that they should shut down the places where there is at least some shelter <e>", "<cs> my lords instead of directing questions to the fact that some of these places are not full should we not be asking why they are not full <e> <s> it may be that people are not attending because there is something wrong with the centres <e> <s> why do we not try to find out why people who are sleeping on the streets <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> i understand that the orders will be debatable and therefore i am sure your lordships will be pleased to hear that i do not propose to follow what i feel is a regettable tendency in this house for statements to become the subject of debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this is the first occasion on which the noble baroness the minister has taken charge of a major debate in her newly promoted capacity and we wish her well <e> <s> we do not promise her a good time or an easy time but we know that we can rely on her to deal sympathetically and honestly with the many questions which we shall have to raise <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall see <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not understand that the changes in board and lodging allowance that have recently been made we debated them on maundy thursday put limits on the amount of time during which young people can stay in accommodation and make it impossible for them to settle down and get on with their training or get on with their job <e> <s> does the noble lord not understand that while he says this is a matter for local authorities the government through rate capping and other devices are making it increasingly impossible for local authorities to carry out this job <e> <s> i do not want to monopolise the time but it is very important that i ask the noble lord one further question <e> <s> when young people come out of care are the government concerned at all about where they live or what happens to them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble minister tell us whether there is any ceiling on the deductions which can be made from invalidity pensions widows pensions and old-age pensions so that there is not total impoverishment of those people who are trying to <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why this hospital was shut in the first place and how he can guarantee that women in that area can be treated by women doctors <e> <s> is he not just putting some hopefulness before the house without any certainty <e> <s> can he also tell us whether the waiting list in that area has lengthened or shortened as a result of the disgraceful closing down of this hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say on what authority he states that there is no religion in which women are made to feel that it is difficult for them to be dealt with by men doctors <e> <s> those of us who have worked for years with the elizabeth garrett anderson hospital for example find that many women feel that it is impossible and unacceptable for them to be seen by men doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it quite clear that although i am speaking from the front bench on this side of the house we have a free vote and there is no party line on this matter at all <e> <s> i hope that there will not be a party line in any quarter of the house <e> <s> i want to thank all the speakers who have made their contributions to this important debate especially my noble friend lord kennet <e> <s> i am not sure that i should call him my noble friend any more but socially if not politically i shall call him my noble friend because he has worked so hard on this subject <e> <s> we all remember the way he introduced previous bills on this matter and i think that the whole house should be very grateful for his efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords why not <e> <s> they are only men <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl assure the house that this green paper will be a green paper as traditionally understood in that it will be a series of suggestions and thoughts which can be discussed and altered or are the leaks to the press correct in suggesting that the government have in fact made up their mind and that this will be the most rigid careen paper ever <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate the noble baroness <e> <s> she is getting better and better at reading ill-written scripts <e> <s> the noble baroness told us in conclusion that what was announced today would make the system easier to understand <e> <s> i did not feel that there was a great rapport of understanding among your lordships as this complicated document was being read out <e>", "<cs> thank you my lords <e> <s> what i cannot understand about this document is that it suggests that the children will not be able to pay for the old people <e> <s> the contributions which the children make are for their old-age pensions <e> <s> i have paid my contributions <e> <s> i have been at work since i was and i do not want anybody telling me that i am a burden on the younger generation <e> <s> i should like to know what has happened because i am very suspicious of where my pension contributions have gone <e> <s> i think that they have been swallowed up by the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> i do not think that they have been properly invested <e> <s> i should have done better to have put them in a building society or in national savings <e> <s> therefore it is wrong for the government to put out this verbiage suggesting that old people are a nuisance and that the young people will not be able to afford to keep us <e> <s> the logic of that would be to kill us all off and that certainly would be cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel there is an air of unreality in this chamber as we try to return to the social security bill after the important and far-reaching statement that we listened to earlier on the same subject <e> <s> in view of that news this debate is largely a grotesque irrelevance <e> <s> the bill is also grotesque in its form and purpose <e> <s> this is i regret to say true to recent tendencies in the dhss to send to parliament bills which are a ragbag of disparate ingredients of what are called in the long title connected purposes but which are manifestly disconnected <e> <s> in this one measure we are to deal with occupational pensions gratuities to members of the horserace totalisator board statutory sick pay pensions for members of the gaming board changes in pneumoconiosis benefit and subsidies in housing benefits <e> <s> i welcome the inclusion of the fact that married women entitled to the over-s pension at the lower rate will qualify for the standard rate paid to men and other women over <e> <s> this is no way for legislation to be drafted and brought to this house <e> <s> it makes it difficult to have a coherent discussion at second reading <e> <s> when we look at the details we shall be raising many more points in committee but i feel i want to register my protest because we have had several social security bills which have been unsatisfactory in their form <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly <e> <s> i should like to begin by apologising to the committee <e> <s> on second reading i made a terrible mistake and i grossly misled your lordships <e> <s> at column of the second reading debate on th may the noble baroness lady masham said <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> the noble baroness has been speaking so much today that i cannot think there is any bill before your lordships which is not hers <e>", "<cs> we feel the same <e> <s> it really is ladies day at the lords <e> <s> i shall direct my question instead to the noble baroness lady masham and ask her whether she has in mind any notification process of the kind which there has to be in the case of abortions and so on so that we will be able to see how the bill is working out <e> <s> meanwhile i hope that the noble baroness will not feel that she has to tell the committee that between now and report stage there is no hope of a meeting of minds over this particular difficulty <e>", "<cs> perhaps i did not make my question clear <e> <s> i was not asking about help to these organisations which i hope will be forthcoming but about whether there is to be a legal obligation as there is with the termination of pregnancy for these operations to be registered and recorded so that we know what is happening that is through the legal process and not through any voluntary organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister is able to target areas that are particularly low in response can he consider the possibility of undertaking a definite educational campaign in those areas <e> <s> is it not a fact that school medical officers are not allowed to distribute the sugar lumps but can only tell parents to take their children to their nhs doctor and there is many a slip between the advice being given and the children being taken to the doctor <e> <s> can we not involve the school medical service more actively <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord has said but i must ask him to think a little more about this <e> <s> we are not asking for the illegal operations to be reported because of course they will not be <e> <s> what we are trying to do by this amendment is to bring this operation closer to the provision in the act to terminate pregnancies under which the doctor has to report that he has performed the operation <e> <s> that is quite different from what the noble lord has said <e> <s> we know that illegal operations will not be reported but unless we get a report of what is happening we shall not be able to follow up the results of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may with leave come back again because i am very worried about what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> the figures that i have from the department and from the library show that there were operations for female circumcision in the year <e> <s> so i am not asking for anything new or special or difficult <e> <s> i am trying to <e>", "<cs> my lords someone says stamp collecting but i think that if we are to get any sense out of clause we must know what is happening <e> <s> that is all i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some grief that i have to declare that i cannot support this amendment <e> <s> if female circumcision is wrong today it will be wrong in months time <e> <s> if we were to pass this amendment we would be suggesting to some of the people most concerned that they could continue performing female circumcisions for the next months and that there would be nothing wrong with that <e> <s> this amendment would mean that many women would be subject without legal protection to risk <e> <s> it is not a good amendment <e> <s> i want to see this bill brought into law as soon as possible <e> <s> any postponement would be harmful and wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the noble baroness that if there is one thing i congratulate her on it is her stamina <e> <s> she has been a very lonely lady today <e> <s> i think the emptiness of the government benches and the paucity of government speakers indicate that the tory party do not care about social security and do not understand it <e> <s> they do not care much about these proposals <e> <s> it is a pity that nobody spoke up in favour of the governments proposals in the whole of this long debate <e> <s> the noble baroness lad lane-fox who is very loyal and very courageous had her criticisms to make and we know she often speaks up for people in need <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington tried to make some joke out of the absence of proposals from this side of the house <e>", "<cs> it was not a joke <e> <s> bad luck <e> <s> my lords in my generosity i thought it must have been a joke because if the noble baroness had looked at the order paper for today she would have seen that the business for today is a discussion on the governments green paper and i think we would have been very much out of order if any of my noble friends or i had dared to talk about the labour partys proposals for social security <e> <s> that is not on the agenda and we are very interested in keeping in order <e>", "<cs> i rise only briefly to point out some difficulties <e> <s> i understand from the explanatory and financial memorandum that clause amends schedule to the social security act so as to remove the age limit of under which an occupational pension scheme need not preserve a members accrued rights <e> <s> this is something that we welcome but it seems to us to mean that any early leaver with five years qualifying service will be entitled to preserved benefits while any young person with less than five years accrued benefits will not be entitled <e>", "<cs> i shall delay the committee only long enough to say that we support the amendments which have been spoken to by the noble lord lord banks <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> any amelioration is very welcome to this side but i wonder why we have had a statement today <e> <s> in my view it is because of the severely critical publicity which has arisen following the cruel impact on some of the most vulnerable young people in our community which has resulted from these new rules <e> <s> i know that i must not make a debate out of a statement and so i shall ask the noble baroness the minister one or two questions <e> <s> what happens to young people or older people while they are waiting for appeals to be heard <e> <s> i understand that there is a long waiting period of total impoverishment if a young person appeals against the withdrawal of benefit <e> <s> is no discretionary payment made to tide someone over such a difficult period <e>", "<cs> it is as my noble friend says though i do not think many of them can afford a bike nowadays <e> <s> i appreciate the sympathy of the noble baroness but the exemptions are not widely known and are not working out because many of the disabled and mentally handicapped who are in board and lodging accommodation do not seem to be receiving the help and sustenance that they need <e>", "<cs> my lords i must protest for a moment against what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> of course the money comes from our pockets and from some of us it comes willingly and gladly <e> <s> we would pay more if we could do something to remedy the evils we have been discussing <e> <s> i think it was very ungracious of the noble baroness to make that remark about my noble friend lord stallard because he pays his taxes as we all do <e> <s> i am sure we would all do so without regret if we could feel that they were being used for these kinds of purposes <e>", "<cs> very briefly if the government are saving million under clause in and million in where are they getting it from <e> <s> they are saving it only because they are taking it away from people who need it <e> <s> they are taking this money out of the resources which many of these people need <e>", "<cs> i was just having a word with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> this may not be the time to have a fundamental debate about the statutory sick pay scheme though i think that one is very badly needed <e> <s> we have very little evidence of how it is working out <e> <s> we have had assurances that matters are going quite smoothly but i do not know on what evidence that is based <e> <s> all that i know is that the explanatory and financial memorandum states that as a result of clause there will be <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down can she help me <e> <s> i quoted the figure of million from page vii of the bill <e> <s> i cannot be responsible for any mistake that has been made although i am not surprised to hear that there are a few more mistakes in the drafting of this legislation <e>", "<cs> we support the amendment <e> <s> in view of the housing benefits review which is being undertaken and we all agree that if anything needs a review it is the housing benefits muddle it is unfortunate to enshrine in statute and in this particular piece of legislation more confusion about housing benefit <e> <s> this is not a party issue <e> <s> i have put forward a view which is widely held among those in the local authorities who have to administer housing benefits and who are experiencing increasing difficulties <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl telling the committee that there is only one case of proposed or expected abuse and it is on the basis of that one single case that we have the clause in this bill or is there other evidence <e>", "<cs> we are very happy to associate ourselves with this amendment <e> <s> it is the first hit of good news we have had from the government today and we welcome it <e>", "<cs> i rise to ask a few questions about this strange clause <e> <s> the effect of clause would enable the horserace totalisator board and the horserace betting levy board to pay pensions to board members with the cost falling to the hoards concerned and not to the consolidated fund <e> <s> i find this a strange creature in the middle of this very strange bill <e> <s> i have to ask first why we have to have legislation so that the horserace totalisator board and the horserace betting levy board can make arrangements for pension schemes <e> <s> surely it is the governments policy that all employers should be making their own occupational pension schemes <e> <s> it is extraordinary to find in this complex bill that there has to be statutory consent for this <e> <s> why cannot the boards make their own arrangemens <e> <s> how much are members of these boards paid <e> <s> why do there have to be special pension arrangements for them <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his usual courtesy <e> <s> there was only one question which he did not answer that is whether pension arrangements would be made for all employees of these boards and not just the top board members <e>", "<cs> again i thank the minister and i assure him that this amendment was not moved in any party sense <e> <s> many of us were very disappointed when a previous government did not put into legislation what we have in mind <e> <s> in fact my noble friend lord stallard then in another place moved an amendment to this effect and tonight he is really repeating a speech he made on that earlier occasion <e> <s> at least he cannot be accused of inconsistency <e>", "<cs> my lords though i speak from the front bench i must make it clear to the house that i speak in a personal capacity <e> <s> i welcome this bill and i wish it well <e> <s> i hope that it will be implemented at the earliest possible moment <e> <s> i am particularly interested that this bill is passing through your lordships house at the end of the united nations decade for women <e> <s> i think that it will go out from this house that we have made one tangible contribution to the emancipation of women during this decade which has not produced all the results that we would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to say that we on these benches strongly support the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord banks who has spoken with great expertise and experience <e> <s> we hope very much that the government will give serious consideration to these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall say only that of course we welcome this information and we are very glad to accept the amendment that the noble baroness has moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have appeared to take a rather trappist part in the debates this afternoon <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that this is not from any lack of interest but because i think that silence may be golden especially when we are dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for the way in which she has introduced the changes <e> <s> on these benches the benches on either side are not full at the moment we totally oppose any abuse of the system but i must remind your lordships that we still do not think that the government are dealing with abuses in the best possible way <e> <s> in order to deal with some young people who have taken advantage of the previous situation the government have put many other vulnerable young people in great difficulties by the overall rules <e> <s> i have never been able to understand why those who abuse the situation could not have been caught under previous rules such as those which insist that people must genuinely be seeking work if they are to get benefit <e> <s> but perhaps tonight is not the time to go into that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> this may be a good-humoured exchange but i must spoil the atmosphere a little by asking one or two questions <e> <s> article states <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great sympathy for the noble baroness and for the rest of us in the way we are having to handle these complicated matters today <e> <s> i have said before that i do not think our business managers in either house or of either party have yet achieved the right way in which we ought to deal with these complicated social security affairs <e> <s> we have had the green paper debate we have had a social security bill and now we have all these orders today <e>", "<cs> my lords then i shall not refer to it at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> but my lords is it not a fact in the view of this government on law and order that the judgment of the high court should be obeyed pending an appeal <e> <s> may i ask the noble minister whether she has seen the ruling by mr justice mann as reported in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister on this point but i was not talking about tribunal findings my question was about a high court judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the sad absence of my noble friend lord ennals who is in hospital he has requested me to beg leave to ask the question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> the recommendations suggest that they should be acted upon promptly which causes me to ask what steps are taken when they are not acted upon <e> <s> is there not unfortunate and sad evidence that many of those recommendations have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will be relieved to know that in view of the fact that there is to be a debate next week i do not intend to reiterate the sincere belief held by my noble friends and myself that this problem is caused by lack of employment for young people and lack of housing at affordable costs and that it is these factors that are at the heart of the problem <e> <s> i shall confine myself to just a few questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for speaking again but there is one point about which i am still not clear <e> <s> it is one that affects very many people <e> <s> the judgment was made during the recess that the time limits should be quashed <e> <s> i understand that there is to be an appeal heard at the end of november <e> <s> the noble baroness stated that after th november new claimants will be subjected to time limits <e> <s> i understood that to be what the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> i cannot hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that after this very long and very interesting debate i feel rather like the road sweeper after the lord mayors show <e> <s> i know there has been some criticism about the fact that this motion was so widely drawn and i know that has contributed to the difficulties of the debate <e> <s> however i would explain that we do not have many labour days in the course of the business of the house and there was great anxiety among many of my noble friends because during the debate on the gracious speech there was no opportunity to discuss these important matters <e> <s> in fact the gracious speech itself was very dismissive and curt about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very surprised when these regulations were laid before us because i remember and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble baroness but this is very important <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell us what action if any the department have taken in these cases where the landlords rather than claimants are clearly abusing the revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness explain how claimants are to be treated fairly and justly when during the last six years there has been a loss of jobs from her department and an increase from million to million in claims for supplementary benefit <e> <s> secondly while the noble baroness talks about a review coming out next year can she tell the house what delay is taking place in the up-rating of benefits for this year <e> <s> thirdly has the noble baroness i must ask her this question because it is very important had time to read the review of her own departments chief adjudication officer in which he states that one in three of all supplementary benefit payments are wrong <e> <s> he blames this situation on lack of training on lack of staff and on the very great pressures that exist <e> <s> i believe that the house deserves to have some response to that report <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating that may i ask whether the bloomsbury office has to close at oclock every morning instead of at pm because by oclock it is overflowing with a workload that cannot be met until early evening <e> <s> surely this shows that that office needs some help <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house what reports have been received from other countries such as the united states new zealand and australia about the effectiveness of this information <e> <s> in particular will she try to raise with her right honourable friend the possibility of extending this deadline <e> <s> although we appreciate the noble baroness saying that the publicity campaign was equivalent to that in this country it might have taken a little longer to have got to some of the commonwealth countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness the minister for her most unwelcome statement which it has taken minutes to deliver <e> <s> i want to say that i am glad that the noble viscount the leader of the house is here and that i think i speak in a non-party way that this is an abuse of the procedure of the house <e> <s> when i first came here five years ago i was given to understand that when statements were made they were to be the subject of only brief comment and questions from the opposition on both benches and they were not to be second reading speeches which initiated a debate <e> <s> i fear that what we have had from the noble baroness and i know that it was not her fault is a second reading speech on the white paper <e>", "<cs> i do not think so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for repeating this statement which is an endeavour to explain why a third attempt has been necessary before the government could get themselves within the law <e> <s> this is a government who preach law and order to all their citizens and then do not do so well themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we all want to thank the noble baroness for what she herself described as a routine good housekeeping process <e> <s> she has certainly succeeded so far as i am concerned in making the opaque almost translucent though not quite <e> <s> she was so right to remind the house that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for telling the house about these increases in statutory sick pay <e>

lords as the governments white paper of december suggested that the government were trying to move towards a decade of retirement can the minister tell us what would be the age for the beginning and the age for the end of the decade or is that not leakable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are all very much indebted to the noble viscount lord thurso who has brought this very important matter before your lordships tonight <e> <s> i would only like to say that my noble friends totally agree that there should be a solution for all the problems that have been brought before us <e> <s> i must say that it is very interesting that it appears to be a crop of old women who are going to deal with this problem of the territorial army tonight <e> <s> but that is how it is <e>", "<cs> why not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how the government are working out the standards of coldness and severity <e> <s> what is happening in various areas of the country where there are different weather conditions <e> <s> how are people for example old ladies in a top back room able to get some conditional help <e> <s> i have been reading all the reports and i cannot understand how

ask the noble lord whether he knows what life is really like <e> <s> he says that people who have put money in the slot meter can find out something about this benefit and get some money back <e> <s> this is not what life is like <e> <s> i must tell the minister that some people who will be sitting tonight in a top back room will be absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his co-operation but i find it very difficult to follow what he has said in view of the number of complaints that i am receiving <e> <s> i am told that in the library we <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i am not totally ignorant about what is going on in the big wide world <e> <s> i find that there is a problem about the heating allowances <e> <s> i am not unaware of the work of local officers <e> <s> some of them are told that they have to put their heads out of the window to feel how cold it is <e> <s> i meet old ladies living in top flat rooms who never go out and who have no means of knowing how cold it is except that they feel cold <e> <s> i mean this in no partisan way but i do not honestly believe that either side of the house has worked out how to deal with the cold climate <e> <s> the only solution is that everyone should have sufficient social security to enable them to pay for their fuel <e> <s> we should not need to have this separatism of somebody paying for their gas and somebody paying for their electricity <e> <s> we should be giving an income to people so that they can attend to their own needs and to keeping warm <e>", "<cs> my lords i sincerely thank the noble baroness the minister for reading that long and complicated statement <e> <s> it is very difficult for the house to take on board the full significance of every single word and figure in the statement <e> <s> personally i shall try to absent myself from loquacity but there are certain points which are very important to millions of people in our country and i must ask the minister whether she can answer one or two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not accept that this arithmetical competition in compassion keeps nobody warm and is most offensive to many old people and to many members on both sides of this house <e> <s> can the minister try to take this question a little further <e> <s> why not for instance add heating allowances automatically for people on supplementary benefit in the winter <e> <s> why do we have to have this argument about how cold the cold weather is <e> <s> we all know that heating costs more in the winter than in the summer <e> <s> i should have thought there would have been a great saving in administration if there was an automatic increase in heating allowances in the winter rather than to have a flat sum all the year round <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for coming back again but i do not think that the noble baroness has explained to the house why the heating allowance is the same in a hot summer as it is in a cold winter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister had time to look at a publication by five charities which deal with these problems <e> <s> they have based their figures on official statistics which suggest that it costs a year to keep a couple with two children in this temporary accommodation whereas a council <e>", "<cs> no my lords you cannot answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness saying to the house that only the question of cost is inhibiting some solution to this problem <e> <s> if so can she explain why arrangements were made with other countries which made no contribution at all to help <e> <s> there is a great feeling among elderly united kingdom citizens who have gone to canada <e> <s> many of them widows and widowers have gone to live with their married sons or daughters have made a home there and they save the dhss a great deal of money by

government will support them <e> <s> secondly does the noble baroness the minister recall that just after the last raid on gabarone there was a mission from the commonwealth parliamentary association

say to the government that they will not be able quietly to hustle the bill here <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> my lords it must have been another bill that the noble baroness was talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords as a graduate of birkbeck and a governor at the present time may i ask the minister whether she and the government realise that though we are described as part-time students in fact we are reading for full-time internal degrees of the university of london <e> <s> the fact that we study at night rather than during the day is no reason why we should be devalued to of a full-time student <e> <s> do the government think that we obtain our books or our laboratory equipment at half price <e> <s> do they think that we pay our staff half-price or maintain the buildings at half-price <e> <s> it seems to me that as we are talking about public money the government ought to take more direct interest in this important question <e>", "<cs> we accept that these are largely textual amendments and subject to the reservation that we might want to come back to them again when we have read them twice we shall not take any action this afternoon <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her to make one point clear <e> <s> we were glad to hear her sympathetic words about transitional payments for people who are at present disabled but it is not clear to some of us what is to happen to the newly disabled <e> <s> will the people at present getting benefits who are to be protected by transitional benefits receive more than a person who suddenly becomes disabled after the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement is welcome on all sides of the house <e> <s> after the governments recent disaster in the division lobbies i am happy to be able to agree at least with something that is coming forward from the other side <e> <s> i want to ask one or two questions <e> <s> will there be back pay for married women who have been looking after their invalid relations for many years or when will be the starting date for the new rule <e> <s> will publicity be given to the change so that all married women in that position will know that they have a right to claim the benefit <e> <s> it is most important to know about the back-pay provisions or whether there is to be a new starting date <e> <s> married women who have been caring for sick and invalid relations for many years should not be excluded from payment for that sacrifice <e>", "<cs> and so did i my lords <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness the minister has said that the government think they have struck the right balance but i have to ask what is magic about the age of <e> <s> why not draw the line at the age of or <e> <s> i cannot understand the justification for picking on the age of <e>", "<cs> i rise only to express the warm thanks of my noble friends and myself for the statement which the noble baroness has made <e> <s> i shall not make a speech about school meals but i think the conversion on the road to damascus is welcome to us all <e> <s> i hope it is a harbinger of other conversions which the government benches might undergo before this bill reaches the statute book <e>", "<cs> in view of the time and of the understanding that the noble baroness has shown of the problem i would only mention that the government are treating students differently under the social security legislation as regards housing benefit <e> <s> there is a clear difference there and i hope that we shall not lose sight of that <e> <s> but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord gave himself and the government away a few seconds ago when he said that unfortunately there were some local authorities who did not do exactly and i wrote it down as we wished <e> <s> when has it been doctrine in this parliament that local authorities should do exactly as the government wish <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> i am an old reporter and i wrote it down and i hope that <e>", "<cs> there are one or two important questions <e> <s> if it is the governments intention that for the first six months there should be payments of mortgage interest from the social fund then at the end of the six months if a person obtains a job i presume that that help will cease <e> <s> after the six months if that person loses his job will he lose any help <e>", "<cs> may i ask why <e>", "<cs> earlier the noble minister was pleading the cause of families who were just above the social security level and saying how sorry she was for these poorly paid families <e> <s> now she does not seem to have the same sympathy towards a poorly paid family just above the supplementary benefit level whose daughter is found to be pregnant <e> <s> what will happen in families in that situation where often there is a great deal of discord <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that reply and i hope that i heard her rightly when she said that she could state that there would be no cash loss for blind people <e> <s> that will give them some reassurance <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that it is not for the noble baroness to talk about income tax but i think it is very important for that allowance to be maintained because it is expensive for blind people to get to work it is expensive for them to keep a guide dog and it is <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness quoted beveridge but i remind her that the beveridge report came out in the context of full employment <e> <s> the noble baroness says that these women are entitled to work <e>", "<cs> before i decide what to do about the amendment the noble baroness has not answered her own sentence on rd june reported in col of the <e>", "<cs> we shall have to come back to this point again because obviously there is some unfairness in the proposals but for this evening i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her what is the governments attitude to women who work part time <e> <s> i understand from the bill that a woman who works part time between eight and hours a week must be with the same employer for five years <e> <s> that will cause many difficulties for women who take occasional part-time work especially women in agricultural areas who work during the harvest and people who work in seaside resorts and so on <e> <s> i wonder what the government think will happen to those people and why they have put a five-year limit on the time that they must spend with the same employer <e> <s> that may cause difficulties for many women <e>", "<cs> i regret the fact that the noble baroness did not give us a more encouraging answer <e> <s> if any members of the committee think that we are sitting too late tonight may i point out that we were supposed to rise for the dinner hour from pm to pm because of the nature of the business that the government put into that dinner hour we did not resume on the social security bill until pm that happened last monday as well when the dinner hour was so extended that the time on the social security bill was curtailed <e> <s> that is because the government do not like the social security bill and want to minimise the time that we have on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble baroness on her audible reading of her brief <e> <s> as an old-age pensioner i look forward to collecting p a week extra very soon <e> <s> i must set that off against the fact that a cup of coffee in your lordships establishment costs p <e> <s> that means that i can have only an extra one and a bit cups of coffee for my p <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness leaves the subject of child benefit can she explain to those of us who have no actuarial knowledge or experience how it is worked out that there should be an increase of p a week <e> <s> what is the underlying mathematics of p <e> <s> could it not have been p or p <e>", "<cs> my lords forgive me <e> <s> can the noble baroness say on what evidence she says that these changes in attitude will take place <e> <s> how does she know this will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say how happy i am that the noble baroness and i have our joint names to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not sure which of us is queen elizabeth i and which of us is mary queen of scots or who is going to chop off whose head <e> <s> but for the moment this is a practical and acceptable amendment <e> <s> i appreciate that what we are asking the government to agree with tonight is not a defeat <e> <s> the propositions that have been put forward arise out of a consensus not only of people on all sides of this house but of people outside who do a great deal of work and who know the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i asked the noble baroness a question about what would be put in instead of clause <e>", "<cs> then my lords there is a vacuum in legislation which i shall enjoy <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment and i want to ask a specific question <e> <s> i referred to this matter on rd june when i asked the minister what would happen if someone was unemployed for six months got his mortgage interest paid got a job for a little while but then lost it <e> <s> would he have to go back to the beginning of the six months or would he be helped <e> <s> the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say on behalf of my noble friends that we appreciate the situation and look forward to the third reading when the minister will speak further <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has talked a great deal about the principle of cash benefits <e> <s> your lordships would be in a better position to make some assessment if we knew how much the cash was <e> <s> it has been pointed out that reference has been made to a mythical figure of which the noble baroness has described as an illustrative rate <e> <s> none of us would like to go to our bank manager and take out a loan or obtain a credit card on the basis of an illustrative rate <e> <s> it is an insult to your lordships to ask us to deal today with this important problem when we have no figures throughout our consideration of the bill we have had no figures on which we can make an assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness the leave of the house to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords in a way that is a disappointing reply <e> <s> the noble minister says that there will be no loss of cash benefit and then she confirms <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to support what the noble lord said <e> <s> in my many years in one place or another i have never known a bill which has depended so much on regulations <e> <s> the amendment brought forward by the noble lord expresses the anxiety of many of us in all parts of the house about this increasing tendency by the government to bring forward bills in which the legislation depends on regulations <e> <s> i shall not detain your lordships <e> <s> i shall say only that i strongly support what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain the house for very long <e> <s> i am very sorry that we have received these two regulations on social security points so late <e> <s> obviously the government have a very unfriendly idea about how we should proceed in these matters but because it is so late and because there are so many detailed matters to consider and to discusss i propose that we shall not enter into debate tonight <e> <s> i hope that on another occasion i can write to the noble baroness and then we can try to sort out some of these matters <e> <s> i am not asking the house to approve these regulations because i do not like some of them but i am proposing that we do not oppose them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall say only that my noble friends and i completely support this amendment which has been so ably moved by the noble lord lord banks <e>", "<cs> my lords my first comment must be that the fact that we have this statement today indicates the tremendous disarray in which the government find themselves in regard to social security <e> <s> we are now in the middle of the third <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down can she tell us how many such letters she has received <e> <s> was it only one letter and if so is it not rather an abuse of the argument to refer to one letter <e> <s> i could refer to many other letters <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the explanation from the noble baroness i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords how can i follow such a disarming statement from my enemy opposite <e> <s> i can agree with her on one or two points namely that i think that the whole house has worked very hard on <e>", "<cs> my lords one is enough <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather confused and slightly amused by the reason no <e> <s> which the commons have given <e> <s> they say that they disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> i hope that there will be members on more than one side of the house who agree with me that it would be useful if the logistics of the repetition of statements could be altered <e> <s> i do not think that the business of your lordships house is helped very much by the introduction of statements when we do not know at what time or what will happen <e> <s> i do not know the answer and i should not presume to suggest one <e> <s> however i know that many noble members on both sides of the house with whom i have discussed this problem feel that we are not dealing very efficiently with this aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord with whom i have had a happy relationship for many years <e> <s> i did not think it was out of order to ask why something was not in a statement as i know that many pensioners and many people who are looking after them are concerned about hypothermia and all the problems of severe weather <e> <s> when we have a statement which does not mention this matter i am entitled to ask why it is not mentioned especially when i find that there is an enormous piece of paper in the library telling me of the submission from the social security advisory committee and when i ring up the department i am told they have nothing to say about <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be too hot but i suggest that degrees fahrenheit is too cold for people and this is no way to deal with the problem <e> <s> nor can i find any help in the statement for people who have prepayment meters or who buy coal in advance <e> <s> the statement contains nothing about the problems of the old regarding the cold or hypothermia which caused so much anxiety last winter <e>", "<cs> it says so here my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness with her usual courtesy tell the house what has been the response of the government to the report of the social security advisory committee on the governments plans for helping with heating costs in severe weather conditions <e> <s> i cannot find out what response the government have made and as the winter is getting very near it is very important to this debate tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is being very helpful but is it a fact that these plans will not come into force before the social security advisory committee has made its recommendations <e> <s> what will happen if the committee disagrees with the governments plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i am especially glad that the noble baroness has told the house there will be an opportunity to debate these regulations <e> <s> i can assure her that i shall be as brief as i possibly can not only because i am very much opposed to statements turning themselves into debates but also because we have been promised a full debate <e> <s> also there is another very important subject before your lordships later this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for that answer <e> <s> can she reassure me about the statement made in another place that the minister would be writing to all the people concerned so long as their names are on the dhss computer but that those who were eligible but who registered through local offices would not have a direct communication <e> <s> is the minister satisfied with the amount of advertising and information that has been given <e> <s> can she not consider postponing the date of st december which is very near now <e> <s> surely it would not be within the spirit of the findings of the strasbourg court that people should be disqualified just because of an arbitrary date which the government have chosen to fix <e>", "<cs> but surely my lords that is a reason for postponing the date <e> <s> i am sure we all appreciate the enormousness of this task but is the noble baroness aware that no one in the house would want women to be disqualified just because there was some hold-up in the office working locally <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may commend these regulations to your lordships house <e> <s> however to myself and to many of my noble friends it seems typical of the mean spirit of this government that on the last day before we rise for the christmas recess at a time of giving of generosity and of goodwill they should seek to pass through this house regulations which will take million away from unemployed families <e> <s> what a christmas present that is for the government to give to these people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for that answer but i must press her further <e> <s> if no medical evidence was taken into consideration in fixing the minus degrees surely this is totally irresponsible <e> <s> is it not a fact that the meteorological office was asked to pick on a datum line that would ensure that the government only had to deal with the issue on average once every five years <e> <s> if that is not true then i invite the minister to say so <e> <s> i will try to keep within the rules of order and not abuse question time <e>", "<cs> my lords but conceding that no one has found a real answer to the problem <e> <s> i want to suggest that it is time we all got together and found some way of giving a winter bonus irrespective of temperatures and ages so that people do not have to suffer this uncertainty <e>", "<cs> my lords thirdly it is not unusual for front bench speakers to ask three <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that on the order paper the noble lord lord hesketh was to propose these draft orders tonight <e> <s> the fact that he is poorly at home and that we have the pleasure of having the noble baroness here to deal with these proposals shows that women are much stronger than men <e> <s> this is a difficult debate because all these measures were passed in the other place before the end of the year and we are now asked to rubber stamp them <e> <s> we shall not vote against them but we should like to deal with one or two aspects <e> <s> all the instruments for the up-rating of benefits within the existing system are quite unacceptable because they lack the fundamental changes for which we on this side of the house are working <e> <s> because the base is wrong the up-rating cannot be right but we have to try to deal with some of these questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> the fact that the government have had so soon to come forward with amendments to their original plan would seem to vindicate those of us inside this house and many outside that the governments original plan was some distance from perfection to put it mildly <e> <s> i shall briefly ask the minister one or two questions which are of great concern to many people <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the government agree with the figure of as the increase in the number of deaths from hypothermia and whether it includes hypothermia-related illnesses as the cause of death <e> <s> can he also tell the house whether the government are satisfied with the arrangements for a a week severe weather payment how many applications were received how many were granted and whether any payments have yet been made <e>", "<cs> my lords what about the grant <e> <s> there is no answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord unable to answer my simple question on what happened about the weekly allocation <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked how many applications had been received how many had been approved and whether anybody yet had any money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about this year <e>", "<cs> my lords we are greatly indebted to the noble baroness lady seear who has brought this important question before us <e> <s> it would be helpful to have some assessment of the scale of the matter <e> <s> i am sure that many noble lords have received a great deal of information about the non-take-up of benefits which is the subject of the debate <e> <s> i have been reading cmnd <e> <s> paper on the governments expenditure plans for <e> <s> in paragraph this official document says <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her sympathetic reply <e> <s> can she give some idea of the timescale of this review <e> <s> surely it is a fact that the sooner one puts a date on the expectation of the result of the review the sooner one is likely to get it <e> <s> can amendments be made by regulations or would there have to be a change in legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for explaining this short bill so clearly to us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may thank him for answering so many questions <e> <s> there is one further point on which perhaps he can advise me <e> <s> in regard to widows if the husband dies after april the death grant will not be available <e> <s> the widows grant does not begin until <e> <s> i asked in my speech whether this was not a rather unkind gap and i wonder whether widows are to be left in a situation in which they will not receive and they will not receive <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to write to me i shall of course accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second time within a few minutes that we have had to deal with amendments to unsatisfactory government regulations <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord and i appreciate that with his usual lucidity he has shown <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is one which i regard as very serious indeed <e> <s> it seems to call into question the whole status of the commissioners and above all the independent status of the chief adjudication officer <e> <s> it seems to set aside the appeal procedure which has been embodied in the social security legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for asking one last small question <e> <s> did the minister say that the regulations would be referred to the social security advisory committee <e> <s> as the regulations are taking effect immediately <e> <s> i do not see what value their advice will be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that we all welcome any improvements that can be made to help disabled people and we especially welcome the appointment of the noble lord lord holderness as the chairman <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether there will be other people who need to use artificial limbs on this special authority or will it be possible to have a committee of users so that people who need artificial limbs can have a direct channel of communication with the special health authority <e> <s> there have been some problems about communication <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support the amendment and do so for several reasons <e> <s> this is a very complicated and difficult question <e> <s> i must say to begin with that we are not asking for payment to be made to young mothers under the age of if they have over the capital allowance but that is very unlikely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be glad to know that i do not propose to go in detail through these regulations which i think are very confusing and unhelpful <e> <s> the whole problem which they bring to mind is that the social security act of last year was very dependent on regulations <e> <s> now we have regulations here which replace those laid by the negative instrument on th december <e> <s> it is just another example of how the government are trying to rule by regulation and not by law <e> <s> i understood though i did not believe it that the act was supposed to streamline and simplify the social security regulations <e> <s> instead the regulations have confused and brought delay and have introduced into this house and the other place government by regulations which are not amendable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that while we would all agree about the desirability of old people staying in their own homes some of them are liable to die of hypothermia as they sit in their cold homes <e> <s> as a considerable part of this report dealt with the question of help with heating can the minister tell the house whether the government are satisfied with the assistance they gave during the very severe weather at the beginning of this year and whether they are making any long-term plans to help with heating <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the concentration of most noble lords is on some other subject today <e> <s> i am referring not to the mercenary affairs going on in another place but to the important scottish rating bill which we have to discuss <e> <s> i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether in calculating the net income the government are relating the figures to the retail price index or to the pensioners index <e> <s> is it not a fact that the retail price index does not include housing <e> <s> since over half a million pensioners have lost housing benefit <e> <s> under the new regulations from next month over million pensioners will lose housing benefit in addition to being forced to pay per cent <e> <s> of rates out of supplementary benefit <e> <s> in view of these facts there is no room for complacency about these figures <e>", "<cs> my lords some of these regulations are largely technical others raise more important points of principle <e> <s> however i can assure your lordships that i shall absent myself from that temptation and deal only with one or two points on which i hope it may be possible to have an answer if not today then by correspondence later <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by protesting at the inconvenience that has been caused to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we would all wish to associate ourselves with the thanks of the house to the members of staff who had such difficult work to do in this terrible disaster <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the minister whether there are any claims still outstanding and also whether any money payments were in the shape of grants and not loans so that people will not be expected to repay any financial help that was given to them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not right that people who are disabled and elderly ought to be able to feel secure in their own homes <e> <s> the charge on housing benefit is surely quite appropriate <e> <s> does he agree that it is elderly and disabled people who are not living in sheltered accommodation who are the most vulnerable <e> <s> usually people living in purpose-built accommodation for the elderly and disabled have some kind of supervision which will make them feel safer <e> <s> can he not look at this again <e> <s> i understand that the regulations do not come before parliament until the autumn <e> <s> there is a strong feeling among voluntary bodies about this <e>", "<cs> my lords we are glad to welcome these regulations in principle <e> <s> some months ago we raised the question in your lordships house about more control being needed in small homes with four or fewer people <e> <s> it might seem a bit churlish having asked for these controls to be brought in to ask the noble lord a few questions but if we do not get the details right today we shall be laying up difficulties for the people who will have to implement what the minister agrees are very complicated rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for reading the statement but i do not thank him for anything he said in it <e> <s> i know that it is supposed to be within the rules of this house that statements should not be the occasion for debate <e> <s> i hope therefore that we may be given an occasion for fuller debate so that we do not take too long tonight on this statement <e> <s> but i must ask the noble lord a few questions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether in view of the fact that electricity prices are to rise to per cent <e> <s> social security benefits will be increased to take account of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all thank the minister for having taken us on this cross-country run around these regulations <e> <s> we have a heavy workload before us heavy in more senses than one <e> <s> these five orders with which we are loaded this afternoon weight grammes which in my english is nearly two pounds <e> <s> they are heavier in more ways than the avoirdupois aspect of them <e> <s> it is right for some of us to protest about the way these matters are being handled <e> <s> for example in the other place members are not being confronted with all five orders at once <e> <s> they are taking extra time so that the orders may be dealt with in more detail <e> <s> if the minister thinks i am trying to make a political point i must tell him that the impartial joint committee on statutory instruments said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves the point of the disabled i wish to say that we have had many representations from their organisations claiming that it is the new applicants that is anyone who becomes disabled after april who will be in a worse position than those who are presently disabled <e> <s> can the minister explain that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am confused <e> <s> i was asking about people who will become disabled after april <e> <s> i cannot see how the local offices can have any knowledge about how many people will become disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many families will be worse off and how many families will be better off as a result of these changes <e> <s> can be also say how much money the government are saving because any money that the government save is to the detriment of those who have hitherto been receiving it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that after next april there will be some families receiving family credit and housing benefit who will in fact lose p in benefit for every pound they earn <e> <s> surely that is something of a poverty trap <e> <s> is it not also the case that as people start paying national insurance at per cent <e> <s> when they earn as little as per week they are better off to stay at home collect in benefit get their national insurance dues credited and not have to pay fares to work <e> <s> surely that is a poverty trap <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for having chaired that interesting committee and to all members who served on it <e> <s> i should also like to pay tribute to the many witnesses who gave such thoughtful evidence and who obviously took a great deal of trouble with it <e> <s> i refer especially to some of the voluntary organisations which do not always have vast resources to help them prepare their submissions <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell us why <e> <s> at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has promised to write a great many letters <e> <s> how long will it take before we receive the answers <e> <s> the dhss <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no opposition on this side of the house to the regulations <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords we could spend our time going into a great deal of detail about this statutory instrument but the most important thing is for us to try to go back to some of the underlying philosophy <e> <s> we unfortunately passed the social security act last year <e> <s> a main part of that act was to provide that important matters should be dealt with by regulations and by statutory instruments and not by legislation <e> <s> we have tonight an example of matters brought before us by statutory instrument which ought to have been in the primary legislation <e> <s> if that had happened and it is what ought to have happened we should have had notes on clauses and more public information about these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that i appreciate all the helpful information he has given <e> <s> however i did ask one question and i apologise for having asked so many questions on clause of the statutory instrument which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i must crave your lordships indulgence if anything i have to say today is rather inadequate <e> <s> in spite of several requests i have not received the courtesy of being sent the notes on clauses on the bill which in previous times have been sent to the opposition spokesman <e> <s> i shall have to do my best without the notes on clauses from the department <e> <s> if that leads to any misunderstanding of what the department is trying to do i suggest that it is not my fault <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be simpler if the minister were to ask his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to put some more of his spare money into the social fund rather than expecting charities to subsidise the dhss <e>", "<cs> my lords as an aged aunt i am anxious to know the degree of consanguinity which will give me responsibility for the excesses of all my nieces and nephews <e> <s> how close is a close relative in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords instead of passing legislation to disadvantage such disabled people and then setting up a voluntary scheme to try to put things right would it not be simpler to amend the social security bill which goes into committee next week <e> <s> there might be helpfulness in all parts of the house if this could be put right on a statutory basis and not by setting up some separate <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment which has been so ably moved by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> i should like to remind the minister of one sentence in the conservative party manifesto a pledge which i and thousands of people in this country feel has been broken <e> <s> it was child benefit will continue to be paid as now and direct to the mother <e>

particularly all the mothers and fathers and children when they get to the right age will take account of this point <e>", "<cs> with respect to the timetable of the committee i rise only briefly to support my noble friends on this amendment <e> <s> we believe that it is very important and the bill as it stands shows a gross <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister why these points cannot be put into the bill <e> <s> we are suffering from government by regulation <e> <s> time after time we are asked to vote a blank cheque without having seen the regulations <e> <s> although we appreciate the courtesy of the minister in telling us something about the matter tonight this is not the way to govern a country <e> <s> the exceptions should be put into the bill <e> <s> i look forward to amendments from the government at a later stage <e> <s> such action would allay a great many anxieties in all parts of the committee <e>", "<cs> can i ask the noble earl why we have to hang around until nine oclock <e> <s> not all of us wish to have a gourmet meal <e>", "<cs> i rise only to support the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> this is a very important matter but because of the time and noble lords consideration of other matters i suggest that i and my noble friends return to it at another time <e>", "<cs> i had understood that there was an understanding that we might all go home now <e>", "<cs> my lords having gratefully received my old ladys from her majestys government perhaps i may ask what organisations are being chosen to distribute the million <e> <s> are any instructions or guidance being given to these organisations or are they totally to use their own discretion <e>", "<cs> we support the amendment moved in the name of our noble friend i hope i can say that lord banks <e> <s> we are all anxious to save the time of the committee so if i appear to be a little cursory it is not because of a lack of concern about this clause but because i believe it is very important after all the discussion that has taken place that we should move on and make a quick decision <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down as both sides of the committee agree that we do not want to encourage young people to lay about can he with his long experience which we all respect say why that section of the act is not adequate to deal with those who insist on being voluntarily unemployed <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e> <s> the concern of my noble friend is about the need for a right of appeal from adjudications on housing benefit <e> <s> we are all agreed that housing benefit has got into an uncontrollable muddle over the last few years and the provisions in the bill certainly do not help to clear matters up <e> <s> that is another reason why there should be some provision for appeal <e>", "<cs> whether these people are tiny or little they are real people <e> <s> i appreciate that the minister has undertaken to look further into the complicated question of housing benefit which involves local authorities <e> <s> some of us who have been on local authorities know what a conflicting factor that is <e> <s> in view of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we support the noble lord lord banks because there is widespread anxiety and it is not limited just to this side of the committee about how the social fund will work in practice and what effect it will have on the people who need to use it <e> <s> it seems to me very modest to ask for an annual report <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask one question <e> <s> i understand that last year single payments accounted for million <e> <s> i also understand that the social fund budget for contained loans of million and grants of million <e> <s> i make that sum to be million <e> <s> that seems to leave a shortfall of million in expenditure for people in need <e> <s> how are such people to find million <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can tell us how many social fund officers and inspectors have been appointed to date <e> <s> they seem to be having a lot of work to do <e>", "<cs> on this side of the committee we appreciate the hard work of the noble lord opposite <e> <s> after all we are three to his one and we understand how hard he has had to work <e> <s> we thank him for the sympathetic and conscientious understanding which he has given <e> <s> we only hope that he can transfer some of that sympathy to ministers in another place so that this bill might be improved in some ways at least before it gets onto the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to express my support and that of my noble friends for the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord has set out the case so clearly that i need not delay your lordships for more than one minute <e> <s> however i just wish to point out that several members of the government and supporters of all parties have agreed that it is preferable for people to be better off when they are at work than when they are at home on benefit <e> <s> this seems to be a most obvious case where that principle should be put into practice <e>", "<cs> unfortunately my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the minister that there are many people both inside and outside this house who will be watching the development of this matter with great anxiety <e> <s> i thank him for the explanations which he has given this afternoon <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the clarity and expertise of the speech of the noble lord lord banks has thankfully made my task brief <e> <s> there has been a great deal of discussion throughout the country on the freezing of child benefit <e> <s> i hope that the government will take some notice of the fact that more than organisations of many different political and social beliefs have joined in the campaign save child benefit <e> <s> this is not a party matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help the noble lord on this <e> <s> there is nothing in my amendment about an appeal to a tribunal because there is no appeal to a tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is all rather confusing and i would say to the noble lord opposite that out of modesty i was not asking for an appeal tribunal although i think there should be one <e> <s> having been turned down on that basis several times by the government i thought that this more modest and gentle way of giving people some help would perhaps be approved of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord read out his note <e>", "<cs> my lords i only hope that this short debate has got rid of some confusion in all parts of the house and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we strongly support the amendment <e> <s> the social fund is a new endeavour <e> <s> many people wonder how it will work and what will happen <e> <s> it is important to have included in the bill a <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important motion and i shall take a little time to say why i think that is so <e> <s> i was doing some homework the other night when i came across an interesting quotation from sir winston churchill when he was president of the board of trade in and this question was being discussed <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> through no fault of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i know i asked the minister a number of questions but before he sits down i should like to raise the subject of constructive dismissal <e> <s> i am informed that appeals against constructive dismissal charges take about two years <e> <s> this point is important to the people concerned <e> <s> if the noble lord is unable to answer me tonight i am sure that he will write to me though i should have preferred to have his reply on the record of the proceedings of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i pay a slight tribute to the noble lord opposite because i do think that we have received from him a great deal of sympathy and <e>", "<cs> my lords the orders and regulations now before us follow on the new changes in social security and i do not propose to go into them in detail or at length because we oppose many of the principles of these changes <e> <s> these regulations only underline the fact that they are based on principles which are unacceptable in fairness to many of our people <e>", "<cs> i only mentioned it because it seems to be on the order paper <e> <s> i thought i ought not to let it be thought that i had not read everything that was on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i was somewhat previous when i referred to this matter earlier <e> <s> however i confirm that this is the one point which we agree about and which we welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate that all the regulations should be taken together <e> <s> however the most important element in the motions concerns housing benefit <e> <s> i am glad to see that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord banks for bringing this matter before your lordships <e> <s> the question which he has asked covers an enormous area and i do not think that we can go into all the details tonight <e> <s> however perhaps i may raise one or two points <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much i appreciate the ministers courtesy about this case <e> <s> i should like to ask him a question on the principle <e> <s> if someone is turned down by the social fund for a preliminary grant and then goes to a voluntary organisation is the money that the voluntary organisation gives to the applicant for his gas cooker new tools or new clothes to go to a job deducted from benefit <e> <s> if the assistance is in the form of say ballet shoes or a screwdriver it is not deducted <e> <s> this does not just relate to the letter i wrote to the noble lord <e> <s> can the minister say whether it is a rule that the social fund can provide implements and artefacts but if it gives money then somehow that gets into the circle of benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that in view of the slowness that we all appreciate we have to suffer from the lawyers there will be back pay for people whose payments are delayed <e> <s> can he also tell the house a little more about the status of the trustees <e> <s> i know that he cannot name them yet but will there be an honorarium for them <e> <s> can the minister also say something further about the executive arm to which he referred <e> <s> will it be comprised of civil servants and how will they be recruited and paid <e> <s> i ask these questions because there is a genuine interest on all sides of the house in the success of this fund <e>", "<cs> i rise to express my support for the amendment on behalf of my noble friends <e> <s> it seems to me to be absolutely unacceptable that there should be this per cent <e> <s> figure across the board <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks has already mentioned that in camden according to official figures there should be an individual price of <e> <s> according to government figures the national average is <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government say that the per cent <e> <s> reduction should be in accordance with the national average because people cannot help where they live <e> <s> they probably live in a certain place because their job is there and because there is work in the area <e> <s> looking through all the figures which i have studied most carefully i find that the national average is <e> <s> i take the example of camden not for any reason other than that i happen to live there and i know the area well <e> <s> i pay rates in camden and my charge will be <e> <s> i should perhaps mention that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is also a camden ratepayer <e>", "<cs> when the minister talks about high spending in boroughs such as camden does he not recognise the enormous expenditure of that and neighbouring boroughs caused by homelessness <e> <s> with three railway stations we attract a number of people and there are enormous responsibilities which have to be paid for <e> <s> it is not a question of high spending for nonsense it is high spending in trying to meet the terrifying needs facing some of the central city authorities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord when we reach schedule why the provisions for rebate cannot be put into the bill itself <e> <s> i feel that we are getting too much legislation in this house where the powers are delegated to regulations and statutory instruments and all sorts of things <e> <s> we do not get enough of the important provisions in the bill itself <e> <s> i assure the minister that i have read schedule <e> <s> i read too much <e> <s> i should like to know whether when this rebate comes in it will be temporary <e> <s> what will happen if these provisions are not incorporated in the bill itself <e>", "<cs> we support this amendment <e> <s> we have never understood why the arbitrary age of was picked on to make such a different social security provision <e> <s> i have often asked this question and i can recall being afraid that i was boring the chamber with it during the social security legislation which introduced this proposal <e> <s> we never received a satisfactory reply <e>", "<cs> you were lucky <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is he saying that he is abandoning the advice of a friend of his who said that they should get on their bikes and look for work <e> <s> that is the main reason for people leaving home <e> <s> when the noble lord said that people under may have been worse off under a previous government surely it was a conservative government that brought in the years-of-age rule <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that per cent <e> <s> of all households that is per cent <e> <s> of all retired people are excluded from the general index because they rely for at least three-quarters of their income on national insurance and social security <e> <s> does he recall that these pensioners have a separate price index which does not include housing at a time when housing costs for many people are increasing rapidly <e> <s> therefore is it fair that any increase in their pensions should be linked to the retail price index which is connected to the expenditure of people who are still earning <e> <s> surely it is not fair to base it on that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether his ministry or the government are giving any advice on the structure and content of training for social workers in this field <e> <s> does he not agree that it is inter-agency training that is needed so that not only social workers but health visitors and community nurses even the magistrates who make the place of safety orders are better informed about these difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former chairman of the sewage working party may i ask the noble earl whether he realises that if we put longer and longer pipes out into the channel the french will bring longer and longer pipes towards this country <e> <s> when i was on that working party we were told by the french the more rubbish you send to us the more we will send to you <e> <s> therefore the only answer surely is to deal with this problem at source <e> <s> the effluent must not be allowed to go into the sea to begin with but must be dealt with at source <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether he is taking any steps to inform the exhausted carers of disabled and chronically ill people of the complications to which he has referred <e> <s> is it not a fact that many of them find it very difficult to understand their rights in these matters <e> <s> can he also tell us whether it is the case that children who go into respite care do not receive benefit unless they go into a local authority hostel and that they lose that benefit if they go into a voluntary organisation for care <e> <s> surely if that is the case it does not seem reasonable or fair <e>", "<cs> my lords in courtesy i must thank the minister for making that statement even if i do not thank him for its contents <e> <s> before i comment in detail on the statement i should like to say that i wish that we could do away with the procedural annual pantomime whereby ministers spend months <e>", "<cs> then i have another half to go my lords <e> <s> what we regret mostly is the attitude to those who may be just above what the government decide is the poverty line <e> <s> we do not applaud this statement in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are most grateful to the noble countess lady mar for bringing this important matter before the house <e> <s> the noble countess is not the only one who is concerned about the change in the situation <e> <s> radar and other respected organisations which specialise in help for the disabled are also concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he answer my question <e> <s> if it was an unfair question perhaps he will write to me <e> <s> what proportion of the social fund so far has been made available for community care grants <e> <s> when the bill was going through the house we were told that this was to be a major objective of the social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with the citizens advice bureaux that part of the reason for the low take-up is what they call client confusion <e> <s> might not client confusion have something to do with the very difficult application form fc which has to be filled in <e> <s> the form is in parts in rather small print <e> <s> i reached question no <e> <s> and then had to give up <e> <s> will the minister put some fc forms in the library to see how many noble lords are able to get beyond question no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords as it seems that the government are saving million through their treatment of child benefit but have allocated only just over million to uprate the new benefits and as only about one-third of the families entitled to family credit are receiving it due to the governments poor marksmanship and targeting can the minister tell the house what is happening to the cash balance which the government are saving by these new arrangements <e> <s> surely that money belongs to the children of this country <e> <s> what is he doing with it <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord received the observations on this subject of the social security advisory committee and are the government taking any notice of them <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first heard that these motions were to be taken today i thought that it was a very bad day to discuss them <e> <s> i had a vision of noble lords departing from the house as early as possible for christmas merriment and i thought that it would be rather hard to have to concentrate on complicated problems <e> <s> of course this is a bad day for many terrible reasons and it is difficult to have to pursue an argument at this time <e> <s> i must congratulate the noble lord on his powers of concentration which he focused on the detail of these orders <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way as he particularly referred to me <e> <s> if lord montgomery had been means tested he might not have hurried to the post office so quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate that the government are showing some concern about the problem <e> <s> however can the minister say what is happening to those young people while those talks are taking place <e> <s> what instructions is he giving to social security offices about the level of help they can give to to year-olds while they arc unemployed <e> <s> what is the advice on the average amount and would he like to live on it <e>", "<cs> my lords why not <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that answer how can the noble lord presume to fulfil the election manifesto of the conservative party which stated quite clearly we will continue to maintain the value of the state retirement pension <e> <s> how can the government say that they are doing that when they are proposing the per cent <e> <s> increase in april and when even the chancellor of the exchequer has warned that the increase in inflation is likely to be per cent <e> <s> and more <e> <s> why at this point in time are the poorest people suffering a fall in their standard of living which is contrary to the conservative manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us when old-age pensioners many of whom may well be dead before too long will catch up on the per cent <e> <s> increase that the chancellor has predicted <e> <s> will they have to wait another six months for example before there is another uprating that will help them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be glad to know that i do not propose to go into all these statutory instruments individually <e> <s> however i have one or two questions that i should like to ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lady turner for initiating this debate <e> <s> in the minimal time at my disposal i should like to raise one or two topics <e>", "<cs> everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he explain to the house why he says that everyone will be a week better off <e> <s> from the figures which i did him the courtesy of putting to him many people will be only p better off <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to my noble friend lord stallard <e> <s> he has worked for many years to try to put right this obvious injustice <e> <s> i feel a little sorry for the minister because he looks as lonely as a hermit <e> <s> not a single back bencher is present to support him <e> <s> he does not have a whips shoulder to weep on and only just now has the noble lord lord strathclyde rushed into the chamber <e> <s> no doubt he has done so to tell his noble friend that he should not say that the government cannot afford the money having himself told us in the preceding debate that there is loads of money and that the government are doing marvellously that is except as regards british pensioners living in canada <e> <s> the indications are that none of his back benchers cares or that they are all to embarrassed to come here tonight to support a case which they know to be totally unjust and unfair <e> <s> i know that privately many of them believe that to treat one country so differently is totally unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can answer two quick questions <e> <s> he told us that to unfreeze pensions would cost million <e> <s> however how much does it cost <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to give the noble lord some advice <e> <s> i have in my hand a letter from his predecessor the noble lord lord glenarthur dated th july which states <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords surely those transitional payments were given because the people concerned were in need and had to have transitional payments <e> <s> how can the government now say that they do not need them any longer at a time when inflation is going up <e> <s> surely after all we heard in the house yesterday about the plenitude of the economic strength and resources of the government there is no reason why anyone should be worse off under the social security bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the minister who has tried to make clearer the unclarifiable regulations that are before the house this evening <e> <s> i wish to ask him why these <e>", "<cs> my lords in his speech of th may of which i have a full copy thanks to the courtesy of the minister the secretary of state expressed the view that even the poorest one-fifth of families with children spend nearly one-tenth of their income on alcohol and tobacco <e> <s> is that the governments view <e> <s> can the noble lord say what statistical definition lies behind the phrase the poorest fifth <e> <s> who are the people who comprise the poorest fifth <e> <s> did the secretary of state collect budgets from everybody <e> <s> how did he define the poorest fifth <e> <s> in all courtesy i submit that it is very unfair to many low income families to bandy about such statistics <e> <s> i know that many of them feel very hurt and deeply offended <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to thank the noble lord for setting out so clearly some of the implications of the bill <e> <s> i agree as do many of my noble friends that in the field of social security there should be continuing review and <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be bad for his fingers <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the words to which the noble earl referred were used in the context of an announcement made in another place by the minister that the government propose to privatise certain aspects of social security work <e> <s> why should the government think that there will be a better or more efficient service when it is handed away from his departments professional staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what arrangements are being made for this money from the social security budget to go to the local authorities which will be looking for the money from the community charge in order to carry out their services <e>", "<cs> i am sure that noble lords in all parts of the committee have listed carefully to the noble baroness and appreciate that she speaks with wisdom experience understanding and sincerity <e> <s> i should like to thank her for passing on a message if i may put it that way from the noble lord who failed to give her lunch <e>", "<cs> i was rather amused that the noble lord seemed to think that we were unintentionally going to cost the treasury a good deal of money <e> <s> this follows the news that the treasury supplement to the national insurance fund is to be abolished <e> <s> i found that somewhat inconsistent <e> <s> i am sure that we shall hear more about that later <e>", "<cs> we are discussing mobility allowance <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that slight touch of encouragement <e> <s> in view of what he said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i assure the minister that we shall return to the point at a later stage <e>", "<cs> from these benches we should like to associate ourselves with the amendments which are now before the committee <e> <s> when estimating the costs and benefits there are not just the savings which can be effected by keeping people at home but the unquantifiable gain in comfort and serenity at a difficult time <e> <s> hospitals can be horrible places for people when they are very ill <e>", "<cs> i wish to be clear <e> <s> the minister said that those people will be given advice and information <e> <s> will they be given benefit during all that procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords that leaves per cent <e> <s> of pensioners who do not receive additional payments <e> <s> as the conservative manifesto promised to maintain the value of the state retirement pension are the government not failing in that promise when the up-rating in april this year was only per cent <e> <s> whereas inflation increased by over per cent <e>", "<cs> why not say a fifth <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to express my support for the noble baroness <e> <s> all of us must know of cases where a son a daughter or a wife has given up work in order to care for someone who is very ill <e> <s> the situation may last for many years <e> <s> when death arises it cannot be an immediate release for the carer <e> <s> a person may have to sell the home and perhaps move <e> <s> moreover the person will have to try to pick up the threads of life and look into the prospects for a new job as well as dealing with many other personal and emotional problems <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> however we must all realise that the amendment deals with symptoms <e> <s> it deals with the symptoms of the governments total failure to provide adequate housing for the people of this country <e> <s> i regret very much that the bed and breakfast system has somehow been slotted into housing policy in a way that is expensive extravagant and deleterious to health <e> <s> many reports have been received from health visitors and others about the terrible effects of such accommodation on young children <e> <s> we hear from school teachers of non-attendance at school and of the difficulties when children moving from one hotel to another and therefore to a different education authority have the sequence of their education broken <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the groupings list i have states that amendment no <e> <s> a is grouped with this amendment <e> <s> i can only apologise if

about the many disadvantaged people in our society but i think that this is the first time that we have referred especially to people who are disabled and particularly those who are mentally disabled

out i hope that the minister will repeat his last performance and graciously accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the need for voluntary organisations to do all the marvellous work which they do is the result of the total failure of the governments housing policy <e> <s> why do the government not pay some attention to the need to eradicate homelessness

that people seeking asylum should not suffer deprivation <e> <s> it does not cost them per cent <e> <s> of what it costs other people for rent and living expenses <e> <s> while we welcome the

make arithmetic of this serious human problem <e> <s> if one handicapped person needed this help he should have it <e> <s> if there are or why should they be denied it simply because there are too many of them <e> <s> surely it is very important to look at the individual needs of these people rather than keep putting them through a computer somewhere as if all that mattered was figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> i am sure that many members of your lordships house are looking forward to this meeting which has been promised since july <e> <s> however does he recall that in the same debate it was also promised that the situation regarding homeless young people would be monitored by the department continuously <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister realise that there is a great deal of public opinion and concern on all sides of this house and in the other place regarding the unfairness of a situation where widows of men who were killed in the first two world wars are receiving approximately half of that which is paid to war widows whose husbands have died since <e> <s> if the occupational element cannot be made retrospective why not increase the social security element in the payment so as to bring these payments closer together <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the continuing failure of every government to put right this injustice could parliament which i hope is still the supreme authority in this country have an opportunity for a free vote on the matter <e> <s> i believe that that would recognise public concern about this gross injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the changes that have been announced today in which i am sure the noble earl has played his part as he promised the house on previous occasions i should like to ask two questions <e> <s> the noble earl has told the house that the change will cost million in the first year <e> <s> can he tell the house how much successive governments have saved by denying parity of pensions to pre- widows for a number of years a parity which the government seem to accept only partially at present <e> <s> should the cost not be set against the savings that have been made by the earlier denial of rights to pre- widows <e>", "<cs> i feel like a stranger in this masculine chamber when we are talking of women and their problems <e> <s> there seems to be a minimal number of women who can put something of their ideas into this bill <e>", "<cs> if i may have permission to speak again i should just like to say to my noble friend that he is talking absolute rubbish <e> <s> i am the only woman speaking here and i can tell him that none of us tells our doctors when we are or weeks <e> <s> there is no way in which the many doctors whom i have loved and worked with will accept that a woman can be absolutely honest about when as they used to say she last saw <e> <s> i think it is stupid for us to be wasting time tonight on or weeks <e> <s> a woman who wants termination of a pregnancy will get it and the sooner parliament recognises that the better <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl saying that i am to have a baby when your lordships tell me to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount explain how young people who were below the age of when they left this country could have been on an electoral register <e> <s> secondly has he an estimate of how many young people are involved <e> <s> for how many years can they go on voting <e> <s> can they continue voting in this country for the rest of their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords how many are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not unfortunate that we are talking today about the treasures of northern cyprus and by implication the whole of cyprus <e> <s> surely this marvellously rich heritage is the result of a variety of civilisations <e> <s> does the minister recall that these treasures come from the greeks the phoenecians the venetians the ottomans and the byzantines <e> <s> some came from this country <e> <s> they were a heritage from richard coeur de lion who had a honeymoon there on his way home from the crusades <e> <s> therefore the important point is not where these treasures are situated geographically today but that there should be recognition that this heritage belongs to the whole of europe in fact to the whole of civilisation <e> <s> why cannot we encourage international scholars to work on this heritage perhaps through <e>"]
