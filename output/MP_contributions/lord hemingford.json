["<cs> my lords when my father first spoke in this house about years ago he mentioned his diffidence at doing so and now i know exactly how he felt <e> <s> he said that it was compounded by the fact that he had been able to be present in the house on only two or three occasions previous to that because he was resident abroad <e> <s> i find myself in similar straits with less excuse because although i work in london i have been able to make only two brief appearances here and i should not have troubled the house so soon were it not for the fact that this bill contains a clause which gives me some concern <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of this amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> i speak as a member of the guild of british <e>", "<cs> i find that i did not underestimate the government altogether in that i believe that in the noble lords word to a great extent and largely they have put into the bill what i am intending by this amendment <e> <s> however i do not believe that when it comes to writing statutes it is enough to reflect to a great extent or largely what one is trying to say <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that i do not feel satisfied with what the noble lord the minister has said and i wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to mention one small part of the bill and i will do it quickly because the noble lord lord ardwick has already cantered entertainingly over the course <e> <s> i am concerned with the clauses which deal with material acquired or created for the purposes of journalism <e> <s> i should say that i speak as editorial director of westminster press and as a member of the british executive of the international press institute <e>", "<cs> in supporting these amendments i should like if i may to elaborate a little on the strength of the feeling within the ranks of journalism because although the government have been making signals now for many weeks indeed since the committee stage in another place indicating that they have only to be convinced that there is a consensus within the press they have so far not apparently been convinced and therefore i feel constrained to go into the matter in rather more detail than we did on second reading <e> <s> if i do go into a little more detail i hope that your lordships will take it on the chin <e> <s> i would rather that the noble lord the minister had accepted the general assurances that were given on second reading most notably by the noble lord lord ardwick but as he has not done so i feel that i must attempt some more detail <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i am still a member loyal but critical <e>", "<cs> may i congratulate the noble lord on the ingenuity of that argument <e> <s> however i <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> on the contrary i was going on to say that i would much rather be in that situation than arguing about material acquired or created for the purposes of journalism <e> <s> it has nothing to do with being in a special position <e> <s> we want to be treated just like anyone else <e> <s> that is the essence of the thing <e> <s> obviously i would rather not be caught at all but i would rather he there on that basis than arguing about material acquired or created for the purposes of journalism <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to push these amendments <e> <s> i think they have achieved a small part of their objective in providing the opportunity for the noble lords lord campbell of alloway and lord ardwick to say what they have said <e> <s> i have to say that what the noble lord the minister has said is extremely disappointing <e> <s> i think it is extraordinary if the home office read what was said at the committee stage and did not simply add up the number of people in the chamber who spoke which was itself impressive and still came to the conclusion that there was no consensus within the press against these amendments and i can only say it is a very strange conclusion for them to have reached <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has a different definition of journalism from mine <e> <s> i think therein lies one of the great difficulties with which we are faced because it seems to me that a book on current affairs would be very unlikely to be <e>", "<cs> took the oath <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the governments amendments in regard to allowing newspaper editors in effect to do their job <e> <s> i ought here to declare an interest as i am an editorial director of the westminster press and a member of the association of british editors and the guild of british newspaper editors <e>", "<cs> my lords i too think that this bill has considerable merit <e> <s> i am sorry that it appears destined not to go any further here than did a similar measure in another place <e> <s> the issues that it raises could have generated more discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confine myself to giving some specific responses to <e>", "<cs> no my lords but information about events in iran might come from a third government <e> <s> this would presumably be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i belong among those who believe that the balance which the noble earl mentioned when he opened the debate has not been correctly struck in the bill <e> <s> it is not a question of saying that there should be no secrets now <e> <s> however one should beware as the noble lord lord mishcon said of falling into the error of believing that whatever government do they do for the best <e> <s> i follow also the noble lord lord bethell in his discourse on the possibility that the security services might at some time in the future go over the top <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because i feel that in the debate in <e>", "<cs> at issue here is whether a distinction is to be made in the approach adopted for a member of the security intelligence services and that adopted for someone who has been a crown servant or government contractor <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that we are not only talking about contractors but also crown servants <e>", "<cs> if noble lords do not like the amendment perhaps they can suggest a better remedy for the problem that the noble lord lord mishcon has raised <e>", "<cs> we seem to have been conducting a debate on these amendments on the footing that the only way that the government can get their civil servants to behave is to use the criminal law against them <e> <s> it seems that it would be perfectly legitimate in this case to do what has been suggested which is to raise the threshold a little on this subject <e>", "<cs> we have heard two very distinguished lawyers addressing this amendment and i am sure that we all share their sympathy for a judge who is trying to interpret it or a jury who is trying to interpret what the judge has said <e> <s> perhaps <e>", "<cs> the need for this amendment stems from the extraordinarily wide scope of the bill in the area of defence and international relations which we have already discussed at some length and the general definition of what disclosures are damaging <e> <s> they are located in clauses and which state that an unauthorised disclosure is damaging if <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow my noble friend in what he says <e> <s> i hope that we shall consider these amendments separately <e> <s> we are talking here as i see it about whether a small number of people should be denied the opportunity to argue in front of a jury that what they have done is on balance right in the public interest <e> <s> those of us who support these amendments say that they should not be so denied <e> <s> it has been said that disclosures which might <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add that it is extremely difficult if for example one is a diplomatic or defence correspondent <e> <s> i know that there is a defence which states that if one is not aware that one is endangering the security of a british citizen that is a defence <e> <s> but the house should be aware of the extraordinary difficulty of dealing with that kind of language when one is trying to report those matters <e> <s> if one takes the case of british citizens held in the middle east for example it is almost impossible to know what may endanger them <e> <s> if one took the widest possible construction of the clause it would make almost any form of writing on the subject impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords as a journalist and an editor it is my view that there is some danger in the present hue and cry over press standards that we shall get the matter out of proper prospective <e> <s> i say that while being grateful for the measured approach which many noble lords have adopted in what they have said <e> <s> however there is a tendency when a ball starts to roll to be tempted to go too far <e> <s> i hope that we shall not go so far as the empress dowager of china who years ago said <e>"]
