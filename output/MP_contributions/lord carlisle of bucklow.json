["<cs> my lords in asking your lordships to extend to me the indulgence which is traditional to someone addressing the house on the first occasion let me like the noble lord lord callaghan of cardiff start with an apology <e> <s> as some of your lordships may know i am at the moment chairing a committee set up by the home secretary to review the parole system <e> <s> in that capacity i arrived back at heathrow during the course of this morning from america having flown overnight from washington <e> <s> therefore i fear that i rise to address your lordships without having had the advantage of hearing any of the speeches of yesterday although i have had the opportunity and the time since i have been back to read both the speech of my noble friend the minister and that of the noble baroness lady david <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to denigrate anything that has been said by the noble baronesses lady masham and lady faithfull but i hope that the government will not accept this series of amendments <e> <s> i say that because with this clause we are looking at what should be in the national curriculum in the core and foundation subjects <e> <s> it is easy to add continuously to that list subjects such as home economics <e> <s> i accept the importance of home economics as the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> said <e> <s> however our curriculum has been criticised often both for being too narrow in that it encourages pupils to give up subjects too soon and too wide in that we fail to concentrate on what are the necessary basic subjects at school <e>", "<cs> my lords not having been able to be present in committee on the bill i wish to say that i still remain profoundly concerned about the proposals for and the timing of the abolition of ilea <e> <s> i fully accept what the noble baroness lady cox has said <e> <s> it is easy to make a great attack on ilea <e> <s> it is undoubtedly true that ilea is far more expensive than many or perhaps all other education authorities <e> <s> i am sure it has rightly at times been accused of being a profligate authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale was right to remind us that the problems of the state of our prisons and prison overcrowding are not new <e> <s> indeed i vividly remember that the first submission i received as a junior minister in the home office in when the noble lord was permanent secretary was one which had projections of future prison populations which were far more horrific than those which have actually occurred <e> <s> i believe that the criminal justice act which introduced community service added a very useful weapon to the powers available to the courts to deal with people in ways other than imprisonment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the committee which i had the honour to chair found that many of the criticisms which led to the setting up of the committee by the home secretary were fully justified <e> <s> it was our unanimous view that if confidence particularly judicial confidence is to be restored in the parole system those proposals should be implemented at the earliest possible moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter will forgive me if i do not follow him in his argument about the abolition of capital punishment <e> <s> however i should like to follow much of what he said about the gap that has arisen between the sentences passed by the courts and the actual sentences served <e> <s> indeed i have a great deal of sympathy with his argument that that gap has now become too great and that steps should be taken to restore some meaning to the whole of the sentences passed by the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords to a certain extent the noble lord is right <e> <s> the interesting fact is that when transportation ended and people were dealt with under penal servitude in this country the same concerns began to be expressed as regards prisoners being released at a substantially earlier period than the sentence passed by the court in exactly the same way as the noble lord indicated in his speech <e> <s> the whole matter was looked at by a select committee of the other place in i believe the s or the s <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second time within a short period that i have had the good fortune to follow the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale in a debate in this house <e> <s> the other occasion as the noble lord said was on th november last year when he initiated a debate on alternatives to imprisonment <e> <s> as that debate took place within five days of the publication of our parole review i had the opportunity on that occasion to address your lordships and to set out in general terms the conclusions that we reached <e>", "<cs> i confess that i was worried about the clause when i first saw it and i should like to ask my noble and learned friend one question <e> <s> is it his intention that any rules which may be prescribed that require leave of appeal to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may apologise to my noble friend for the fact that i was not in the chamber when he started to repeat this statement <e> <s> having had an opportunity to look very quickly at the white paper i understand that he has accepted the vast majority of the recommendations of the committee which i had the honour to chair <e> <s> i should like to thank him very much for that <e> <s> in fact i believe that what the committee proposed with regard to parole is a far more coherent pattern for sentencing than exists at the moment
