["<cs> my lords this is the first occasion on which i have had the privilege of addressing this house <e> <s> i should like to make some observations on the broad issues and then to speak on only a narrow sector of the subject <e> <s> much of our industry in this country is lean taut and competitive and it has been brought to that position in part by the present recession <e> <s> a comparatively small increase in volume now which must surely take place will have a dramatic effect on unit costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a very simple point to put before this house and i promise not to keep you very long <e> <s> you may find it so naive as to ridicule me but i speak with conviction <e> <s> the point is merely this i do not believe whatever other policies are necessary that the economy of this country will be put on a firm footing until our industrial performance at least matches those of our competitors in europe <e> <s> i do not know how many of your lordships have had the advantage of reading a recent nedo report completed in september taken at the council meeting in october and then issued to the press <e> <s> it was a balanced objective report free so far as i can see from political bias <e> <s> it sought to establish how we stood with our competitors in europe and what policies they adopted to make themselves more successful than we are <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord airlie on his maiden speech <e> <s> i do not often disagree with him either in the city or in other spheres and i have some reservations about what he has said to this house today but the clarity lucidity and indeed the gentleness with which he has expressed his views commend them to everybody in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that this report by the sub-committee will commend itself to your lordships house <e> <s> under the treaty of rome the commission and their responsibilities are in no way challenged in the report have the responsibility of stamping out unfair competition and improper trade practices <e> <s> the sub-committee directed its attention to the procedures and came to the conclusion it seems to me that in four respects they were open to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that information <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether it might be helpful to have discussions with the recognised bodies because i am sure that if they were to take place some reasonable agreement could be reached on this difficult problem <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a dull technical subject <e> <s> it is nevertheless of great importance to the industrial and commercial community and to anyone who is connected with the investment of funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel like ruth gleaning in the cornfields after seven noble combine harvesters have been over the ground <e> <s> ever since the beginning of time the economies of the world have moved in cycles periods of expansion and growth have been followed by periods of recession and stagnation <e> <s> when the recession comes we all see with that brilliant gift of hindsight how over-trading should not have taken place and we look for remedies for present discomforts <e> <s> that is just the situation we are in now but it has been exaggerated by the fact that it is not just one or <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the erratic movements have arisen from the bad economic and financial policies which have been followed by a great many governments all over the world and from a failure to understand the deep international problems that face us <e>", "<cs> my lords in this country we have a genius for setting in hand commissions reports investigations and inquiries to find out why things went wrong <e> <s> the inquiries are usually conducted with great care and integrity and when the findings are published we flay ourselves all over again either by trying to find some grounds for criticising the report or by using the report to criticise others without much elevation of the discussion <e> <s> i do not want to go down that road at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord barnett for his contribution to this debate <e> <s> the report before the house proposes that we should join the european <e>", "<cs> under the procedures of the committee i ask leave to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is all part of the same subject and on that <e>", "<cs> i have listened intently but i am not quite clear about what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth wants me to do <e> <s> does he wish me not to divide the committee on the amendment <e> <s> sadly i cannot do that <e> <s> i listened with immense care and attention to what the noble lord lord lucas said and i made it clear to him outside the confines of this house that i did not want to press the matter to a division if it were possible not to do so <e> <s> but there was not the ring of conviction in what he said to the committee which would allow me to feel that he was going to comply with the clear expression of opinion as i hear it from the members of the committee <e> <s> under those conditions i feel that the committee must divide <e>", "<cs> that would be entirely acceptable to me and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment standing in my name <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i too may express my thanks to the government <e> <s> they have already been thanked this evening for having withdrawn what i call the original clauses and <e> <s> those clauses were not very satisfactory <e> <s> we are particularly glad that the government have not sought to tinker with them but have removed them altogether <e> <s> it is a matter of great satisfaction to the critics on the last occasion <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether there has been some confusion <e> <s> i am referring to clause <e>", "<cs> i am puzzled by that remark because it does not seem to me to fit with the proposal that there are to be guidelines <e> <s> are there or are there not to be guidelines indicating what definitions or criteria are to be applied <e> <s> if it is really to be said that we need not say what fit or unfit means what is the purpose of talking about guidelines <e> <s> i am really very puzzled about the comment that has just been made <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is any need to pursue amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mottistone has explained the original intention of this amendment was to try to relieve insolvent companies of the expense of pursuing miscreants <e> <s> it was felt that that burden should fall upon the state and should not rest on the creditors money to incur that expense <e> <s> but as i read the bill in its present form all the applications must be made by the secretary of state himself and therefore the cost must fall on the secretary of state <e> <s> i think that that is the interpretation <e> <s> if the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth will confirm that that is so i would with the leave of the committee beg leave to withdraw the amendment straight away <e>", "<cs> with the consent of the committee i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little to add to what i said before <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas chided me for again bringing this matter before the house <e> <s> my only reason for doing so is that on the first and the second occasions when this matter was in committee the noble lord promised to look into it to see what he could do but the result of that consideration has produced nothing <e> <s> this is extremely disapointing <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord bruce of donington would be willing not to press this amendment with the determination which he so gallantly shows in this house <e> <s> this bill has had a long and difficult period of months of birth pangs and throughout that period the four chartered accountancy bodies and the insolvency practitioners association have been working hard together to settle as prospective licensing authorities what their responsibilities should be <e> <s> they work in close contact with each other and as the noble lord lord lucas has said with the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two great causes for satisfaction this morning <e> <s> the first is that it appears likely that there will be a decision on a cross-channel link after a hundred years or more of dithering <e> <s> to that extent great credit rests with the government at last for bringing this to a head so that we do not dither any longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a member of the roskill committee and i am grateful to the house for allowing me to speak on this subject <e> <s> i hope that the house will forgive me for speaking with conviction in support of its recommendations <e> <s> the broad sweep of the report has been covered already by our chairman the noble and learned lord lord roskill <e> <s> in brief it proposes radical changes in the criminal procedures for fraud cases from the time of discovery until the verdict <e> <s> the present procedures are long out of date <e> <s> i suspect that similar changes are also necessary in the civil procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one short personal observation to remove any possible question of doubt <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor mentioned that at one time i was a partner in coopers and lybrand <e> <s> i should like to make it clear so that my own position is not in question that i retired from that firm over years ago <e> <s> i take no part <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment i should explain at the beginning that i have a minor conflict of interest in that this amendment affects professional bodies including the accountancy bodies and i am an accountant <e> <s> however i have no interest and take no part in investment business <e> <s> the professions that i think are affected by the amendment are the account-ancy bodies the law society the chartered surveyors and actuaries <e> <s> there may be others but i imagine that their feelings are similar to those expressed by the noble lord lord hacking and indeed to those which i hope to express myself <e>", "<cs> may i draw the attention of the noble lord lord lucas to two points <e> <s> as i understood his reply the main point was that the rpbs will undertake a narrower range of business <e> <s> that can be put into perspective perfectly simply in this way <e> <s> if a motor driver goes on to the streets and has an unfortunate accident a claim against him would be just as great whether he drives the car once a day or five times a day <e> <s> the cause of action is the same and the claims will be just as heavy <e>", "<cs> my lords the tentacles of this bill are widely spread but i wish to speak to only a small part of it <e> <s> i had the privilege of being a member of the roskill committee <e> <s> i am pleased to observe that some of the recommendations made by that commitee have been incorporated in the bill <e> <s> if they are carried into effect they will help to streamline the criminal procedures of this country and to bring them towards the present century <e> <s> the effects will be three in number in that area of the bill <e> <s> the first effect will be to enable documentary evidence to be brought before the court much more readily than has been the case in the past <e> <s> this will help the cause of justice and save a great deal of time and cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this bill <e> <s> i should declare an interest in that i am a member of the jockey club but this bill will yield no personal reward of any kind <e>", "<cs> i share with the noble and learned lord lord roskill the view that this proposal ought to be rejected <e> <s> i do so despite the formidable array of legal talent which has proposed it <e> <s> the effect of this clause is that all documents will be admitted unless the judge directs to the contrary <e> <s> it is certainly a broad clause but the breadth of it is carefully preserved by the restrictions imposed by clause <e>", "<cs> i hope that clause will stand part of the bill and i say so for four reasons <e> <s> i cannot speak with the skill and knowledge of so many members of the legal profession who are steeped in the law <e> <s> i speak only as a layman but i have the advantage of having studied the evidence which came before the roskill committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one short point to make <e> <s> i should not have asked for permission to do so if i had known what the noble lord lord seebohm intended to say <e> <s> the report follows a number of others which have drawn attention to the sorry state of the communitys finances <e> <s> one of the main thrusts of the report is contained in six lines in paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a member of the roskill committee <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and appear to meet exactly what that committee had in mind <e> <s> in other words if the crown has the right to challenge for cause and it also has the right of having confidential matters heard in chambers it seems to me appropriate for stand by to be abolished <e> <s> i was therefore puzzled as to why the government wished to retain stand by and i made inquiries about it <e> <s> i received two pieces of information both of which have been given to the house this evening by the noble and learned lord lord havers <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> the facts of the situation are clear <e> <s> numerous committees commissions and other inquiries have established that over a very long period of years the remuneration payable to lawyers in the legal aid scheme has been inadequate <e> <s> the second factor is that neither the existing legislation nor this bill include suitable mechanism to make it likely that remuneration will be fair and reasonable in the future <e> <s> we shall come to the question of machinery in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> clause ought to say and in the light of this debate it seems likely that it will eventually say that fair remuneration should be paid <e> <s> it should then go on to say if it is thought proper what factors should be taken into account in fixing fair remuneration <e>", "<cs> i was saying that if this is to have the slightest trace of common sense or fairness the pay of the judiciary engaged in legal aid cases should be reduced the pay of the raft of civil servants who supply the support services should be reduced or the pay of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor should be reduced and that of his servants who are engaged in legal aid matters <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> on an earlier amendment i said that this question of the remuneration of the legal profession was an open festering sore which had been outstanding for a great many years <e> <s> but one of the reasons for that was that there was an absence of adequate mechanism either in the existing legislation or in the present bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> the whole thrust of the debate in committee on this topic was that the words fair remuneration should be included in the bill so that the legal profession is properly paid <e> <s> in his answer the lord chancellor said <e>", "<cs> my lords i did point out that everybody knew except the noble and learned lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble and learned lord lord ackner i have one point of inquiry <e> <s> if the amendment is agreed will the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor be kind enough to tell us this <e> <s> when he has had regard to the factors is it the intention to fix fair or unfair remuneration for the legal profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to say that in the light of the comments that have been made on this clause tonight he will consider amending it to make it what i would call intelligible or at least more in accordance with the explanation that he sought to give us <e> <s> if that is so i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i should like to be sure that i understood the position correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords audit committees are a well-established principle of company administration <e> <s> the accounting profession of which i am a member has advocated them for many years <e> <s> i have publicly and privately supported them <e> <s> i have sat on numerous audit committees sometimes on one side of the table and sometimes on the other <e> <s> the difficulty with this bill is that its defects are so obvious and so deep-seated that i do not think it will be possible to tinker with it by amendment <e> <s> for that reason i think that there is only one possibility and that is to take the bill away and if necessary rewrite it altogether <e> <s> i shall return to that point later in my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment and particularly the conviction with which the noble baroness lady young has spoken about it <e> <s> i do not wish to weary the house at this time of day <e> <s> however i wish to point out that if britain is to hold its position in the community more and more british citizens will have to move into the community <e> <s> they will need to be satisfied that their children can be properly educated so that they can take advantage of university and other forms of higher education when they return to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i share in the disappointment which has been expressed so far in this house at the attitude adopted by the government <e> <s> those of us who have the task of finding citizens from this country to extend our industrial and commercial enterprises abroad know how difficult it is to find people who are prepared to throw up all they have in this country in order to serve terms overseas <e> <s> we all know that one of the factors which is uppermost in their minds is the education of their children so that they may take advantage of higher education when they return to this country <e> <s> the attitude so far adopted by the government compares ill with that of other member states in the community that have found it possible to find support for their own nationals in similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak in this debate but the ground affecting the structural funds has been so well covered by all the noble lords who have spoken already that i should only weary the house with repetition <e> <s> therefore i hope your lordships will allow me to refrain from addressing the house further <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to the second reading i hope that i reflect fairly the views of the institute of chartered accountants of england and wales as i am a member <e> <s> in so far as the bill affects the profession we generally support the broad sweep of it <e> <s> but there is a mass of complexity in it and many of the clauses will require some amendment to make them work satisfactorily <e> <s> those will be better dealt with in committee rather than mentioning them this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anybody will dispute the principle that the economic and financial barriers of the common market should be removed as soon as possible <e> <s> i do not doubt the principle i have grave doubts about the timing <e> <s> i gravely doubt whether the administration of the community is strong enough to make it possible or practicable to achieve this for a great many years <e>", "<cs> the accounting profession on behalf of whom i speak is foremost in wanting statements of standard accounting practice to be observed both by companies and by the profession <e> <s> we wholly support the principle <e> <s> my doubt is whether this is the right time and place to introduce this provision <e> <s> i am not privy to this but i understand that discussions are already taking place with the government on the outcome of the ronald dearing report which will be wide and comprehensive and is likely to require some form of statutory backing <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord strathclyde will be able to tell us or give some indication of what is likely to happen <e> <s> but in its present form it would be unwise to put in a provision of this kind <e> <s> the principle we wholly support <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will accept amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> my profession strongly supports these proposals <e> <s> it has been pressing for them for some time <e> <s> they are necessary in order to give proper information to shareholders <e> <s> i entirely support everything that has been said by the noble lord lord williams of elvel in that respect <e>", "<cs> it is extremely important that the amendment should be approved <e> <s> i speak from some experience of this matter over years <e> <s> in cases out of the secretary has no responsibility either for preparing or presenting the accounts of the company <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to ask him to sign the accounts about which on the whole he knows little <e> <s> it is important that the bill should not be passed in its present form <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that arrangement would be suitable <e> <s> the secretary has no responsibility and in practice takes no part in preparing or presenting the accounts <e> <s> further he is usually not an accountant he is usually a lawyer <e> <s> indeed his secretarial duties are quite different from preparing and presenting accounts to the public <e> <s> it is quite wrong to allow his name to go on the document and apparently carry his signature and his authority when he has had nothing to do with it <e> <s> that approach is absolutely wrong when compared to what happens in practice <e> <s> therefore i hope that the law can be made to comply with what actually happens in practice <e>", "<cs> i agree with that <e> <s> i thought i heard the minister say that the signature by the directors <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> there seems to be in the bill a change for changes sake <e> <s> it has no valuable effect whatever <e> <s> the words set out in amendment no <e> <s> are well established well understood and have been in existence probably since <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat what i said <e> <s> this is change for changes sake and is damaging <e> <s> i seem to have been unable to convince the minister that the precise emphasis of what the auditor has to report is important has been important for years and is vital in the conduct of civil and criminal claims <e> <s> i do not comprehend how the government can possibly say that it is not important <e> <s> i do not think that they have considered the point <e> <s> from what has been said by the minister i do not believe that he has known or taken into account the effect on civil and criminal claims <e> <s> if he had done so if he had followed the cases which have taken place in the courts he could not possibly have made the statement that he has made to the committee <e> <s> i beg him to reconsider his view <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to oppose the amendments <e> <s> however i ask the noble lord when the matter is looked at by parliamentary draftsmen to look at paragraph which has some unusual wording <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> no thank you <e>", "<cs> i am quite willing to agree to that <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the members of the committee who have supported this amendment <e> <s> it is only necessary for me to comment on the remarks of one member who gave support that is the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> i detected that his support was conditional on support for another measure which is very close to his heart <e> <s> i do not think the two are connected at all <e> <s> i was speaking to the physical problems of monitoring on a huge scale <e> <s> that interpretation could be put on the bill <e> <s> whether the secretary of state or another body enforces that control is not relevant to that point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the professional body on behalf of which i speak would very much like the word jointly to be removed since that is likely to lead to administrative difficulty <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appear to have been drawn into something which i do not follow <e> <s> i was speaking only to the word the in line on page <e>", "<cs> the minister has undertaken to make changes as appropriate and that is fully acceptable <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the proposal is acceptablei withdraw the amendment on that basis <e>", "<cs> i do not want to divide the committee at this time particularly as we all want to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the court of auditors made a report on the accounts of the community and to use the gentlest words that one can states that those accounts are misleading in short they are subject to grave irregularities <e> <s> will he tell the house what the government intend to do about the accounts of the community which are full of irregularities <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view this amendment should not be passed for three reasons <e> <s> first the statutory duty of the auditors is to report to the shareholders and not to the directors <e> <s> it is extremely important that that statutory responsibility should be absolutely clear and not confused by any other reporting obligation such as that indicated in the amendment <e> <s> secondly if any point of significance arises on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also in an embarrassing position because i have received very staunch support on my left and support from the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i am sure that the word secure is incorrectly used in the bill because in paragraph we see that in the first instance somebody who is admitted to the membership of the institute is fit and proper <e> <s> however there cannot be continuance surveillance to ensure that he is fit and proper every succeeding day in his life <e> <s> if he subsequently proves to be not fit and proper all that we can do is to get rid of him <e> <s> we cannot ensure that he shall be all his days fit and proper <e> <s> this is the point that troubles me <e> <s> having listened to the noble lord i now find that there is an intention to impose requirements upon the governing bodies which they simply cannot meet because they cannot secure something of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i have pointed out that if we discover that somebody is not a fit and proper person we must take action <e> <s> however that requires a separate provision in the bill <e> <s> if he does not prove to be fit and proper this can easily be covered by other wording if necessary <e> <s> it is quite unsatisfactory to put in the blanket word secure in the hope that that is what it is intended to mean <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no possibility of the risk of the enlarged provision being abused <e> <s> if there was any such risk the secretary of state could step in under the provisions of amendment no <e> <s> which is tabled in his name and which he will propose later this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what i said i withdraw amendment no <e> <s> bat if the noble lord wishes to speak to amendment no <e> <s> then i shall let that amendment remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than grateful to the secretary of state for what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been anxious on this subject as i have already explained to the house both in committee and at this stage <e> <s> i am pleased to note from what the noble lord lord young of graffham has said that the discussions will continue <e> <s> i do not think there is any point in my pursuing this matter until those discussions have been taken a stage further <e> <s> i hope that the bill may then be tailored if necessary to meet the outcome of those discussions <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord young of graffham for taking the trouble to bring forward this amendment <e> <s> it has considerably relieved the anxiety in our minds and we are grateful for the way it has been handled <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in that i was chairman of the royal commission on legal services from to <e> <s> we made certain recommendations and as has already been pointed out in the government under the present prime minister and the last lord chancellor but one approved the majority of those recommendations <e> <s> the green papers reverse not only the recommendations but the approval given in <e>", "<cs> my lords the annual revenue of the community is some million and expenditure is much the same amount <e> <s> the great bulk of that expenditure and the revenue takes place in the member states <e> <s> under every head of expenditure and revenue in the member states fraud is rife <e> <s> the amount has never been quantified but the estimates vary between billion and billion every year <e> <s> that is a disgraceful situation <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the explanation <e> <s> however i wonder whether the noble lord can help me <e> <s> is he saying that the administrator has the power to pay creditors existing at the date of the order if the company is solvent <e> <s> that is the issue <e>", "<cs> in the light of that answer i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the explanations which have been given <e> <s> i shall take them away and consider what effect they might have <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied with that explanation but it is not a matter for dividing the committee at the moment <e> <s> i shall take back what <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that information <e> <s> i wonder whether he would be willing to allow the responses to be examined at some place so that anybody who is interested in seeing them can study them and make an appropriate synopsis <e>", "<cs> my lords for the removal of doubt perhaps i may say that the question i ask is put in a helpful and not a critical spirit <e> <s> has the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor had a chance to read the submission made to him dated th april by lloyds of london on contingency fees <e> <s> that submission supports the evidence referred to by the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson <e> <s> does the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor not think that under those conditions it would be prudent to modify or amend the statement which he made to the house on th may at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion calls for a more integrated european community <e> <s> i should like to make the plea that there is very little hope of an integrated european community until we get the basic organisational structure of the common market on to a common sense basis <e> <s> it comprises at present six different layers of authority disjointed and uncoordinated <e> <s> first there is the european council which considers wide policy issues after meeting two or three times every year <e> <s> it does not determine legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor help us as regards the number of courts in the new programme which are designed and equipped to deal with the new information technology which is developing very quickly in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always a danger in a debate of this character that many of us repeat the same points in different language <e> <s> i am bound to transgress to some degree in that respect <e> <s> however i should prefer to speak not so much about japan but about what we in the united kingdom can learn from japan <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to that part of the bill that concerns the legal profession <e> <s> like its predecessors the green papers this bill is an exercise in the political dogma of competition <e> <s> it will damage one of our oldest professions and in turn it will damage the administration of justice <e> <s> in the future the control of the legal profession will be in the hands of bodies the bar council the law society the lord chancellors department the advisory quango the designated judges the director general of fair trading the solicitors disciplinary tribunal the conveyancing quango the conveyancing appeals tribunals and two ombudsmen <e> <s> the number of will increase as each new para-legal body is approved <e>", "<cs> i have the same difficulty with the words or better because the public are worried that new methods will be worse methods <e> <s> therefore or better means that the new methods may be worse <e> <s> if the words were and better the problem would probably be removed <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment but i wish to approach it from a slightly different aspect <e> <s> i am much more concerned for the purposes of what i wish to say about the legal aid scheme and the words in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i may be barking up the wrong tree but i thought this principle had been accepted by this house on several occasions in recent years namely the simple principle that when there is imposed on somebody a statutory duty which may or may not expose him to damages or claims for damages then he should be indemnified <e> <s> this was debated in the financial services bill and the indemnification was put into that bill <e> <s> it was debated at enormous length last year on the companies bill <e> <s> it was contested in the early stages by the minister speaking for the government but the tenor of the house supported the view that the indemnity should be given <e> <s> it was therefore put into the companies bill <e> <s> there is now a third occasion <e> <s> why is it left out on this occasion <e> <s> why do we have to fight for it yet again <e>", "<cs> i am anxious to support the amendment <e> <s> however i do not want to go through all the reasons as that would take a little time <e> <s> i understood from what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said a few moments ago in relation to another amendment that he would look into this matter <e> <s> if that is the case it would save time if he could help us on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the wording of the motion before the house implies that a free market economy will provide the utopian world in which we all want to live <e> <s> i am sure that it may help to do so but it does not go very far along that road <e> <s> we need a great deal else besides if we want to keep the word great in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> unhappily this bill has disregarded most of the nine principles upon which a profession should be based <e> <s> but we shall have to reap that dreadful harvest in the years that follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i was the chairman of the select committee which examined this private bill <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord dormand of easington for the comments that he has made <e> <s> the committee of which i was chairman felt that there were a few small matters to which i ought to draw the attention of the house merely by way of information <e>", "<cs> my lords as we see the bill leave the chamber i watch it with great distress because i believe that it will do great damage to a great profession <e> <s> but even worse than that i am afraid that it will set a standard for the other professions and will destroy a proud privilege we have had in this country for so many years the high quality of all our professions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that answer although it does not encourage very warm thanks because it does not really answer the question <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that one cannot eliminate fraud until one gets rid of its causes which was the point of the question <e> <s> does he not agree that so far there has been no political will in the community to make any attempt to set that programme of reform in hand or to employ the skilled staff necessary to make it work <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in the past months there have been no less than three reports <e> <s> there was the select committee report of st february the court of auditors report of th april and the report of the national audit office issued last week on th june <e> <s> all the reports draw attention to numerous examples of failure to detect and prosecute fraud in the united kingdom <e> <s> will the noble earl be good enough to tell the house what machinery is in post or is proposed to clear up these deficiencies in administration <e>", "<cs> my lords one advantage of the select committees inquiries is that a wide range of evidence is received and almost by a side wind so to speak a number of matters of importance are brought to light <e> <s> apart from the clear recommendations of the committees report with which i of course agree there seem to me four matters which are worthy of comment <e> <s> first and in this respect i seem to be echoing what the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow has said the impression left from the evidence tendered to us was that there is no consensus of opinion in the corridors of power nor yet in the marketplace of the community as to whether and when other nations should be invited or should apply successfully to join the twelve now present <e> <s> i believe there is a risk <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak to only two points in the report <e> <s> first perhaps i may draw the attention of the house to paragraphs and <e> <s> they repeat as has been done many times in the past two years the need to overhaul the resources and the objectives of the court of auditors in the community <e> <s> i do not propose to develop the point any further tonight because we shall debate it next week <e> <s> however i urge the government to take note of the continued requests for action to be taken on those lines <e> <s> i hope that they will be able to tell us something about it on wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the members of the house who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that there is general agreement that there is a public scandal which has not yet been eradicated <e> <s> there is also agreement that there is an absence of political will to correct it <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for seeking to answer the various points that have been raised and the four questions that i put to him <e>"]
