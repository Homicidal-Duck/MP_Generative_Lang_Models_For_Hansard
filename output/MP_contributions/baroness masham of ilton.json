antidote to this poison <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also ask the minister whether he is aware that many doctors are concerned about this because it takes only a very little paraquat to damage the lungs of small children and many people in this country are careless especially over locking up weed-killers in garden sheds and anyway the children probably would not be able to read <e>", "<cs> my lords i

clause <e> <s> i should just like to ask the noble baroness lady young whether this extends to scotland because some of this bill does and some does not <e> <s> i should just like her to confirm that <e>", "<cs> if it is already being done in scotland would it not be simpler just to include scotland in the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish to remove from the bill clause which amends the town and country

assent on th june have the same effect in relation to scotland as clause and the new clause being moved today have in relation to england and wales <e> <s> clause of the bill is therefore no longer necessary <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i wish to raise a point with the noble baroness the minister <e> <s> my noble kinsman has mentioned instances of incorrect signing and i wonder whether this could not be penalised under the trade descriptions act <e> <s> sometimes hotels insert in the aa handbook signs indicating facilities for the disabled <e> <s> my noble kinsman is well aware of this situation because on one occasion i am thinking of he booked the hotel <e> <s> the room was suitable for disabled people but it was up a flight of steps and so was absolutely useless <e> <s> yet in the aa handbook there was a wheelhcair sign beside the hotel entry indicating that it was suitable for access by wheelchair <e> <s> such an instance might come under the trade descriptions <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble baroness for this amendment <e> <s> there is no doubt that it makes the bill much better <e> <s> i asked some questions in the course of the scottish bill and i should like to repeat them <e> <s> the noble baroness may have answered them already <e> <s> i will study <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i hope that

question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that interesting reply <e> <s> may i ask whether she is aware that there is a very great and serious problem regarding the after-care of the ex-patients of stoke mandeville hospital of which there are about on their books <e> <s> there is no computer service and the administration is overloaded and therefore very inefficient <e> <s> also there is no call-back system and many patients get into serious problems related particularly to their bowels bladders and pressure sores <e> <s> could the government look into this very seriously <e> <s> is the noble baroness further aware that in the last week i have heard of two cases through general practitioners contacting me and asking where they can send patients who are suffering from non-acute paraplegia for bladder and bowel treatment and advice <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the spinal injuries association may i ask the noble baroness whether she is aware that unfortunately she has not got the correct information and that the spinal injuries association will be pleased to supply her with this <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> she has got vast experience concerning local authorities <e> <s> i think it has been useful to have the debate on these amendments

there is a good deal of pressure on your lordships house <e> <s> therefore it is important that this bill gets back to another place <e> <s> this is the reason why we are taking the two stages together <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls on me once more to thank all noble lords who have spoken and to thank the minister the noble baroness lady young in anticipation for a very good circular which i am sure the government will do their best to produce with the help of interested bodies outside your lordships house <e> <s> i should just like especially to thank the noble lord lord noel-baker for bringing up one of the most important points perhaps about this whole bill that having the correct facilities prevents disability and we who are severely disabled know only too well that if disability can be prevented so much the better for everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the leeds education authority for their good facilities for handicapped children <e> <s> they have special schools for those who need them and a splendid ordinary comprehensive school with access to all departments for disabled children who have to use a wheelchair or crutches or have other difficulties <e> <s> this school is called holt park <e> <s> it also has a community library included in the complex <e> <s> if leeds can do this why cannot other educational authorities <e> <s> as leeds have had these facilities for some time perhaps before the third reading the government will report on how successful they are proving <e> <s> this amendment seems very reasonable and i should like to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that there have been massive cuts in educational funds <e> <s> this is a great danger because local authorities may cut educational facilities for handicapped people too <e> <s> therefore there should be a plan because one has to be more careful with resources <e>", "<cs> my lords to have records

specialities it crosses borders <e> <s> one person may be doing a great harm because he may not be able to answer all the questions which the parent wants answered <e> <s> they may be medical questions which a teacher cannot answer they may be educational questions which a medical person cannot answer <e> <s> it is right across the board and as has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord renton because i do know personally some parents who are highly professional themselves they are perhaps consultants in medicine or professors at universities who themselves have children who have severe disabilities <e> <s> local authorities can be very authoritarian and therefore relationships break down <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord renton has a very valid point and i support his amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the matter somewhat complicated in the case of the ages of disabled school children because so many of them have lost time through operations and illness that they may have missed out on years of schooling <e> <s> in germany where i visited educational facilities for disabled children such children sometimes still go to school

to keep down the speed of the heavier lorries <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to contratulate the government on bringing in this amending bill <e> <s> i should like also to add that i hope that your lordships may be able to improve the bill during its passage through this house <e> <s> i was pleased to hear the noble lord lord elton say that he was open to suggestions <e> <s> i was moved some years ago while watching the remarkable film one flew over the cuckoos nest <e> <s> this was a film which showed how attitudes of staff in a hospital for mental patients can become so orientated

have been made aware by patients who have called out my name and i have realised that they need friendship and individual recognition <e> <s> there are many desperately lonely people in our society

councillors does he not think it is very necessary that there should be experts to advise because otherwise money is wasted in doing the wrong things <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl

officers of the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord a few questions <e> <s> one of them is in order to clarify the situation because i am rather muddled <e> <s> do we now have the mentally ill the mentally handicapped and the mentally impaired <e>", "<cs> being a member of a board of visitors i find that in the penal institutions the inmates do have all their rights fully explained to them it so happens by a member of staff <e> <s> they are told of their right to appeal and of their right to see members of the board visitors and so on <e> <s> it really <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down and other noble lords get up may i just put the record straight <e> <s> i said that in penal institutions

she means by short-term treatment <e> <s> does not short-term treatment sometimes have long-term effects <e>", "<cs> may i just say that i am rather surprised at the noble baroness putting this forward and taking away the family responsibility <e> <s> i feel that there should be some flexibility <e> <s> i should like to see a close relative involved maybe not the closest relative because they may not be compatible because relationships break down but i do think one should not hand over responsibility to the state <e> <s> some people are very proud and do not want to go to the social services <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him whether he thinks that a close relative would be more satisfactory than the nearest relative <e> <s> it just might not be practicable to get hold of the nearest relative he or she may be in america kuwait or anywhere <e> <s> a close relative might be the one that had a better relationship with the mentally ill patient or person <e>", "<cs> thank you my lords <e>", "<cs> the first part of the amendment is very good indeed but what worries me is the phrase <e>", "<cs> the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble lord would give that information not only <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister this <e> <s> if the patient is not seen during hours who prescribes drugs <e> <s> there is great concern about the <e>", "<cs> but if he has not been seen by a doctor <e>", "<cs> but you have not been admitted to hospital <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down may i ask him how many children there are in long-stay hospitals <e> <s> i know of one hospital in yorkshire which is called claypenny which is a very large hospital for mentally handicapped patients <e> <s> there are many children there and it is very sad to see them <e> <s> the staff do the very best they can for them <e> <s> there is also a school which is excellent <e> <s> but still i agree with the noble baroness lady faithfull and with the noble lord the minister that it is no place for children <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord belstead answers that point i should like to say that i am a member of a regional health authority in yorkshire and we have one planned <e> <s> also as the noble lord has said there is one in middlesbrough <e> <s> i asked a question on second reading to which i did not receive a reply <e> <s> i shall repeat it now in the hope that i shall get a reply <e> <s> if a patient needs assessment as the noble baroness lady macleod has just said can he or she be sent from the south to the north as we in the north seem to be better equipped and will be shortly even better equipped with these secure units <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there has been an increase from per cent <e> <s> in to per cent <e> <s> in of those involved in motor-cycle accidents with acute traumatic injuries admitted to stoke mandeville hospital spinal unit and resulting in permanent paralysis <e> <s> would he not think it time to mount a campaign in our schools to educate young people about the horrors and what it really is like to remain paralysed for the rest of ones life <e>", "<cs> my lords as a disabled driver for years i should like to thank lady gardner of parkes for this opportunity to discuss her majestys governments plans to revise the orange badge scheme <e> <s> there are some rumours being circulated which cause alarm among some disabled drivers and other road-users and this has been confirmed by the noble lord lord banks tonight <e> <s> the abuse by able-bodied people of the orange badge has been a reflection of selfishness by some members of our society but this is the sorry state of the present-day situation <e> <s> therefore as said at the time that the disabled persons bill passed through your lordships house it was a very necessary move to tighten up on the allocation of the badge and to penalise people for the wrongful use of the badge and for parking in a place reserved for a disabled person <e>", "<cs> could i just ask the noble lord lord belstead whether he would explain how much help a legal panel can give an individual patient <e> <s> do the patients have to pay or is the help voluntary <e> <s> and can they always be represented legally if they wish to be <e>", "<cs> i did speak on this matter at second reading and

have put my name because i was going to table an amendment on legal aid and i really do not mind which one i support whichever the government think is best i shall be very happy to speak to this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elton told the committee that patients who went to a crown court will now go before a review tribunal <e> <s> can he say how many patients this will involve and if they can choose whether they go to a crown court or to a review tribunal or will they be put into mental hospitals without a fair hearing in court <e> <s> if so this country will look very bad

tribunals <e> <s> he did speak rather fast and until i read <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken including the noble lord lord richardson <e> <s> i should just like to say to him that i have discussed this amendment with practising consultants whose views are not quite the same as his <e> <s> i think there is a code of practice laid down for the procedure of examining patients in normal hospitals non-mental hospitals <e> <s> therefore i want to take this back and reexamine it myself and take further advice on it <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether he can tell the committee approximately how many detained patients need to have operations performed against their wishes each year <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down as amendment to which i have already spoken also includes physical medical review and a code of practice will he please look at all the things i referred to previously and consider them along with the other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords what would happen if the patient has no nearest relative who is in touch with him because there are such people <e> <s> could it then perhaps be a member of a voluntary organisation or a social worker <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord is on the wrong amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like just to bring to the notice of the noble lord lord sandys and of the house the fact that the amendment states in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i am not sure whether the government are really in touch with the realities of what is happening on the ground <e> <s> in this country we do not place enough emphasis on rehabilitation on that i am quite clear <e> <s> psychiatrists have told me that when they write reports for the review tribunals they sometimes have to recommend that a patient stays in hospital because <e>", "<cs> my lords only today i heard of a very tragic case of a man who had been forced to have treatment and whose wife had signed the consent form <e> <s> he is now out of hospital but the relationship between husband and wife has totally broken down <e> <s> he has no confidence in her and he feels a broken inadequate man <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all noble lords who have paid tribute to the voluntary bodies <e> <s> we in great britain are very fortunate in having such splendid voluntary bodies and so many people who give their time so liberally <e> <s> i am grateful for what the noble lord lord sandys has said in particular for his tribute to the community health councils <e> <s> when people put forward their names it is always difficult to make a selection <e> <s> the people representing voluntary bodies throughout the country

particular organisation whom the commission think it would be good to have as advisers <e> <s> having said that i am pleased to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have supported this amendment <e> <s> i must say to the minister particularly that there is a new secure unit the first purpose-built one in this country and it is without a social worker attached to it at this very moment <e> <s> how depressing this is for the hospital staff the doctor and the nurses to work so hard with these difficult patients and then not to be able to give them social support when they leave <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to thank the minister the noble lord lord elton for the way that he has given information and answered letters on matters brought up in connection with this bill <e> <s> he has worked so hard with such gusto and with such good humour <e> <s> i am pleased with the result of my amendment on after-care and i thank all its supporters <e> <s> i hope that this legislation will now get the departments concerned with health and social security to work closely together and to provide what is essential to the detained patients on discharge <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister whether the government will consider first-aid and home nursing as part of the school curriculum <e> <s> does the minister not agree that this would make young people more able to look after their children and their elderly people and thus save the national health service a great deal of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for his reply may i ask him whether he is aware that one of the main dangers is toxic fumes from the smoke from mattresses which are now used in our prisons and other penal establishments and whether the government are considering supplying other mattresses and giving breathing equipment to prison staff <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be a good idea if the prisoners themselves made some of their new mattresses so giving them employment and saving them being shut up in their cells for hours a day <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble minister which countries throughout the world now have lead-free petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that it was not for health reasons that these countries had lead-free petrol <e> <s> may i ask him for what reasons they do have it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what is the difference between cheap imported lenses and non-imported lenses <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those old age pensioners who are disabled do not receive the benefits of cheap travel on buses and trains which other old age pensioners receive <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can make it clearer by asking the noble lord whether he is aware that old age pensioners do not receive the mobility allowance <e> <s> if they have a disability they are also at a disadvantage compared with their peers other old age pensioners who are not disabled since they cannot receive the benefits of cheap travel on buses and trains which other old age pensioners have <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord is not aware that i have received many letters from old age pensioners who have disabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government keeping in close contact with the international committee of the red cross in geneva <e> <s> i believe that the committee has offered its services on behalf of the falkland islands population <e> <s> is it not vital that there should be an impartial humanitarian body to protect the interests of civilians in the hands of an occupying state <e> <s> would the

whether he will arrange for his department to undertake some screened controls on preventing strokes such as checking for high blood pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my thanks to the noble baroness lady stedman for giving us the opportunity today to discuss the department of transports report <e>", "<cs> my lords for about years i have served on the board of visitors of a borstal and have also from time to time taken dis <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a question <e> <s> does that include if he absconds if he runs away <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the

question <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether in the planning of nurses homes any accommodation is being planned for married couples because many nurses marry very young now and many more men have come into the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that rather vague reply may i ask him whether the medical faculties of universities do not have a lot to do with clinical work on patients <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that professor glanville the last professor of

special attention as in this amendment for how long may it have to stay in a community home <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister replies may i too ask a question <e> <s> does this mean that where a family had all done something wrong an adult member of that family would be legally represented but that a child of that family just because he is a child would not be legally represented <e> <s> it seems very strange that legal representation should be given to adults but not to children how much more the children need it than do the adults because most adults can express themselves <e>", "<cs> i should like to add that so often when we have been discussing childrens legislation in this house it has been quoted that time is so much longer to a child than it is to an adult <e>", "<cs> i am attached to an open borstal and very many of the boys whom i have seen have been remanded in large local prisons such as durham armley liverpool and so on <e> <s> after that they go on to another

accept a few of these things <e> <s> we do not lock our children up if they have a few accidents <e> <s> i cannot see a reason why the government should say that they cannot accept these modest amendments <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble baroness lady trumpington appreciates that i said it in great friendship <e> <s> but this is a problem and it will become more of a problem because with the young prisoners coming into the borstal system what are we going to do <e> <s> we are going to take a step down and the younger boys will probably be placed in community homes <e> <s> some of

break a window <e> <s> when the noble lord mentioned this point i thought as i sat here of my noble kinsman who has a mercedes with electric windows and it seemed that perhaps it would be a good idea

call down the passage which i failed to do <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether before a curfew is imposed by a court there will always be a social report because nearly all the boys whom i see have worrying drinking habits as well as home problems <e> <s> one example is the broken home where the mother has an uncle living with her <e> <s> that is the term which the boys use for her lover because they like to be respectable <e> <s> so often there is frustration and disharmony between the lover and the son <e> <s> shutting them up with their frustrations might create a very great problem for the mother who wants to keep her son from custodial treatment as has already been said <e> <s> if the curfew could take place by giving offenders evening classes with a probation officer or a youth worker until the pubs close then i would support it <e>", "<cs> my lords as this amendment is supported and actually drafted by the all-party penal reform group and it is meant to

reports <e> <s> medical reports can sometimes take quite a long time especially if they happen to be called for over christmas and the new year <e> <s> prison hospital beds might be blocked by young people waiting for medical reports to be made on them <e> <s> this could be very detrimental to the other prisoners who may need the special beds in the prison hospitals <e> <s> therefore i would agree with the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that they should go to a youth custody centre and i see no reason why they should not go to a closed one where they would be with other young

have not committed crimes <e> <s> that is the difficulty <e> <s> i see no real way out unless one divides up the homes with homes for the goodies and homes for the naughty ones <e> <s> i can see the

lords the noble baroness lady trumpington who was not here at the beginning of this debate has asked me to say that she would have been speaking in this debate but that she has been attending a conference on incontinence at the royal college of physicians <e> <s> this is a subject of utmost importance about which she is very concerned <e> <s> sufferers from incontinence need rehabilitation and the greatest support and understanding <e> <s> the noble baroness has such close experience with the subjects that we are discussing today that i am sorry she is not enlightening your lordships

think that the priorities of the health service are for those people who work in it and not for those whom it is meant to serve <e> <s> in the bill there is protection for the salaries of general practitioners but there is penny-pinching means testing for some of the most disadvantaged members of our society those people who are unfortunate to be blind deaf or crippled <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how many women serve on the board of governors and how many men serve on the board of governors at the royal marsden hospital and is he aware that the chairman is male and perhaps there is a bias <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether i heard correctly when he referred to hoods <e> <s> if that is so what make and what type of hoods are being used <e> <s> furthermore in view of the severe pressures of overcrowding in our prisons may i ask

concerned with very many voluntary organisations of which i am president i too must support this amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord wallace of coslany decides what he will do i should

last week at the london hospital and an occupational therapist told me that that district was thinking of not supplying the roho cushion to paralysed people <e> <s> if the noble lord is not aware of

aware that the patients at that hospital are mainly geriatric patients some of whom will not be returning home <e> <s> is he further aware that if the patients are moved then to get other rehabilitation facilities as good as those in that hospital a great deal of expense may be involved <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that the buildings of the ida hospital are in excellent condition

the minister whether he will be good enough to answer the first part of my supplementary question which was why we have to import blood compounds from america and why we cannot manufacture our own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that the navy are short of doctors at the present time the army are short of and the raf <e> <s> is he further aware that after the doctors have given years service they get a pension and the problem could be retaining experienced doctors in the services <e> <s> would he not agree with me that it is important that service personnel their families and the public the national health service patients whom they serve get as good a medical service as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one more question <e> <s> does the minister think that it might be possible to have closer links with the national health service and perhaps some joint funding in areas where there are small populations near to a military hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the ancient city of ripon is to have a by-pass <e> <s> it has one of the oldest cathedrals in the country the foundations of which are being shaken by the heavy traffic which comes thundering round ripon totally blocking it up and spoiling this lovely old city <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the new managers salaries are to come out of the present regional health authority budgets <e> <s> in the old days the nurses used to be accountable to the matron and would not an appointed matron wearing a uniform have been a cheaper way of getting accountability of nurses than yet just another manager who will probably be wearing a suit and will not be recognisable <e> <s> he will just be yet another manager <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i apologise for my lateness in arriving for this debate <e> <s> i had a very longstanding engagement to open officially a unit at a hospital in kent <e> <s> this was a very happy occasion and i did not want to let down the people in a national health service hospital at

second reading of the previous bill some of your lordships could not stomach the sight of seeing young girls being mutilated in such a way <e> <s> the cries of these young girls anguish were heartrending <e> <s> we discussed this subject fully in the last session of parliament and i think that the bill was improved but we now have in parliament many new members <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord kennet has again brought the matter of prohibiting female circumcision in britain before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury is doing the country a great service in instigating this important debate in your lordships house <e> <s> there can be nothing more important than to try to find successful ways to reduce crimes of violence <e> <s> i was most hesitant to put my name down to speak in this debate with such erudite and distinguished speakers but the reason why i felt i should contribute is on behalf of

for that full reply may i ask him whether he is aware that when we get boys sent to us in youth custody centres they have very often completed maybe half of their sentence in an adult prison <e> <s> would he not agree with me that for a or year-old boy to be locked up hours a day while in the middle of his puberty could be very damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a problem in that some magistrates are not aware that detention centres are not being fully used <e> <s> they are under the impression that the centres are very full <e> <s> is he aware that i have discussed this with some magistrates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he can give an assurance that old blood blood that has passed its recommended date of use will not be passed on to private hospitals

trying to get their patients out into the community where the hospitals have a considerable amount of land available which could be sold off on the open market <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that the health authorities need every single penny they can get hold of to be able to get these patients resettled in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble kinsman the minister whether some educational boards are more sympathetic than others to those children taking examinations who have problems such as dyslexia and other handicaps <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that throughout the country many parents are worried that their young people may be involved with drugs and can he give some advice on what they should do and from whom they should seek help <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to me the minister said that parents should go to the teachers but a great deal of drug abuse happens after the children have left school <e> <s> if it is to the teachers that parents must go to whom must the teachers go <e>", "<cs> my lords while paying tribute to the many people who work so hard to provide facilities for disabled people on the tyne and wear metro could i ask the minister how many disabled people are making use of it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with me that the small cottage hospital generally deals with low technology medicine and is usually for the elderly and the infirm <e> <s> would he agree that it is much easier to close a small hospital than a large one <e> <s> but are the expenses of the ambulance services taken into consideration because with rural transport being cut back the elderly and the infirm have difficulty in getting to hospital if it is not near their home unless they go in an ambulance <e>", "<cs> my lords i also pay tribute to lord amulree <e> <s> he was a friend and physician of elderly and disabled people <e> <s> he did a great deal towards educating doctors to the problems of disability <e>

that reply may i ask whether there was a bone specialist on the committee and also whether he is aware that there is an epidemic of fractures throughout the country and that many orthopaedic surgeons are most worried about the situation among the elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the minister again whether he is aware that many elderly people especially in cities such as glasgow and liverpool

supervised when they are eventually discharged <e> <s> would not some form of parole system be a safeguard when they go back into the community <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add a word to say that i

baroness lady jeger said <e> <s> we have yet another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead for calling attention to this frightening and tragic situation

dhss <e> <s> this is no trivial matter and i hope that this debate short though it may be will help to stir the government into a state of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord if he will discuss particularly with his colleagues those doctors who practise in rural areas because it could be that the wife is the only trained secretary in a particular district and that the general practitioner might have to go miles to find somebody else who is qualified <e>", "<cs> i am very very willing for the right reverend prelate to speak before i do if he so wishes <e> <s> if some

electric typewriter because it has no proper fingers does not have more important needs than a christian child though the disabled child may be christian as well who has christian teaching leaping around <e> <s> could they not do that out of school <e>", "<cs> before my noble kinsman sits down may i ask him whether he will ask his colleagues to consult also with the national bureau for handicapped students <e> <s> they are now doing a survey of micro-computers and technology of that kind for handicapped children and his colleagues might learn something <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble kinsman the minister how much research the government are doing on the teaching of mathematics <e> <s> he knows as well as i know that we have two children <e> <s> both went to totally different schools and neither of them can do maths <e> <s> our daughter passed seven good o levels but still she could not do maths she took the subject three times and failed <e> <s> our son who happens to be dyslexic had a very attractive english teacher and passed o level english hut he cannot do maths either <e> <s> i believe that written into the bill ought to be more attractive or more handsome maths teachers maybe the children will then start learning maths <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble minister how many severely disabled drivers have been issued with parking tickets because they have had such difficulty in parking and cannot find any special place or free meter at which to park <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she would be interested for some of our spinal injury people to give her their parking tickets which they have been given by the police and the traffic wardens <e> <s> some of them have drawerfuls and some have been taken to court <e>", "<cs> would it not be better to have the word unreasonably added <e> <s> it would be better if it stated <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble baroness lady lockwood who has so much experience probably more than any other person in the house on equal opportunities whether she would not agree that equal opportunities would have been less emotive and more acceptable to members of the public who are frightened of disability rather than discrimination which is frightening in itself <e>", "<cs> am i not right in saying that the south australian act is called the equal opportunities for the handicapped act and does not use the word discrimination <e> <s> again the noble earl lord longford has just referred to discrimination without saying unreasonable discrimination <e> <s> that is so important that i think each time the word discrimination appears in the bill it should be preceded by the word unreasonable so as to make it unreasonable discrimination <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few remarks <e> <s> at a very early age when i was a child in the middle of the war my mother ran a london canteen for servicemen at one of the london stations <e> <s> on one occasion two air force people came in with very disfigured faces and none of the people would serve them <e> <s> they were frightened and called for my mother who went and served them <e> <s>

discrimination <e>", "<cs> yes and that can be improved <e> <s> i think that we must vote on the principle but i believe that the government will be very unwise if they do not set up some body which will learn of these changing problems <e> <s> we now have multitudes of handicapped people coming into a community which is perhaps not ready to receive them and that community needs to learn and be educated <e> <s> as the noble lord lord pitt has said perhaps legislation will help to educate them <e> <s> i want to do what is best for the disabled and i also want to do what is acceptable to those people in the country <e>", "<cs> it is very sad that this amendment had had to be put forward because surely this is a bad management matter at district hospital level <e> <s> someone who shouts and screams should be put into a side ward so that he or she does not disturb the other patients <e> <s> there are some problem patients such as those unfortunate people who suffer head injuries and nobody quite knows which hospital to put them in <e> <s> the big problem is when some hospitals do not have enough room to make a private place <e> <s> i hope that as this is a health matter the minister will speak to the amendment <e>", "<cs> first let me say that i think there should he far more housing suitable for disabled people built and more houses built with bathrooms downstairs <e> <s> i also serve on a new town in fact two new towns <e> <s> i have been trying over the years to encourage them to do something they do not seem to like that is to build suitable houses for disabled people <e> <s> i think that is a great pity <e> <s> i wonder whether the government can give special grants for more housing which is suitable for disabled people and which would also serve the large population of the elderly <e> <s> it seems such bad luck if you are a young disabled man with a family living and working with colleagues who are buying their own council houses <e> <s> they do not want to be singled out and if they are disabled they want to have the same chance in life <e> <s> and they are being singled out if this amendment goes through <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> is he aware that this information has not gone down to the general practitioners and that they spend a great deal of their time when they are very busy ringing the hospitals to see whether cardiac pacemakers are needed or wanted <e> <s> would not the minister consider it to be advisable as funeral directors are supposed to take out the devices for general practitioners to know about this <e>", "<cs> my lords why is it that in this country pacemaker insertion is less than in any other western european country and only one-fifth of that in the united states of america <e> <s> would not the minister agree with me that for those who can benefit from the pacemaker it is most wonderful and gives them a new lease of life <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the disease can be passed on to pheasants pigeons and those kind of birds <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what are the symptoms of this particular strain <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord campbell of croy exactly what powers the commission will have <e> <s> i rather agree with him that one does not want to impose a limitation <e> <s> if the commissions powers are to be quite strong it might be important to have on it people with legal experience to sort out any problems <e> <s> that is the point which i should like him to answer <e>", "<cs> in a way i rather feel able to support the noble lord lord campbell of croy because i think that the noble lord lord ennals has made a very good point in that he has illustrated that the present dhss is not interested in disabled people and sadly there are no lords a leaping from the ministerial bench <e> <s> perhaps if the responsibility lay with the home office and i know personally the home secretary who is an exceedingly hardworking person disabled people in this country might he better off <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question of the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> under this bill if there is an obvious case of discrimination for example not calling a disabled person for a job interview solely because he is disabled even though he is qualified with excellent references and all other external factors are suitable and if it is very obviously a case of discrimination what would the commission do about it <e> <s> if they attempt to conciliate and fail what recourse does a disabled person have and what power has the commission <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him a question about the access committee which i wholeheartedly welcome and whose chairman i know <e> <s> what will the access committee do when it is faced with matters of discrimination <e> <s> i hope that it may tackle the problem of fixed rails at london airport which stop any wheelchair-bound person using the facilities <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord

and given advice <e> <s> with the noble lord lord campbell of croy and others i shall take it away and try to get something of satisfaction to everyone and to see that it covers everything that is

pleasure in withdrawing this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government looked at community service as an alternative to prison for those who do not pay their fines <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble kinsman how the government see health education in the curriculum and what they are doing to encourage local authorities to spread information about the dangers of our permissive society to pupils especially as regards drug abuse and venereal disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord annan for this opportunity <e> <s> my contribution to this debate will be very short but there is concern from many people that the limited and hard striven-for facilities for severely disabled students in universities polytechnics and colleges of higher and further education may be cut back <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will give some assurances that these valuable assets will be safeguarded and that when there is change the

government now find it acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add just a few words <e> <s> following what has been said by the noble lord lord glenarthur i hope that where there is a will there is a way and if the government really want to find a way they will do so in another place <e> <s> i hope that this bill will have a speedy passage through another place with the governments full help

with rheumatic diseases as the noble lord lord bottomley said there are many people in this country with those diseases have gone a long way down the list of health priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister how many other european countries have such legislation and whether interpol will be helpful when the legislation comes into force <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble kinsman whether he will encourage more treatment centres such as phoenix house for drug abusers and for alcoholics and also whether he will encourage more meaningful deterrents in cases of rape

ask the minister whether the government will help voluntary organisations such as phoenix house and here i have to declare an interest as i chair that organization to set up hospices or refuges for

there was a great problem of lack of speech therapists and physiotherapists which we all know about <e> <s> he said that it was important that their skills should be passed on to care attendants and to parents who could then help with the repetitive work which speech therapy entails <e> <s> teaching such children is a long process and some care attendants are very good at it <e> <s> they are employed by local education authorities <e> <s> therefore it is sensible to bring such services together and make them more flexible so that they can be provided by the local education authorities and

before us a group of amendments namely amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i shall mention them afterwards <e> <s> i should like to speak now to amendment no <e> <s> which has my name and that of others attached to it <e> <s> because this amendment has a star i should not like your lordships to think that we have just tabled it <e> <s> i spoke to a similar amendment in committee at am and not many members of the committee were present at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble kinsman if legionella can be found in the heads of sprays in bathrooms <e> <s> if so how best should they be disinfected <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether his department works closely with the home office over the problem of the homeless who are mentally ill and who land up in police cells <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in some places for people who have not been able to get treatment in this country their communities have raised money and sent them abroad for treatment <e> <s> how does he view that kind of circumstance <e> <s> does it not show how keen the community is for health services <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that farming has become much easier that young people now sit in comfortable heated cabs and have vehicles to drive around in and that <e> <s> therefore they do not use up as much energy as they used to do when they rode bicycles and had a much harder life <e> <s> will he also agree that often in rural areas there is nowhere but the pub to go to in the evening <e>", "<cs> my lords is not westminster and riverside a slightly special case bearing in mind the number of tourists and people who come to work in the areas <e> <s> those people have strokes and heart attacks so with those additional people coming into the area should it not be treated as a special case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that helpful reply <e> <s> however can be tell me whether he believes that parents are fully aware that the hearts and lungs of young people can stop if they misuse butane gas <e> <s> are they aware of this serious danger <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government not worried about the case in sheffield at the hallamshire hospital where the osteopetrosis unit is under threat of closure <e> <s> the consultant has had to find from the bank to keep it going <e> <s> one woman in three suffers from osteopetrosis brittle bones during her ageing life <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble kinsman what happens at present to the people about whom the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has spoken <e> <s> do they receive rate rebate <e> <s> do they pay rates <e> <s> in the future will they have to pay more than they are paying now <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the minister whether there could be any risk in using aluminium cooking utensils <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add one thing <e> <s> i have noticed going round several am i not allowed to come in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that risley remand centre has had a bad reputation for many years <e> <s> there has been a high rate of suicides <e> <s> does he realise that it is difficult to break a reputation that has been held for so long <e> <s> does he also realise that i am pleased to hear that the year-olds are to be removed to hindley youth custody centre <e> <s> that is a good move <e> <s> will he <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to support the amendment <e> <s> the older children get the more concerned parents become and sometimes the young people become more difficult to handle <e> <s> all kinds of problems emerge related to puberty and sex <e> <s> sometimes the children who are no longer children but young people become strong and parents worry very much about what will happen when education ceases altogether <e> <s> perhaps this is a time when they need more support than ever before <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment a need for some such form of therapy cannot be supplied by the education authority as has been stated by my noble friend lady darcy <e> <s> it has to wait for the health authority to do it <e> <s> to wait for the health authority to do so may cause delay or if that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether a little competition between two authorities is not a very healthy matter <e> <s> is that not the whole ethos of the conservative party <e> <s> there are many married physiotherapists occupational therapists and speech therapists who could give a few hours of their time <e> <s> so i do not agree with the minister s argument <e> <s> further is it not possible to make the amendment perfect in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt in my mind that to many people the saying an englishmans home is his castle is very true <e> <s> to a disabled person this is just as true <e> <s> disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a very special community spirit in that part of london <e> <s> is it not very important for good relationships with the new people coming into that area that that spirit remains <e>", "<cs> my lords with the problem of the extreme shortage of nurses will the government extend work permits to those people coming from european countries such as portugal who wish to be care attendants and who can do that job very well for severely disabled people who wish to live in the community <e>", "<cs> we have a growing problem in that the number of aids patients doubles every months <e> <s> i am told that the first signs of the disease can be found in the mouth <e> <s> following a dental examination the patient is counselled and it is to be hoped if the presence of the virus is confirmed the patient will realise the need to prevent the spread of the disease <e> <s> we must do everything we can to stop the spread of that terrible condition <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from that question perhaps i may ask the minister how much research is being done on salmonella and eggs as cases of salmonella poisoning are increasing vastly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether devil worship is on the increase <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support these amendments as does my noble friend lady darcy de knayth who is not too well at present <e> <s> on the issue of housing i must say that many disabled people have had a raw deal <e> <s> my noble kinsman the minister knows full well about such problems <e> <s> therefore i hope that he will give the committee a sympathetic and helpful answer because many disabled people will be watching what is done by the committee in respect of this matter <e>", "<cs> over the past year as i said at second reading i have had several exasperated disabled people contact me who have wanted to buy their council houses which they have lived in for many years so that they can improve the properties and have some security for themselves and their families <e> <s> perhaps disabled people more than any others should be helped to do this <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey sits down perhaps i may ask him whether this would be a suitable alternative <e> <s> if a council sells a house to a disabled tenant could it not build another house and thereby increase the pool of houses for disabled people <e>", "<cs> can i just say to my noble kinsman that i served for many years on two new town corporations <e> <s> i can tell him that i had great difficulty persuading and cajoling them to build suitable houses for either disabled or elderly people <e> <s> they do not like building one-storey accommodation <e> <s> if we lived in canada new zealand or australia there would be no problem because there they build that type of house but in this country it is very difficult <e> <s> if the minister asks local councils i think the answer will be that they do not want the proposal that the noble lord lord swinfen and i are now proposing <e> <s> they would prefer to discriminate against disabled people <e> <s> sadly that is the problem with local authorities and housing corporations at this time <e>", "<cs> before my noble kinsman rises i should like to ask a few questions <e> <s> what percentage of discount are we considering <e> <s> i think that that could be a complication <e> <s> moving house is a very expensive business for disabled people in particular who may have to move pieces of equipment <e> <s> moreover they may have friends who help them in the locality in which they live and that is why i support them being enabled to buy their council house a property with which they are familiar in a locality which they know <e> <s> they already know the snags and the good points <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the mentally ill will the government look very carefully at the very worrying increase in arsonists and will they work very closely with the home office to see where those people should be treated whether in health or penal institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept an invitation to visit the female orthopaedic ward at leeds general infirmary where he will find very old out-dated beds lumpy mattresses which give the patients pressure sores inadequate washing facilities and frustrated nurses who feel that they could do a better job if there were better patient facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords when we look back on hitlers regime in the war we can see that a group of people were singled out as different <e> <s> they had to wear a star they were jews <e> <s> they were discriminated against with disastrous results <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should remind my noble kinsman that we made very strong speeches on second reading which was quite a long time ago before the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carter is usually a great friend of disabled people <e> <s> in this matter he would not be a friend <e> <s> this amendment is discriminatory and complicated <e> <s> disabled people are against all types of discrimination however big or small <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to say that i hope more suitable housing for disabled people will be built by corporations local authorities and all people building houses throughout the country <e> <s> a house suitable for a disabled person can be used by any family <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether this measure includes scotland too <e> <s> england and wales have been mentioned and being a scot i just wondered whether scotland was included <e>", "<cs> my lords as a so-called disabled person i should like to thank the chairman of the select committee on the european communities for giving us the opportunity today to discuss the report on integration of disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords spain <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his helpfulness and thoughtfulness <e> <s> i will go back to radar to see when they have read what he has said whether they are satisfied <e> <s> if they are still not satisfied perhaps they will get in touch with him before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> there have been problems and they have quite a few examples of cases where there have been breakdowns with the social services probably <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i should like to add my feelings to those of the <e>", "<cs> i wish to add my concern about this age group <e> <s> i am attached to a youth custody centre which has recently changed its name and i cannot remember what it is <e> <s> it has changed its name three times <e> <s> these young people are aged between and years <e> <s> recently i conducted a survey and looked at a list of the boys going out <e> <s> if they are homeless their details are written in a certain way <e> <s> many of them are homeless because their families have broken up and they are going out to virtually nothing <e> <s> the result is that they are returning to youth custody <e> <s> i have had boys who have come back two three and sometimes four times <e> <s> it is an expensive way of dealing with them and it is not the right way <e> <s> if something can be done then it should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the noble lord lord butterfield i should like to say how good it is to hear that he is interested in health promotion <e> <s> i hope that he will promote it in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that rather vague answer <e> <s> does he agree that there is great concern about rats among the public which has been handed down through history from the time of the plagues which swept through asia and europe <e> <s> can he give an assurance to the house that there are enough rat control officers throughout the country <e> <s> if he cannot give that assurance can he get it from the department of the environment <e> <s> it is not only weils disease which is carried by rats but also hepatitis and salmonella among many other diseases <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many wastepaper bins were placed around the countryside but that they have disappeared <e> <s> is the reason for their disappearance particularly from lay-bys the fact that no one will empty them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to my noble friend lord hunter of newington for initiating this debate on the white paper <e> <s> as these are very early days with the working papers just having come out i am sure that this debate on the national health service reorganisation is one of many which your lordships will undertake in the period of consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell me whether the report which i shall read with interest includes laying ducks <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the glasgow veterinary college carries out some very important work on the aids virus and has a worldwide reputation <e> <s> what will the world think if this very famous school closes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his reply <e> <s> i hope that when the guidelines are drawn up it will be done in conjunction with the organisations for disabled people so that they can register their agreement with them <e> <s> i think that in the past the problem has been that some children have unnecessarily been taken into care away from loving parents who with a little more help perhaps somebody to do the shopping or the provision of meals on wheels for example could have had their children remain with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord and beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if sheep and cattle were grazed in the same park as deer would they be at risk from tuberculosis <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord brougham and vaux for this debate <e> <s> in a recent report it was estimated that alcohol consumption in britain is set to double in the next years with devastating social consequences <e> <s> with the increase in car ownership and busy roads the combination can mean only disaster unless something positive is done to try to curb aggressive dangerous driving which is stimulated by alcohol <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what are the bad effects on people bitten by the fly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many magistrates would like a greater choice in sentencing for example community service orders combined with rehabilitation for problem drinkers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether some groups of people are more likely to use crack than others <e> <s> if that is the case would it not be wise to contact the community leaders in order to try to stop the horrifying problem which is now escalating in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords are deer farms licensed and do they have a licence to sell venison <e> <s> is it not a fact that if these animals are living in an unnatural environment such as a factory farm they develop more diseases than they would if they were in wild habitation <e>", "<cs> my lords if there are designated farm watch schemes but some farms are outside it are those farms not more at risk <e> <s> will the minister ask police in rural areas to make available to the public more information on how to fight crime <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that florence nightingale was a very good manager in that during the crimean war she reorganised the whole of the hospital and nursing services <e> <s> surely among the thousands of nurses now working in the national health service there must be one who is an excellent manager <e> <s> would not such an appointment give a boost to the morale of all nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords on my copy of the whip which i received last friday the unstarred question included the subject of alcohol <e> <s> however when i telephoned the whips office on monday to put my name down to speak i was not informed otherwise <e> <s> therefore most of my remarks will be linked to alcohol because this is as important as tobacco and because i know more about the problems arising from alcohol <e> <s> i consider them to be similar in regard to taxation and health and i have been a strong campaigner against smoking for as long as i can remember <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few words <e> <s> i find it very depressing to hear my noble kinsman say that severely disabled people will be means tested because when people are severely disabled they have many extra expenses and just to survive in the community is a problem <e> <s> it is very sad that the government cannot give a little encouragement to enable people and families to stick together and to stay in the community <e>", "<cs> the amendment will encourage the saving of money <e> <s> if it is known that a disabled person will be living in the house that is to be built many of the persons individual needs can be incorporated at no or little cost <e> <s> however some requirements may involve an appreciable extra cost for example the installation of special bathing or showering equipment or an extra large garage <e> <s> the only way at present in which any assistance can be given is to wait until the building is complete rip out what has been installed and replace it with what was wanted all the time <e> <s> that seems a great waste of everybodys time and money <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment <e> <s> i am wholly against means testing for any person with severe disability <e> <s> as has been so well said by the noble lord lord swinfen disabled people have many extra expenses which may be a millstone round their necks <e>", "<cs> i should like to explain the matter a little further <e> <s> my noble kinsman said that he wanted disabled people and non-disabled people to be treated the same <e> <s> that is the whole point of the argument before us <e> <s> disabled people are not the same and cannot be until they receive extra money to bring them up to the level of everyone else <e> <s> the point of trying to obtain a disablement income pension for such people is to bring them up to the relevant level so that they are at the same starting point as everyone else <e> <s> indeed my noble kinsman has just said that <e> <s> if members of the committee read <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl lord swinton my husband were here tonight he would tell the committee far better than i can that it is absolutely essential if one is married to a paraplegic that there are two bathrooms in the house <e> <s> he has already said so in the chamber several years ago but i should like to say that it could be the make or break of a marriage <e>", "<cs> before my noble kinsman rises i have heard that there is a new regulation i am not sure whether it comes from the ec about the plugging in of electric wheelchairs <e> <s> i think that he ought to check it because this amendment may be essential <e>", "<cs> crack is the very dangerous drug which makes those who take it violent and desperate <e> <s> we have been warned by the americans to do all we possibly can to avoid the terrible violence connected with that drug <e> <s> perhaps better lighting would be one measure that would help overcome the problem <e> <s> therefore i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> there has been most hurtful discrimination against disabled people who are living in the community and have been denied the right to buy their council houses while other people have been able to buy similar houses <e> <s> i have files of letters and i have had desperate telephone calls from people from all parts of the country and many of these letters i have sent on to the department <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that i visited holloway prison last year where one-third of the inmates were young women from nigeria many of whom were pregnant and being treated on the national health service while they had their babies <e> <s> is there any hope of getting the nigerian government to co-operate with our government to try to stop girls leaving nigeria with drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords people from scotland yard informed our parliamentary drug abuse committee that only about per cent <e> <s> of drugs coming into the country were found <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an approximate rough estimate <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i assure noble lords that it aims to save money <e> <s> for example when we built our house i had a bath lift installed which meant the erection of a reinforced ceiling <e> <s> had that not been done at the time of building it would have cost a great deal more money <e> <s> when we first moved into the house i did not need to use the bath lift but now in my ageing years when my arms are not so strong i use it <e> <s> therefore it is a necessary piece of equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords when there is a means test and people find the extra expense <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he consider for a moment the people whom he is targeting <e> <s> he is hitting those who have probably been professional people such as nurses and teachers who suddenly contract a disease such as multiple sclerosis <e> <s> the agony is piled on <e> <s> they have lived carefully and have saved some money <e> <s> i have dealt with several such people <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that the amendment was so complicated that part of the bill would have to be rewritten <e> <s> i am asking why part of the bill would have to be rewritten for such a small but important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with such a shortage of suitable buildings for disabled and elderly people would it not be possible for that house to go to somebody else on the waiting list <e>", "<cs> my lords there are plenty of elderly people who might want to buy the house <e>", "<cs> my lords many people who are elderly are also disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the amendment which has the full support of the disablement income group and of the royal association for disability and rehabilitation <e> <s> those are organisations which are working for many disabled people throughout the country <e> <s> it seems such a pity that families with disability who have to face so many struggles in life must work so hard to obtain those facilities which will enable them to stay in the community especially as we hear so much these days about care in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords it has taken a long time to come this far <e> <s> i hope that the lady lane-fox is looking down on the house at this moment <e> <s> she will be very pleased <e> <s> disabled people have been most worried by the many different deliberations over the right to buy and i hope that the position will be made clear to them <e> <s> apart from rape i have received more letters and telephone calls on this subject than on any other that i have taken up in this house <e> <s> i have even received two letters today from very concerned people <e> <s> it has been and is a great issue <e> <s> i ask the minister to make clear the position for those people <e> <s> i thank him and everyone else who has helped with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should declare an interest on three counts <e> <s> first i have the honour to be an honourary fellow of the royal college of general practitioners <e> <s> secondly like many people throughout the country i have a chronic long-term disability and i am dependent on the national health service <e> <s> thirdly i live in a rural area <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that some of the suggestions put forward by your lordships today will be listened to by the government <e> <s> i say that because uncertainties are damaging to the morale of any organisation <e> <s> good morale is especially essential for the health service if it is to function in a humane and efficient way <e> <s> an uncertainty hanging over general practitioners who will not hold their own practice budgets and their patients is that of not knowing if the general practitioners will still have freedom of choice to send patients to the consultants they feel are most suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord mountevans for asking this important unstarred question <e> <s> many of the present policies towards road and rail are not satisfying <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that there has been an increase in tuberculosis in many countries with the emergence of the hiv infection <e> <s> that includes america <e> <s> does she not agree that it is very important to protect our children against the infection of tuberculosis <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness not aware that nowadays travel has become very much more widespread and that people go abroad especially to asian countries for holidays with their families much more than previously was the case <e> <s> therefore they can bring the disease back to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> is she aware that many severely disabled and elderly people are now having acute problems in getting their houses cleaned and that to remove the priority of cleanliness makes them feel demoralised and depressed in dirty houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble baroness is as keen on cleanliness as i am and is concerned about those people who cannot do these things for themselves <e> <s> will she ensure that her department monitors the situation throughout the country <e> <s> will she take it upon herself to undertake that task in view of her interest in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the answer given by the noble earl to the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> i was horrified to think what prisoner may still be doing to prisoner at this moment <e> <s> there can be horrific bullying and as a member of a board of visitors i know what can happen <e> <s> i ask the minister whether it would not be wise to bring in the sas now and put a quick stop to the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have before us a mammoth piece of legislation <e> <s> the health of our nation is of vital importance <e> <s> we who have had our lives saved by the skill and experience of those who work in the national health service know that it is of vital importance to keep up the good standards <e> <s> where they can be improved we strive to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness misunderstood me <e> <s> i am a supporter of money following the patient <e> <s> i was concerned about the authority members of the district and regional committees <e> <s> if money is very limited a good many excellent people will give their services free <e> <s> i was referring not to the staff but to the committee members <e> <s> but i am all for the money going with the patient <e>", "<cs> my lords could there be any risk to bovine-type zoo animals and deer from bse <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether in the long term the government will look at employing prisoners who have to be in prison on productive and useful work such as providing a laundry service for hospitals which would save the national health service money <e> <s> the frustration of being locked up for to hours a day leads to smouldering conditions especially when prisoners have only one shower a week <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i could ask who the executive members will be and what sort of officers the authorities will have <e> <s> i serve on a regional health authority and we have a very good mix <e> <s> we have men and women <e> <s> however almost all the senior officers of the authority who are the present advisers are men <e> <s> will it be of benefit to patients if there is an imbalance of more men than women as i think will happen <e>", "<cs> eminent noble lords have moved this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may ask two very brief questions one of which may be a little wide but is still of interest <e> <s> not long ago i had the pleasure of opening a small university unit in leeds a paediatric dental unit <e> <s> the professor in charge of the unit was worried that in the future he might be short of teaching material <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord walton of detchant rises to speak i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> at the beginning of the debate he said that these people would be chosen from the non-executive members <e> <s> however would it not be better if they came from the executive members <e> <s> i say that because otherwise the health authorities would be very professionally orientated <e> <s> i hope that he will agree to consider that suggestion <e>", "<cs> i have a very simple question for the minister <e> <s> what happens if the trust hospitals run out of money <e> <s> moreover what happens if the budget holding gps also run out of money <e> <s> much has been said about security in todays debate <e> <s> i think that the government should give some security to the patients because after all they are the most important people in the national health service <e>", "<cs> i have also put my name to the amendment <e> <s> i have pleasure in supporting it <e> <s> i know only too well the frustrations of both patients and doctors when patients are ready to go home and cannot do so because the community is not ready to receive them <e>", "<cs> yesterday evening somebody telephoned me and told me that it would take the social services one year to process a patient <e> <s> i thought that to process a patient sounded awful <e> <s> does that mean that a patient must wait in hospital for a year before the social services can carry out that processing which sounds like rather a lot of peas in a tin <e>", "<cs> i have two amendments in this group <e> <s> i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> before the next stage of the bill we shall have to reorganise the groupings as some of the amendments are rather similar <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and a

services <e> <s> there is so much confusion about this issue <e> <s> it is a matter about which i wish to know because we are confused on so many issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister whether he saw the article in <e>", "<cs> the rather strange name which appears on the marshalled list together with the other supporters of this amendment is meant to be mine <e> <s> however as people always seem to get my name wrong i am not surprised that it has happened in this chamber <e>", "<cs> i read the article in <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ennals decides what he will do perhaps i may ask what the government will do if districts stop taking patients from districts other than their own <e>", "<cs> but they are not doing it <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> as the minister has stated the nhs is one of the biggest employers in europe <e> <s> i refer to paragraph f on smoking as an example <e> <s> nurses have won a very bad reputation because they are heavy smokers <e> <s> perhaps the excuse is that they work in a stressful situation <e> <s> however one of the other recommendations is counselling <e> <s> therefore if they are working in a stressful situation counselling should overcome the need to smoke <e> <s> that shows how important it is that nurses should set an example to the many patients they treat <e> <s> if they were doing the right things they could pass on those good practices to the patients under their care <e> <s> that would make us a healthier nation which is what we should be aiming for <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness said that she would re-examine the matter perhaps she will look at the unpopular specialties like alcohol and drugs <e> <s> it is easy for them to be forgotten <e> <s> so that nobody is forgotten can the word including be contained in the provision in the bill so that nothing is omitted <e>", "<cs> i also support the amendment <e> <s> i believe that the amendment standing in my name

criminal record should not run a public house <e> <s> however the rehabilitation of offenders act covers that <e> <s> i was interested when the noble baroness lady faithfull spoke about the children act because children are covered by this legislation and it does not seem to have opened <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment at this point <e> <s> the term low incidence adds yet another complication as has been mentioned by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> the field of disability is so complicated and so wide that nobody understands it very well <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few points that have not yet been mentioned <e> <s> i speak now as president and founder of the spinal injuries association <e> <s> i assure the committee that in every single spinal unit in the country there are acute beds being blocked by patients who cannot go home <e>", "<cs> a point raised by the noble lord lord winstanley has been forgotten it is the serious lack of hospital social workers and occupational therapists working in local authorities as a link <e> <s> there must be that important link between the hospital and the community particularly in respect of housing <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do i should point out that if something is written on the face of the bill it places emphasis on it and it is not then forgotten <e> <s> sometimes people forget matters which are not written on to the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour may not be sure or may not quite know but i certainly know <e> <s> i consider it most extraordinary for consumers and carers to be left out of a decision <e> <s> it looks to me like the age of dickens and forgetting to involve those people who are the most important <e>", "<cs> i thought that the governments whole emphasis was that people should be as responsible for themselves as possible <e> <s> i should be very surprised if the amendment were not accepted <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments <e> <s> i should like to give one example of respite care which has not been mentioned <e> <s> i refer to the carer who is caring day in and day out for someone who is heavy <e> <s> if carers know that they will have a holiday just for a week or two weeks it can make all the difference and enable them to carry on for the rest of the year <e> <s> otherwise relationships can sometimes break <e> <s> i know that relationships break <e> <s> in this case it can be that absence makes the heart grow fonder <e> <s> a stitch in time saves nine <e> <s> it is so important <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak on amendment no <e> <s> zc <e> <s> it has the backing of the crossroads care attendant scheme john grooms association for the disabled and had he been here the noble lord lord swinfen would have spoken alcohol concern and scoda the standing conference on drug abuse <e>", "<cs> i was attracted to the suggestion made by the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> it is important to include voluntary agencies <e> <s> one reason is that it is most important to keep their good will <e> <s> it would be exceedingly expensive for the government if some of these agencies were to go out of business <e> <s> the government would then really be in trouble <e>", "<cs> with the indulgence of the committee i want to try to impress on the noble baroness the importance of this for the drug and the alcohol situation not the disabled <e> <s> they have been linked now with mental health and there are no local authority votes in drugs and alcohol <e> <s> they are exceedingly unpopular <e> <s> you have no idea of the difficulty we have in setting up houses in various towns <e> <s> one needs help over this and not hindrance <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that it is the most difficult field <e> <s> she knows this because she is the minister concerned with drugs <e>", "<cs> i also support this amendment but having taken it through the chamber i did not want to say too much <e> <s> i think it is better that i do not say too much <e> <s> physically handicapped people have to pay the community charge and many of them find that difficult <e> <s> therefore they are even more deserving of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to ask how one undertakes an assessment without taking into consideration a persons views <e> <s> it is most extraordinary <e> <s> i cannot understand it <e> <s> if a person has a view and can express himself and that view is not taken into consideration he is being treated like an animal <e> <s> when one assesses a pig or cow one

should like to ask one question <e> <s> what happens if local authorities do not take notice of the guidance given in the guidance lines <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask a few questions before the minister speaks <e> <s> last weekend in suffolk i attended an engagement which concerned disabled people <e> <s> i met a lady who was extremely disabled <e> <s> she used an electric wheelchair and told me that she had just had her home help cut completely <e> <s> also i live in rural north yorkshire and i know someone with alzheimers disease who is living in a cottage by herself <e> <s> she has no home help because no one will travel to the cottage to clean it <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies is it not a fact that some people who wish to make money out of vulnerable people have groups of small homes with fewer than four residents <e> <s> there is nothing to stop them doing that <e> <s> they may have several homes with or more residents <e> <s> there may be three or four people only in each home and therefore the homes are not registered <e>", "<cs> crossroads care attendance schemes support these amendments <e> <s> they give care to very severely disabled people in their own homes <e> <s> they may have cancer they may be very elderly or have a severe physical disability <e> <s> the care attendants are often married women who have some time on their hands and are able to give a few hours to the scheme <e> <s> they sometimes go to a persons home stay the night put the person to bed at night and get them up in the morning <e> <s> there is lifting involved in that <e> <s> anyone who knows about lifting knows that the person should be properly trained otherwise there may be damage to the back <e> <s> therefore to get these schemes off the ground there needs to be training and very often pump-priming grants <e> <s> there is a danger that those might disappear <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord peston rises to speak perhaps i may say that the minister touched on the most difficult point <e> <s> the voluntary organisations which run the national organisations do not know how to collect the money which they used to receive centrally from different social service departments throughout the country <e> <s> perhaps the minister can give some idea as to what they should do <e> <s> the voluntary organisations including phoenix house and acet which deal with home care for aids say that it will increase their workload by around per cent <e> <s> it is something about which they are extremely concerned <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment <e> <s> however the hospital social worker of for example the supra-regional unit of a specialising unit it may be a spinal unit situated miles from the patients home will surely also be the link with the patients local district <e> <s> i know how hard-pressed social workers are <e> <s> i take stoke mandeville hospital as an example <e> <s> it has something like one and half social workers for the hospital patients who come from a large part of britain <e> <s> therefore it is a most important issue <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i have put my name to the amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether she can give assurances on three points that services will continue for clients with drug and alcohol problems that services will be easily accessible for clients and that choice will be maintained with the flexible use of treatment options <e> <s> treatment is wide and varied <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount rises i should like to say that i wish i had the faith and trust possessed by the minister <e> <s> i know that there are no votes in drug and alcohol abuse <e> <s> it is a most unpopular issue <e> <s> we tried to set up a phoenix house on the south coast <e> <s> we have had great opposition led by the local mayor to setting up a home or treatment centre <e> <s> i could show the minister letters that i have received on this matter as have the organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords if someone is called back for a second smear if the first is not conclusive how long does that person have to wait before she is called back again <e> <s> it can be a worrying period <e>", "<cs> my lords can a calf get bse through the milk of its mother or through the placenta <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of disabled people i should like to thank the noble lord lord ennals for bringing up this matter <e> <s> i have served on a regional health authority for some years <e> <s> i hope that i did not serve on it because i was a disabled person <e> <s> i should want to serve on it because of my interest in all health needs whatever they may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i should like to say that i am still worried <e> <s> universities are places that can look after themselves <e> <s> we are talking of people who cannot look after themselves the very vulnerable those people who cannot speak of their problems because they are embarrassed about them <e> <s> we also have the carers to consider <e> <s> they give up a tremendous amount of time and need guidance and help from people who are experts in the district <e>", "<cs> my lords if a gp cannot send a patient to the consultant of that patients choice and the patient goes to the consultant and hospital that the district says he must go to what happens if an operation goes wrong <e> <s> can the gp and the patient sue the district health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was if the gp has to send the patient to a hospital which is not the hospital of his choice or of the patients choice but is the choice of the district and something goes wrong have the gp and the patient i the right to sue the district for making the wrong decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support this amendment <e> <s> i should like to mention the difficulties of std clinics <e> <s> it is not just a question of the patients who go there but is also a question of the follow-up of contracts of infected people counselling and the work which must be very confidentially carried out <e> <s> how will that be done <e> <s> is it to be done by numbers or initials if the billing is to go to the districts <e> <s> perhaps patients will not want their districts to know about attendance at clinics <e> <s> that is why it is important that we consider the confidentiality aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i think he realises there is concern about this matter because the report has not been made yet <e> <s> therefore something needs to be written into the bill <e> <s> i can assure the house that i am not going to divide it at this moment <e> <s> the subject will be taken away and we shall discuss it <e> <s> it is an enormously important subject <e> <s> it may come back at what i imagine may be a rather long third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords a few weeks ago i was invited to open a splendid new rehabilitation unit at a hospital in swansea <e> <s> i saw self-referral speech therapy in action and thought it a good idea <e> <s> it saves time and the patient does not have to go through a doctor <e> <s> it worked well and if one can save time one is saving money <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to the problems of disabled people <e> <s> there is a scheme called dial-a-ride which disabled people can use <e> <s> however they are not allowed to use it for attending appointments at hospital <e> <s> the reason is that if they did that there would be no dial-a-ride provision for other purposes <e> <s> i am fortunate enough to have a car <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that i am a resident in the riverside health district and that i have attended two of the clinics at the westminster hospital <e> <s> is she further aware that it is worrying for patients to see the stress and pressure on the services <e> <s> does she realise that the medical students need people coming from outside the riverside health district if they are to gain medical achievement and training <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that westminster is a special case because of the many tourists and people who work in that district <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson said that britain would be the only country in the world to have such legislation <e> <s> i believe that britain often does take the lead over such matters and other countries then follow <e> <s> we should be proud of that leadership in seeking to prevent tragic accidents <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson and i beg to differ over protective headgear for young riders <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> is she aware that it has been discouraging for staff at some of our expert units such as liver units when they have not seen the rewards of their work and that they need every encouragement and money to support their much needed units <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is excellent that we have some of the best specialising services which we can offer to other ec countries and that they want to come to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i am not sure whether it is perfect but the feeling of the house is that some kind of provision is required <e> <s> i wish that the minister could have said that she would take it away in order to put a provision in the bill herself <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe my co se is simpler as i am one of five people involved in an amendment <e> <s> it is encouraging that there has been some progress but like other supporters of the amendment i feel that an independent body is needed <e> <s> i shall give the house an example of bad patient access to the national health service which came my way on sunday <e> <s> i was telephoned in yorkshire and told that the access for people in wheelchairs to the sexually transmitted diseases clinic at the westminster hospital had been closed <e> <s> many people who have aids have to use wheelchairs when they are ill because of weakness <e> <s> the route they used to take was by lift but now the only route they have is outside and runs past the morgue <e> <s> how insensitive and uncaring can management become <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments illustrate the real worry and insecurity now surrounding all those people mentioned in them <e> <s> they also illustrate the anxiety of the people running the organisations <e> <s> many people might fall through the net of help <e> <s> therefore i support the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend the minister how long these payments will continue <e> <s> are they just crisis payments or will they go on to the rehabilitation stage <e> <s> will payments be only for nursing homes or will they be for other places <e> <s> otherwise everyone will be taking nursing home status <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say how far further is <e> <s> does it continue as long as it is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment which seeks to protect vulnerable people who may be at risk in nursing homes <e> <s> i wish to ask one question <e> <s> running some of the drug rehabilitation services are certain people with past criminal records <e> <s> would the amendment cause a problem <e> <s> perhaps we might have to have an amendment at the next stage of the bill in order to exempt these people <e>", "<cs> my lords alcohol is a particularly problematical thing <e> <s> so many people enjoy it including many of your lordships <e> <s> sadly with alcohol some people fall by the wayside and become very ill <e> <s> they do not just get drunk and have a hangover they become ill their livers pack up and eventually they die <e> <s> however before that happens the problem can cause the break-up of many families <e> <s> alcoholism is perhaps one of the biggest causes of family break-up that is known <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> i do not see the point in giving an attendance allowance to a severely disabled person if it is to be taxed by a means test <e> <s> i wish to bring to your lordships attention two cases of young men each of whom broke his neck <e> <s> one is the son of a late member of your lordships house who broke his neck while playing rugby <e> <s> he is a doctor <e> <s> that young man may be means-tested in respect of the costs of care which could take away all the incentive to make an effort to carry on with his job <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to support this amendment <e> <s> i am told that subparagraph ii incorporates physically disabled people <e> <s> i have a whole file at home from a surgeon in newcastle-upon-tyne who has had difficulty in getting his patients back home <e> <s> his acute beds are being blocked and although some of the local authority housing departments are very good some are only middling and others are totally hopeless <e> <s> his health authority will not employ an occupational therapist to help and advise the housing authorities and there is a shortage of hospital social workers <e> <s> this amendment might help to encourage more hospital social workers and occupational therapists to help to get people home <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the whole point of the community charge having to be paid by disabled people was that they would then be able to decide whether they were getting the kind of services that they wanted from their local authorities <e> <s> i understood that that was the argument when we debated this matter in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords who have spoken and the minister for trying to explain the provisions <e> <s> this is a complicated matter <e> <s> the government have put down amendment no <e> <s> a and as the voluntary organisations are extremely worried about the matter the best thing to do at this stage is to take the amendment away and consider it <e> <s> many noble lords have amendments on assessment so perhaps we could get together before the third reading and see whether some more satisfactory wording can be found <e> <s> it is important to be clear <e> <s> at the moment voluntary organisations are not clear about the position nor are local authorities <e> <s> the noble baroness spoke about communication problems <e> <s> perhaps some exist and that is the reason we want a provision written into the bill to clarify the position <e> <s> therefore at this stage i shall withdraw the amendment and perhaps bring it back later <e>", "<cs> my lords this provision was accepted by both houses of parliament in <e> <s> if the assessment had been implemented we should not be so concerned now <e> <s> there is also concern about the type of assessment <e> <s> as has been illustrated by the noble baroness lady seear many people think the government are taking a backward step in the present legislation in trying to involve carers <e> <s> if at all possible the person who is being assessed needs to be able to put his or her own views forward otherwise we shall be taking a backward step <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down can she say whether that situation is the exact opposite from the situation that will exist in the health service <e> <s> will that not cause great confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this very important amendment <e> <s> the choice of the kind of respite care is very important <e> <s> the problem of the aids tragedy has shown the need for respite care <e> <s> in fact some of the services now provided for aids patients are better than those available for people with many other types of disability <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down would that mean that local authorities would still be accountable <e> <s> if the scheme was not working they could stop it <e> <s> surely they would still be accountable for the money <e>", "<cs> my lords my scottish blood advises me to support the amendment <e> <s> with so much change and the need for accountability it seems wise and useful to have an inspectorate <e> <s> an inspectorate can advise and pinpoint needs <e> <s> it can prevent money being wasted and encourage people when they are doing a good job <e> <s> i should like to ask why scotland has not had an inspectorate during all these years <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down finally perhaps i may ask him whether the white paper is going to be a kind of working reference for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems very sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister and i accept her amendment <e> <s> i just wish that the governement had been able to take a few more of our amendments away and do the same with them <e> <s> we should then have saved a lot of time and made a lot of people outside this house much more confident and happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> alcohol and drugs have been linked with mental illness <e> <s> responsibility is now being moved to local authorities <e> <s> as i said previously unless special safeguards are implemented there will remain considerable misgivings about the move <e> <s> therefore the amendment is most important <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i wish to ask a question <e> <s> if the money is not specially linked to alcohol and drug problems how can the government give the assurance that it will be spent on those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it was decided to limit the offence to causing or permitting a child to ride on a road without protective headgear because of the great difficulties of enforcing a requirement to wear protective headgear on private land unless the police were given power of entry to private land <e> <s> however that was considered unacceptable <e>", "<cs> may i answer the argument of my noble friend lord monson that if a parent makes it a condition that a year-old can ride if their helmet is done up and the child breaks that condition how can the parent be held responsible <e> <s> they have not permitted the child to ride in this way and therefore they would not be penalised <e> <s> this amendment would make the regulations on how the headgear should be worn applicable only to the under-s <e> <s> this means that although the to year-olds would have to have a correct hat with them they could wear it on their elbow or anywhere else if they so wished <e> <s> this amendment therefore essentially reduces the age limit to <e>", "<cs> on the advice of parliamentary counsel it was decided in another place that it would be desirable to have owner on the face of the bill in order to avoid any misunderstandings <e> <s> an owner who has caused or permitted a child to ride without the correct headgear will be liable to prosecution whether or not this amendment is accepted <e> <s> for the sake of clarity therefore i urge noble lords to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that was the advice of counsel <e> <s> this bill has the full backing of the ministry of transport and the government <e>", "<cs> as in similar legislation on the wearing of seat belts we have to be very clear about setting an age limit <e> <s> the amendment would effectively limit the bill to any child who appeared to be <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to remove the protection provided by the bill from any child simply because he or she appeared to be older than their years <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord airedale will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> the requirement on the secretary of state to consult before making the regulations is chiefly to discover whether there should be any exemptions upon religious grounds or in particular circumstances <e> <s> it is also to receive advice on what the required standard or standards of headgear should be for example whether cycle helmets should be included <e>", "<cs> that is a consideration <e>", "<cs> i should like to put on record that nobody should ride a foal but some people do remarkably stupid things <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does so perhaps i could say that the reason foal appears is that nobody wants anyone to ride a foal <e> <s> that is obvious <e> <s> but the definition of foal is very vague and nobody knows when a foal is not a foal <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> when does a foal become a young horse <e> <s> foal appears because the definition is vague <e>", "<cs> my lords as the national health service is funded from taxpayers money it seems right that they should know how the money is spent <e> <s> will trust hospital meetings be open to the public <e> <s> they again are funded from taxpayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> there is anxiety and that has arisen because these projects are funded by social security <e> <s> there is to be a changeover <e> <s> it is as regards that changeover that there needs to be some security <e>", "<cs> my lords if accountability is the stumbling block of this amendment it does not seem a strong argument as it would be the choice of the local authority to allocate funds in this way <e> <s> if they found that the system did not work they could discontinue direct funding and provide care in a different form <e> <s> the amendment just gives the local authority some flexibility and as my noble friend lady darcy said it gives the disabled person the chance to be more responsible for his own life <e>", "<cs> my lords during the passage of the bill several of us have struggled to add more customer participation <e> <s> perhaps we should have been more successful if a few more members from all parts of the house had had the energy and interest to stay after their usual going home time <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord monson has taken the wording from the legislation on child seat belts <e> <s> however that act was framed in a very different way to this bill <e> <s> the act provided for an absolute offence of carrying a child in a car when the latter was not wearing a restraint and where a suitable restraint was available <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage to save the time of the house i should like to put forward a proposition which may please my noble friend lord monson <e> <s> having given thought to foals and zebras perhaps i could bring back an amendment at third reading to include the definition used in the farriers registration act which would be comprehensive <e> <s> the definition reads <e>", "<cs> my lords some of your lordships may know that the bill as printed on th january included a defence of due diligence <e> <s> it was decided in another place to remove that clause as it was unnecessary <e> <s> an attempt was made at some time to introduce an amendment with the same effect <e> <s> it was not accepted but the minister responsible for roads and traffic agreed to re-examine it and to arrange for its reintroduction in your lordships house if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment goes over the ground that we covered in committee and on report <e> <s> it may be too much to hope that my arguments on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord airedale have made my noble friend lord monson realise that this defence is also unnecessary because of the use of the words cause or permit <e> <s> let me repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> permitting necessarily involves some mental requirement in relation to the childs use of the horse <e> <s> a person does not cause or permit an action which it is out of his power to prevent whether or not he has custody of his horse at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the question from the noble lord lord kilbracken about the word any the provision still makes sense without it <e> <s> i commend the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how many specially-trained sniffer dogs are used in the detection of drugs and whether some of the money can be spent on training more of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> but is he aware that because there have been so many changes recently to the <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens if a hospital trust gets into difficulty <e> <s> what will then be the role of the community health council <e>", "<cs> i thank those members of the committee who have spoken on the amendment <e> <s> however as it is late i think it is best not to try to do too much at this moment although many people outside this chamber are concerned about the growing effects of alcohol on children and young people <e> <s> this matter constitutes a far bigger problem in the north than in the south <e> <s> in the south drug abuse is a bigger problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are some excellent care models in london for aids sufferers many of whom are helped by volunteers but that there is a lack of facilities outside london <e> <s> can she do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be possible automatically and routinely to test everyone who comes into hospital or who works in a hospital <e> <s> could not a patient be infected by a surgeon who might be hiv infected and who cut himself whose blood gets into the patients wound <e> <s> all those people should be tested <e>", "<cs> my lords if these cases are taken to court can the minister say how much the cost will be to the health service in legal costs and in medical time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some useful transcribing is being done in some of our prisons for example wakefield <e> <s> will she see that that work is extended because it helps the rehabilitation of prisoners as well as helping the blind <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness know how many acute surgical beds are being blocked by disabled people who may for example have had an amputation or have a broken back and have to use a wheelchair and who must remain blocking those acute beds because there is no suitable housing for them to which they can be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords will the community health councils have the same rights in visiting trust hospitals as they do for non-trust hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that rather short reply <e> <s> is he aware that petty crime is on the increase and if so will the home office undertake some research into the problem <e> <s> uncontrolled car-boot sales could be a very convenient way to get rid of garden tools workmens tools videos and other such goods which are stolen <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that on thirsk racecourse each sunday there is a car-boot sale which seems to attract the attendance of more people than a race meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on monday i spoke with an orthopaedic surgeon who told me that at westminster hospital and other london hospitals it is possible to operate only on emergencies <e> <s> if that is so will the condition of other patients not deteriorate <e> <s> also is that not a waste of expensive surgeons operating time when they are twiddling
