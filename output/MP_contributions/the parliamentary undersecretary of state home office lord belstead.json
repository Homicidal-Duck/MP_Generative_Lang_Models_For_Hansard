["<cs> my lords at the conclusion of this days debate on the gracious speech your lordships have debated two priorities which affect everyone every man or woman or family in this country first how to restore our countrys economic prosperity and secondly how to make this county a safe and happier place in which to live <e>", "<cs> my lords the government intend to ask parliament to approve the draft order for the repeal of the wales act in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords where a mentally-ill passenger has to be detained arrangements are normally made for his admission to hospital <e> <s> where detention in prison is unavoidable the need for medical treatment is taken into account when allocating the detainee <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor made it clear in the debate on the address that the government are concerned about the length of time persons spend waiting for their cases to be heard in the courts <e> <s> the home office makes every effort to keep to the minimum the time spent in prison by persons awaiting a decision on whether they are to be deported <e>", "<cs> my lords i have placed in the library of the house a copy of the <e>", "<cs> my lords discussions have for a considerable time been in progress between the home office and the brewers society and licensed trade organisations about a possible scheme for disposing of the funds <e> <s> we are now waiting for those bodies to approach us with modified proposals as a basis for further discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords while the government regret that a large number of united kingdom electors did not vote in this first election of representatives to the european parliament they are satisfied that the results fairly reflect the opinion of the electorate as expressed through our traditional electoral system <e>", "<cs> my lords the government announced during the statement on the disturbances at southall made on th june that a review of the public order act and related legislation was to be undertaken <e> <s> the adequacy of the powers for the preservation of public order during processions is a matter to which the government attach importance and it will certainly form part of that review <e>", "<cs> my lords the government see a continuing role for the equal opportunities commission however our detailed policies regarding the commissions work are being worked out <e>", "<cs> my lords the law on criminal libel is currently under review by the law commission <e> <s> although the speech of the noble and learned lord lord diplock in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to make a personal statement <e> <s> on th july in the exchanges which followed the question by my noble friend lord donegall about the equal opportunities commission i told your lordships that the commission had a total staff of <e> <s> i regret that in saying that i misled your lordships <e> <s> i find on further inquiry that while the commission has an authorised complement of the number of staff currently employed by the commission is <e> <s> i should like to apologise to your lordships and in particular to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby who asked about the commissions staff <e>", "<cs> my lords revised proposals have been received from the brewers society and have been <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the gaming board is responsible for keeping under review the extent and character of gaming in great britain <e> <s> the board also has certain functions in relation to lotteries <e> <s> it has no responsibility for horseracing and will not be involved in any way in the proposed horseracing advisory council <e> <s> my honourable friend the under-secretary of state for the environment in referring to the proposal that this new body should be set up by st january inadvertently mentioned the gaming board but this was an error and he has asked me to apologise to anyone who was misled <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary will very soon be presenting a white paper containing proposals for changes in the immigration rules <e> <s> the government do not believe that these proposals will contravene our international obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word from this bench <e> <s> the noble lord did not bore me at all but he has mystified me slightly <e> <s> on monday in this house i was asked a question by the noble lord and as i understood it he was seeking an assurance that gaming and the gaming board were in no way related to horse racing <e> <s> here we are having enjoyed some minutes of the noble lord in which he has been at pains to show that on a gaming bill it is appropriate to talk about betting and the levy board <e> <s> however i leave that on one side <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not retreating from the general spirit of that commitment but it was also made plain in the conservative partys manifesto that there would be changes in the law governing the entry of husbands and male fiancs <e> <s> this inevitably means some difference in treatment as regards the right of a woman to be joined here by her husband or fianc <e> <s> we believe that this is justified to prevent abuse of the present system by men using marriage as a means of immigration to this country <e> <s> these are matters for the immigration rules and we shall not wait for our nationality bill to implement our proposals on them <e>", "<cs> my lords interference with sporting activities may infringe a number of provisions of the criminal law <e> <s> my right honourable friend knows of no present need to strengthen the law in this area <e> <s> the prevention of disorder at individual events is a matter for the chief officer of police concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the powers of criminal courts act was deliberately framed following a recommendation of the advisory council on the penal system so that the initiative in considering the question of compensation should rest with the court and not be left to an application by the victim <e> <s> it remains the right of the victim however to make application to the criminal court for compensation or to institute civil proceedings against the offender if he so wishes <e> <s> we have no evidence to indicate that the criminal courts are failing to make compensation orders in appropriate cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this short bill and the related agreement between the governments of the united kingdom and the isle of man on customs and excise and associated matters represent the outcome of several months of formal negotiations between our two governments on the establishment of an isle of man customs and excise service <e> <s> the customs and excise arrangement between the united kingdom and the isle of man typifies the longstanding and close co-operation that exists between our two territories on matters of common interest <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time that either house of parliament has had the opportunity to debate the report of the may committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we are taking a careful look at home defence arrangements to determine what improvements it may be possible to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for a police negotiating board for the united kingdom in place of the police council for the united kingdom <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to change the statutory basis under which police forces are maintained <e> <s> in particular the government have no intention of setting up a national police force <e>", "<cs> my lords special <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first occasion that the house has had the advantage of a speech from the noble lord lord strauss <e> <s> with his great parliamentary knowledge and added to that his knowledge in this area of theatre censorship the noble lord made a speech of such quality that i know your lordships would wish me to add my voice in saying that we hope the noble lord is going to be with us for many years and that it will not be very long before he will be speaking to us again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords mr reyes a refugee from chile accepted in panama was arrested by the panamanian authorities and placed on a plane to the united kingdom with which country he has no connection against his wishes and without proper documentation <e> <s> this situation required and still requires careful inquiry <e> <s> by th december sufficient information was available to justify mr reyes release from custody and temporary admission <e> <s> the principal obligation under the united nations convention on refugees is to protect refugees from refoulement and there is no question of our sending mr reyes to chile <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend lord inglewood that justice on all occasions should be done to special constables who fulfil such a valuable role in helping to keep law and order in this country <e> <s> i also agree with my noble friend that the situation with regard to the special constabulary at the moment gives rise to considerable concern <e> <s> i think this was very much in the forefront of the mind of the noble lord lord boston when he said quite rightly that my noble friend had done a service in making some pretty trenchant comments on this subject last week and again today in moving these amendments <e> <s> but i do not think that the way to assist the special constabulary is to move these amendments into the bill <e> <s> i should like to explain very briefly why that is so and then i should like to respond if i may to both noble lords by trying to make some constructive conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for a long reply to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> on th january my right honourable friend the home secretary made the following announcement in reply to a question in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the firearms legislation provides for the chief officer of police to decide what conditions should be attached to a firearms dealers registration certificate including specific conditions relating to security <e> <s> it requires that a register is kept of all transactions and that within the united kingdom arms are sold or transferred only to someone authorised under the act to take possession <e> <s> authority from the secretary of state is required by anyone wishing to deal in prohibited weapons such as machine guns and tear gas weapons conditions relating to security and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express gratitude to the noble lord for the thanks which he has given to my noble lords and also to the home office for the work which we have been glad to do with the noble lord on this bill <e> <s> this bill of course is sponsored by the noble lord and is in every sense his bill <e> <s> if i may say so i shall watch with great interest its further progress in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords on st december the latest date for which this information is readily available there were persons detained in prisons under the provisions of the immigration act <e> <s> as the breakdown requested is in the form of a table i shall with permission circulate it in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have the opportunity to add a <e>", "<cs> my lords approximately replies have been received to the consultative document issued by the previous government and an analysis of these will be published <e> <s> they agree in showing that the voluntary sector while safeguarding its independence favours working more closely with government at all levels but also show considerable diversity of view about detailed matters <e> <s> while they provide a valuable starting point they do not afford and were not intended to provide the basis for a programme of action <e> <s> meanwhile the government are studying how within the present constraints we can further encourage the voluntary sectors invaluable contribution to social welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is being held at a time when the reality of the threat to the western alliance is uppermost in our minds and i am grateful to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for initiating a debate on matters which require the attention of parliament <e> <s> indeed this debate has attracted as speakers a long list of your lordships who have first-hand experience of the many matters which fall within the scope of the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no specific plans to introduce in england and wales a unit similar to the special unit at barlinnie prison in glasgow <e> <s> i understand that there are no plans to establish such a unit in northern ireland or to set up additional units on similar lines in scotland <e> <s> we are taking a close interest in the barlinnie experiment and have arranged for senior home office officials to visit barlinnie shortly <e>", "<cs> as i understand it my noble friend is absolutely right and the reference ought to be to section la <e> <s> however from a drafting point of view i am not quite sure whether it is right as my noble friend contends that that is how it should be printed or whether the way in which it is printed at <e>", "<cs> my lords as the information requested has to be in the form of a statistical table i shall with permission circulate it in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury has sought to persuade the house to disapprove the changes in the immigration rules which my right honourable friend the home secretary has laid before parliament <e> <s> this is not the first time that the noble lord has brought this matter before your lordships <e> <s> on the th december last we debated the white paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords the government hope to be able to make an announcement soon after the easter recess <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the minister of state has had discussions with the trade and other interests and good progress is being made in reaching decisions on how the funds might be wound up and the proceeds disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments expenditure plans published on th march cmnd <e> <s> did not assume any reduction in the level of expenditure on discretionary awards over the period to <e> <s> they provided furthermore for a growth in the provision for home students in non-advanced further education <e> <s> our estimate is that this should permit a per cent <e> <s> increase in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the information requested is not available <e> <s> the number of overseas students given leave to enter the united kingdom in for studies of all kinds is given by nationality and citizenship in the annual publication of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness for her clear explanation of this bill and of course we are also indebted to my honourable friend mr trotter for piloting the bill through another place so that it now reaches your lordships house <e> <s> fundamentally this bill is in two parts <e> <s> clause deals with applications to the justices for extensions of the range of liquor that may be sold under an on-licence <e> <s> without going into detail we have followed the noble baroness in the explanation which she has given to the house and the reference to this is section of the act as to how this has caused particular problems so far as wine bars are concerned <e> <s> in saying that i do not think that in many cases it is the fault of wine bars <e> <s> indeed it leads to the unfortunate effect that licensing justices may look askance at some of the perfectly genuine applications from wine bars fearful that the owner of the licence for a wine bar can then under section have the power to come back and demand that the licence be upgraded in the way that the noble baroness explained <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science and my noble friend the minister of state have made clear all written representations received on this matter will be given full consideration in the course of the internal government examination <e>", "<cs> my lords the immigration act provides that a person recommended for deportation by a court is to be detained pending the making of a deportation order unless the court or the home secretary directs that he be released <e> <s> the court gave no such direction in mrs de-silvas case nor did my right honourable friend the home secretary feel able to release her <e> <s> she had pleaded guilty to four charges of theft and to working in breach of her conditions in spite of having earlier given an explicit undertaking to the home office that she would continue to comply with the conditions attached to her stay here <e> <s> a deportation order was made against her on th may and she left the country three days later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hooson for asking this unstarred question this evening because he has expressed concern about the publication of the white paper on st april by my right honourable friend the home secretary and i believe that i can meet many of the points of concern which the noble lord has expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to say that the principal issue which is before us this evening and i am grateful to the noble lord lord avebury for raising this matter in the form of his private members bill is whether or not a prostitute who solicits in the street or in a public place should be liable to be imprisoned <e> <s> that is really what we are talking about <e> <s> it is an issue which as your lordships are aware has been considered by two substantial bodies in the last years or so the wolfenden committee in and then the working party on vagrancy and street offences in <e>", "<cs> may i just say from this bench that for reasons which i sought to explain on the second reading of the noble baronesss bill the government entirely recognise that section creates an anomaly and therefore if this bill as i very much hope goes through your lordships house the government would not wish the coming into force of the provisions of clause to be delayed and accordingly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft pool competitions act continuance order be approved <e> <s> it may be helpful if i refer briefly to the act which the draft order is to renew if your lordships agree to this order <e>", "<cs> my lords the government accept the need for a change in the law but wish to take account of the law commissions forthcoming report on the law of attempt as well as the select committees report and the public response to these reports before deciding how best to reform the law while ensuring adequate protection for the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments aim is to improve racial harmony and reduce tensions by every possible means <e> <s> the careful choice of language has a contribution to make but the government believe that an understanding of the fundamental problems which give rise to such tensions is much more important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it is right that the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington should have asked this question today because many of the problems affecting remand prisoners in england and wales to which because of the responsibility of my right honourable friend the home secretary i shall confine my remarks which were highlighted by the may report are a symptom of the problems which affect sentenced and unsentenced prisoners alike <e>", "<cs> my lords the treaty of rome specifies that although it is for the european parliament to draw up proposals for a uniform electoral procedure these cannot take effect until they have been approved unanimously by the council of ministers and adopted by member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements <e> <s> parliament will therefore have ample opportunity to consider this matter when legislation is introduced to incorporate the european parliaments proposals into our own electoral law <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely sure that the government spokesman on these amendments and on the amendments which we are now coming to will be able to shed very much light compared with his colleagues on the government bench <e> <s> but at least this spokesman can spread a little happiness because i have great pleasure in accepting the amendment moved by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the additional payments to the nearest million made by the programme contractors under section of the independent broadcasting authority act as examined by the comptroller and auditor general were as follows for the years onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the parliamentary boundary commissions for england scotland and northern ireland are likely to have completed their tasks of reviewing parliamentary constituencies by early <e> <s> the commisson for wales has not yet begun its general review but is expected to do so shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords when the committee on the future of broadcasting under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord annan published its report in march the noble lord and members of his committee may have reflected upon the length of time which is very often needed for recommendations to turn into action <e> <s> if your lordships look at the instructions which are to be found on a packet of asparagus seed you will find the words first dig a trench five years ago and many a government committee has waited a good deal longer than that for something to happen <e> <s> to be fair the three years since the annan <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to the general law and the bbcs royal charter and licence and agreement it is for the corporation to determine the content of its programme services <e> <s> this is not a matter in which the government should seek to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision made in the supply estimates for the equal opportunities commission in the present financial year is the same in real terms as the revised estimated expenditure of the commission for <e> <s> this represents a significant reduction compared with the expenditure planned for that year <e> <s> in common with other government departments the commission has been asked to accommodate the cost of the recent civil service pay settlement within the published limits by reducing its staff complement <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the european commission of human rights has not yet reported on various applications before it about the restrictions on correspondence to and from prisoners in england and wales <e> <s> we have been discussing these cases with the commission and we are considering changes in the regulations on prisoners correspondence <e> <s> at this stage it would be premature to publish details <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the four parliamentary boundary commissions are independent statutory bodies and the government have no power to intervene in the conduct of their reviews <e>", "<cs> my lords the proceedings to which the noble lord refers were instituted on a friendly basis and the government are considering the judgment in the same spirit but we need time for this consideration <e> <s> it is too soon for us to be able to answer specific questions about the next steps <e>", "<cs> my lords the broadcasting authorities are responsible for the content of their programmes <e> <s> it is for them to decide what programmes to broadcast and it would be contrary to long-established practice endorsed by successive governments for ministers to seek to influence their decisions <e> <s> it is therefore for the bbc alone to decide whether to show the war game on their television programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in his speech spoke briefly about the roots of the dispute which have led to the industrial action that is now being taken by prison officers and many of your lordships with considerable experience in one way or another of the prison system of this country have with one accord recognised the difficult and sometimes dangerous work that prison officers are asked to do and over the years they do it <e> <s> i should like to join other noble lords who have spoken in that vein by saying that having previously known nothing about it over the last year or so i have at least tried to learn something of the very demanding work that prison officers do <e>", "<cs> my lords the annual report of the commission for racial equality covers a great deal of ground <e> <s> it is not practicable to deal with all the criticisms and proposals in it some of which are in very general terms within the scope of an oral reply <e> <s> but my right honourable friend the home secretary has carefully noted the contents of the report and the government are in close and regular contact with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords in england and wales the decision whether to prosecute in respect of an alleged criminal offence is a matter for the chief officer of police concerned having regard to all the circumstances of the case <e> <s> he may decide to take no further action if he considers that appropriate or particularly where the suspect is elderly and admits the offence to dispose of the case by way of a formal caution rather than prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords since i replied to a starred question by the noble lord lord bruce of donington on th october i have had the benefit of a further detailed report from the chief constable of sussex <e> <s> i have had an opportunity therefore to go into the matter in greater detail <e> <s> it will perhaps help if i begin replying to the noble lord by describing the events as they have been reported to me by the chief constable
