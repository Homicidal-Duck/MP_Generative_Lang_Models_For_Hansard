["<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord northfield on his bill and to give him my assurance that i shall in no way hinder the bill or put forward any form of amendment <e> <s> i had two small questions for him one of which has already been asked by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley which concerned the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely saying that if a gang of three or four armed poachers have a range rover in which to take the deer away it may be worth or more and if an old man such as a gamekeeper discovers them in the act of poaching they may possibly commit murder rather than have their range rover taken away <e> <s> i put that forward as a possible occurrence <e> <s> the fine is a considerable fine <e> <s> it does not affect the bill it is just a possible side effect <e> <s> apart from that i think that the bill is excellent and i entirely support it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the way that i read it i merely wanted confirmation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should begin by declaring a slight interest in that i too have put gloves on and gone into the ring but that was many years ago <e> <s> perhaps it would be a good idea when regarding the bill if we retained a sense of balance proportion and logic and looked at the legal aspects a little more closely <e> <s> the bill refers to any person who organises boxing for profit <e> <s> i do not know the legal definition of profit but the dictionary says it means for gain <e> <s> if a charity organises say a dinner at the national sporting club or the grosvenor house and two professional boxers agree to give an exhibition bout in aid of the charity it is undoubtedly being run for profit <e> <s> would that be illegal <e> <s> personally i think it might not be legal <e> <s> there is also the question of whether or not it affects amateurs because the word profit does not necessarily mean monetary gain <e> <s> it means gain something to your benefit and perhaps benefit and gain could include not only a cup or a shield but also the prestige that you bring to your school when one school is boxing against another or if there are two institutions boxing against each other <e>"]
