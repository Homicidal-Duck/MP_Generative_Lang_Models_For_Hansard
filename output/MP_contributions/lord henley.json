["<cs> my lords i must ask for your indulgence doubly this afternoon not merely because i am making my maiden speech but also because i feel somewhat outranked <e> <s> this afternoon you have already heard or will be listening later to admirals major generals field marshals chiefs of staff even company sergeant majors to mention but a few <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not quite so exalted <e> <s> in fact when i took my seat a little over a year ago i believe i was the only serving private soldier in the house <e> <s> i was at the time a member of the honourable artillery company which is as i hope many of your lordships will know a regiment in the territorial and army volunteer reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for giving us the opportunity to discuss the various problems which beset the national health service <e> <s> many of those who have spoken can justly claim to be experts on the subject of the health service and i especially wish to include the two maiden speakers whom i join other speakers in congratulating <e> <s> i am afraid i have no expertise at all and i can only speak from my own recent personal experiences as a patient under the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak only on one very small matter and i hope that i shall not detain your lordships for more than a minute or so <e> <s> i want to ask the government about the pamphlet called <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise this afternoon to make two brief points <e> <s> first i wish to draw your lordships attention to an excellent booklet entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i will if i may bring the debate a little nearer home in fact right back to the palace of westminster and to the heating here which in my humble opinion is quite excessive <e> <s> a little remembrance of matthew chapter vii verses <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend walked a little faster my lords i think he might be warmer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the slaughtering industry is very worried that if there is a delay between the date of the beginning of the new price guarantee scheme and its actual implementation it might cause severe disruption to the amount of lamb being sent for slaughter <e>", "<cs> my lords i was intending to speak to the proposals set out in clause which allow for charges to be made for applications for planning permission <e> <s> you will be very pleased to hear that many people have already dealt with this far better than myself notably the noble baroness lady stedman the noble lords lord beaumont of whitley and lord underhill and my noble friends lord middleton and lord morris <e> <s> there is one exception <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson felt that clause could be justifiable as a modest form of capital gains tax on the increased value of a building due to a grant of planning permission <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to interrupt him here <e> <s> it is for the hope of worth of development it is not for <e> <s> there is a very big distinction in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to this on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble kinsman for that answer <e> <s> may i ask him to take it a little further and ask the secretary of state to consider calling in the application for detailed planning permission for the redevelopment of the site in view of the considerable public interest in the area and in view of the fact that the new plans include at ft office block and the destruction of the existing mediaeval street pattern <e> <s> also will he stress to the secretary of state the importance of calling this in so that the matter may be considered by a impartial tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill has been promoted by the epsom and ewell district council which is the local authority which covers epsom and walton downs <e> <s> this bill deals with those downs and it is necessary owing to the provisions of section of the local government act which causes the existing legislation the epsom and walton downs regulation act to lapse at the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can say how many jobs would be involved <e> <s> i certainly do not have the exact figure <e> <s> there are about horses in training and that will give some idea because quite a lot of people are needed to look after that number of horses <e> <s> again this is a matter of detailed evidence and i think it is the job of the select committee to look into that rather than for it to be dealt with on second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords we have spent almost two hours discussing epsom downs which i think is quite a good run for a private bill of this nature <e> <s> in view of the fact that everyone is in agreement that the bill should be given a second reading i feel that it is unnecessary for me again to go over any of the ground <e> <s> therefore i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had quite a useful debate and i am very grateful that the bill has had general support <e> <s> i do not intend to delay the house very long <e> <s> i know that some noble lords i am thinking particularly of the noble lord lord underhill have been here since pm <e> <s> probably he is in need of dinner certainly i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the amendment is necessary <e> <s> clause of the bill dealing with interpretation provides that <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment has caused us to look again at the defence contained in clause <e> <s> i am grateful to him for making us look again at the drafting <e> <s> our examination has shown that the subsection could be improved <e> <s> any vehicular use of a cycle track to gain access to property must be based on a clear legal authority so to use the cycle track <e> <s> to use a cycle track to gain access to property even if it is the sole reasonable means of vehicular access may involve unlawful use of the cycle track <e> <s> clearly it would be wrong to condone as the present drafting of the subsection appears to do such unlawful use <e>", "<cs> this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> deal with clause <e> <s> the clause was inserted in another place following discussions between my honourable friend mr cecil franks and both the nfu and the cla <e> <s> it is intended to provide protection for agricultural activities when footpaths cross agricultural land <e> <s> the term agricultural land is defined <e> <s> my noble friend talks about the case where a footpath goes adjacent to a field between two hedges <e> <s> that would not be covered by agricultural land and would therefore be dealt with under the ordinary procedure in other words the landowner himself would not have the total veto that he has if it crosses right across the middle of agricultural land <e> <s> but he would have exactly the same power as anyone else to object and the matter could then be dealt with at a public inquiry <e> <s> in view of that i think it will be found that the owner of that agricultural land will be perfectly well protected in fact probably better protected than he is at the moment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is worrying too much <e> <s> it is only the owner of agricultural land who has a right to object to the conversion of a footpath to a cycle track <e> <s> it can still continue to be a footpath <e>", "<cs> if the amendment is carried <e> <s> i hope it will not be <e> <s> my noble friends amendment seeks to extend to forestry and moorland this protection which as i said at the moment is only for agricultural land <e> <s> we feel this is a very significant extension of that protection <e> <s> i think it is very unlikely that there will be many cases of footpath conversions on forestry or moorland <e> <s> if there are the introduction of cyclists will be unlikely to cause any significant extra disruption in the uses of footpaths <e> <s> it may also be rather difficult to establish exactly what consititutes forestry and moorland <e> <s> the subsection defines agricultural land which is fairly easy to define <e>", "<cs> my noble friends seventh amendment proposes to amend clause <e> <s> it is novel in that it seeks to give to the high court powers to specify advertisements and works to be undertaken to give effect to its quashing of an order <e> <s> i know of no other circumstances in which such powers are given to the court <e> <s> if the court quashes an order the footpath concerned will remain a footpath and it is the local highway authority s duty to ensure that the rights of those using the footpath are protected <e> <s> it would be an exceptional move to give the high court power to take action either by insisting on advertisements or on the undertaking of specified works to enforce one of its own decisions <e>", "<cs> yes obviously there will be some sign indicating that every cycle track is a cycle track <e> <s> if it ceases to be a cycle track there will no longer be any signs stating that it is a cycle track and it will revert to being a footpath <e>", "<cs> in the drafting and consideration of this bill the concerns of groups representing the blind and the partially sighted have received our closest consideration <e> <s> my honourable friend mr cecil franks <e>", "<cs> yes it does <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it damage under clause concerns damage by reason of the execution of the works <e> <s> in other words it is the actual creation of the works <e> <s> i presume i am open to be corrected and will inform the noble baroness when i know that that would cover any financial loss that one could put against the execution of the works <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> it identifies a clear need to correct the drafting of the bill <e> <s> once a footpath has been converted to a cycle track steps have to be taken by those responsible for the cycle track to ensure that it will be capable of use by cyclists for example a suitable surface will be required and it will need to be properly maintained <e> <s> some expenditure would then clearly be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friend lord long wishes to comment on the noble lords amendment and so i shall not detain your lordships for long <e> <s> for my part i am concerned that this is a substantial amendment and it moves us some way from the basic objectives of the bill which are to prevent motor vehicles from using cycle tracks to simplify the procedures for converting a footpath to a cycle track and to give the highway authorities power to erect barriers on cycle tracks and undertake other works <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fairly confident in saying to the noble lord that they are not offences if bicycles or tricycles are being pushed <e> <s> i should not like to say that categorically <e> <s> if i may take advice on that i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have had the benefit of discussing these two amendments of the noble lord lord beaumont with my noble friend lord long and i know that he wishes to discuss them in some detail <e> <s> for myself i fully accept the concern which has led the noble lord to move these amendments <e> <s> i certainly do not think we have ignored the points in question in the drafting of the bill <e> <s> if anything i think the position of the blind and the partially-sighted is strengthened by the various safeguards which have been put in before the creation of any new cycle track <e> <s> we also feel that adequate steps must be taken to increase the safety and convenience of cyclists and that a balance between their interests and the interests of other people must be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down can he confirm for my own benefit and probably for others that the existing voluntary arrangements will continue in effect for some considerable time certainly until the new regulations are brought into force if this bill is enacted <e>", "<cs> following on from the noble lord lord walston i should like to ask whether this <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i apologise again for putting this amendment down so late <e> <s> i see his point that the parliamentary draftsmen have not had time to look at it <e> <s> i was about to say that i am not a lawyer i am but i have forgotten all the law that i knew <e> <s> i have looked at the amendment and i suspect there may be one or two things wrong with it but i am sure we shall be able to sort them out <e> <s> on that assurance from my noble friend i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may add a few words to assure the government that not everyone on these benches is in favour of this amendment <e> <s> i certainly hope that the government will not accept it and that the house in general will reject it <e> <s> we have spent a long time six days in committee and now three on report discussing the principles of the bill <e> <s> as i think my noble friend lord nugent of guildford said this amendment seems to be bringing cross-subsidy principles in by the back-door <e> <s> on top of that i am not sure that as drafted the amendment would achieve what it sets out to achieve <e> <s> the drafting is thoroughly suspect i imagine <e> <s> for those reasons i hope that the house will reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord brabazon for this amendment <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for introducing it <e> <s> if i may say a word on behalf of post offices i am sure that they will be most grateful too <e> <s> this amendment will go a considerable way to helping them bring more business into their offices and to maintain their network i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether he does not agree that the paramount way of allocating places in schools should be a question of parental choice <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer and especially for what he said about <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that there are some places i was thinking particularly of hadrians wall parts of which the department looks after which are getting far too many visitors and which are suffering as a result <e> <s> possibly the department ought to be discouraging this <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord sandford has been commendably brief <e> <s> i hope i can follow suit and with luck your lordships might then be in bed by at least midnight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer and fully accept that this is a matter for chief constables <e> <s> but does he agree that there has been a very marked decline in the number of special constables from about in to about now <e> <s> does he also agree that they are a highly cost-effective force in that they are not paid at all and that more could be done to encourage their recruitment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege for me to follow the noble lord lord henderson of brompton who is a fellow cumbrian <e> <s> this is especially so as i find myself substantially in agreement with what he says regarding the necessity for the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now some five hours since the noble lord lord callaghan rose to say that he felt that most things had been said <e> <s> since then a great deal more has been said <e> <s> i understand that at lunchtime a certain noble lord was offering prizes to anyone who would say something new <e> <s> i feel that a great deal that is new has been said since last night <e> <s> i am not sure how much i can add to that but i wanted to speak because i felt that i should like to nail my colours to the mast <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to second my noble friends motion for a humble address in reply to her majestys most gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords as a neighbour and fellow cumbrian i particularly regret it <e> <s> however i am sure that we all look forward to his memoirs which i understand are in preparation and are grateful for his continued advice and presence amongst us <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords for their contributions to the debate <e> <s> in particular i thank the noble lord lord ennals for his kind words of welcome <e> <s> perhaps i may say how pleased i am that he is out of hospital <e> <s> i hope that we will see a great deal of each other across the dispatch box over the coming months <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleaspre until five minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in the debate <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to answer many of the questions that have been raised <e> <s> in particular i hope that i shall be able to answer the question asked by several noble lords including the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i apologise in advance if i fail to answer some questions but i can write to noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by thanking the noble lord lord molloy for his kind words on opening this question <e> <s> i must say that after the strength of feeling in everything i have heard so far i feel somewhat like daniel going into the lions den without the assistance of a vet <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass those remarks on to my right honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been giving detailed consideration to the suggestions for changes to the arrangements for the provision of hearing aids which have recently been made by the royal national institute for the deaf <e> <s> a wide range of views has been expressed on the proposals and we are now considering the best way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords we are concerned about the long waiting times for hearing aids in some districts <e> <s> in that context suggestions for change which have been made by the rnid are welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on that request to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i believe that internal hearing aids can be made available on the national health service if the consultant thinks it necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords that will certainly be taken into consideration when her majestys government consider which way to go forward with regard to improving the provision of hearing aids <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly a matter which needs to be considered <e> <s> i gather that hearing aids provided by the national health service are on loan but obviously that does not solve the problem of getting a new hearing aid at a difficult time <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the growth in car ownership it is not always possible to provide on site parking for everyone travelling to hospital by car <e> <s> where parking has to be restricted it is usually to ensure that routes used by emergency traffic are kept free and that there is access for sitting case ambulances disabled drivers and priority staff cars <e>", "<cs> my lords current guidance suggests a ratio of one parking place to every four beds increased to one to one where access is difficult due to the limited availability of public transport <e> <s> her majestys government consider that this level of provision is sufficient to provide for patients who cannot visit hospital without a car for example the disabled essential staff and some but by no means all visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords where a health authority wishes to provide more parking than is advised it may decide to recover some of the cost by charging <e> <s> differential charges can be made according to the status of the user staff patients and visitors <e> <s> staff who are required to use their cars to perform their duties for example district nurses are exempted from charges <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact an underground car park is planned at the new westminster and chelsea hospital with spaces <e> <s> that will be a ratio of to <e> <s> that level of provision is considered acceptable given the limited space available and accessibility to the hospital by public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i am <e> <s> after the current redevelopment of a new mental illness unit at the charing cross hospital there will be a total of about spaces which will be a ratio of to <e> <s> there is very good public transport in that area <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl that it is very difficult to park in the area of the charing cross hospital <e> <s> i have done it myself <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for each individual hospital <e> <s> i do not believe that it is a matter for the government to issue directives on the day-to-day operation of hospital car parks <e> <s> each hospital will have a unit general manager who is capable of taking decisions on the allocation of car parking space and how it should be operated <e>", "<cs> my lords that is again a matter for the hospitals <e> <s> clamping is available to hospitals as long as sufficient warning is given to the owner so that he knows that his car will be wheel-clamped and there is no damage to his car <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble lord acquired a parking ticket <e> <s> he will know that in newcastle the metro is available <e> <s> i also know that the local authority in newcastle is very anxious that people should use public transport if possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the freeman hospital but i know newcastle <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have stated the government have issued guidance but it is then up to the district and the unit itself to decide how to run its own car parking <e>", "<cs> my lords the house as i think every speaker said listens with very great respect to the noble lord lord glenamara who is a former head teacher and a former secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> i listen to him with even greater respect as a fellow cumbrian and a fellow graduate of durham university as also i believe is the noble lord lord dormand <e> <s> everyone in the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord glenamara for initiating this interesting debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> i have said that the government will consider proposals if there is unanimity and they come forward <e> <s> i said that earlier <e> <s> as we have said repeatedly we are prepared to consider the case for a gtc on the basis of specific proposals put to us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will accept that i said that this was not at the top of the list of government priorities <e> <s> but as i said at the beginning and i cannot repeat this more strongly we are prepared to consider the case for a council if specific proposals are brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that the government do not put it top of their list of priorities <e> <s> we do not see it as vital but if proposals come forward from all interested bodies the government will certainly consider them <e> <s> i feel that that is an answer to the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point that the noble baroness has made <e> <s> i am sorry if i missed it while listening to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the debate which has taken place this evening as have all noble lords <e> <s> until recently i knew little about schizophrenia <e> <s> the debate will prove useful in heightening public awareness of schizophrenia which is most important <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand the problems and i hope that i am not giving a slap in the face as the noble lord puts it to all the people who are suffering <e> <s> i hope that i have explained what the government propose and are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson referred to hostels <e> <s> we very much agree that hostels are important <e> <s> the department has funded research which shows how cost-effective they are <e> <s> we look to see a continuing increase in the number of hostels provided by health authorities and of course by local authorities and the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> my lords at the beginning of my speech i made it quite clear that we felt that the bill was discriminatory in relation to mental illnesses <e> <s> the noble lords lord pitt and lord rea suggested extending it to all other mental illnesses <e> <s> we felt that it would be discriminatory just to deal with mental illness and mental handicap and not deal with other disabilities <e> <s> i think i made that perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords as the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on that question to my right honourable friend <e> <s> as the noble lord knows we have not yet given our responses to the houses select committee report on priorities in medical research but we hope that they will be published in due course and will deal with such concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords the white paper sets out the governments policy decisions and further details are contained in the series of eight working papers which were published on th february <e> <s> we shall be programming the introduction of changes carefully to ensure a smooth implementation <e> <s> but pilot schemes could cause major uncertainty in the national health service as to the final pace and direction of change <e> <s> the governments response to the select committees report will come in due time <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister for health hopes to write to the chairman of the select committee the noble lord lord nelson of stafford before the end of spring <e>", "<cs> my lords that concept is certainly not applied to medical research <e> <s> the government give a great deal of money to medical research both through the medical research council budget and through the departments direct funding of research <e>", "<cs> my lords the white paper makes it quite clear that there is no threat to research and that the government are fully committed to a strong medical research infrastructure through universities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows perfectly well that paragraph of the white paper refers to research <e> <s> it makes the governments commitment to research quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there are concerns among general practitioners <e> <s> no doubt the government will take them into account <e> <s> i am afraid that i did not quite catch the last part of the noble lords question <e> <s> perhaps he will repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not proposing at the moment changes to research <e> <s> the noble lord is taking his question beyond that to the white paper itself <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment medical research is funded by the department directly and by the medical research council <e> <s> as i understand it that will continue <e>", "<cs> of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we took a considerable amount of time before we came up with the white paper proposals <e> <s> we have allowed a considerable amount of time for their discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are firmly committed to our proposals set out in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> three organisations have been broadly supportive of the proposals the national association of health authorities the institute of health service management and the society of family practitioner committees <e> <s> there has also been wide-ranging support from individual clinicians mainly hospital consultants or heads of academic departments of medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware i said that many doctors have also supported the government <e> <s> the fact that the bma has not been broadly supportive is irrelevant <e> <s> we have a great deal of support from individual doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> much of the information the doctors have been putting out on the instructions of the bma has been wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that we are riding roughshod over the two professions <e> <s> with regard to the pilot schemes thorough consideration was given to the proposals during the year in which the review was carried out <e> <s> to postpone full implementation would lead to uncertainty and anxiety in the service without producing the benefits to patients and staff that will flow from early implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that many gps support the government <e> <s> if the noble lord read an article by a london gp in the <e>", "<cs> my lords that question goes rather wide of the subject on the order paper but i thank the noble lord for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i criticised the bma for some of the documents it issued which were mentioned by my noble friend lord jenkin and which are not fair <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is well aware from an answer given by my noble friend lord arran some time ago people do not have to be conservative to be members of such organisations <e> <s> we always choose the best possible people <e> <s> the three associations that i mentioned were not those mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> i mentioned the national association of health authorities and the institute of health service management <e> <s> the noble lord did mention the society of family practitioner committees <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolute rubbish <e> <s> as i said we are firmly committed to the proposals but welcome views on their implementation <e> <s> as the noble lord knows perfectly well and as ministers in both houses have repeated on many occasions we have absolutely no plans to privatise the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that we welcomed views on implementation <e> <s> with regard to pilot studies quite a few of the proposals are voluntary such as the doctors practice budgets <e> <s> in a sense one could argue that that is something approaching a pilot study <e> <s> it is up to the doctor himself to decide whether to take it on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is correct <e> <s> as one of my noble friends said the other day that was slightly before my time <e>", "<cs> my lords the new contract is a totally different question and i think it is wrong to start confusing it with the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness thought that i looked like a hermit and did not have a shoulder to rest on <e> <s> i shall endeavour to answer as many of the points raised as possible in my speech <e> <s> however i expect that i shall not be able to satisfy the noble lord lord stallard <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point but i shall be coming to that <e> <s> we have made reciprocal agreements with different countries at different times <e> <s> back in inflation was not seen to be the problem which it later became and for historical reasons certain anomalies have grown up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am terribly sorry but the figure i have is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may say that it is a propaganda figure but i am afraid that i shall stick to it for the moment and he will have to accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall have to write to the noble lord on that <e> <s> i have not read the letter from my noble friend lord skelmersdale <e> <s> the figure i have is million and i shall have to stick to that <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first question concerning the united states i explained that it was an historical anomaly <e> <s> the agreement with america i cannot remember the date was at a different time <e> <s> we accept that it is an historical anomaly <e> <s> it would be expensive to now make a change for canada australia new zealand and the other countries <e> <s> it would cost million <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the noble baroness was asking why that was the case <e> <s> i said that i did not know why it was the case and that i would write to the noble baroness <e> <s> is that not enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i should add that this is an unstarred question and it is normally in order that when the minister sits down the debate ends <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of three mental illness hospitals approved for total closure in and one in <e> <s> numbers for are not yet available <e> <s> four mental illness hospitals are planned to close in two in and five in <e> <s> one of the hospitals planned to close in is that approved for closure in <e> <s> figures on ward closures are not collected centrally <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of discharge of a patient into the community is entirely a matter for the consultant psychiatrist who must be happy that the patient will benefit from a more independent living environment <e> <s> there should be no question of a patient being discharged until his needs have been carefully assessed and arrangements have been made with local authorities and other care agencies for those needs to be met including appropriate accommodation where necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made that clear <e> <s> we also made it clear in planning guidance issued to health and local authorities in july that by each district must have developed a care programme to provide a system of co-ordinated arid continuing care for people chronically disabled by mental illness <e> <s> we also emphasised that each district should ensure that a consultant psychiatrist has special responsibility for rehabilitation and continuing care <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made that point clear <e> <s> i think the noble lord knows my answer on the griffiths report <e> <s> however for his benefit i shall repeat the answer on griffiths which is that the government are actively considering the report of sir roy griffiths with a view to bringing forward proposals in the near future <e> <s> the issues involved are too complex and important to admit easy answers <e> <s> the report offered only one of a number of possible solutions <e> <s> there is a great deal of other material to consider and we are determined to take the time necessary to arrive at the best solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows that we shall give an answer to the griffiths report when it is appropriate <e> <s> as regards section officials from the department have been involved in a series of discussions with local authority and health authority representatives to identify the processes which will make up the requirements under the important section of the act <e> <s> the timetable for implementation will depend upon the outcome of those discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble lord knows that i cannot give an answer as regards when we shall respond to the report <e> <s> but as a sign of the importance with which her majestys government view the griffiths report i can say that my right honourable friend the prime minister is chairing a small group of ministers who are principally involved in the matter in a short series of meetings <e> <s> her involvement is a sign of the great importance attached to this issue in the current political agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for saying that i gave a full reply <e> <s> the noble lord sitting next to him has not often said that to me <e> <s> it is not a question of whether we should suspend the closure of hospitals <e> <s> there is still a surplus number of beds in mental hospitals <e> <s> in the total number of in-patients was <e> <s> there is still a total number of staff beds in mental illness hospitals and other units of <e>", "<cs> my lords if i caught the name of the hospital correctly it is not one that i have listed as being scheduled for closure in the period up to <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be more specific but i shall certainly draw what the noble lord has said to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not only the local authority it is also the health authority <e> <s> of course there is always consultation between her majestys government and those bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords an estimated million income support recipients received a full increase at this years uprating <e> <s> an estimated million received no increase or a partial one <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord and other noble lords will know there were massive changes in the social security system last year <e> <s> those changes also produced far greater simplicity in the system and greater fairness between claimants in similar circumstances <e> <s> it is not possible to make such changes without there being some hard cases <e> <s> that is why we brought in the transitional payments to ease the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but income support was brought in because it is simpler <e> <s> obviously as those people who lost and received transitional payments catch up with their new figures those transitional payments will go <e> <s> to preserve the transitional payments as the noble baroness seems to suggest would preserve those inequalities <e> <s> if the party of the noble baroness of which she is such an ornament were still in power there would be much less chance of it paying <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting semantic distinction although i do not accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest figures show that at th september there were people waiting for admission to hospital <e> <s> comparable figures for the four preceding years were and respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept that the figures are marginally higher than the previous figures <e> <s> however as the noble lord knows they are considerably better than they were in when they reached a highest ever peak of i think i should also say that accusations that the government are under-funding the national health service are unfair <e> <s> we have increased funding in real terms by per cent <e> <s> since <e> <s> i should also say that the number of day patients treated has also gone up dramatically since <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not include in the figures for waiting lists what are referred to as self-deferred cases nor have we included them in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows that this government are engaged in the biggest hospital building programme since the beginning of the national health service <e> <s> as regards the sale of surplus land i believe that the noble lord has tabled a question on this subject to be discussed in a couple of weeks time <e> <s> i shall willingly answer it then <e>", "<cs> my lords the average might be marginally higher than under the administration to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> however as he well knows and as i think my noble friend lady trumpington told him two or three years ago under every single labour government since the last war the figures have gone up and under every single conservative government they have come down <e> <s> as regards the white paper the noble lord knows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows that the white paper contains proposals designed so that money follows patients <e> <s> if money follows patients it makes it easier for them to go where there are not waiting lists <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand the noble lords reference to hospitals opting out of the national health service <e> <s> on the assumption that he is referring to self-governing hospitals the recent white paper makes clear that these will remain firmly within the nhs <e> <s> the white paper also explains that self-governing hospitals will be free to make use of their assets to provide health care and to dispose of assets subject only to a reserve power for the secretary of state to intervene if a disposal would be against the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid i do not entirely understand the noble lord <e> <s> there is no advantage in the nhs spending money on maintaining or securing surplus property which could be better spent on patient services <e> <s> i stress two <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords knows perfectly well that i did not use the phrase opting out and nor will i use those words <e> <s> these hospitals are not opting out they will be self-governing hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is going beyond the question on the order paper but we should like to hear from individual members of the public as well as from local pressure groups <e>", "<cs> yes my lords over hospitals have expressed interest from every region in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that assurance <e> <s> certainly in selling off land we should like to obtain as much money as possible <e> <s> as i said the money is for the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question <e> <s> anyone can express interest in a hospital opting out <e> <s> the final decision will be taken by the secretary of state after he has listened to consultations from the local community and staff <e>", "<cs> my lords the government put the money into the national health service <e> <s> i made that perfectly clear <e> <s> in the case of self-governing hospitals the money goes to the self-governing hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord no doubt read a report in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows perfectly well that we had a question on that last week <e> <s> his question goes quite beyond the question on the order paper <e> <s> he knows very well that this government have been engaged in one of the biggest hospital building programmes since the creation of the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass on the noble lords comments to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of steps have already been taken which are designed to improve the recruitment of nurses and health visitors <e> <s> these include improvements in pay scales which on average have risen by more than per cent <e> <s> since april last year and the introduction of the new clinical grading structure <e> <s> important changes are being made in nurse training and we are taking steps to improve career development for nurses <e> <s> the national nurse recruitment publicity campaign is being further developed <e> <s> so far it has resulted in over requests for information about nursing as a career <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not speak about the possibility of improving nurses pay but about the fact that it has been increased by on average per cent <e> <s> since last year <e> <s> as regards what the noble lord terms the demographic time bomb we accept the decline in the number of suitably qualified school leavers will lead to problems if the situation remains unaltered <e> <s> we have asked health authorities to improve recruitment and retention by increasing male recruitment making greater efforts to recruit mature entrants organising back-to-nursing campaigns which includes refresher training establishing nurse banks and providing more opportunities for flexible working and job sharing <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for health about a month ago welcomed the two new reports on health service managers which call for further action to be taken by health authorities to ensure equal opportunities for women <e> <s> he is commending those reports to health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords a mortgage package has been introduced involving the nationwide anglia building society in the london area <e> <s> i gather that other health authorities have made similar agreements with other building societies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how many questions the noble lord asked <e> <s> as regards numbers i do not believe that they have fallen since last year <e> <s> the noble lord was probably thinking of a report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness knows perfectly well that i cannot give her the assurance that that will happen <e> <s> i shall certainly draw her remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords that is entirely another question <e> <s> nurses will be receiving a salary and therefore they will be in a position to pay the poll tax or the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to the comments made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by apologising to the house in advance because i do not think that i shall be able to cover all the points that have been raised by noble lords <e> <s> bearing in mind the time limits on this debate i should finish more or less on the dot of oclock or two minutes before the hour <e> <s> i shall probably have to omit a few of the points raised <e> <s> however i certainly give the assurance that i shall write to any noble lords whom i do not manage to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble lord on that matter <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford mentioned two figures one of received per polytechnic student and the other of received per university student <e> <s> there is a big difference <e> <s> my understanding is that most of that difference was for research <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> as this is a private members bill and as i set out the governments view on second reading i had not intended to take a large part in the proceedings <e> <s> however i said that i would make another statement when we dealt with the question that clause shall stand part of the bill which is to be moved by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> perhaps it would be appropriate if i spoke at this point <e>", "<cs> the government cannot support the amendment which runs directly against current policy <e> <s> that is to allow local and health authorities to determine their own priorities within broad guidelines bearing in mind their statutory powers and duties to provide services for mentally ill people as a whole <e>", "<cs> i said that we could not support this amendment just as we do not oppose the bill <e> <s> we merely say that we do not support it <e> <s> i would not oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> all i can say about griffiths is that the response will be soon <e>", "<cs> i do not see that that quite follows <e> <s> the guidelines can go out before we make any response to griffiths <e> <s> these are guidelines to the health authorities <e>", "<cs> i believe that i owe the noble lord lord ennals an apology <e> <s> i was becoming rather confused <e> <s> griffiths will come first and then the guidelines <e> <s> griffiths will come soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure

the health service over the past years funding is up per cent <e> <s> in real terms since <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the noble lord refers to practice budgets in which case we shall allow the appropriate amount of money that a practice will need to meet its costs <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords will know the house had a very late night last night <e> <s> i am afraid that i have not seen the announcement about the rise in interest rates <e> <s> however i can repeat that funding has increased by per cent <e> <s> in real terms since <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that point

of the chief nursing officer <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend will certainly read what the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that nurses are not being kicked in the teeth

lords my right honourable friend appointed the members of the policy board <e> <s> he chose to appoint the chief medical officer but as i have already stated not in his capacity as chief medical officer <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible that i expressed myself rather badly <e> <s> however i am sure that noble lords would not expect me to discuss the merits of individual candidates for the policy board in this way <e> <s> as i said the secretary of state has expressed every confidence in the chief nursing officer <e> <s> that is all that it is proper for me to say on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that there is a lamentable lack of expertise on the policy board <e> <s> i stated that there was a representative of the chief nursing officer on the management

however aware whether there are any welsh or scottish members on the board <e> <s> but as i said the board is not there to represent individual interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will

shall provide the powers necessary for all parts of the national health service to continue to be involved with research and central funding for the service cost of that research <e>", "<cs> my lords

confirm that but i shall certainly bring it to the attention of both my right honourable friends <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course i do <e> <s> i have stated quite clearly that her majestys government remain committed to research within the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall not be able to respond to the individual case which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> however i shall write to him and bring the other matters to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the government will deal with the suggestions of the select committee in their published response <e> <s> with regard to the adequacy of research funding the medical research council the main body that receives government grants for medical research has seen its budget rise from million in to million in <e> <s> that is an increase of per cent <e> <s> the health departments own research budget has gone up from million to over million an increase of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall convey to my right honourable friend the worries of the noble baroness and of other members of the house <e> <s> i can only reiterate the commitment of her majestys government to research <e> <s> i should also in passing say that we are very grateful for all the voluntary funds that go to research <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure which question i am supposed to be answering <e> <s> as regards the policy board which was the first question we have brought in the people whom the noble countess mentioned for their business expertise and their

different sides of the house <e> <s> i am not sure that it will be possible for me to satisfy all noble lords <e> <s> i do not see how i could satisfy both the noble lords lord northfield and lord rugby and my noble friend lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords this year billion will be spent in our hospitals and community health services throughout the united kingdom billion in england alone where health authorities have received cash increases averaging per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather suspected that the noble countess was basing her figures on those of the national association of health authorities <e> <s> the government consider that the figures used by the naha are artificial and bear no relation to what has happened in the health service <e> <s> the crucial points are the amount of money put in by the taxpayer which is over per cent <e> <s> more in real terms since and the services we provide to patients <e>", "<cs> my lords health authorities will not be underfunded as the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> we suspect that the naha has used rpi to judge inflation <e> <s> however that is not the correct figure to use <e> <s> the correct figure to use would be the health service index which is a slightly lower figure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is lower not higher <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no shortfall <e>", "<cs> my lords as i stated in my first answer her majestys government have increased funding by per cent <e> <s> on top of that there are further savings that health authorities themselves can make <e> <s> there have also been increases to their funds made available by changes in superannuation <e> <s> i believe they are now paying million less <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that remark <e> <s> i hoped that our figures were generally accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are providing wholehearted support for national drinkwise day <e> <s> my right honourable friend the lord president of the council and

to participate in various local drinkwise events on or around th june <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can explain it in simple terms <e> <s> there is a legal anomaly which was discussed last year on an amendment moved by my noble friend lord lucas <e> <s> existing legislation defines intoxicating liquor that is that which needs to be sold with a licence in terms of the highest level of alcohol that was ever in the liquor <e> <s> some low-alcohol beers are brewed up and then the alcohol is removed some are always brewed below the per cent <e> <s> which is the level for intoxicating liquor <e> <s> therefore some low-alcohol beers can be sold in unlicensed premises and some cannot <e> <s> i hope that that reply is helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords drinkwise day is not about going completely dry <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to attend part of the royal ascot meeting <e> <s> the day is about promoting sensible drinking nationwide <e> <s> it is a chance for the public to look at their drinking habits consider healthy drinking choices and be a better judge of their alcohol consumption <e> <s> looking and feeling fitter being in control and enjoying life through sensible drinking lie at the heart of the campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can help the noble lord on that wider philosophical question <e> <s> it is something that has been considered by my colleagues who are members of the ministerial group on alcohol misuse <e> <s> i shall ensure that a copy of its first annual report is placed in the library <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to examine it he will find a long list of actions that the ministerial group propose should be taken to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the question but i accept that seems to be rather a lot of money <e> <s> i suggest that the noble viscount tries another restaurant where he might find it cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the eight working papers issued in england and those issued in scotland and northern ireland a further working paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> as regards confusion i am afraid that quite a lot of confusion results from the comments of the noble lord and his colleagues who have allowed a certain amount of misrepresentation to creep into what they have said about the white paper <e> <s> as regards the prime ministers comments i can only repeat what she said the health service will continue to be funded mainly by general taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the electorate had spoken on the subject of the national health service <e> <s> if the noble lord was referring to yesterdays results of the european elections so far as i know the national health service was not a question in those elections <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows perfectly well the election concerned the european parliament <e> <s> the national health service is not a responsibility of the european parliament <e> <s> if the noble lord takes the view that the electorate are so unsophisticated that they voted purely on the health service he has a much more cynical view of the electorate than i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble kinsman for those remarks <e> <s> we are aware that the timetable is tight but we believe that the health service will be able to adapt in the necessary time to the changes proposed in the white paper <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is working for patients as it says very clearly on the front of the document <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone can have a different interpretation of these matters <e> <s> i say that the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> there is no evidence that the public have rejected the governments white paper

glad that the noble lord is pleased with the election results <e> <s> it will be a temporary blip and it is nice that his party should have such temporary enhancements <e> <s> no doubt in two or three years time the electorate will have a chance to show what they really feel about these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite another question <e> <s> we have had many questions on the contents of the white paper we have had debates on the contents of the white paper <e> <s> the question deals with documents that we have produced in explanation and amplification <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend said that it would be mainly financed by general taxation <e> <s> i think that that is perfectly clear and i reiterate the governments support for the health service <e>", "<cs> my

are funding research to implement the recommendations of the black and comare reports and are supporting other related studies <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept that there is evidence of association of the incidence of leukaemia in the vicinity of those nuclear installations but we do not accept that that is evidence of a causal mechanism <e> <s> until we know what the mechanism is it is not clear

issues to be addressed in estimating the possible health risks of low doses of radiation <e> <s> the interpretation of data in relation to what the noble lord said was a very small number of people presents many problems <e> <s> as with any relatively rare disease the incidence of leukaemia naturally varies widely from one area to another <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept the noble lords concern <e> <s> i live in cumbria though admittedly quite a long way from sellafield and i know that many people are worried <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will accept and acknowledge that this is an area which calls for scrupulous and expert investigation of the issues involved and inevitably that will take time <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed something that sir douglas black considered in his report and i believe it was in the first report of comare which related to west cumbria <e>", "<cs> my lords what my noble and learned friend has to say about the geography of the area is of

campaign against the proposals in the white paper <e> <s> it has been designed to give a totally wrong impression of what the proposed reforms are intended to do <e>", "<cs> my lords yet again i have to tell the noble lord that we are not out to destroy the health service as he seems to think <e> <s> as i said earlier my right honourable friend will consider requests for meetings from any

matter for the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords we originally said that we hoped the new arrangements would be in place preferably from st july <e> <s> the noble lord raises an issue which remains to be resolved notably the precise financial arrangements <e> <s> we shall consider the issue and when it is resolved a decision will be taken on the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords of course <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am aware of this problem <e> <s> at the moment i can only say that a decision will be made as soon as possible <e> <s> we have recently written to the general managers of the regional health authorities advising them that the existing arrangements will certainly continue until st december unless the letter is cancelled prior to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept

not feature in the governments legislative programme this session but was introduced as a consequence of certain incidents in january this year which the government considered to be repugnant <e> <s> the bill has been drafted in order to deal specifically with problems which could arise following allegations that kidneys from paid donors from another country had been transplanted at a london hospital and to combat the threat of a foreign national setting up an agency in the united kingdom to recruit live donors for payment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for what he said <e>

lord ennals <e> <s> i must thank him for giving me notice of various questions he wished to raise <e>", "<cs> my lords my advice is that the donors wishes could be enforced <e> <s> my understanding always was that on the death of the individual his wishes had no further effect <e> <s> whatever the position doctors would rather not start removing organs against the wishes of the donors relatives because of the danger of adverse publicity which might in the long term do much greater harm to the whole principle of voluntary organ donation <e>", "<cs> my lords i leave that to him and the advice that he obtains from his solicitors <e> <s> my noble friend lord trafford asked about tests to establish relationship <e> <s> we are consulting the medical profession about details of the tests that will be used <e> <s> those details will be set out in the regulations <e> <s> we expect them to be a combination of blood tests and dna tests <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks due to technological changes we feel that they are best put into regulations and not enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords the treatment of individual patients is for the doctor responsible for their care <e> <s> if the responsible doctor deems hormone replacement therapy to be clinically necessary then he will decide whether the known benefits outweigh the known disadvantages before deciding whether to prescribe it for his patients <e> <s> if he does decide to do so then it is available on the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of claims by dr carruthers that the treatment can have beneficial effects in those areas <e> <s> as yet we have received no evidence but we shall certainly look with interest at any evidence produced by dr carruthers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what answer i can give to that but i certainly note the noble and learned lords comments <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady trumpington has just leaned across to tell me that she does not want male hormones <e> <s> regarding my second answer we still do not know whether the treatment can be effective for anything other than its current use which is largely for treatment of osteoporosis <e>", "<cs> my lords there are substantial problems attached to the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> the main one is that student accommodation in higher education institutions is generally not held vacant during the summer vacation but is used for a variety of purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the committee of vice-chancellors and principals will note the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> he will be aware that the committee cannot bind the universities <e> <s> it is up to the individual institutions to decide what to do <e> <s> however i hope that they will note the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> if such information is available i hope they will start to collect it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm what my noble friend has said <e> <s> rightly universities have to have regard for their primary functions and the need to use their resources to the best advantage in order to support those activities <e> <s> the commercial lettings of their halls of residence and other units of accommodation also serve a useful purpose <e> <s> they help to meet the full-year cost of student accommodation thereby reducing the burden on students <e>", "<cs> my lords quite obviously their first duty is to provide accommodation for students <e> <s> during the vacation they must look for other sources <e> <s> i am sure they will take note of the noble lords suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords but quite a number of students do have long summer vacations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for the universities to decide whether they can make some use of their surplus accommodation for whatever purposes they consider best <e> <s> the noble lord has tried to widen the question to include the homeless generally <e> <s> the question relates to what the universities can do concerning this problem <e> <s> it will be unwise for me to expand the question to the whole subject of homelessness <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help my noble friend on that matter <e> <s> i know that universities use their accommodation which is surplus during the vacation for a variety of purposes <e> <s> i shall have to find out whether it is used for holiday purposes <e> <s> it is a matter for the individual institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i received some advice from the committee of vice-chancellors and principals <e> <s> it stated that halls of residence and accommodation were used for conferences and that the open university runs residential summer schools <e> <s> it did not mention holiday accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying what i shall not be talking about this afternoon <e> <s> i do not intend to go down the gcse/gce controversy <e> <s> as my noble friend lady young said this is not the time or the place to discuss that matter in detail i shall mention it only briefly <e> <s> nor shall i discuss the general controversy about the teaching of history <e> <s> nor do i intend to follow some of the comments made by my noble friend lord beloff about the governing body of the school which he appeared to believe was a nest of leftists <e> <s> as he knows under the act a number are elected by the parents and it is up to the parents to decide who to elect <e> <s> my noble friend lady cox <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the department has looked into the matter but later in my speech i shall deal with departmental investigations <e> <s> i shall inform my noble friend whether that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that correction <e> <s> i was not aware of that but i shall certainly make sure the department is aware of it <e> <s> i shall continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> if i may continue mention has been made of the scottish examinations <e> <s> the government are fully persuaded of the high quality of scottish examination syllabuses in general and of their suitability as preparation for entry into higher education <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science therefore intends that qualifications certified by the scottish examination board should be approved for use in maintained schools in england until at least <e> <s> it is however within the framework of the overall curriculum policy for governors and head teachers in individual schools to decide whether it would be appropriate to offer scottish qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that <e> <s> however as i have stated if the noble lord or anyone else feels that there are matters which ought to be inquired into they can raise them with the secretary of state <e> <s> it was my understanding that dr freeman has agreed with the lea that he should undertake a one-year programme of retraining in tourism and leisure in <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> he will understand that i cannot grant him an inquiry now <e> <s> my right honourable friend will obviously read the debate and take note of what noble lords have said <e> <s> if any noble lord or anyone else wishes to take the matter further they can write to my right honourable friend <e> <s> if he considers it fit and proper he will then institute an inquiry <e> <s> i cannot give that assurance myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to the end of my speech but i take the point made by my noble friend lady young <e> <s> i certainly give the assurance that i shall personally bring the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i do not think that i can say anything more but i give the assurance that i shall bring it to his attention <e> <s> i reiterate that it is open to anyone to apply to my right honourable friend to institute an inquiry under section of the act <e> <s> i do not think that i can go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble kinsman for those remarks <e> <s> we hope to bring negotiations about a united kingdom

further information from the hungarian government which we shall need time to study <e> <s> as regards encouraging paediatricians to visit the hungarian institute that is a matter for them <e> <s> however we are conducting an evaluation of what is going on at the peto institute through the birmingham foundation for conductive education <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should also say that as my noble kinsman mentioned there was a television programme some months ago which i did not see <e> <s> i gather that there was also a radio programme this morning <e> <s> again i am afraid that i was unable to listen to it because i was rather busy being briefed on this question and other matters <e> <s> increasing numbers of people whether professionals or those involved in the voluntary sector are aware of what goes on <e> <s> i hope that they will visit the peto institute and discover what it is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i should say that i am not speaking here on health matters which is something for my new department the department of social security <e> <s> if the noble lord has listened to me he will remember that in my first answer i said the minister of state for social security and the disabled which comes under the department of social security <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her kind remarks <e> <s> i hope that she will continue to be kind to me but i believe that that might be wishful thinking <e> <s> i shall try to answer some of the points that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that remark <e> <s> i quite understand that she has already been kind to me once today <e> <s> she has not been particularly unkind to me since then <e> <s> no doubt that will happen later in the year when she will find her opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness has misunderstood me <e> <s> obviously the ideas behind the regulations have been discussed a great deal <e> <s> i accept that they have not been approved by parliament <e> <s> they were discussed in another place yesterday afternoon <e> <s> i hope that this house will approve them later today <e>", "<cs> my lords the community charge is payable by the individual not based on the residence <e> <s> i presume that what they are losing but i shall have to write to the noble baroness about this reflects their saving in living expenses through not being at home <e> <s> if i have that wrong i shall certainly correct it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord would accept that the savings from being in hospital are greater than the additional expenses of being in hospital <e> <s> i would certainly think that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can be <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that i said when we debated his report on th july that it was unlikely that we could reach a decision this century <e> <s> all i can say is that this is a very complex matter which requires very careful consideration of a number of issues <e> <s> we feel that it would be unwise to make a precipitate decision <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will remember that i said we would write to the commission <e> <s> in september we approved the terms of the letter which was forwarded to our permanent representative to the commission <e> <s> it has now received that letter <e> <s> we have obviously not yet received a reply to that letter <e> <s> no doubt the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> however i can only reiterate the fact that this matter is very complex <e> <s> we feel that it would be unwise to make too hasty a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords on th july i said that it would be unlikely that we would be able to achieve equality of pensions this century <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness knows that the issue of state pension age is very complex <e> <s> for historical reasons women receive their pensions at and men at <e> <s> it is very difficult to change that situation so that people have the same pension age without causing problems for those who are planning their retirement who might at the moment be only in their s <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said to the noble baroness the reason for the difference in age is historical <e> <s> it is very difficult to change that <e> <s> obviously because women live longer they will receive more in pension than men <e> <s> but we cannot change these matters overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the case <e> <s> some other european countries have the same pension age others have different pension ages for men and women <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate on the th if i remember rightly the noble lord suggested that he favoured as the qualifying age for both sexes <e> <s> the noble lord knows that that would be far too expensive an option to consider <e> <s> the select committee put forward the idea of the decade of retirement but accepted that there were problems <e> <s> the government see problems in that <e> <s> i can only go back to what i said earlier it is a highly complex matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may say that <e> <s> it would achieve savings but it could not be done overnight because there are many women in

people would be affected by the original amendment put forward by the noble lord and that would make it very difficult to estimate how much the proposal would cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the noble lords question <e> <s> however it is somewhat wide of the question on the order paper which concerns the numbers which are in dispute between the noble lord lord carter and his colleagues

certainly make them available to my noble friend as well as to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not <e> <s> as the noble lord knows that figure which includes all the severely mentally

question is relevant to that on the order paper <e> <s> as i have stated the usage of beds is increasing because changes in medical technology mean that consultants are able to discharge patients sooner <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> the number of in-patient cases treated has risen over the past years from about to about in <e>", "<cs> my lords i accepted that there were problems <e> <s> i cannot comment on individual cases but if the noble lord will write to me no doubt i shall look into the matter <e> <s> we have accepted that on some occasions there are problems and we are doing what we can to reduce those times <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no figures for increased use of day beds <e> <s> of course the facility is available for doctors to make greater use of day beds rather than keeping people in hospital <e> <s> that would be a matter for an individual consultant if he felt that that facility was right for a particular patient <e>", "<cs> my lords according to my figures the number of out-patients has increased <e> <s> as i said i do not have the figures for <e> <s> they are provisional <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained earlier my noble friend is right in saying that the number of beds has fallen but the number of people we have treated has increased because there is a greater throughput of people using the beds <e>", "<cs> my lords in general our accident and emergency departments provide excellent care <e> <s> a recent royal college of surgeons report identified a need for improvements in the care of the most seriously injured <e> <s> following consultations the department of health is giving urgent consideration to these aspects of care <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not aware of any specific problems with regard to weekend facilities in accident and emergency departments <e> <s> if my noble kinsman knows of any specific instances i shall be most grateful if he will bring them to my attention <e> <s> it is for the health authority management locally to decide what level of staffing is necessary and to ensure that that is provided <e>", "<cs> my lords some casualty departments are better than others <e> <s> we recognised the fact that some needed improvement and that is what both the department and the royal college of surgeons have been looking at <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the concern <e> <s> however it is very difficult to get the balance exactly right between having a great number of accident and emergency departments that it might not be possible to fund adequately or having fewer and better departments with more time to provide care <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always stated that we recognise the importance of the ambulance service in terms of getting patients to hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will understand that we are not going to be drawn on to the subject of the ambulance dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> spending on the long-term sick and disabled has increased over the years by billion in real terms <e> <s> the average annual real increase between and in prices has been million <e>",

"<cs> my lords it would help me to comment on that point if the noble lord gave me the reference of the book from which he quotes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join the noble lord lord peston in

coming months <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the noble baroness <e> <s> if she has listened i said that my right honourable friend the minister for housing has been to centrepoint <e> <s> he has seen what the problem is <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord and trust that he will not be putting forward a junior ministers protection bill or whatever the bill was that he raised last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not covering that point but the noble lord will appreciate that i spoke for minutes <e> <s> however i shall write to him about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords

addition in june we wrote to some people whom we believed might be affected <e> <s> of those responded and were sent claim packs <e> <s> since then claims have been received and we expect further claims to come in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his welcome of the abolition of the earnings rule <e> <s> my understanding is that as before pensions would continue to be taxable <e>

honourable friend the secretary of state put it in his speech to the society of pension consultants some time ago <e> <s> he went on <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it from the noble baronesss remarks that she does not accept the fact that our personal pensions initiative has been a huge success <e> <s> on this side of the house we are delighted that so many people are taking the opportunity of making alternative provision for their retirement <e> <s> in the longer term that will dramatically reduce the cost of serps <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says the fund is in surplus at present <e> <s> however as i have said that surplus is declining and will shortly that is by about fall below the recommended minimum of per cent <e> <s> which the government actuary sets <e>", "<cs> my lords the treasury supplement was abolished in line with the principle that contributory benefits should be funded from contribution income and not general taxation <e> <s> that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows perfectly well there is a per cent <e> <s> incentive which is derived from the national insurance fund <e> <s> indeed it has been coming from there since and will continue until <e>", "<cs> my lords expenditure is estimated to rise by an average of per cent <e> <s> in real terms over the next three years <e> <s> moreover by the expenditure will be over billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord such figures without notice <e> <s> obviously i would accept that a great deal of the increase is the result of an increase in the number of claimants <e> <s> however that is not necessarily a bad thing <e> <s> it indicates that we are reaching a great many people who were not reached before <e> <s> perhaps i may give an example <e> <s> invalid care allowance over the years has gone up by some per cent <e> <s> that is because we have extended the benefit to married women something the noble lords party did not do <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not intend to comment upon the church of england report <e> <s> however returning to the noble lords first point that per cent <e> <s> is attributable to an increase in the number of claimants that may be true in respect of some benefits <e> <s> i do not accept that it is so globally <e> <s> moreover as i said to the noble lord lord stallard it is no bad thing if we are reaching more claimants <e> <s> indeed i have already had this conversation with the noble lord on the issue of the long-term sick and disabled <e> <s> i repeat it is a good thing if we are reaching more people than the noble lords party did <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have already said we shall continue to increase the retirement pension in line with the retail prices index <e> <s> however we shall also look at the average total income of pensioners which has increased by some per cent <e> <s> in real terms over the past years <e> <s> in addition to that and i am talking now purely about government spending not total average income spending on the elderly as a group has increased by some per cent <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> as i said we intend to continue to increase state pensions in line with the retail prices index <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have the figure for take-up

per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> the increased spending on income support over spending on the previous supplementary benefit and housing benefit amounts to about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords

my lords i am not sure whether i quite understand the noble lord <e> <s> that per cent <e> <s> is set on an average and will give the payer of the community charge the right to demand accountability from the authority <e> <s> it is up to him then to vote for an authority which will keep the charge at that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords income support rates were set to take account of that per cent <e> <s> quite simply people can vote for an authority which will keep down their community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords it is pure speculation as to the level at which any local authority will set its community charge <e> <s> it is up to the electors to vote for an authority which keeps down the community charge to a reasonable figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the calling of a general election is a matter for me <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord will know that housing benefit is not set at a particular figure <e> <s> it depends on the income of the individual and on his rent <e>", "<cs> my lords when they renegotiate the rent with the landlord it is necessary for them to take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords it is entirely up to the individual to decide whether he or she wishes to take out a personal pension and to seek appropriate advice in his or her case <e> <s> in the case of personal pension schemes which are investments as defined in the financial services act persons regulated by bodies under that act have a duty to provide the best advice on such products <e> <s> it is for the individual to make arrangements for obtaining any further advice that may be necessary in the light of changing circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said that is entirely a matter for the individual to decide in the appropriate circumstances <e> <s> we believe that an individual can make that decision for himself on advice from advisers and having read for example our own book <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the three draft orders and the three draft regulations all of standing in my name on the order paper be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to start by commiserating with the noble lord lord carter and my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> they will both have a long day and be deprived of their dinner <e> <s> however i am afraid it cannot be helped <e> <s> i shall try to be as quick as i can though i shall not be able to cover all the points made by noble lords <e> <s> if i go much beyond to minutes not only will my noble friend lady trumpington be upset but even worse i imagine

in an opposition amendment <e> <s> i cannot remember whether or not it was in this house but certainly it was proposed in another place last year <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of state explained in committee why such a high figure was unacceptable <e> <s> it would exclude over half of all compensation claims and seriously undermine the principles that the compensator should meet his full liabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i shall certainly make that letter available to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no fixed relationship with other interest rates in the economy <e> <s> premium bonds are not the kind of savings to which we attach the highest priority and the interest rate used to set the prize fund reflects that <e> <s> it is entirely a matter for the individual where he wishes to invest his money <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat the answer that i have just given <e> <s> the noble lord might offer some advice to his wife but i am sure that she is perfectly capable of making up her own mind <e> <s> speaking for myself i have not the first idea whether my wife has any money in premium bonds <e> <s> it is a matter entirely for her to decide in the light of the circumstances at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for those remarks <e> <s> at the time of the introduction of premium bonds by the chancellor of the exchequer in the then shadow chancellor described them as a squalid raffle <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord asked more or less the same question of my noble friend lord caithness on an earlier occasion when a question of this kind was put down by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i fail to see what this question has to do with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> i merely said that the government do not attach the highest priority to this form of investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i remind her that we have a woman first lord of the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot comment on the second part of my noble friends question <e> <s> however as regards the first part the cost of processing claims is something of the order of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may again remind the house that this government like its predecessors is neutral on the ethical issue of abortion <e> <s> questions relating to time limits have traditionally been matters which successive governments have left to the conscience of individual members of both houses of parliament <e> <s> i should also like to remind the house that as most noble lords recognise we are not talking about time limits as the noble baroness lady jeger suggested we are talking about means of altering those time limits should that ever be necessary <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene in this debate i am not sure whether it is the beginning or the end <e> <s> for the record the abortion act which legalised abortion under certain circumstances does not as the noble lord lord houghton said extend to northern ireland <e> <s> the provisions of that act were not originally introduced in northern ireland because the government considered the reform of social law in the province to be a matter for the devolved government at stormont where views on these matters sometimes differed from those of members of parliament at westminster <e> <s> i am advised that no elected northern ireland politician has ever called for changes in the northern ireland abortion law <e>", "<cs> on the spur of the moment i am not sure how i should answer that question <e> <s> i am sure that if the elected representatives of northern ireland raised this matter it would be taken into consideration by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that it would be for the government to start the process of consultation but if one felt that this was the view of the northern ireland people the northern ireland elected representatives and all the other bodies i mentioned certainly it would be something to be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked about retrospection <e> <s> we are seeking legal advice on this point and my right honourable friend the secretary of state will issue guidance to social fund officers shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered the noble lords second point in my second answer to the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> i said that we are seeking legal advice on the question of retrospection <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state is seeking legal advice on the question of whether there is a retrospective element <e> <s> i cannot go further than that <e> <s> the noble lord might care to glance through the judgment of lord justice woolf which is some pages long <e> <s> he will understand that my right honourable friend cannot immediately come to his own judgment on it without taking legal advice <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make myself perfectly clear <e> <s> my right honourable friend is seeking legal advice on what the judgment will mean with regard to the question of retrospection <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question <e> <s> it is a question of retrospection <e> <s> my right honourable friend is seeking legal advice on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i only used the word fantasy because i thought it was so unlikely that the noble lord and his friends would ever have the chance to put those policies into operation <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree <e> <s> i accept that the inclusion of the mortgage interest <e>", "<cs> my lords it is beginning to work <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on the noble lords comments to my right honourable friend <e> <s> as my noble friend lady hooper says that will probably not be this afternoon because he is busy with other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the original question was about the effect of interest rates on the rpi <e> <s> mortgage interest payments are the only form of interest payments which are included in the rpi <e>", "<cs> my lords the rpi is our measure of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords our measure of the rate of inflation is the rpi <e> <s> it is the best measure that we have and mortgage interest repayment rates are the only form of interest included in the rpi <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat what i have said on many occasions and what my noble friends and colleagues in another place have said <e> <s> interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords we also consider some uprating of the retail prices index without housing costs <e> <s> on this occasion i am talking about the retail prices index <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered that question <e> <s> i said that i was answering in terms of the retail prices index and i shall stick to that answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that retail sales growth picked up in the early part of this year <e> <s> however retail sales are still much lower than in and early <e> <s> retail sales growth in reached per cent <e> <s> compared with a growth rate of per cent <e> <s> in the three months ending in february <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that inflation seems to be winning <e> <s> the all-items inflation rate is lower now than in the middle of <e> <s> the underlying rate as measured by the rpi excluding mortgage interest payments rose by only half a point since the beginning of and is only marginally above the rate in may <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the report and are examining the claims by the pensions investment research consultants <e> <s> however i do not necessarily accept their figures <e> <s> it is obviously a matter for the individual who wishes to take out a personal pension to seek the appropriate advice <e> <s> there are regulatory bodies in the form of lautro and fimbra who will control and regulate those who offer advice to individuals seeking to take out personal pensions <e> <s> our own leaflet np which i believe i have mentioned on a previous occasion states that there is no guarantee of investment results from the money paid into any scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the eventuality to which the noble lord refers is very unlikely as i told him the other day <e> <s> he will also know that my right honourable friend the secretary of state announced further protection for occupational pension schemes only last week <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> under this government the average income of pensioners has risen by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends very much on inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the link between the basic pension and earnings is not the key factor in improving the income of pensioners <e> <s> more important to pensioners is the value of their total income from all sources <e> <s> as my noble friend lord orr-ewing said between and when pensions were increased in line with the higher of movements in prices or earnings the average total net income of pensioners increased by only per cent <e> <s> during our first eight years in office the real terms increase was over per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> under this government the savings income has increased by per cent <e> <s> under the previous labour government it decreased by per cent <e> <s> my noble friend raised also the question of increases in the capital limits in income related benefits <e> <s> there will be around individual gainers as a result of the increases announced by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer over per cent <e> <s> of whom are pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords the pensioners in scotland will benefit in exactly the same way as the pensioners in england <e> <s> we are uprating the system for the whole country at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness lady turner i do not intend to be drawn on the general subject of the community charge <e> <s> we have had ample time to discuss and debate it in this house <e> <s> but having said what she did the noble baroness immediately proceeded to do the opposite and hardly touched on the orders <e> <s> however i am glad that she ended by giving a welcome to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords we know that the ageing part of the population is going to expand <e> <s> it is fairly easy to predict the size of the elderly population for a number of years <e> <s> similarly we know how many entrants there will be into the workforce for at least years <e> <s> thereafter it becomes a matter of speculation because the issue depends entirely on the number of children who are born <e> <s> it is very difficult to make predictions about the size of the birth rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that the elderly are not a burden now or in the future <e> <s> i accept that the elderly have contributed much to the economy and public life particularly in this house during their working lives and as of now <e> <s> my noble friend will also know that we have recently abolished the earnings rule <e> <s> we hope that this may encourage a great many elderly people back into the labour market <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will remember that last october we announced improvements in income support for the over-s <e> <s> that was a package worth an extra million a year for the less well off elderly pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has quite rightly said we shall have time to debate these matters this afternoon <e> <s> in fact we shall be debating them at very great length <e> <s> my understanding is that there will be a great many occasions when there will be positive incentives to produce a package that will provide both better care for the elderly staying at home which will not only cost less but will also provide better value for money and a better service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is a shining example of that asset and i hope that we shall hear a great deal more from her in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board the noble lords suggestions <e> <s> i shall pass them on to my right honourable friend but i make no promises <e>", "<cs> my lords it is many hours since i last rose to respond to a point made by the noble lord lord carter at question time <e> <s> it is now eight-and-a-half hours since my noble friend lady hooper opened the proceedings on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see that it is different at all <e> <s> i do not remember because i was not born but the noble lord may remember that the bma fought the proposals of mr bevan <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that existing beneficiaries will continue to receive care <e> <s> all the trustees have said is that they will have to suspend consideration of new applications as from th april <e> <s> other than that i can only say that we are awaiting the response of the trustees <e> <s> as regards the future of the fund we made clear in our report on disability benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can spell out exactly how the trustees can limit the scope of the fund <e> <s> as i said we are awaiting their response <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the fund was originally set up partly in recognition of the fact that with our reforms some severely disabled people would no longer be able to claim the additional requirements payments for domestic support <e> <s> the fund has never been envisaged as being the only source of income for those who are disabled and might make use of it <e> <s> there are a range of benefits available within the social security system as well as help from local authorities and health authorities <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is why we originally set up the independent living fund and that is why we have expanded the amount of money available to it over the past three years <e> <s> in the current year it will be something in the order of million <e> <s> that is why we have offered an extra million to the fund if it can find some way of limiting the scope <e> <s> the fund was expanding beyond those who were originally covered by the eligibility criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have had to increase the amount available from million to million and now to million that would appear to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made an offer of million <e> <s> that is in addition to million available for this year which was more than double what was available last year <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord kilmarnock appreciates some of the aims behind <e>", "<cs> i shall respond briefly to the noble lords remarks <e> <s> as he said any unit of whatever kind can apply <e> <s> its eligibility for national health service trust status will be considered on its merits <e> <s> to make the position quite clear perhaps i may return to the question of whole districts <e> <s> as i said it might make sense for the full range of services in a district to become nhs trusts <e> <s> however that will only relate to the services in the district <e> <s> the dhas other roles that is planning purchasing and public health must be kept separate <e>", "<cs> i do not think that any amendment was accepted <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend said that she would take it back and consider it <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to digress on the subject of the role of regional health authorities <e> <s> my noble friend referred to that at second reading and it is covered in the white paper <e> <s> perhaps i can start by dealing with one of the points made by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> he asked what type of people will be the new non-executive members of the regional health authorities <e> <s> will they be businessmen <e> <s> the bill says nothing whatever about who the non-executive members will be <e> <s> some will undoubtedly be drawn from the business world but others will be drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds <e> <s> in general they will all have links with the local community through either residence or work and will therefore be sensitive to its needs <e> <s> i can only emphasise that suggestions for membership will be welcomed from all quarters <e> <s> they will no doubt include people who as my noble friend lord jenkin suggested will be local councillors <e>", "<cs> as i said the regional health authorities are strategic bodies accountable directly to the secretary of state <e> <s> the secretary of state is directly accountable to parliament <e> <s> another place is filled with elected representatives from local areas <e> <s> that gives the noble lord all the accountability he asks for <e>", "<cs> a great many elected members of parliament live in their areas <e> <s> i am sure that all good local members of parliament i am sure the noble lord was one when he was in another place hold surgeries <e> <s> they see local councillors <e> <s> the secretary of state is accountable to parliament and in another place there are elected members <e> <s> having said that i hope that the noble lord lord ennals will accept that the amendments are not consistent with our <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may repeat one point <e> <s> suggestions will be welcomed from all quarters <e> <s> as my noble friend lord jenkin said some local councillors might in time be appointed <e> <s> but we do not accept the argument that at least a quarter should be appointed from the local authorities <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord winstanley lord pitt and lord ennals propose that we should include two general practitioners on the fhsas rather than the one proposed in the bill <e> <s> we do not accept that proposal <e> <s> the professional members on the new authorities will not be the only source of professional advice which the authorities will have <e> <s> no individual or even two individuals whatever their background or experience could ever provide the full range of comprehensive advice which fhsas will need in the future <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made an admirably brief speech <e> <s> he suggests in the amendment that local medical committees should have exclusive rights to be consulted over the appointment of all members of the new authorities other than the chairman <e> <s> this we feel is clearly inappropriate <e> <s> under <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have had a useful and wide-ranging debate on the social security bill <e> <s> in time i wish to cover various points <e> <s> because of time limits i intend

what i said <e> <s> as a matter of policy ministers regard themselves as being bound by the confidentiality provisions <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on the comments of the noble lord lord harris to my noble friend <e> <s> if he wishes to comment on them no doubt he will <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question <e> <s> i repeat the answer i gave <e> <s> ministers always feel themselves bound by the confidentiality provisions and it would be wrong to break that binding <e> <s> as i said i shall certainly pass on the remarks of the noble lord to my noble friend the paymaster general <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat what i said as regards the act <e> <s> as the noble lord will know it is later than the act to which he referred <e> <s> specifically the act does not preclude the disclosure by the bank of england of information to the treasury if disclosure and here i accept that possibly i misread the word preclude and said something different does not preclude the disclosure by the bank of england of information to the treasury if disclosure appears to the bank to be desirable or expedient in the interests of the depositors or in the public interest <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for that correction <e> <s> i suspect that it was misreading on my part <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords the law is different in america <e> <s> as i understand it i do not know how much criminal law the noble lords knows in england for a criminal offence to be committed there has to be the <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the guilty mind <e> <s> under american law that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord is correct <e> <s> my understanding is that in the case in florida bcci as a corporation pleaded guilty to some of the charges <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is referring to <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt i shall have to write to the noble lord <e> <s> my understanding is that it pleaded quilty as a corporation and as such accepted its criminal responsibility <e> <s> the case would be different in england but obviously i cannot comment on specific cases <e> <s> there is a difference between english law and american law on the liability of

return of - per cent <e> <s> i repeat that we do not use any particular level of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that comment <e> <s> however as i said we do not <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be some gainers under community charge benefit among those with savings of more than <e> <s> i do not have figures in front of me for those with savings of more than <e> <s> noble lords will know that the limit for community charge benefit was increased from to <e> <s> of those community charge benefit gainers approximately will be pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords they are not expected to achieve any particular rate of return <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is slightly confused <e> <s> while that would imply a rate of return of - per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> one should also take into account the taper <e> <s> as noble lords will know for the community charge the taper is only pence in the pound and therefore for every of income only pence is taken off the community charge benefit <e> <s> if that is taken into account the percentage comes down to - per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know perfectly well and i believe that i have said this to him on a previous occasion when answering a question about premium bonds that it is not my job to advise the noble lord on his investments <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i said that i was not here to advise the noble lord <e>", "<cs> these amendments go to the heart of the new role of the district health authority which is to assess the services needed by its resident population and ensure that they are delivered in the most suitable way by the most appropriate provider <e> <s> the importance of that cannot be underestimated <e> <s> neverthless i hope to persuade the committee that the amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> i also hope to calm any anxieties as the noble baroness lady robson suggested that some anxieties might have been calmed on the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my first undertaking was that the dhas would publish a list of services which the noble lord welcomed <e> <s> i also reassured him that the directors of public health will continue to produce annual health reports and districts will continue to publish plans for service provision <e> <s> does that satisfy him <e>", "<cs> i tried to reassure the noble lord that the existing arrangements whereby each district director of health produces an annual report would continue to be built on <e>", "<cs> this amendment relates to continuity of care <e> <s> it is a very important amendment and concept but i hope that i can persuade the committee that it is unnecessary <e> <s> as the committee will know district health authorities are now subject to the requirement which the amendment seeks to impose <e> <s> in passing i should say that national health service trusts will operate under contracts to ensure continuity of care following the discharge of the patient <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady hooper will write to the noble lord on that point but i shall not comment on it myself <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness and would prefer that people should not use the word processing which as the noble baroness said sounds like peas in a tin or a pod <e> <s> i cannot comment on the particular case to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> no doubt my noble friend would be prepared to look into that <e> <s> however i was trying to say that one hopes that with the new co-operation between the local authorities and health authorities that sort of problem will not arise <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness mean amendment no <e> <s> a rather than amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond on amendraent no <e> <s> moved by my noble friend lady cox after what the noble lord lord peston described as a foolish intervention <e> <s> i do not necessarily agree with that <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble lord that it was foolish for him to intervene <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> b would place a duty on health authorities to consult community health councils and others before entering into contracts as providers of services to residents of other districts <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with the point underlying the amendment <e> <s> it is that the planning and provision of patient services need to be informed by the judgment and expertise of health care professionals <e> <s> it cannot too often be emphasised that the principal object of the governments reforms is to help doctors nurses and other professionals to provide higher standards of service to patients <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows very well that in many parts of the country we already have problems with recruitment <e> <s> that is true not just in the national health service but also in a great many other areas of employment <e> <s> nhs trusts will have the flexibility to respond to that situation <e> <s> it will be up to them to set their own limits <e> <s> as i said there is no incentive for them to push up their prices to such an extent that they cannot compete effectively <e>", "<cs> perhaps i misled the noble lord on the matter <e> <s> the document will be put forward by those applying for trust status <e> <s> as i said there will then be consultation on that document <e> <s> we see no need for there to be a repeat document from the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to increase the political nature of the debate but it is worth correcting some points that the noble lord made <e> <s> i do so purely for the sake of the record <e> <s> he implies that there have been cuts in health spending under the government <e> <s> as he knows perfectly well there has been a growth in real terms since of per cent <e> <s> there has been a growth in spending per capita in real terms of per cent <e> <s> which brings the expenditure on the health service under this government indeed under all governments to an all time high <e>", "<cs> as i said there will be further guidance <e> <s> perhaps i may return to the document put forward by the applicants <e> <s> as i explained that document will cover in some detail quite a range of issues and i spelt them out benefits to patients proposals to develop services and to ensure quality leadership in management arrangements and trusts personnel information and financial matters <e> <s> having had such a wide-ranging document from the applicants for the trust i do not think that it will be necessary for the secretary of state to produce another document on which there would be yet further consultation <e> <s> there would be consultation on the document produced by the applicants for trust status <e>", "<cs> i start by giving an absolutely firm assurance to the noble baroness lady phillips who is not in her place and to the noble lord lord peston who intervened that as my right honourable friend the secretary of state has said on many occasions there is absolutely no intention other than that the national health service trusts shall remain part of the national health service <e> <s> that is not privatisation by the back door and it is positively mischievous to suggest that it is <e>", "<cs> it is for the region to consider consultations <e> <s> the applicants will forward their applications for national health service trust status to the region <e> <s> it is for the region then to consult <e> <s> it is then for my right honourable friend and the region to take into account the consultations to the extent that is necessary <e>", "<cs> this is important <e> <s> i thought the noble lord said that ballots should not be prescriptive and that my right honourable friend or whoever might be the secretary of state would not be bound by them <e> <s> my reading of the three amendments is that they are exactly that and that the secretary of state would be bound by them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will understand that i will not give him an assurance that those words will be written into the bill <e> <s> but i shall repeat if the noble lord would like it the assurance i gave about the commitment of the government and of my right honourable friend to have consultation <e> <s> would the noble lord like me to repeat it now <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that he has read it several times <e> <s> i repeat that assurance and that commitment <e> <s> there will be further guidance as well <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows that will be a matter for the regional health authority to decide after discussion with the individual practice concerned <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the figure of but i believe that practices of over patients would be considered as suitable for this provision if they show an interest in it and the regional health authority thinks they are suitable <e>", "<cs> as did my noble friend lady hooper perhaps i may stress that these schemes will be voluntary <e> <s> practices will arrive at their conclusions as to whether they wish to take part after discussion between the regional health authorities and the practices <e>", "<cs> put simply the region determines the sum and then in directions the secretary of state tells it how to get there <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is asking because it strikes me as being a simple concept <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is on the right track but i shall repeat what i said <e> <s> as the region determines the sum the secretary of state decides on the factors which push the region into determining it <e> <s> that can be done by directions <e> <s> there is nothing new in directions being used and as the noble lord knows it follows normal practices in legislation on financial allocation <e> <s> i quote the example of the rawp system instituted by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> it was achieved by directions and was not regulation based <e> <s> does that answer now satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord and wish to deal with only one other point that he raised <e> <s> he asked about the relationship between fund-holding and what he called the gps contract <e> <s> the contract covers the relationship of all gps fund-holders or not with the health service as a whole <e> <s> fund-holding simply provides opportunities for willing volunteers and again i have no hesitation in stressing that they are volunteers to improve still further the services that they offer <e>", "<cs> obviously i do not accept the suggestion that it would be sensible to have regulations <e> <s> however as i said earlier i can assure the noble lord that when my right honourable friend gives his directions they will include regarding the composition of the list such points as age and sex together with a number of chronically sick and disabled people and other potentially high-cost patients <e> <s> does that assurance help the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i assume that the intention of the amendment is to prevent practices accepting contributions in money or in kind from patients to top up the fund to ensure that they receive treatment under the nhs in a private hospital <e> <s> the government agree that that should not happen <e>", "<cs> the government recognise that there need to be safeguards to ensure that funds are not misspent <e> <s> while the regional health authority will have overall responsibility for the operation of the scheme fhsas will be given the specific responsibility of monitoring practices to ensure that the fund is managed properly <e> <s> practices will be required to submit monthly and annual reports to <e>", "<cs> yes and they can then remove the status from that practice <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peston is correct in his assumption that the budgets are indicative but the noble lords amendments are obviously based on a misconception <e> <s> there will be no new sanction or penalty for simply exceeding the budget and no powers to do so are being sought <e> <s> disciplinary action will as now be contemplated only in the last resort when there is clear evidence of over-prescribing <e> <s> regulations already provide for action to be taken against doctors who prescribe excessively <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will agree that it would not be acceptable for there to be no effective mechanism to take sanctions against doctors who over-prescribe <e> <s> we have discussed with the medical profession how these existing procedures can be modified based on a hearing by a professional committee to develop a fair and equitable system in which the profession and the public can have confidence <e>", "<cs> i do not accept the terms of the amendment <e> <s> as i said funding for - will be million <e> <s> i cannot make any promise that that will be increased by per cent <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord would expect me to isolate any form of finance for special protection <e>", "<cs> quite obviously the noble lord will not expect me to accept that there is under-funding throughout the health services <e> <s> i said earlier at this committee stage and i shall repeat it because i think these figures bear repetition that there has been real terms growth in national health service expenditure between - and - of per cent <e> <s> spending per <e>", "<cs> the noble lord implies that there was no real terms increase <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seemed to be implying that there was no increase <e> <s> he seemed to imply that the inflation figures for the health service should be measured by a different index <e> <s> but we have increased the number of patients who have been treated <e> <s> i do not have the figures before me but if he would care to have those figures i shall certainly make them available <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give my noble friend some reassurance <e> <s> i was trying to say that the noble lord had somewhat exaggerated the tone of the article <e> <s> i have not seen the exact words used by my honourable friend and i shall certainly write to my noble friend when i have done so <e> <s> my understanding was that he was referring only to individual districts and not to under-funding in the national health service as a whole to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> that is the very point of the reforms <e> <s> the money will follow the patients <e> <s> districts will have an incentive to take those patients <e>", "<cs> that is because the reforms have not yet been enacted <e> <s> they will be enacted in time and districts will have the incentive to take those patients <e>", "<cs> my understanding and i repeat it is that my honourable friend was referring only to individual districts and not to the health service as a whole <e>", "<cs> i take it that the noble lord lord peston was speaking purely to the two amendments that of lord kilmarnock and his own amendments nos <e> <s> and yza <e> <s> alternatively was he speaking also to an amendment that comes later amendment no <e> <s> d which i understand has been grouped with these amendments <e> <s> he did not seem to address it <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with the noble lord on the lettering of amendments <e> <s> i should like to join him in a debate on that which might produce a great deal of consensus <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord misunderstood me unless there is misunderstanding on both sides which is always possible <e> <s> i was trying to say that the national audit office is covered in the act by a similar provision to the one which the noble lord is seeking to delete <e>", "<cs> we shall look at the matter <e> <s> i should stress that the provisions as drafted were agreed as satisfactory by all who raised them in another place and the wording was agreed by the audit commission which will have to carry them forward <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that he would like me to have another look at the matter i shall take it away <e> <s> for the moment i would certainly prefer the noble lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend knows we are a listening government and we shall certainly have another look at this point <e> <s> what i have been saying is that the audit commission will be able to undertake value for money studies but not to question the merits of the underlying objectives <e> <s> if the wording agreed in the compromise from another place is not satisfactory i should stress again that the audit commission was fully consulted before the present wording was arrived at we will be prepared to take it away and have another look at it <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e> <s> as i stressed at the beginning local authorities and health authorities are different animals <e> <s> health authorities have their accountability to parliament through management executives and the secretary of state <e> <s> local authorities have to be viewed differently <e> <s> there is different treatment <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord that assurance that the bma was consulted <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting debate <e> <s> perhaps i may start by saying how grateful i am for the support of those members of the committee with local authority background as members of authorities <e>", "<cs> i accept as i accepted before the demographic trend of an increasing number of elderly <e> <s> there is also a per cent <e> <s> increase in real terms which more than covers any increase over the eight or years about which i have been talking of expenditure by local authorities <e> <s> one cannot describe an action which imposes trust in local authorities as being complacent <e>", "<cs> i do not accept that it is <e> <s> we accept the case for specific grants on some occasions and we do not underestimate the usefulness of targeted specific grants in a context which can be clearly defined for example training needs nor of central funds for special initiatives as in the case of the successful care in the community demonstration programme <e> <s> we believe that the proposed specific grant for mental illness is the right kind of vehicle for ring-fenced funds <e> <s> here there is a definable need to move quickly from the very low baseline of current services to the position where local authorities are taking the primary responsibility for the social care of those people in the community who have a mental illness <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not seem to trust the local authorities <e> <s> he asked what local <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has just said and as her noble friend lord carter said earlier this is a very complicated matter <e> <s> i hope that i can assist the committee <e> <s> the provisions of sections and of the national assistance act as amended by the clause we are now considering and of section of the same act as amended by clause of the bill have the effect that a local authority which arranges residential or nursing home care for someone must charge that person the full amount he is assessed as being able to pay in accordance with regulations the secretary of state will be making under section of the act <e> <s> the effect of this will be to leave the person with an amount also to be prescribed in regulations for personal expenses <e>", "<cs> it was an assurance without commitment <e> <s> i said that when our officials had finished considering the matter if there seemed to be a need for an amendment we should return with other suggestions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising this issue which i am glad to tell him has already been addressed in the clause by other means <e> <s> the opening words of subsection specify that local authorities are debarred under it from helping people with the provision of accommodation under sections or of the national assistance act <e> <s> those sections deal with the provision of accommodation <e> <s> if a person leaves residential care or a nursing home to live independently he or she will be able to apply for local authority help with day or domiciliary care on the same basis as anyone else <e> <s> these services are provided under a different legal provision from residential and nursing home care and local authorities are not debarred from providing this help to people with preserved entitlement <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendment is to prescribe the way in which housing benefit should be calculated in cases where a person is provided by his or her local authority with a place in a private or voluntary residential care or nursing home <e> <s> that involves consideration of detailed aspects of the rules affecting social security benefits <e> <s> the committee may therefore find it helpful if i start by outlining the way in which the social security system will provide help to people needing this type of care after april <e>", "<cs> the noble lord presses me to go further <e> <s> the noble lord said that i said his amendment was inappropriate <e> <s> i did not say it was inappropriate but rather that it was inappropriate at this stage <e> <s> i shall continue with my conciliatory remarks <e> <s> i also described the proposal as interesting <e> <s> however i then went on to say that it had serious disadvantages <e> <s> i honestly do not think that i can or would like to go any further tonight other than to say that the department of social security is considering these matters <e> <s> we shall continue the process of consultations with local authorities <e> <s> this has been a useful debate and we shall certainly take on board in our consultations and consideration the views expressed by the noble lord tonight <e>", "<cs> obviously i cannot promise that <e> <s> however as the noble lord knows the whitsun break will come between now and report and therefore we have quite a while before we reach another stage of the bill <e> <s> i make absolutely no promises other than to say that we shall continue our consultations with local authorities in our consideration of these matters <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord with the noble lord lord allen wishes to have a meeting with me or with my officials i am sure that that can be arranged between now and another stage <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we can deal with the matter when we reach clause <e> <s> if this relates to scotland i am sure that my noble friend lord sanderson will be able to deal with my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> we are dealing here with what i consider to be two rather different amendments <e> <s> i hope that i can persuade the noble lord to withdraw the first one and convince him that the second will be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not expect me to respond to that example which depends on various assumptions and details <e> <s> i shall certainly write to him when i have read the exact point that he has made <e>", "<cs> the principle behind the charging arrangements for residential and nursing home care set out in section of the national assistance act as amended by this clause in the bill is that residents should pay as much of the cost of their place in the home as they can afford subject to their being allowed to retain an amount prescribed in regulations for their personal expenses <e> <s> the same rules for working out what residents can afford to pay will apply to homes in all sectors and we shall bring people in local authority homes into line with those in the private and voluntary sector at a cost of million a year <e>", "<cs> i said that it would not be reasonable for such a person to find alternative accommodation where age or infirmity was a factor <e> <s> however i will <e>", "<cs> or infirmity <e>", "<cs> obviously it will take some time for that information to become available <e> <s> it will not be available immediately the arrangements come into effect next april <e> <s> we require information from the local authorities after they have negotiated fees for the homes <e> <s> there is no point at the moment asking local authorities what fees are being charged in their areas because those are not necessarily the true fees <e> <s> we need to know what the fees or charges will be after negotiation by the local authority <e> <s> that is the evidence that we require <e> <s> the information that the noble lord seeks from local authorities at the moment has little value <e>", "<cs> i thought that i made it clear that my right honourable friend would look at local differences <e> <s> that is the point of acquiring evidence from various local authorities <e> <s> i should emphasise that that evidence should concern the cost rather than fees or charges <e> <s> those are two different things <e> <s> that was why i stressed that our present arrangements are very much a blunt instrument <e> <s> as the noble lord knows full well there is always the danger that if one puts up the limit many of the fees would go up <e>", "<cs> i accept that there is a short-term problem here <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend made a mid-year announcement of an extra and at a cost this year of million and at a full-year cost of million in addition to the million that he announced would come into effect this april <e> <s> that is a large sum of money <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals asked that same question and i answered him <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carter spoke of shortfalls in the levels of income support and cited cases <e> <s> there will always be shortfalls whatever may be the limit for the level for income support <e> <s> the noble lord knows full well that if we raised the limit to there would still be shortfalls in some parts of the country <e> <s> it is important to bear in mind that there are still homes below the limits as they are set although i appreciate that there are problems in some areas <e> <s> however i believe that we can find homes in all areas which are below the limits <e> <s> the other point which the noble lord should consider is that if we keep on increasing income support levels as i said before the fees are pushed up <e> <s> that does not help those who are paying their own fees and who are not on income support <e>", "<cs> earlier this evening the noble lord lord allen asked the government to accept a few amendments but i am afraid that i cannot go quite as far as that <e> <s> however i hope that i can assist the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i hope that we are not being discourteous to this committee <e> <s> as i said consideration is still in progress and we are giving the matter much thought <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord carter in moving the amendment but i hope that i can convince him that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said those factors will be covered in the general consideration of the revenue support grant <e> <s> i do not think that it would be wise to pick out two factors and enshrine them in legislation in section of the local government finance act so that they would be given more prominence than others <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is correct <e> <s> obviously we must discuss the implications of the community care proposals with the local authority associations <e> <s> that might lead to slightly different weight being placed on different factors in reaching the ssa on which the rsg is based <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite correct in that we discussed a similar amendment at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> i can only repeat what i said then <e>", "<cs> i cannot make that promise <e> <s> i repeat the assurance that we shall continue the existing arrangements unchanged until we have completed the review <e> <s> i do not think i can give an assurance that we shall necessarily come forward with anything before the bill reaches the end of its course <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord ennals for his kind remarks about my honourable friend mr freeman <e>", "<cs> that is most kind of the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that he will be able to make the same remarks at that time <e> <s> there is no need to say exactly why we need a specific grant for the mentally ill because we dealt with that matter earlier <e>", "<cs> i go no further than saying that it will be a small proportion <e> <s> we do not have in mind that it will meet anything like the totality <e> <s> to some extent the grant is designed to encourage that provision <e> <s> as we said earlier it needs encouragement because it has always been treated very much as a poor relation <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving the government credit for introducing clause <e> <s> i should also like to thank him and the noble baroness for putting down this amendment in such good time <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> when we reach clause i shall speak to it briefly <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that it is a very minor technical amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept the fact that it was put down on friday <e> <s> however all the other government amendments were put down in good time <e> <s> i just thought that i should make that point about the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment tabled in the name of the noble lord was put down in very good time <e> <s> i cannot remember the exact date but perhaps the <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can find the answer to those questions before i reach the end of my speech <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord carter that the issue is a sensitive one and that it is difficult to get the matter right <e> <s> that brings me to a point made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock about people not wanting to make an application <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is aware of subsection which clearly states that it is not merely the dying person who can make an application but it can also be <e>", "<cs> my right honourable friend the minister of state mr nicholas scott said in committee in another place that we would be publishing a draft upon which people would have every opportunity to comment <e> <s> we have consulted a wide range of organisations involved in the care of terminally ill people including help for hospices the association of hospice social workers the sainsbury foundation the marie curie cancer care the association of palliative care and of course the bma <e> <s> we have also consulted individual doctors caring for terminally ill patients and the patients themselves <e> <s> we have commissioned independent research to test the proposed claim form and leaflet and after taking account of the comments received we consulted again before preparing the final printing <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can answer briefly <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that this amendment is not necessary <e> <s> any claim under the terminally ill provisions will be able to be accepted as a claim under the normal provisions if the terminally ill criteria are not met <e> <s> in view of that i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this provision with the other tests for residence and presence in great britain stands in place of contribution conditions <e> <s> it is relatively straightforward to fulfil and ensures that the purpose of the benefit to assist with the costs of long-term disablement in great britain is met <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> i can only go so far as to say that my right honourable friend will consider the matter <e>", "<cs> as the committee will know since we debated the amendments during the course of last years social security bill there have been two significant developments <e> <s> first as the noble lord lord allen said the amendments which we debated included the deaf-blind <e> <s> since then we have been <e>", "<cs> it is now <e> <s> our main concern has been the considerable difficulty of defining the group in legislation <e> <s> the committee will accept that it is very important properly to define the group because we are speaking here about government expenditure <e> <s> to define it in an imprecise manner might lead to much greater expenditure than originally was intended <e> <s> because of that we believe that the number of people who would qualify would not be as low as the supporters of this amendment suggest <e> <s> it would involve substantial additional expenditure over and above the million a year which an extension to people would cost <e>", "<cs> i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i gather that last year we were talking about or so <e> <s> is the noble lord asking what has been the level of take-up <e>", "<cs> if a figure is available i shall make it known to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall ensure that a copy is put in the library and that it is not forgotten as was the response which i owed to the noble lord lord allen <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly reply <e> <s> i believe that figures lie at the heart of this matter <e> <s> it is very important when extending a benefit to get it right so that it is clear how many people will be involved <e> <s> there is considerable disagreement on the figures <e> <s> whatever one feels about either the governments figures or mencaps figures the number is at the heart of the matter <e> <s> even mencap has had to double its estimate <e> <s> it is a very difficult job and more work needs to be done on it before we go any further <e> <s> i have given the committee assurances about the new mobility component in the disability allowance <e> <s> i hope that that will be enough to satisfy the committee at the moment <e>", "<cs> i have read carefully the new clause tabled by my noble kinsman and listened with interest to his speech <e> <s> i must confess he is aware of this because i spoke to him immediately before he moved the amendment to being less than clear as to the intention underlying the amendment <e> <s> at times i became even more confused as he spoke <e> <s> he spoke of whole categories of people being removed from the benefit system <e> <s> i believe he said that neither gypsies nor peers were entitled to benefit from it <e> <s> as far as i know they are not excluded from the system <e> <s> he mentioned three other categories to which i shall come later <e> <s> i shall not say that i feel the amendments are unnecessary i feel that they are worse than that <e> <s> i cannot recommend that the committee accept the amendment for two main reasons <e>", "<cs> it is quite obvious that the two cases are completely different <e> <s> in the case of the national health service bill my right honourable friend must satisfy himself that the resources are adequate <e> <s> here the use of the word adequate for a particular individual inevitably involves a subjective judgment that makes the amendment which seeks equality of treatment meaningless because adequacy will be different in different circumstances <e> <s> the amendment is meaningless in the use of the word adequate which conflicts with the equality of treatment required because the adequacy will be different for different people <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee but i do not consider the amendment to be quite as important as the amendment which the noble lord tabled on friday <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments of the noble baroness and my noble kinsman in opposing the motion that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> there are good reasons for introducing the clause with which i shall deal in a moment <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had dealt with that matter <e> <s> i have given an assurance that those benefits will continue to be reviewed as of now and uprated where a decision to uprate is made <e>", "<cs> the government have already provided in <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble baroness that assurance <e> <s> however if she will allow me i shall look again at the matter between now and the next stage of the bills proceedings <e> <s> i cannot go any further <e>", "<cs> i was not giving the noble baroness an assurance that the government would bring forward an amendment <e> <s> i imagined that she would wish to return to the matter on report <e> <s> i said that we would look again at the matter and if necessary discuss the matter further at that stage <e>", "<cs> that is why i am confused <e> <s> for some reason i thought that the amendment tabled in the noble lords name and that of my noble kinsman would be included in this grouping for discussion <e> <s> i do not know whether that is correct <e>", "<cs> in that case we shall discuss amendment no <e> <s> some time tomorrow evening <e>", "<cs> it is a complicated matter <e> <s> in clause and the amendments we are attempting for the <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble kinsman will not mind repeating his last remark i am sorry that i did not catch it <e> <s> i was talking to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> there are occasions when it is important to try to re-establish the policy intention <e> <s> we tried once and we are making a second attempt <e> <s> i do not think it right that there should be a situation where claimants receive windfall payments when it was never intended that they should <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble baroness is saying <e> <s> however there always was this policy intention it existed for years and the courts in later years said that we were wrong <e> <s> we changed the law <e> <s> the situation continued for some time and then the courts said that we were wrong again <e> <s> i know what the noble baroness is saying that we are changing the law <e> <s> however on this occasion in order to prevent large numbers of what one could call windfall payments with people receiving payments when it was never intended that they <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble baroness said about the danger of retrospective legislation <e> <s> we are trying to put the statute right as the noble baroness says that we ought <e> <s> she then complains that it is retrospective <e> <s> i believe that on this occasion quite a number of claimants would receive windfall payments in a manner that parliament never intended <e> <s> one has a duty to the treasury and public funds to see that on this occasion there is justification for <e>", "<cs> i hoped that i had given justification for a small degree of retrospection on this one occasion <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can take this any further <e> <s> i moved amendment no <e> <s> and spoke to the other amendments <e> <s> i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> it is rather complicated <e> <s> the final amendment amendment no <e> <s> is to safeguard the interests of the legal aid board <e> <s> where the lone parent is legally aided for the original proceedings the legal aid board can recover any money still outstanding in respect of the cost of that action from an award of arrears of maintenance ordered to be paid as a lump sum <e> <s> the provision safeguards the interests of the legal aid board <e> <s> does that satisfy my noble kinsman <e>", "<cs> i did not notice that we had discussed schedule <e> <s> sadly by odd procedural moves of the noble baroness opposite we have been prevented from discussing it <e> <s> the noble lord lord byron had some amendments down and i am sure we would all have taken a great interest in considering them but he was unable to move them <e> <s> it is in the interests of the legal aid board <e> <s> i do not think that the child will lose out just as the noble earl knows full well that under section of last years act which would have been affected by schedule i it would not be a case where the individual lost out <e>", "<cs> i think i had better come back in detail on that <e> <s> i do not think that that is the case but perhaps the noble earl will accept my assurances to that extent and allow me to press the amendments <e> <s> i shall write to him to make sure that i have got the position right and to make sure that he understands what i have been saying <e> <s> i commend the amendments to the committee <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord carter said we are on familiar territory <e> <s> members of the committee will remember the important debate on this very subject during consideration of the national health service and community care bill only days ago <e> <s> on that occasion the committee decided quite rightly not to go ahead with the amendments <e> <s> i hope that as before i shall be able to persuade the mover of the amendments to withdraw them because <e> <s> i believe that the measured steps the government are taking in this matter are the right and proper response <e> <s> in doing so i should like to <e>", "<cs> i touched upon that matter in the previous debate at which the noble lord may not have been present <e> <s> it was put to me by one of the noble lards opposite that evidence provided by the voluntary sector was by definition because it was not provided for pr of it evidence of the true cost <e> <s> i do not necessarily accept that point <e> <s> merely because a body does not make a pr of it does not mean that it provides the most efficient and cost-effective service <e> <s> that is not necessarily the evidence that we need <e> <s> we must seek proper evidence after april when local authorities will be negotiating not just with the voluntary sector but with the private sector and any other sector that there happens to be <e> <s> at that stage we shall obtain the true costs <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may start with the question of costs <e> <s> my noble kinsman estimated costs at about million <e> <s> i am not sure how he arrived at that figure <e> <s> obviously it would depend on the additional amount to be paid but i suggest that costs could be considerably higher <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl care to elucidate <e>", "<cs> i was asking whether it would be purely a question of the complete absence of cooking facilities or of cooking facilities being available but inadequate <e> <s> the noble earl said that the department of the environment spoke of per cent <e> <s> being inadequate <e> <s> obviously there would still be borderline cases where someone would have to judge what was adequate and what inadequate <e> <s> the noble earl said that on that occasion it was per cent <e> <s> there is the other per cent <e> <s> there will be cases which are borderline between the two <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord russell quoted a department of the environment report which stated that per cent <e> <s> of services were inadequate <e> <s> one still has to decide as regards the others whether or not the facilities are inadequate <e> <s> there is always a borderline <e> <s> that is all <e> <s> the noble lord may try to be clever with percentages <e> <s> i am trying to suggest that it is a difficult matter of judgment <e>", "<cs> i have not yet had an opportunity to read the report which has been referred to but i shall do so as soon as possible <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendments but i should like to say something about the governments proposals for carers <e> <s> the new carers premium worth up to per week will provide significant extra help for less well off carers <e> <s> as the sponsors of this amendment propose the money will go to people entitled to receive invalid care allowance or who have a more valuable benefit which overlaps it <e>", "<cs> as i said we shall continue to monitor the situation <e>", "<cs> provided my voice survives i shall reply to both amendments <e> <s> i listened carefully to what the noble lord and the noble earl had to say on the amendment which seeks to introduce further concessions for people in income support <e> <s> i say further concessions because i think the committee will want to know the full nature of the help already provided to people in these circumstances <e> <s> i can assure the committee that people entering this type of accommodation are not immediately required to give up their previous home <e> <s> indeed many if not all of them will have every intention of returning home to take up where they left off before they moved <e> <s> quite understandably they or their relatives on their behalf may not want to commit themselves too quickly to living permanently in residential accommodation so for some their stay in that accommodation may at first be temporary <e>", "<cs> it may be of use in the debate if i intervene at this stage and speak fairly briefly <e> <s> i shall speak again at the end of the debate before the noble lord lord carter decides what to do about his amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be of use to the committee if i speak now <e> <s> i reassure the noble lord that i will answer his and any other points towards the end of the debate before the noble lord lord carter concludes and decides what to do about his amendment <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that a total of seven have been awarded six to widows whose husbands died as a result of the two diseases and one to a war pensioner <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may correct the noble earl <e> <s> what i have just been saying and what the nrpb figures have shown is that there is no higher rate of cancer among this group than among the rest of the population <e> <s> that is why we used a control group of another people who had the same background of serving but not near nuclear tests <e> <s> it is only with the two cancers that i have mentioned multiple myeloma and leukaemia excluding chronic lymphatic leukaemia that there seems to be a slightly higher rate <e> <s> in that case we have accepted that that could be attributable service and we are awarding pensions as a result <e>", "<cs> i tried to make it clear perhaps i did not make it clear enough that his widow would be entitled to put her claim back <e> <s> if the war pensioner died of one of the diseases that i mentioned i am <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said that as a layman he found it difficult to distinguish <e> <s> all of us here with perhaps one or two exceptions are laymen <e> <s> obviously we have to take advice on these matters <e> <s> i am advised that it is quite easy for medical experts to distinguish between the cancers <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend stressed the special nature of the war pensions scheme <e> <s> he has a great deal of experience <e> <s> it is important to stress as i did at the beginning of the debate that the standard of pro of is merely that we ask that where a reasonable doubt is shown the benefit of that reasonable doubt shall be given to the claimant <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the nrpb will be aware of this debate <e> <s> i shall make sure that it is aware of the comments made by my noble friend and other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> if any new evidence should appear before the date mentioned from whatever source it is still open to the doctors in the war pensions branch of my department at norcross to consider whether that evidence applied to the individual claimant and whether as a result of our standards of pro of any claimant was eligible for a war pension <e> <s> for that reason i stress what my noble friend emphasised the generous onus of pro of with regard to war pensions <e>", "<cs> what i have been trying to stress is that approximately people took part <e> <s> the control group was a similar size <e> <s> i appreciate that there might be oddities in one town of where the figures are higher but it is not a big enough sample <e> <s> we have taken a sample the same size as the group of those who took part in the tests <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is absolutely correct <e> <s> the noble lords noble friend lord parry stated that in that case he thought it was either multiple myeloma or leukaemia <e> <s> on those facts it is likely that the widow could be eligible <e> <s> however i cannot adjudicate on the matter at the dispatch box <e> <s> no doubt with the support of the noble lord and my honourable friend the member of parliament for that area mr bennett she will receive every reassurance <e> <s> i give the noble lord the assurance that the war pensions department itself will look at the case <e> <s> i do not know whether the widow has already made a claim and been turned down <e> <s> in that case we shall ensure that it goes to appeal <e>", "<cs> having dealt with that matter i wish to answer a few other points made by noble lords of a factual nature <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter mentioned the memo of th may <e> <s> it stated that tests were vital to discover detailed effects of various types of explosions on equipment stores and men without various types of protection <e> <s> this is true <e> <s> tests were carried out and for the purposes of the test articulated dummies were used <e> <s> at no time during the united kingdom tests were humans used as guinea pigs <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl speaking to the three amendments in the grouping amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> that is my understanding <e> <s> if he is not it would be quite useful to know <e>", "<cs> my noble kinsman concentrated on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> bearing in mind the long debate we had on amendment no <e> <s> and to a lesser extent on amendment no <e> <s> i shall follow him and concentrate on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> a great many of the points on his later amendments have to some extent been covered <e>", "<cs> i accept that pregnancy can occur at ages both above and below <e> <s> i do not know whether there is an increased likelihood either way <e> <s> the matter of groupings is one for negotiation between the usual channels <e> <s> my understanding is that the amendments were grouped <e> <s> as the noble baroness will know the note at the top of the groupings list reads <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether noble lords opposite can manage to do so on two nights in a row <e>", "<cs> when we devised the social fund we made it clear that the scheme should operate flexibly but within strict financial limits <e> <s> we considered that the best way of achieving this was through a budget and a number of directions issued by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> this was clearly spelt out in the white paper <e>", "<cs> the government fully share the concern for the homeless but i feel that this amendment is not the right way forward <e> <s> i am not sure that this is the moment for a general debate on homelessness <e> <s> we should stick to the question of deposits <e>", "<cs> i do not have the figures for rent in advance <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that of all claims in the crisis category per cent <e> <s> are successful <e> <s> if i can find the figures for rent in advance i shall certainly let the noble lord know <e> <s> for all claims in that category the figure is per cent <e>", "<cs> i spoke on the generality of the clause when speaking to the first amendment in the name of the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> the committee will be aware that similar but by no means identical amendments were introduced when the bill was in another place <e> <s> those amendments sought completely <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord hylton thinks that we have treated many of the previous amendments with lack of sympathy <e> <s> i regret that i cannot accept this amendment but i hope that i can make some perhaps more sympathetic noises which might go some way toward pleasing my noble kinsman and other noble lords <e> <s> i do not know whether that will be the case but i shall certainly try <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble baroness is trying to be very helpful and i think she is being helpful in trying informally as it were to tighten the amendment and bring it down from merely invalidity benefit and severe disablement allowance which is <e> <s> the object of the amendment to just this one group <e> <s> i imagine that this is a group which it might be quite easy to define carefully for the purposes of such amendment as the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> i cannot give her at this stage and it is very unlikely that i shall be able to do so the reassurance that she would like other than to repeat what i said at the end of my remarks namely that we accept that the scheme is a new scheme and in time we shall have to look at how it develops and the changes that may have to be made to it <e>", "<cs> it is quite a relief to have reached clause <e> <s> it is nice to see the noble baroness at the dispatch box <e> <s> she has been kept waiting in the slips all afternoon although i know that she had a brief warm-up earlier <e> <s> i imagine that she and i will have much to discuss this evening particularly after dinner <e>", "<cs> it will be in order for the noble baroness to make her point at this stage <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is correct in her reading of what is proposed <e> <s> i think that it is preferable to insert complete months in place of the wording <e>", "<cs> i understood that we were to debate my noble friends amendments with that of the noble baroness <e> <s> i thought that at this stage i should be in a happy position somewhere in the middle <e> <s> obviously that is not so because the noble baroness has decided to deal with her amendment separately <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i thought that the amendments were to be taken together and that i should find myself in the happy position of being in the middle <e> <s> obviously that is not to be the case <e>", "<cs> we are becoming a little bogged down in this government amendment on which we have now spent minutes <e> <s> i have come under fire from my noble friend before but i do not think that he has ever gone so far as to accuse me and my noble friends of being like stalin and even worse of being much the same as noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness does not go round committing the culpable crime of vulpicide with great frequency <e> <s> as the noble baroness said it is not of ten that an amendment tabled in advance to a social security bill achieves the topicality which the noble baroness has achieved on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be brief in response to this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> it is with some foreboding that i respond to the noble baroness on this issue <e> <s> not only has she presented her case as she always does very clearly but as i believe i said at second reading she brings a wealth of experience as a member of the occupational pensions board <e> <s> it was the opb which produced the report commending a tribunal <e> <s> my noble friend has also intervened and stated that ombudspersons i think he said were proliferating like a flood <e> <s> some might say the same is true of tribunals <e> <s> however everyone will agree that one or the other is necessary on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider my noble friends points <e> <s> i can answer his first question by <e>", "<cs> earlier i was accused of being stalin <e> <s> now i am accused by different noble friends of being a corporatist <e> <s> as my noble friend quite rightly said the effect of his amendment would be to remove the provisions whereby the determinations or directions of the pensions ombudsman could be enforceable in the courts <e> <s> in other words the proposal is that it should be entirely voluntary whether or not the trustees or manager of the scheme concerned choose to comply with the pensions ombudsmans ruling <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised at the opposition of the noble baroness lady turner to this amendment <e> <s> i am surprised and have been surprised in the past by her repeated opposition to personal pensions and the whole success of the personal pensions initiative <e> <s> i feel that she should welcome the success of the government <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require that when a company becomes insolvent and an independent trustee is appointed to the pension scheme all the trustees would have to consider the welfare of scheme members only <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard and possibly my noble friend are aware that the amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> there are sufficient powers in the bill to do in regulations what they wish to do <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord slightly misunderstood me <e> <s> i referred to a report by the national association of pension funds <e> <s> it then issued a code of practice aimed at stopping new self-investment but also aimed at running it down where it already existed <e> <s> we agree with that body and with the opb that in the main self-investment is an undesirable practice <e> <s> as i have said we want <e>", "<cs> i am not sure what the answer is <e> <s> i shall let my noble friend know as soon as i can <e>", "<cs> certain of the provisions in this bill will ensure that if a scheme winds up employers will have to ensure that members receive pension increases at the prices per cent <e> <s> rate for rights built up after an appointed day <e> <s> for pension rights built up before then increases will depend on what has already been guaranteed as a result of these provisions and on any additional surplus emerging when the scheme winds up <e> <s> any deficiency in the schemes assets will count as a debt on the employer <e> <s> our aim is to see that if an employer winds up a pension scheme the members receive the benefits to which they are entitled <e>", "<cs> the speech by the noble baroness reminds us of some of the reasons why the occupational pensions board was asked by the then secretary of state for social services to provide a report on various issues relating to occupational pensions <e> <s> one of the issues was the involvement of pension schemes in company mergers and takeovers <e> <s> as the boards report makes clear <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that she had come to the end of her list of amendments on pensions but there is one more for myself following hers <e> <s> this amendment seeks to give the secretary of state power to appoint member representatives as trustees of pension schemes and to give these member representatives a majority of voting rights among scheme trustees <e> <s> to do so it would have to override the rules already laid down in pension schemes for appointing trustees <e>", "<cs> we accept these entirely technical amendments while we consider the implications of the decision on clause and schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to overturn a long-standing practice that the treasury should always be formally involved in the approval of secondary legislation when it chooses to do so <e> <s> the reason for that is simple <e> <s> as the guardian of public expenditure the treasury must always be able to concern itself when ministers authority to make regulations brings with it the power to introduce new spending commitments <e> <s> the bill therefore allows the treasury to insist that its consent is sought and given on any issue <e> <s> in practice it is a right not of ten exercised but it is clearly one which the treasury should have <e> <s> it is moreover a power that is not restricted to social security legislation but which applies across government <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how to respond to that remark <e> <s> as i explained last evening when i spoke to various government amendments on this provision in moving amendment no <e> <s> to which my amendments after amendment no <e> <s> were <e>", "<cs> we debated these amendments on monday <e> <s> as my noble kinsman said we debated and agreed to amendment no <e> <s> to which these amendments are attached <e> <s> on tuesday my noble kinsman pressed the matter to a division <e>", "<cs> i do not have the answer to that question but i shall certainly let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is talking about occupational maternity pay rather than statutory maternity pay <e> <s> it would be a mistake to become bogged down in a discussion on the national health service and community care bill as further stages of that bill remain <e> <s> my understanding is that people would transfer to the new nhs trusts on existing terms <e> <s> thereafter it would be a matter for employees and the nhs trusts to arrange employment conditions as they wished <e> <s> all this bill lays down is that the two sets of pay will be aggregated so as to avoid a condition whereby there might be two sets of pay both of which were below the limit <e> <s> the noble lord may wish to come back to the point at the next stage of the national health service and community care bill but on this bill i do not think it is a valid point <e>", "<cs> rather than explain the rational <e>", "<cs> of course there is a rationale <e> <s> but as i said rather than explain it i should like to say to my noble kinsman and to the noble lord that we have considerable sympathy for the spirit of the amendment and would like to consider it further <e> <s> however obviously i must point out that it goes wider than asylum seekers although i appreciate that asylum seekers were the subject of my noble kinsmans remarks <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i must say that i am sorry the noble lord feels disappointed in the answers that he has received for the second time in two weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry it was the same week <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question <e> <s> i said no <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> i should like to make one point about the effect of inflation <e> <s> when the noble lords party were in government income from savings for pensioners actually went down <e> <s> over the past eight years savings income for pensioners because we have inflation more or less under control has increased by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not be drawn into a discussion on salary inflation <e> <s> the question on the order paper is about the uprating of the state retirement pension <e> <s> as i stated at the beginning the state retirement pension is uprated annually in line with the retail prices index <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a completely different question and one which goes quite beyond the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct there is a lag <e> <s> however any increase in inflation after september will obviously be taken into account in the next uprating <e> <s> the noble lord seems to think that with computerisation we would be able to cut down on the time between the uprating period of september to april <e> <s> i am advised that that is not possible and even if it were we would not be able to reduce it by more than two or three months compared to the existing six-month period <e> <s> therefore there always has to be a lag but this only exists when inflation is rising the minute inflation comes down the pensioner benefits because the rpi for september to september will be higher than it is in april <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to carry out the uprating on the historic basis <e> <s> this means that we have to have delay between the uprating period and the time when the increased pensions are paid <e> <s> we could return as happened before to a basis of forecasting inflation but that is far more unreliable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for those very helpful remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not necessarily accept the figure given by the noble lord <e> <s> as i stated earlier the most important aspect to look at is not the basic state retirement pension but the average incomes of pensioners which have increased by about per cent in real terms over the years that we have been in office whereas when the noble lords friends were in office it increased by a mere per cent over six years which is per cent per year <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wants figures just on total social security benefits i can assure him that the increase in real terms for pensioners who are dependent purely on social security benefits is about per cent compared to a mere per cent when the noble lords friends were in office <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggests that we remove clause so as to make merger between fpcs fhsas as they will be and dhas possible <e> <s> subjection does not rule out merger it does not make it impossible <e> <s> but it would need primary legislation <e> <s> subsection does not prevent it if the noble lord follows my argument <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to ask another place <e> <s> that provision was in response to amendments put forward in another place <e> <s> i do not think they were government amendments <e> <s> although it is called a family health services authority it is not an authority as defined by the principal act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that everybody will not be confused because i have explained to the house that the fhsas are not health authorities as defined <e> <s> the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord kilmarnock will make matters even less clear <e>", "<cs> my lords it is report stage but i will give way <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not make it clear <e> <s> the fpcs have been renamed authorities and we felt that it was important to make it doubly clear to avoid any confusion over the new title <e> <s> to remove subsection would create further confusion and leave the matter open to doubt which i am sure is not the intention of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we will look at it <e> <s> it was something which emerged at committee stage in another place <e> <s> i cannot remember the name of the predecessor to fhsas after fpcs <e> <s> perhaps dare one ask <e> <s> another place may have got it slightly wrong <e> <s> we will be prepared to look at an alternative to authority if the noble baroness or any noble lord can come forward with an alternative <e> <s> i leave the matter there <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly give the undertaking that i shall put to my right honourable friend the confusion in which this house found itself <e> <s> i am sure that the house is no longer confused because i have explained what the form is <e> <s> but i promised to take this away and possibly we can come forward with a better title <e> <s> they have already had a couple of attempts in another place but as i said earlier perhaps we can do better <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said we considered a similar amendment in committee <e> <s> i hope again to show that the amendment is unnecessary although obviously i understand the fears of the noble lord lord ennals <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i thought that i made it clear that circular and its accompanying booklet <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems rather late at night to have to refute yet again the allegations of underfunding that the noble lord lord pitt put to us <e> <s> however i have a duty to do so and i shall do so <e> <s> i shall repeat what my noble friend lady hooper and ministers in the department of health have said before which is that there is no underfunding <e> <s> we have increased spending in real terms by some per cent in the years or more that we have been in office <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i shall not give way <e> <s> i now wish to return to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ennals some time ago <e> <s> as my noble friend lady hooper said in committee the bills proposals are designed to assist gps to obtain the best available services for their patients <e> <s> contracts will be particularly helpful in this respect because they will allow resources to move more freely to the hospitals that are most popular with gps and their patients <e> <s> at the present time gps <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that the district will not challenge the gps choice unless it can be proven that the proposed referral by the gp was not wholly justified <e> <s> it is a matter of proving that the gp has not chosen correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the legal liability in that case would rest with the person who had committed the tort in other words the doctor or with the health authority which is responsible for that hospital <e> <s> however that is a legal point and i had better come back to the noble baroness on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene briefly because i should have dealt with that point more fully <e> <s> it will be a matter for the independent clinicians at the regional health authority if there is a dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can answer the arguments on the amendment briefly <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord kilmarnock for reading out most of paragraphs and of <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained in committee that no special legislation is needed to secure the position of regional and supra-regional services <e> <s> in a legal sense this is simply because district health authorities will have a clear duty to ensure that a comprehensive range of services is available to their residents <e> <s> this must include services which need to be provided on a regional or supra-regional basis <e>", "<cs> my lords establishing close links with the community they serve will be a key aspect of the dhas new role <e> <s> however this does not mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble lord does not wish to engage in a long discussion on contract law <e> <s> it is a long time since i took my bar exams and my memory of contract law is somewhat hazy <e> <s> can i stress again that as the noble lord knows well nhs contracts are not the same as contracts in contract law <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment cuts across the arrangements that exist already to help people travel to hospital <e> <s> the scope and extent of these arrangements are not affected in any way by this bill <e> <s> ambulances or other forms of hospital transport will continue to be provided free of charge for all patients for whom this is medically necessary <e> <s> guidance has already been issued on the way in which these transport services will fit into the contractual system <e> <s> the most appropriate approach is likely to be for health care providers to arrange transport in support of their services <e> <s> this will make it easier to integrate transport services into the overall package of patient care <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first say that i fully accept the need for national health service trusts to have proper professional and particularly medical advice in order to manage and develop their services <e> <s> we have as the house will know already made clear that most trusts will have medical and nursing directors on their boards which will ensure that there is proper input at the very highest level of management <e> <s> but clearly that will need to be supplemented by advice at other levels in the trust <e> <s> where i differ from the noble lord moving the amendment is in respect of the way in which trusts should obtain such advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be the first to admit that the rate of inflation is high far too high <e> <s> we believe that our policies will bring it down and <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend that figure immediately <e> <s> although the united kingdom rate of inflation is higher than that of our competitors all reputable commentators agree that our measure of inflation is seriously out of line with the consumer price indices of nearly all other countries because of the inclusion of mortgage interest payments <e> <s> that obviously has a perverse effect in that measures intended to reduce inflation push it up in the short term <e> <s> despite those distortions we are determined to get inflation down but we must take a realistic view of how high inflation is in relation to other countries <e> <s> we feel that our measure of inflation at the moment distorts that comparison <e>", "<cs> my lords as i and my colleagues have said before on various occasions interest rates will remain as high as necessary for as long as necessary in order to bring down inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be easier if my noble and learned friend asked his noble friend sitting beside him on the benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i saw the article in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not quite follow what the noble lord suggests <e> <s> obviously if my right honourable friend calculates the average for the entire european community it includes this country <e> <s> as the noble lord is well aware we are a member of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not bandy statistics with the noble lord <e> <s> i said that the average for other oecd countries was per cent <e> <s> that obviously includes this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer my noble friend back to my noble friend lord cockfield who first raised the matter of the gdp deflator <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows full well that the department of employment or for that matter the entire government do not indulge in statistical manipulation <e> <s> i said that the headline figure for rpi was per cent <e> <s> but that that had serious weaknesses <e> <s> i referred to the <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the government consider all possible ways of bringing inflation down but i can only repeat what i said earlier which is that interest rates will remain as high as is necessary for as long as is necessary to win the battle against inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will remember well a full page advertisement which i believe appeared in all the major newspapers and which was signed by some economists <e> <s> i believe that that advertisement appeared before the previous election or perhaps even a little earlier than that <e> <s> all those economists were wrong and they were proved to be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe my noble friend is wrong because we are on the third question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that everyone in the house welcomes the clause generally <e> <s> all noble lords recognise that there are problems of definition <e> <s> i do not see the amendment as being the way forward <e> <s> i hope that i can convince the noble lord lord kilmarnock that that is the case <e> <s> if he <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss intervention has not been helpful <e> <s> she will be aware that clause was brought forward as a result of representations on this matter made during the passage of last years bill <e> <s> the government have responded <e> <s> there are as all noble lords have accepted great difficulties over definition <e> <s> we have tried to find a way around the difficulties and we are finding a way around them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble lord about the details on the form that the doctor would have in front of him <e> <s> i am not sure what the position is but i shall let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can take the noble lord much further today <e> <s> as he knows at the previous stage i stated that my right honourable friend the minister of state for social security had said in another place during the committee stage that he would examine this provision <e> <s> he intends to consider the area of non-contributory benefits in general as i said on the last occasion <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that it would be right to examine this entitlement as part of that consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall respond later to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have already discussed the amendment with the noble baroness <e> <s> perhaps i may also say that i am happy to investigate any individual cases of difficulty such as the one mentioned by my noble kinsman lord russell as is the training agency <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that my noble friend lord renton explained why he disagreed with the amendment on other than technical grounds but so be it <e> <s> the amendment seeks to give the over- rate of personal allowance to certain income support claimants under that age who have to live away from home <e> <s> it also introduces similar provisions for young <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble kinsman spoke of the position of junior ministers at the dispatch box <e> <s> i thought he intended to quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that there were about vacancies throughout the country in march of this year <e> <s> i also repeated the governments guarantee that all young people will he able to take up a yt place <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would abolish the lower applicable amount for young people aged under in housing benefit only <e> <s> it would have the effect of basing the calculation of housing benefit on the full adult rate of personal allowance in all cases irrespective of age or personal circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will recall that this matter was raised in committee and that similar amendments were also discussed during the passage of last years social security bill <e> <s> quite frankly there is little that i can add to what last year my noble friend lord skelmersdale said and i have already said on those matters <e> <s> i do not propose therefore to rake over all the old ground as to why the government introduced the benefit changes for people living in bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> having said that i accept as the noble lord lord hylton said that bed and breakfast accommodation is not ideal <e>", "<cs> my lords when i responded to the amendment in committee i said that i was less than clear as to the intention underlying it <e> <s> i think i can say that i am still less than clear as to the intention behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly need to take advice on my noble friends point <e> <s> but certainly in relation to the other groups that i specified we discriminate we make no bones about it in favour of certain groups <e> <s> i have explained why we do so and which groups they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i accept that <e> <s> i have received some advice <e> <s> i refer to the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on war widows <e> <s> war widows have special disregards under the income related benefits <e> <s> they benefit therefore under the social security system <e> <s> the noble earls amendment would not allow that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness explained she tabled an identical amendment to this at committee stage <e> <s> this debate is therefore a re-run of the one we had on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> of course we do not want to overburden industry with such expense <e> <s> however we have seen a growth over the past years from some per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in long-term coverage <e> <s> in terms of short-term sick pay it is about per cent <e> <s> if over these past few years when there has not been the tighter employment market industry has been able to expand from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> i see no reason why that progress cannot continue <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another amendment which we discussed in committee and i can only repeat what i told the noble baroness on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baronesses have explained the amendment would require the government to amend the tax rules for occupational and personal pension schemes to allow them to pay a pension to persons in receipt of invalidity benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> it is now five years since the government commissioned the office of population censuses and surveys to carry out a major survey of the circumstances of disabled people <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord carter does not seem to think much of that survey <e> <s> as has frequently been pointed out to us that is a considerable length of time in the lives of many of these disabled people who may or may not be receiving some of the current range of disability benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble baroness saw my honourable friend mrs shephard <e> <s> i can assure her that she would have received equally pleasant treatment from my right honourable friend mr scott <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hylton has completely missed the point <e> <s> of course we shall continue to pay the costs of people in homes <e> <s> i believe that expenditure in this field has gone up from some million a year to something well over billion in the past years <e> <s> what we are discussing here is the maximum amount which the government will allow for income support for people in homes <e> <s> noble lords opposite feel that the amount is inadequate and have pressed this point again and again <e> <s> i hope i can assure them and the noble baroness that we have done something <e> <s> i shall try to respond to the various points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord said that these are merely probing amendments <e> <s> i totally reject what he said regarding fund-holding practices but as he will appreciate the amendment refers to the general principle of fund-holding budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been some slippage on procedure <e> <s> it is report stage <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to put a question so be it but the general rule is that no one intervenes after the minister has spoken other than the mover of the amendment <e> <s> however on this occasion if the noble lord wishes to ask a question he may <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord misunderstood <e> <s> the budget holding practice may say that they do not wish to be a budget holding practice and therefore will go back to their original status <e> <s> if they wish to have budget holding status they will only accept that position if they feel that the amount of money offered is sufficient <e> <s> that is all i said <e>", "<cs> my lords a budget-holding practice before it agrees to become one or if it wishes to continue as one will have to satisfy itself that the resources offered to it by the region are sufficient for what it considers are its patients needs <e> <s> surely that must answer the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until minutes before nine oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal first with the anomaly which according to the noble lord lord kilmarnock exists between part iii and the health side of the bill <e> <s> i thought that i had made myself clear at committee stage if i did not i do so now <e> <s> there is no anomaly here <e> <s> the community care services are managed by the local authorities <e> <s> at the end of the day the nhs is directly accountable to parliament through the secretary of state <e> <s> that is the key difference <e> <s> local authorities and the nhs are very different animals <e>", "<cs> my lords we share the noble lords view of the importance of services for elderly and disabled people which as he would be one of the first to point out do not have the glamour that certain other services possess <e> <s> however this amendment would provide a fairly poor mechanism for improving them <e> <s> for a start services would have to reach a demonstrably inadequate state before action would be taken to improve them <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that my noble friends interpretation is correct <e> <s> regarding the points made by the noble lord lord carter i look forward to amendment no <e> <s> which we shall discuss later today <e> <s> i shall have to consider his second point and come back to him on the matter <e> <s> if there is a suitable moment during the consideration of some other amendment i shall respond at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as the movers of the amendment the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord carter said we have been over this ground <e> <s> we have been over it once before on this bill and twice on the social security bill <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the movers of the amendment that when we last went over the ground as they put it on th may which was the sixth day of the committee stage of the bill the committee divided on an amendment that was virtually identical <e> <s> it decided by votes to to reject that amendment <e> <s> it is quite wrong and improper for noble lords to come back again with virtually the same amendment on the same bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the amendment had virtually the same effect <e> <s> the amendment was rejected by the committee on that occasion <e> <s> it is not right that the noble baroness and the noble lord should bring it back on a later occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that remark <e> <s> i have no idea how the clerks decide what is right or wrong <e> <s> the noble baroness knows full well that the effect of her amendment is virtually identical to that of the previous amendment although the wording is very different <e> <s> the previous amendment was much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if the noble lord lord peston felt that i was ratty as he put it in my response to the noble lord lord carter and the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i was being perfectly fair <e> <s> it is obvious that the amendment has exactly the same effect as the one moved previously <e> <s> it was right and fair of me to state that clearly in order that your lordships were aware that we had debated the subject at great length on three separate occasions <e> <s> indeed the subject was debated at great length in another place <e> <s> we have voted on an amendment which had a virtually identical effect <e> <s> as i then said the effect was the blank cheque book approach as is the effect of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may point out that i found the <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> as always the governments arguments were totally unconfused and very sound <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i should not want it to go down on record that i had been rude to the noble lord <e> <s> i said that when the noble lord lord carter gave the figure of that that was the worst case figure <e> <s> under no circumstances would i say that the noble lord lord carter had presented the worst possible case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for making that point <e> <s> it certainly would be an interesting task for the courts and provide a very interesting income for our colleagues at the bar and for the rest of the legal profession <e>", "<cs> my lords we were all sweetness and light when discussing the previous amendment <e> <s> i am afraid that on this occasion i must say that the amendment is not acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows we debated an identical amendment at committee stage <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to prescribe the way in which housing benefit should be calculated after april for people who are provided by their local authority with a place in a private or voluntary residential care or nursing home <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first briefly respond to my noble friend lord swinfen who asked for a definition of rural area <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot help him <e> <s> i can refer him to a remark that i made earlier this afternoon to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and say that i suspect it would create yet more work for the lawyers but i might be wrong about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit to the noble lord that i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> if they do all well and good and the noble lord lord carter assures me that they do <e> <s> i thought that possibly we might be creating a little more work for my learned friends but perhaps we are not as it has been defined <e>", "<cs> my lords when we debated this clause in committee it was then clause my noble friend lady hooper made clear the governments position on similar amendments <e> <s> it appears to be simply a question of whether these proposals should be on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends interpretation of section probably differs slightly from mine <e> <s> my understanding is that if authorities have to take into account the ability of carers that would require a certain degree of consultation with the carer <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the concern of the noble lord lord kilmarnock regarding hiv and other problems <e> <s> however i do not think that the arrangements envisaged by the amendment are practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords to begin with i should like to clarify the position so that we all know what we are discussing <e> <s> i take it that we are speaking to amendment no <e> <s> b and not to amendment no <e> <s> which was originally on the grouping list <e> <s> as i understand it noble lords would prefer to take these amendments separately <e> <s> i propose to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord ennals can face being answered by me instead of the noble baroness <e> <s> obviously i accept the concern behind the amendment that assessment of community care needs should be regularly reviewed <e> <s> however as we have said on other occasions we do not feel able to accept that this should be on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has said we considered this matter at an earlier stage in our deliberations <e> <s> i think it was my noble friend who explained on that occasion that no decision could be made about the implementation of this section and the remaining sections of the act not yet in force until we had received cost estimates from the local authority and discussed them with them <e> <s> we have still to receive those cost estimates <e> <s> but i can tell the noble lord lord carter who mentioned the fact that we had written to the association of county councils that on th june six days ago we received an interim reply from one of the associations the association of county councils indicating that it and the association of metropolitan authorities are currently engaged in drawing up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is trying to impose a timetable on the government <e> <s> i tried to make clear that we shall continue our consultation with ideal authorities but that we wanted to know more from the authorities who are the experts about the cost implications <e> <s> until the consultation is complete we cannot take the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can take the house much further as regards section than i did when it was discussed on a previous amendment <e> <s> as i explained in connection with that amendment which was designed to bring section into force at the same time as clause it would be irresponsible for us to proceed to further implementation of the act before our consultations with the local authority associations are complete <e> <s> i said that we were pursuing the matter with all possible speed <e> <s> i think i can also say that it was agreed with the local authority associations at an early stage that sections and should be considered together for implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer that question <e> <s> however i can repeat the assurance i gave to the house as regards amendment no <e> <s> which was moved by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth <e> <s> we will pursue these consultations with all possible speed <e> <s> we have received a reply from the association of county councils but we do not think that it would be responsible to continue at present until we have had further discussions with the associations <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we have already implemented considerable parts of the act <e> <s> the noble lord will know that when the legislation was enacted on the birthday of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale we said that we would implement the sections when we could <e> <s> however we stressed at the time that there were financial implications <e> <s> i shall continue to stress that point <e> <s> we shall continue to discuss the matter <e> <s> i have given the assurance that we will make all possible speed and that we will continue to discuss these matters with the association of county councils and the ama <e> <s> after that has been done and at an appropriate stage these sections can be implemented <e> <s> i must stress again that we agreed that they would be taken together <e>", "<cs> my lords consultations began on th february <e> <s> however perhaps i may repeat what i said to the noble lord <e> <s> we have already implemented large parts of the act <e> <s> we always stressed that there were financial implications and we continue to say so <e> <s> as i said continued discussions are necessary with the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can only give the answer i gave earlier we shall continue to pursue the matter with all possible speed <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept my assurance on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said this amendment has already been discussed twice <e> <s> it was discussed during the debate on the national health service and community care bill and also in committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot help the noble lord as regards the timing of the completion of the consultations <e> <s> we have another week before what i understand is the suggested day for third reading that is next monday <e> <s> i hope that by that time i shall be able to give at least a hint as to when the consultation process will be completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but can he confirm that he is speaking to both amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords have said we have debated this issue before <e> <s> i am not sure that i can take the house much further than i did in committee <e> <s> we recognise the important role that carers play in the community <e> <s> we should look at the help that the government have given which has increased significantly over the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords although i cannot accept the amendment that is not to suggest that i am not without sympathy for its aims <e> <s> i have a feeling that my noble kinsman has gone slightly too far <e> <s> there are many ocasions when the value of the house is not taken into account as capital <e> <s> here we are dealing with the relatively few cases where the carer is under and is not a partner of the disabled person going into care <e> <s> that carer potentially loses his or her house because it is then counted as part of the owners income <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an assurance that i could manage that in a week <e> <s> the same problem arose last year and my colleague mr lloyd said he would continue to monitor the position <e> <s> however as i have said the problem is that it is difficult to find a way of drafting an amendment appropriately to make it sufficiently tight <e> <s> i cannot give the noble baroness an assurance that i can come forward with anything at third reading <e> <s> if the noble baroness cares to try herself she may <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to imply that the noble baroness needed my permission <e> <s> she knows she does not need that <e> <s> however if she wishes she can have another bash at this matter but i give no assurance that the government will necessarily accept what she may come forward with <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the cost of implementing this amendment as the noble lord has drafted it would be in the region of million at a rough guess <e> <s> the noble lord has drafted the amendment far wider than i think even he would accept is necessary <e> <s> i said that i could envisage some hard cases arising <e> <s> i mentioned a particular example <e> <s> however in our years monitoring we have not come across any such cases <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say immediately that i fully appreciate the concern of both my noble kinsman and the noble lord lord carter for those who find themselves homeless <e> <s> in replying i do not believe that i should go over old ground that was covered at committee stage <e> <s> however i should like to comment briefly on our experience under the old single payment scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords during the course of the debate in committee i explained that to extend the help available by way of community care grants to those receiving invalidity benefit and severe disablement allowance presented us with very real problems <e> <s> it would for example ignore other deserving groups such as pensioners ignore the fact that many of those receiving invalidity benefit have resources which mean that they are significantly better off than those receiving income support and involve considerable extra funds or alternatively severely limit the help that could be offered to others in similar need <e> <s> for those reasons i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be pleased to hear that i have no intention of accepting the amendment <e> <s> it was because the disqualification rule was not acting as a sufficient deterrent that in april the government increased the maximum period and i stress the word maximum for disqualification from to weeks <e> <s> since then disqualifications have fallen dramatically <e> <s> claims have also fallen but proportionately fewer disqualifications are now being imposed <e> <s> that indicates that the policy of deterrence is working <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the noble baronesss interests in these matters <e> <s> i know she does not like to consider anyone as being older than anyone else <e> <s> in the past some workers over the age of who have been unemployed for a year or longer were able to sign on as quarterly attenders <e> <s> that will not be the case <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness does not believe in such categories as older workers <e> <s> therefore i am sure she will accept that what the government are doing is right despite what my noble kinsman said about it being an attack on the older worker <e> <s> as the noble baroness does not accept that there are such groups as older workers i am sure that she will find it easy to support the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i did not misunderstand the noble baroness <e> <s> i had always understood that she felt we should not discriminate against older workers and with that the government heartily agree <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated an identical amendment to this one at committee stage <e> <s> i regret that there is very little i can add to what my noble friend lady blatch said on that occasion <e> <s> however i will reiterate the main points of the governments arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving her amendment i presume that the noble baroness is also speaking to my amendments which are grouped with it <e> <s> those amendments are nos <e> <s> b a and <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as the noble baroness says we have spoken to it on a number of occasions previously <e> <s> as i said when i intervened at the beginning of the noble baronesss speech in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i shall also be speaking to government amendment no <e> <s> b and to amendments nos <e> <s> a and which are consequential <e> <s> i hope the house will bear with me if i say a little about the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could return to the amendment and not be drawn into discussion on employment law euthanasia and perhaps even sir william beveridge <e>", "<cs> my lords the deprivation rule as it is commonly known exists primarily to prevent abuse of the taxpayers money <e> <s> it provides for a person to be treated as still owning capital of which he has deliberately deprived himself in order to obtain benefit <e> <s> that is a longstanding provision and a sensible one <e> <s> of course it would not be right nor has it ever been the intention to treat a person as possessing the same amount of notional capital for all time <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the forthright support of the noble baroness <e> <s> i listened with interest to the speech of my noble friend lord brentford in moving the amendments in the name of my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> in committee my noble friend lord mottistone sought to reduce the level of pension increases required for the future service from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> on that occasion my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i must remind my noble friend that this is the report stage and it is the convention that no noble lord shall speak after the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the points he has made are similar to those expressed in our discussion in committee on the use of the surplus when my noble friend lord mottistone suggested that to spread the surplus over a very large number of people would not necessarily be the best way to use it <e> <s> on that occasion the noble lord lord carter asked him if discretion would mean that the trustees would have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss amendment has raised the questions of the funding of the pensions ombudsman and his independence <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to reassure her on the matter <e> <s> paragraph of schedule gives the secretary of state powers to impose a levy on occupational and personal pension schemes to meet the costs of the pensions ombudsman and the registry and the grant to be made by the opb to the occupational pensions advisory service <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very much taken with the conciliatory way in which the noble baroness moved the amendment <e> <s> clearly she has given thought to the points i made when the issue was discussed in committee last month and has now brought forward an amendment which is superficially attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords the position as the noble baroness is aware when a scheme winds-up will match the general requirements for pension increases <e> <s> in the event of a scheme winding up it will be a liability on the employer to provide increases at the level of prices up to maximum of per cent <e> <s> in respect of pensions accruing after an appointed day <e> <s> for pension rights based on service before then increases will depend on the extent of increases already guaranteed as a result of the new requirements and any additional surplus emerging when the scheme winds up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sympathetic to the type of problems that my noble friend has outlined <e> <s> however i must reserve the governments position until we have seen the results of the report that my noble friend may know we are commissioning in order to provide up-to-date information on the extent of self-investment the sectors in which it is concentrated and in particular what the problems will be in restricting it <e> <s> some preliminary work has already been undertaken and the main study is due to begin early next month <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the individual mrmckiernon and whether he will be awarded benefit <e> <s> we understand that his case will be heard by an appeals tribunal on th july and that final adjudication and promulgation will occur soon thereafter <e> <s> if his circumstances satisfy the current law including the court of appeal judgment in his case he will be awarded disablement benefit along with any arrears <e>", "<cs> my lords i have also read back through our debates in committee on the amendment <e> <s> i did not quite understand what the noble lord lord carter was saying on that occasion <e> <s> i still do not understand what he is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords on most occasions that would not be the case <e> <s> payment would be made back to the date of judgment <e> <s> in committee i mentioned the specific point of test cases <e> <s> those tend to arise with mass redundancy where the facts are identical for all those involved <e> <s> in most other cases the facts will not be identical and therefore the test case principle will not follow <e> <s> with regard to those occasions i gave an assurance in answer to my noble kinsman lord russell <e> <s> i said <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the thinking behind what i understand is a probing amendment <e> <s> i hope that i can give the assurances that the noble lord wants <e> <s> the amendment is already reflected in our policy <e> <s> perhaps i may stress first that it is not part of our approach to reduce the facilities available to help people with as the legislation puts it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can add much to what my noble friend lady blatch said on a previous occasion <e> <s> as the noble lord said we discussed this matter previously <e> <s> the noble lord said that one knows how long someone will be in prison <e> <s> there is a degree of uncertainty because although someone may be serving a specific sentence as the noble lord is well aware people rarely serve the full length of the sentence <e>

to the noble lord for his welcome of this new subsection <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for seeing me beforehand to tell me that this amendment was merely probing <e> <s> i shall deal first with the point that the noble lord raised as regards seeing the form in draft <e> <s> i am afraid that that is not possible because we have sent it to the printers but as soon as it comes back i shall allow him to have a look at it <e> <s> i wrote to the noble lord lord kilmarnock on this matter as he asked for reassurances on certain points and on the monitoring of the provision <e> <s> i can make available to the noble <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for speaking on the amendment and stressing the inconvenience of the form in which noble lords are trying to achieve their ends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can give the noble baroness quite the assurance that she wants <e> <s> i said that there will be research into the operation of both benefit and yts and i stress the yts provisions <e> <s> i hope that that will go far enough to satisfy the noble baroness <e> <s> i said that she would have to wait a while for the announcement of the detail of the research <e> <s> at the moment all i can say is that there will be research into both benefit and yts provisions for and year-olds <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will be prepared to leave the matter at that <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is quite obvious <e> <s> it must be that some homelessness is self-inflicted <e> <s> the noble lord simply cannot deny that <e> <s> if he expects me having just announced that there will be research into this matter to speculate on what percentage might by any definition be self-inflicted he is obviously more naive than i thought <e> <s> i cannot speculate before research has been commissioned <e> <s> i can make the categoric statement that some surely must be self-inflicted <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that statement <e> <s> i repeat that officials in my department and the department of employment will be discussing that report with nacab <e> <s> i ought to say however that it was not clear to us when we received that report whether the cases were pre-march or post-march <e> <s> the question of whether they are pre-march or post-march is very important because my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment announced various changes in march <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to follow my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to follow my noble friends lord renton and lord boyd-carpenter and the noble lord lord henderson or my noble kinsman in this very fascinating discussion on primary and secondary legislation <e> <s> i object to this amendment but not on those grounds and therefore i hope that noble lords will bear with me if i refuse to be drawn into discussion on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> the training agency will do its best <e> <s> there will not always be a course which is absolutely ideal for the young person in question <e> <s> however i stick to what i say <e> <s> at the end of the day the second choice will always be better than nothing at all and will be better than that young person receiving income support <e>", "<cs> my lords had the noble lord listened to me on the previous amendment he would have heard me say that we intend to commission independent research into the operation of benefit and yts provisions <e> <s> it will be independent <e> <s> i cannot say who is to conduct it because we have not yet decided who to commission <e> <s> i am sure that as soon as that is decided the noble lord will be told about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can respond to that knowing that my noble kinsman comes from the academic fraternity <e> <s> however i shall certainly pass on the comment to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> when he comes to commission the research i am sure that he will consider who is the most appropriate person <e> <s> if the noble earl wishes to put forward any names from the academic community i am sure that they will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness said this is familiar territory and i am not sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness was really responsible and she drafted the amendment rather well <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness withdraws the amendment perhaps i may add that this morning we considered the question of carers who are in receipt of invalid care allowance <e> <s> we endeavoured to ascertain the number of carers who are partners <e> <s> in the short time available we were not able to obtain that information it might have provided at least one interesting statistic <e> <s> certainly we shall continue to monitor the situation and as i said if we find that there is a problem we do not have much evidence to show that there is changes can be made by means of secondary legislation <e> <s> i shall now sit down and allow the noble baroness to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the case that the noble lord lord carter referred to towards the end of my speech <e> <s> however first i shall deal with the generality of the amendment as i understand it because it was tabled on friday and is quite new <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> we have had a number of valuable and constructive debates on the measures in the bill and across the field of social security legislation <e> <s> i should like

lady seear <e> <s> last but not least i should also like to thank my noble friend lady blatch for doing so much and for giving me such valuable support throughout the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall respond briefly to some of the points which have been made <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter likened the bill to the famous curates egg <e> <s> he then went on to say that that would be unfair to curates <e> <s> that was a strange remark <e> <s> i looked carefully around at the right reverend prelates because i did not think that curates could lay eggs <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall leave it at that <e> <s> as i said i shall deal with one or two of the points upon which i might be able to say something of use <e> <s> bearing in mind the time problems it would be unwise of me to respond to all the points made <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter rightly asked when the decision would be made as to how housing benefit will be calculated <e> <s> in the past i assured the noble

definite than when in the past it was stated that it would be soon <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am afraid that i cannot help the noble baroness any further <e> <s> it is a complex matter and we cannot rush into premature decisions <e> <s> i have stated that the government accept that there is a case for equalisation <e> <s> how we achieve that and how long it will take is complex <e> <s> we must bear in mind that there are people in their s who have already made plans for retirement on the basis of a pension at whatever their retirement age <e> <s> it is a complex problem that cannot be solved overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords it was made by officials in my department <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have nothing to hide <e> <s> they have made their views on this matter perfectly clear on many occasions not least in an answer by my noble friend lord caithness to a question from the noble lord not so very long ago <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that this is a parliamentary democracy and the subject has been discussed in both houses on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend but i understand that there are problems on the other side of the house in that some members of the party opposite seem to have different views on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the government intended to publish a white paper on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one view and that is the governments view <e>", "<cs> my lords the question does not relate to emu <e> <s> it relates to sterling joining the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> the question about emu is slightly different from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward with interest to that report <e> <s> only yesterday dr karl otto phl spoke to that

the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> in view of the noble lords wish to be better informed i shall repeat what my noble friend and my right honourable friends in another place have said on many occasions namely that the government are committed to join the erm when the level of united kingdom inflation is significantly lower when there is capital liberalisation in the community and when real progress has been made toward the completion of the single market freedom of financial services and strengthened competition policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the easter act was a somewhat long time ago <e>

lord lord bruce <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible that my noble friend has been in many dining rooms clubs and so on in the united kingdom but i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter has nothing to do with a federal europe <e> <s> i note that the noble lord has different views from those held by some of his other friends in his party <e> <s> i have repeated the governments view that

that i can go further <e> <s> i do not accept that it is necessary for the government to rush into precipitous decisions on equalisation in the state pension scheme <e> <s> i shall continue to say as

trustees should seek their own legal advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot <e> <s> the problem is one for clarification <e> <s> the government are unable to clarify the european courts

eighth report of has already made clear that he sees no change in the fundamental role of community health councils <e> <s> the white paper proposals that are now being taken into the act do not add to the chcs duties or burdens but obviously the role will have to be clarified to cater for the change in the function of the districts from providers to purchasers of services <e>", "<cs> my lords

of that role <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give a date <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that it will be soon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear in my original answer we have no plans for changing the membership of community health councils <e> <s> the membership will remain as it is at the moment that is one half appointed by local authorities a third by local voluntary

the community health councils <e> <s> that is the role of the community health councils <e>", "<cs> my lords of course those councils are important <e> <s> just because one body gives its view of how

litigation <e> <s> obviously such costs would be great and we recognise the argument that the resources likely to be taken up by such litigation would be better used on services for national health service patients <e> <s> however the point i made earlier to the noble lord lord ennals still applies care for patients would not benefit if as the likely outcome of compromising the present legal action this were to encourage other expensive litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the pearson committee did not recommend a general system of no-fault compensation for medical accidents in this country <e> <s> the royal commission considered the matter very carefully but came down against it in <e> <s> i do not think that circumstances have changed since that time <e>",

advantages or disadvantages of the recommendations made by the pearson committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i simply do not accept what the noble lord said <e> <s> i repeat it is the most appalling tragedy that so many haemophiliacs have been affected <e> <s> however i do not feel that no-fault compensation would be the answer to the problem <e> <s> the government have responded to

noble lord said about the rich man receiving this benefit as well as the poor man my impression was that the noble lord had changed his views <e> <s> the government have not changed their views at all

<s> from april there was an extra per week above the rate of inflation in the pocket of a mother of a lower paid working family receiving family credit <e> <s> i cannot comment on the specific figure mentioned by the noble lord but i believe that the governments position and their case is good <e> <s> we have continued to support the family <e>", "<cs> my lords statutory sick pay has not yet been discussed with the employers organisations <e> <s> the noble lord expressed the view that increases for residential homes are not enough and are not in line with inflation <e> <s> the statement makes clear that following the price waterhouse report the government identified the gap as being greatest in the nursing homes and that is why their increases were so large <e> <s> the need was not so great in the residential homes <e> <s> nevertheless we are putting an extra million into income support for residential and nursing homes together with last years increase of million <e> <s> as we made clear in the statement that is an extra million over and above billion that is spent on income support for nursing and residential homes <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i thank my noble friend for his support <e> <s> of course we recognise that the needs of a mother with children are greater than a mother without children <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend saw fit to up-rate child benefit this year by for the eldest child <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating my three noble friends on their excellent maiden speeches <e> <s> my noble friend lord howe made an informed speech on the criminal justice bill and prisons and their problems <e> <s> my noble friend lady eccles as a distinguished chairman of ealing district health authority spoke about the nhs <e> <s> my noble friend lord pearson spoke with great expertise on higher education as an outsider <e> <s> how welcome it is to hear an outsider from higher education give us the benefit of his advice in the house where we have so many insiders on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords our aim is to ensure that in suitable cases they are dealt with without resort to the courts or failing that the penal system <e> <s> we recognise that there is scope to increase the level of diversion <e> <s> this can best be effected by increasing local awareness of non-custodial options and encouraging closer and more effective working relationships between all the professional agencies and individuals involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that the home office has recently issued guidance to the courts the police the probation service and other bodies on how to deal with mentally disordered persons who commit offences <e> <s> the guidance has the full support of the department of health and has been circulated to both health and social services authorities <e> <s> the governments policy aims to ensure that people with mental disorders who are suitable for and would benefit from care in the community should receive such care <e> <s> however it was never intended that all mentally disordered offenders should be accommodated in the community <e> <s> some would certainly not be suitable for such a placement and each individual case has to be considered on its merits taking account of the clinical judgment and the need to ensure the safety of the public <e> <s> no mentally disordered person detained in hospital should be discharged from the hospital until the strict criteria laid down in the mental health act are met <e> <s> no patient should be discharged until proper care and attention while he is in the community have been arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the correction by the noble lord <e> <s> however i know that he and his noble friends always mistrust the aims of the government and seem to impute everything to the allegedly malign influence of the treasury <e> <s> the interests of the taxpayer are important <e> <s> there is no reason why taxpayers many of whom are bringing up families on modest incomes should subsidise those who choose to avoid their responsibility <e> <s> however our real motive is to put children first and to ensure that regular maintenance payments are made through efficient and non-confrontational means <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness that the ruling has left some areas unclear particularly the extent to which it has retrospective <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows perfectly well that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply do not accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> they are totally separate <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to respond on a non-party basis <e> <s> i am trying to make it clear that it is not for the government to clarify a decision of the european court of justice <e> <s> only the european court itself can clarify what was meant by the decision in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the decision of the court in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the noble lord did not listen to me <e> <s> i said quite clearly that the government would seek clarification from the court if a suitable case could be found <e> <s> the government cannot go to the court and ask for a declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords let me repeat that my understanding is that we can seek clarification if a suitable case can be found <e> <s> we shall support that case if such a case can be found <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it quite clear that the government accept that the present situation is unsatisfactory <e> <s> as i said the government are considering carefully what needs to be done <e> <s> we are in consultation with all the interested parties and with the european commission <e> <s> however in the end the matter must be clarified by the european court itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept as my noble friend said that the noble lord is learned in the law <e> <s> my understanding is that we could only seek clarification by means of a test case <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall be the first to come back to the noble lord and make the matter quite clear <e> <s> however my understanding is that we can only seek clarification by means of a test case <e>", "<cs> my lords no formal guidelines have been issued by the bank of england but i understand that the bank discusses with individual banks the risks associated with loans to property companies as part of their routine prudential supervision under the banking act <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the concerns of my noble friend but feel that the terms under which a loan is made and when that loan should be repayable must be matters for the banks and their customers <e> <s> it would not be right to attempt to influence the banks commercial judgment in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords concerns <e> <s> the situation is different from that in the early s <e> <s> banks now have a far lower proportion of their capital invested in property than they had in those days <e> <s> as i said in answer to my noble friend i believe that it should be a matter for the banks and their customers as to the terms under which the money is lent and when it should be repayable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that that is the case <e> <s> as i said it should be a matter for the banks themselves and their customers <e> <s> the bank of england will intervene on other matters but not here <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is not in the banks interest to pull the loans i am sure that the banks will take advice from someone as respected in that field as the noble lord himself and not pull the loans <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> under the banking act the bank has a duty to ask the incorporated banks to give notice of exposure of capital over a certain percentage <e> <s> it does not have a duty to give guidelines to the banks on when they should ask property companies to repay their loans or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that this house has a keen and continuing interest in ensuring that the campaign to stem fraud against the ec budget does not flag <e> <s> i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord benson for introducing this debate following up the debate some months ago on the report by the noble baronesss select committee which was published in february <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that we cannot go so far as the noble lord would like <e> <s> i said that the increase was per cent <e> <s> and i do not believe that it merited the noble lords laughter especially as it complements other efforts at a national level and the commissions own inspection powers to detect irregularities of expenditure about which i shall say more in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i dealt with that earlier when i talked about the greek maize case which reaffirmed the requirement on member states to treat fraud against the community budget as seriously as fraud against their national budgets <e> <s> in the light of responses from member governments a community crimes treaty may still be needed but we felt that the case i referred to removed the greatest need for such a treaty <e> <s> i hope that that goes some way towards helping the noble lord <e>"]
