["<cs> my lords i am deeply conscious both of the honour of being a member of your lordships house and of being able to take part in a debate which is close to the nations heart and is certainly very close to my heart <e> <s> so i am grateful to my noble friend lord molloy for introducing the debate <e> <s> i welcome the opportunity of following the right reverend prelate and i agreed with every single word he said <e> <s> also it is a special pleasure to be able to follow my old friend old in the sense of years of friendship my noble friend lord wallace of coslany who preceded me as member of parliament for norwich <e> <s> north <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> will he hear in mind that the crown agents not only provide a greatly appreciated service for many countries in the third world but provide invaluable orders for british exporters to the tune of well over million a year <e> <s> secondly and in particular is he aware of the special services which the crown agents offer to small firms in britain which cannot themselves undertake the promotional task especially in distant and smaller markets <e>", "<cs> my lords in the noble lords answer to my noble and learned friend did i understand him to say or if he did not would he now say that no decision will finally be taken without there being an opportunity for the house to discuss this extremely important question <e>", "<cs> my lords i deeply regret the fact that i was unable to hear the maiden speech by the noble earl lord attlee though i think i heard almost the last speech of his very distinguished father <e> <s> though i did not hear him today for which i apologise i am sure that his contribution to this house will be very great <e> <s> i want to thank the noble earl lord longford for introducing this bill which unfortunately was denied the opportunity of a second reading about three weeks ago in another place <e> <s> i was abroad at the time but i read about it in the newspapers and i was extremely saddened that the bill was not given a second reading <e> <s> i very much hope that disabled people will today be encouraged if this bill is given a second reading <e> <s> a number of those who have spoken have been against it and they include people whom i have known and respected over many years <e> <s> certainly the noble baronesses lady vickers and lady lane-fox are two people whose views on most things to do with the disabled i share but on this bill i profoundly disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble ladys intervention takes it a little further <e> <s> if the noble lady thinks that the acts have done harm she must believe that they have not done much good <e> <s> legislation is only one of the ways in which we can do battle against discrimination whether racial discrimination or discrimination on the grounds of sex but i believe that it is one of the instruments which should be used and which this house ought now to examine <e> <s> we cannot legislate against prejudice but we can legislate against the actions of those who are prejudiced <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first ask the house to accept my apology for putting down my name to speak not early enough for it to be included on the list of speakers <e> <s> i hope to mitigate my offence first by being fairly brief secondly by congratulating the government <e> <s> i warmly welcome this bill <e> <s> i entirely agree with the points made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of bristol <e> <s> i warmly congratulate him on his maiden speech and i do so after having recently made my own maiden speech <e> <s> i have no doubt that although there are difficulties to which your lordships have referred and i wish to touch upon them this bill will put right not just a hardship but a dual hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that it is recognised that there is no fixed level that one can set may i ask this question <e> <s> does not the minister feel that he ought to be giving rather stronger advice to pregnant women bearing in mind the report as long ago as of the royal college of psychiatrists which gave some strong evidence about the effect of heavy drinking by expectant mothers on damaging the foetus <e> <s> it also referred to the fact that about per cent <e> <s> of the cases that were concerned in the foetal alcohol syndrome were born either abnormally small had hare-lips or in some other way had a defect <e> <s> is it not really beholden upon the government to give the strongest advice to expectant mothers that drinking of alcohol except at a very modest level is extremely unwise during pregnancy <e>", "<cs> but is it not a fact my lords that in the past three months as part of the governments privatisation policy there has been a dramatic increase in the funds made available by the dhss to pay the fees of residents of private homes with <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has already said that he congratulates my noble friend on not smoking cigarettes for nearly years <e> <s> from the report is he aware that among young males in england and wales one will be murdered six will be killed on the roads and will be killed before their time by tobacco smoking mainly by smoking cigarettes and that the national health service suffers to the tune of million a year as a result of smoking-caused diseases <e> <s> in view of the mounting evidence of the damaging effect of this addictive drug and the growing willingness of the public to see government action is it not now time for the government to take determined action on the basis of the recommendations in this report especially including the banning of all sales promotion for cigarettes <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the report does document the experience of other countries where they have in fact imposed such a ban norway in particular showing that there has been a dramatic drop in the sales of cigarettes immediately following the banning of public advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be helpful if the noble lord would pass the encouraging answer he first gave to the victoria health district <e> <s> is he aware bearing in mind that they have suffered a cash cut of million in and expect a further cash cut of million in that the health district have informed me today that the options they were considering included the total closure of the westminster hospital <e> <s> another was a substantial reduction in beds including the closing of the accident and emergency unit to which tribute has already been paid for the role that it played at the time of the tragic harrods bombing just before christmas <e> <s> if the noble lord is telling the house that the westminster hospital is safe can he accept that because so many noble lords owe their lives to the skills of the doctors and nurses in that hospital there will be a cheer from all sides of the house <e> <s> but will he also tell the health district which is responsible that that is the situation that the minister has decided upon <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble lord has said the assurance he gave in the answer to my noble friend lord segal that no changes were proposed in the role of the westminster hospital seems now to have been changed <e> <s> can he say whether his last answer or the original answer that he gave was correct <e>", "<cs> my lord would the noble minister not agree that on average medical general practitioners have lists which are too large and that the trend should continue towards smaller shorter lists in order that gps may better fulfil their functions particularly in large conurbations <e> <s> is he aware that while there is a small but steady increase in the number of doctors undertaking the three-year vocational training course as my noble friend lord molloy has said there is now an increasing number who are failing to get into practice and who are unemployed <e> <s> if the noble lord does not have that information perhaps he could get it from the royal college of medical practitioners who would confirm it <e> <s> can the noble lords right honourable friend take some action perhaps to encourage general <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept my thanks for being so fair about the record of the <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from what the noble baroness has said that the government are satisfied that the industry is complying with the code of conduct which was accepted at the time when the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme was introduced in <e> <s> furthermore is the noble baroness able to say what progress is being made in the review which the government are undertaking of the pprs with which the guidelines were originally associated <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness could apply herself to the question <e> <s> i know the pprs because i negotiated it with the industry but since the government have decided that there is to be a review of the pprs i wonder whether the noble baroness could say whether it has started and if so what progress is being made and when your lordships will receive a report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord three questions <e> <s> first what is the profit margin accepted as appropriate for the british oxygen company in the light of the fact that the national health service pays about million a year to boc <e> <s> secondly will the minister confirm that the company charge the national health service an even higher price for medical gases than the guidelines set out by the review board for government contracts <e> <s> thirdly is it not deplorable that last year the executive director of the british oxygen company who is the highest-paid executive in the country received a bonus because of the companys financial success very substantially at the expense of the national health service <e> <s> is the noble lord satisfied with that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate my noble friend lord pitt on enabling the house to consider today this crucially important issue <e> <s> may i as a very new member of your lordships house say how moved i am by the quality of the contributions the degree of expertise that has been presented to us from all sides of the house and at the same time the degree of human understanding in the approach to the problems that we are facing <e> <s> i was personally glad that my noble friend lord soper referred to alcohol as being an addiction and that the noble lord lord rea referred to cigarette smoking <e> <s> i think that if we started afresh but knew all the social consequences that flowed from alcohol and cigarette smoking we might find that circumstances would be different <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to be the second to recognise that many wives of general practitioners perform a very real service in helping their general practitioner husbands and that it is only fair that there should be some form of modest compensation <e> <s> is the noble lord aware as i am sure he is that at present there is considerable confusion and uncertainty about the matter and that a second agreement will be welcome <e> <s> will the noble lord accept that so far as i and my noble friends are concerned one must be aware that unless their professional duties are properly recorded and monitored there is scope for a degree of abuse of a system under which wives are compensated <e> <s> will the noble lord also accept that it would be helpful once agreement has been reached if there could be an opportunity for an exchange in this house on an issue which affects very many general practitioners their wives and their cohorts <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord the minister for his explanation <e> <s> let me say straight away on behalf of these benches that we support the government in the decision they have taken to bring within the scope of control under the medicines act substances that are not now controlled and which though they can be bought over the pharmacists counter contain chemicals which can be very harmful to health <e> <s> as the noble lord said we are dealing mainly with amygdalin though also with one or two other substances <e> <s> he has explained which i certainly had not realised until i looked at the order the way in which amygdalin can become a dangerous product found naturally in the kernels of various types of fruit which can be converted by enzymes into something that is dangerous to the human body <e> <s> there have been a number of deaths in the united states due to cyanide poisoning which have been attributed to amygdalin <e> <s> i know that in the united states it has been widely publicised as a cure for cancer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a recent random survey of prescribing by general practitioners which was carried out by st marys hospital in north london showed that after receiving information on the cost of their own prescribing the general practitioners voluntarily reduced their prescription costs by a month <e> <s> if this were replicated among all general practitioners is the noble lord aware that it would represent a saving of million a year <e> <s> can he say what action the department of health and social security is taking to ensure that all doctors are given this information about their own prescribing costs in order that they may do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a very unsatisfactory situation when the minister cannot give an answer to my noble friend lord molloy <e> <s> why <e>", "<cs> but with respect my lords surely this is far more than a question of local conditions because the figures even as they were reported then were twice as high as they were in <e> <s> is it not a fact that there are nurses now being trained who on completing their training will be unable to find employment within the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the increasing demands of the elderly and in pressing him on this point i am certainly not referring to any noble baroness or noble lord who has received such successful treatment from the national health service <e> <s> however can he give an indication of what proportion of the total number of patients are elderly <e> <s> would he not agree that fewer people would be treated in hospital if the social services could make better provision which unfortunately they are not able to do because of the cuts which the government have imposed upon local authority services <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the situation described by my noble friend lord dean of beswick is not just a leeds problem but is common across the country as my noble friend lord wallace said on an earlier question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that when his government came to office in they made a commitment to reduce the hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord really must not twist the situation <e> <s> i have the figures which were given to me by his own department and so i know precisely what the figures were in in in in and in <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that the figures available from his own department for show a substantially higher waiting list than that which existed even in when the labour government went out of office <e>", "<cs> my lords i said <e>", "<cs> i want to do no more than support the noble baroness <e> <s> there is no significance except to bring the wording into line as she has said with the other two acts which make it an offence to discriminate <e> <s> at this stage i do no more than support the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree strongly with the point that has been made by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton although i agree with my noble friend lady lockwood <e> <s> if the committee is prepared to look at clause <e>", "<cs> may i answer the noble lord <e> <s> i sought in my very brief moving of this amendment to say that it is simply a paving amendment to have a more effective means of defining the amendment to page line <e> <s> the noble lord when he sees that that replaces physical mental or sensory will see that it will make absolute sense <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord and to the committee that if they passed the present amendment and defeated amendment no <e> <s> it would leave the first paragraph absolutely nonsensical <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to rise again but i think it would be unfortunate if at a very early stage of this extremely important bill one side of an argument is presented by a noble lord for whom i have a deep personal admiration and who may have either the advantage or disadvantage of being a barrister to say that this is not how things work <e> <s> he knows that this is not how things work in the field of allegations of discrimination on grounds of sexual equality <e> <s> the vast majority do not go to court at all <e> <s> the law is simply a hack-up mechanism for conciliation and conciliation usually works <e>", "<cs> i can confirm to the noble baroness and to the noble lord that the actual heading of the bill which is why i said i did not disagree strongly with the noble baroness is disablement prohibition of unjustifiable discrimination bill <e>", "<cs> having moved this amendment i wish to express my deep thanks for the way in which it has been debated <e> <s> i feel it would not be unfair to welcome especially the powerful intervention made by the noble earl lord snowdon who has made a very great contribution to the needs of disabled people <e> <s> some of the points which have been made ought to be considered again <e> <s> i admire the silence of the government and i hope that they remain silent for the rest of the day i am sure that the noble lord the minister will not misunderstand me but it does repose therefore with those who sit on this front bench to take over the role of those who sit on the front bench opposite <e> <s> the whole purpose of this committee stage is to ensure that at the end of the day or the week or the month we send to another place a bill that satisfies as many noble lords and noble baronesses as possible <e>", "<cs> i suppose that means that i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief because it is important that we reach a decision on this matter in order to make progress <e> <s> i thought that to most of the arguments the noble baroness lady lockwood and my noble friend lord longford gave very satisfactory answers <e> <s> to remove this clause from the bill would wreck the bill because we would simply declare something to be illegal define the people concerned and the types of discrimination but not have a commission to take some positive action which is surely what most members of your lordships committee would want to see <e> <s> the noble lord emphasised the elimination of discrimination to promote the integration of disabled people into society <e> <s> i do not believe for a moment that the majority of disabled people do not want to be treated as ordinary members of society so far as it is possible for them to be so treated <e> <s> therefore a good deal needs to be done in terms of access to entertainment and public places and the rest <e>", "<cs> i greatly admire the way in which the noble lord has assiduously studied the bill which is exactly as it should be <e> <s> had he proposed in terms of amendments some of the comments that he has made i might have had some sympathy with him and so i believe might my noble friend lord longford <e> <s> but the proposal that the clause should be simply deleted is totally illogical and thoroughly unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> this is a difficult concept and it was inserted in order to be fair because if one has legislation which says that it is an offence to discriminate against someone who is disabled on the grounds that we have already defined in the bill someone else may feel as a result of a disabled person not being discriminated against that they have been discriminated against <e> <s> we are in fact dealing with negative discrimination and this is in a sense to legalise positive discrimination in favour of disabled people even though others might in consequence be discriminated against <e> <s> i personally i can speak only personally on this and in any case it is private members bill do not feel very deeply about this clause <e> <s> i would not go into the division lobby and i am glad therefore that the noble lord is not going to press it to a division <e> <s> i will ask my noble friend whether he will look at it again before we come to report <e> <s> i think this is a confusing concept and we do not want to add any confusion to the bill <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> if he were not a noble lord or even as he was before a member of the house of commons but maybe a modest person less able to speak with great clarity and perhaps even loudly on occasions though i have never heard the noble lord speak loudly does he not think that there should be such a provision for ordinary human beings <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that one encouraging thing revealed in the james report is that whereas we have had for a very long time great disagreement in the medical profession about what is a balanced diet and what is dangerous and what is not we now seem to have agreement with the medical profession with dieticians and the rest <e> <s> i wondered why the government do not themselves feel that they themselves should publish this report and secondly whether it would not now be wise since there are so many dangers for the government to launch a campaign so that the public have a better understanding of what are the recommendations in relation to a balanced and wise diet <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be out of order since the minister did not immediately leap up to reply to ask this question <e> <s> is not the principle concerned involving not those who smoke pipes and cigars but those who smoke cigarettes <e> <s> is not the evidence that was quoted by the noble earl lord kinnoull quite correct that there is increasing medical evidence of the effect on non-smokers of those who are smoking <e> <s> this is a new factor which is better understood now as the result of the third report of the royal college of physicians <e> <s> is it not right that the government should seek to use their influence as was suggested by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the life of a pacemaker is only about seven years would much be saved by this proposal <e> <s> since every heart is different would it not be far more profitable to support <e>", "<cs> i had hoped perhaps that the noble lord <e> <s> lord campbell of croy would have accepted the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i do not at all take his view that it would be a restriction on the secretary of state <e> <s> after all on corad of which mr peter large was chairman roughly half the members whether it was exactly half or slightly more i am not certain were disabled people <e> <s> in many organisations and i am thinking epecially of motahility the contribution of disabled people and their various abilities are outstanding <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> if the committee wants there to be a rough balance between able bodied and disabled people the best thing is to say so in the bill <e> <s> if the amendment was not accepted it would he perfectly possible for whichever secretary of state it is and we shall come to an amendment on that in a moment to appoint only able bodied people <e> <s> i think that that would be a mistake <e> <s> i hope that before we come to the report stage the argument put forward by the noble lord lord kilmarnock will he seen to find favour with the promoter of the bill <e>", "<cs> if it is of any relief to the noble lord lord campbell i shall support every other amendment that he has tabled but i do not want to support this one <e> <s> in fact i want to put forward some arguments to seek to change his mind although i must say that if the noble lord lord glenarthur were to <e>", "<cs> i was present during the second reading debate and i was not really aware that there was a mass of opinion saying we want the home secretary <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord can give any arguments in favour of it he has not yet done so <e>", "<cs> we are a hit short of executives <e> <s> i entirely agree with every word of that former secretary of state the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am disappointed with the noble lord because i knew that he was going to be as negative as he has been <e> <s> of course one welcomes the access committee but the supposition that the only disadvantages and discriminations that disabled people face are those of access is one that i could not for a moment accept <e> <s> however i do not intend to proceed with an argument about that <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord campbell will take out subsection when we come to report stage <e> <s> any reference to a review of the pensions and benefits is inappropriate in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it can make a great deal of difference to the morale of patients if they can receive a call from family or friends rather than always having to make an outgoing call particularly if they are elderly <e> <s> is it not within the capacity of his right honourable friend the secretary of state to advise health authorities that they should do their best to ensure that there is two-way communication by telephone for patients in hospital particularly for long-term patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is extremely grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for asking this question <e> <s> he was himself a very distinguished member of the pearson commission and certainly it is my view that the report of the commission received really very little consideration or achieved very unsatisfactory results from that consideration by the government and i hope that the minister when he comes to reply will perhaps give some indication of how many of the recommendations in the pearson report were acted upon <e> <s> i have of course read the debate in this house on st december on a motion by the noble lord <e> <s> lord campbell of alloway and i am looking forward to the speech that he will make later <e>", "<cs> not everyone <e> <s> this is just a momentary light jocular riposte <e> <s> mr hugh rossi wrote to mr brian rix the general secretary of mencap and in his letter he made it absolutely clear that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves on <e> <s> i wonder whether he will forgive me for putting a question <e> <s> he would agree would he not that we know very much more now than we did five or six years ago <e> <s> the committee on the safety of medicines has at its disposal information statistical analyses and so on which shows that it is far safer for children to be vaccinated than not be vaccinated <e> <s> i hope that in putting his question he was not casting any doubt on what the committee on the safety of medicines is now prepared to state very emphatically <e>", "<cs> my lords an assurance was given to me in writing by the secretary of state for social services at that time <e> <s> is the minister saying that this was a misunderstanding <e> <s> it could not have been a misunderstanding <e> <s> there is no chance of it being a misunderstanding <e> <s> i do not understand what the minister is saying to me <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister care to comment on the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for saying that ministers are considering the recommendations of the binder hamlyn report but can he give the house any indication at all as to when decisions will be taken and if so whether any statement will come before your lordships house <e> <s> it would be a matter of very great concern if the government were to limit the growth of the general practitioner service <e>", "<cs> my lords in the context of consumer safety is the noble lord the minister aware of the serious problem of small children being poisoned by the ingestion of household products such as bleach turpentine weed killers and a number of other products <e> <s> do the government have under consideration the report of the working party on child-resistant closuresxof which i happen to be a member which proposes that they should be compulsory for a small range of poisonous household substances which have been the cause of poisoning in the case of a number of small children <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that even though the number of deaths from such poisoning is very small the number of children admitted to hospital is substantial <e> <s> only a small proportion of such accidents may result in death but does the noble lord not agree that the number of deaths is not an adequate way of determining danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer which in a sense accepted that they were repaid because they had been illegally clawed back <e> <s> would the noble lord answer three questions <e> <s> will he confirm that if parliament gives its blessing to the amendment to the health and social services bill to provide legal sanction for an illegal action he will he demanding of pharmacists a total of million clawback to he paid in six months when it is in fact earnings over three years <e> <s> secondly will he accept that at least of these retrospective demands will he made in situations where the ownership of pharmacies has changed <e> <s> therefore is it not right that many pharmacists are likely to close as a result of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble lord <e> <s> when he says a technical difficulty or whatever the term was what he is actually saving is that it was an illegal action and surely it has never happened before that profits over a period of three years have had to be paid back within the course of six months <e> <s> is this not unfair to pharmacists who perform an important function in our society <e> <s> is it not wrong that at precisely the same time the government are suggesting to the pharmacists retail panel that the payment for nhs services should be halved <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that most members of this house will not be satisfied with that answer <e> <s> will he explain to the house why when a report is paid for by the taxpayer and is available to the secretary of state it should not be available for discussion by the professions by the patients and by this house <e> <s> why is the report not available for publication now <e> <s> why does it have to await the conclusion of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain why it is necessary for the secretary of state and himself to consider the report before other people who may also be experts and whose views may be very helpful should have the opportunity to consider it <e> <s> why cannot it be published now <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether that is accepted by the junior hospital doctors <e> <s> surely a figure of hours a week is their objective and does he not agree that that would normally equate to serving no more than one in four nights a week on duty <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the house will welcome any good news that it is given but would the noble lord not agree that the royal national institute for the deaf is a highly reputable body that its report has just come out and that in its report it uses such terms as chaotic and inefficient <e> <s> for an organisation which is certainly not prone to sensationalism or exaggeration to list seven regions in which the delay period is more than two years surely indicates that there is more action needed to be taken by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton for raising this matter <e> <s> i want to emphasise the point made by my noble friend lord longford that there is no intention here nor do i think the words so imply to exclude the mentally handicapped from the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord lord renton looks carefully he will see the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have difficulty even with the words that have been proposed by the noble baroness <e> <s> we could then find ourselves in a situation with a commission of and with only two disabled people on it <e> <s> i do not think that that is enough <e> <s> if she decides to have four then two of the group would represent the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i should be happy with that though we cannot do that at this stage <e> <s> that is clear <e> <s> it would have to be a third reading amendment and i hope that the combined brilliance of noble baronesses and noble lords can then come up with an appropriate amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first declare a personal interest although not a financial interest <e> <s> it is that declared by a number of noble lords a great enthusiasm for rugby football <e> <s> i played it a lot and i was proud to represent my regiment in its team <e> <s> secondly i was the founder chairman years ago of the anti-apartheid movement to which reference was made by my noble friend lord brockway and which launched the sports boycott <e>", "<cs> my lords on prescription charges how can the minister justify what is in fact an per cent <e> <s> increase since <e> <s> is he not aware that there are many needy people particularly the unemployed who actually cannot afford the medication which they have been prescribed <e> <s> on the greenfield report is he aware that many people will feel that his answer is not a satisfactory one <e> <s> if he looks very carefully at recommendation to which the noble lord lord kilmarnock referred in no way is the doctors clinical freedom interfered with at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that it restricts the clinical freedom of doctors <e> <s> may i challenge him on that because according to recommendation every doctor is entitled to say that he wishes a particular prescription to be for a particu-lar brand <e> <s> how can that be restricting his clinical freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is an increasing number of gp hospitals that are now being proposed for closure <e> <s> does he know of any case in which this is being done because the standards of clinical care for patients in the hospital have sunk below the normal level <e> <s> will he not agree that these small hospitals provide an invaluable service not only to their patients but also in linking the community services with the hospitals <e> <s> if hospitals are at stake what about the other that exist up and down the country <e> <s> cannot the noble lord take a more positive view about this rather than simply saying that it is a matter for other people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that four times during the three questions today he has referred to the responsibility being not that of the secretary of state but that of the health authorities <e> <s> as the secretary of state is restricting the amount of money available for the health authorities is it not time that he gave some lead in terms of priorities in these

sudden now find that they are going to have to pay in some cases much more <e> <s> it has nothing to do with competition <e> <s> would the noble baroness not agree that this is very unfair to the pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble baroness on appearing so much younger than she is <e> <s> why are the unemployed not included on her list <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how many doctors and nurses were affected by the cut in manpower introduced for the first time ever last year <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister understand that if one seeks from for instance the royal college of nursing the total number of trained nurses who are unemployed one gets a figure of between and because they do not know and the department does not know <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that the royal college of nursing would greatly welcome such an inquiry as i have been assured only today <e> <s> why did the minister give such a negative answer <e> <s> will the noble lord convey to his right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services the feeling that exists that it is gravely unsatisfactory that we do not know about how many doctors and nurses available and trained by this country are not now available for use in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is most grateful to my noble friend lord molloy for raising this matter and i think that each of the contributions in the debate has come from people with a very great knowledge <e> <s> it has been an extremely valuable debate <e> <s> of course i agree that the drug industry is open to criticism and in a moment or so i shall make my criticisms of the industry <e> <s> however i want to take up the point put forward by the noble lord lord chelwood because i believe that the value of the contribution of british-made medicines to the balance of payments which last year was over million is enormous <e> <s> this is one of the most success-ful industries in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally delighted that my noble friend lady gaitskell paid the warm tribute that she did to the national health service for restoring her to full health enabling her to give a bit of passion to this debate <e> <s> i am also grateful to see the noble baroness lady faithfull return because the noble baronesses have distinguished themselves today <e> <s> i should before saying that have thanked the noble lord lord hunter of newington for enabling the noble baronesses to do so and for the excellent speech which he made <e> <s> i am sorry that lady cox has had to leave but she left after making what i thought was an outstanding speech <e> <s> i hope she reads <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister one question <e> <s> the noble lord the minister is arguing his case very effectively <e> <s> i simply want to know why the view he now holds was not held and carried into practice at the time of the reorganisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to congratulate most sincerely the noble lord lord campbell of croy for piloting his bill through the house <e> <s> when it had its first reading i spoke briefly from the dispatch box and said that i warmly supported it though i saw it as very much a second tier or a less favourable bill than that which had been proceeded with by my noble friend lord longford <e> <s> i greatly regret the decision of the government for i can take it as no other to use their influence to ensure the defeat of that bill so that it was not referred to another place <e> <s> therefore in my mind this bill introduced by the noble lord lord campbell assumes much greater significance <e> <s> i want warmly to welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept my congratulations to her on her virginity in snuffing <e> <s> is she aware that while the personal pleasures of snuff sniffing as opposed to solvent abuse seem to be negligible as she has said this fact is likely to be exploited <e> <s> there are reports by an american firm which is planning to launch on to the british market a product called skoal bandits which are sachets placed in the mouth and which have supposedly the same effect as snuff but as i understand it in fact produce cancer of the mouth <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the option of privatisation has always been open to health authorities ever since the national health service started <e> <s> the main point is that it has not usually been effective cost-effective or more effective <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble baroness whether it seems to her right that private firms which submit tenders are going to be relieved of value added tax while charities which do invaluable work for the national health service and the social services are not excluded from vat <e> <s> does this not seem grossly unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble baroness on this but since there has been great pressure in this house and in another place that charities which provide a social service should be excluded from the payment of vat does it not seem to her to be unfair that that should be denied but that vat should be relieved in respect of the private companies which manage to secure tenders with the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord kennet i want to speak only about the situation in afghanistan <e> <s> although he is not present at the moment i should like very sincerely to thank the noble earl lord selkirk for having introduced the debate <e> <s> i do not think that either this house or the other place spends anything like enough time on this issue <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to him for giving us this opportunity <e> <s> although accidentally he chose the week of a massive soviet attack on the panjshir valley in which the russians using high altitude heavy bombers against guerrilla fighters proved not only the topicality of todays debate but their determination as one can see at the moment to remain in afghanistan which they have sought to control for over four years <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount will give further consideration to the question put by my noble friend concerning the level of unemployment among disabled people <e> <s> does he not accept that it is extremely high and very disturbing indeed <e> <s> bearing in mind that this house gave a second reading committee stage and report stage to the bill of my noble friend lord longford on the question of discrimination against disabled people would it not be appropriate that that question should also be considered by the manpower services commission and by the government as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that this operation is probably one of the most effective and pain-relieving that has been established in the last years <e> <s> but will she confirm that the increase over the years in question is simply part of a rise that has spread over the last years <e> <s> will she also accept that the increase shown in the figures she gave was partly due to the planning that has gone on in advance into suitable medical teams and operating theatres <e> <s> the planning was done in advance to ensure that the numbers showed a steady increase <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that noble lords and noble baronesses have raised the disturbing question of the waiting period will the noble baroness confirm that the figures which were given to me last month by her noble friend lord glenarthur show that in fact general waiting lists are roughly more than they were in <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am most grateful <e> <s> he said i think that at the stage when i was secretary of state he did not seek a national grant <e> <s> i am referring in this amendment only to grants by local authorities <e>", "<cs> i do not want to become involved in the argument about whether the glc should spend money on arguing that it should be allowed to continue in existence <e> <s> i want to welcome some of the points which have been made by the minister <e> <s> he said that there is not a great deal of difference between us <e>", "<cs> i thought at one stage i was going to achieve what i had set out to achieve when the noble lord lord bellwin began to reply <e> <s> he said at one stage that the government would be considering these suggestions carefully before implementing grant holdback for - in the summer <e> <s> if the noble lord had said that these matters were being considered and that before the report stage he would come back with the type of assurances that have been asked for then i would have felt disposed to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord did not feel that he could make the concession that i asked of <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that there is something very disturbing about a situation in which cadets develop a disease <e> <s> can the noble lord explain why he is satisfied with the level of diagnosis <e> <s> does he not agree that the situation of this number of young people contracting glandular fever would be considered most peculiar if it were found in any other institution <e> <s> is the noble lord not concerned about this and ought there not to be further inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords while i would not for a moment suggest to the noble baroness that there should be that kind of sum paid to retain the royal national orthopaedic hospital in london is she not aware that there is a great deal of concern about the situation in stanmore itself <e> <s> this is partly because of the very run down condition of the buildings most of which were built on a temporary basis and also because of the acute shortage of nursing staff at stanmore <e> <s> in view of the excellence which this hospital has shown over very many years on a national basis not just a regional basis and a bloomsbury basis is it not essential that from bloomsbury or regionally or nationally there should be an infusion of funds in order that the stanmore scheme wherein will lie the future of the hospital is properly implemented in order that it can provide the service which has been previously provided <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl denying that his government have announced a cut of million in their grant to the medical research council <e> <s> is he aware that long answers such as he has given cannot be any justification whatsoever for a cut in research <e> <s> will he say whether there has ever been in any year under any government a reduction in grant to the medical research council <e> <s> with the present alarming increase in cancer cases will the government think again about their responsibilities in that field <e> <s> is this not a very good morning for them to start rethinking their policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i was not wishing to criticise him for the length of his reply if he had in fact been giving good news but it seemed to me that the length of his reply was to conceal very bad news <e> <s> can he justify the fact that the medical research council has fewer funds at its disposal for research during this coming year than would have otherwise been the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am most grateful to him for his detailed answer and for the concern that is being shown by his right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> can he answer for me three questions <e> <s> first how much was paid in all in redundancy payments <e> <s> secondly if these doctors were redundant how was it that there were posts to which they could then be appointed <e> <s> thirdly at a time when the national health service is facing such a serious cash crisis how can the national health service tolerate this kind of expenditure at taxpayers expense <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am a little surprised that he could not give me the total figure for redundancy payments <e> <s> is he aware that my rapid mental arithmetic for which i take little credit suggests that almost million was spent in terms of redundancy payments and pensions at that time even if one takes as a basis only a couple of years <e> <s> is this not really a rather serious situation <e> <s> is he satisfied that the action that the secretary of state is now taking will put a stop to what one can only describe as i think sleight of hand behaviour by doctors who really ought to know better <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord misunderstands me indeed i ask him whether he misunderstands me <e> <s> the complaint that i have raised with him is not that people are paid redundancy payments or that they receive pensions towards which they have probably contributed during their service <e> <s> is he not aware that the real question that i asked and which i am certain causes concern throughout the country as well as throughout the house is whether such people should then be re-appointed to well-paid posts within the national health service <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware and certainly his right honourable friend the secretary of state must be aware that that is really a scandalous situation <e>", "<cs> as i understand it five amendments are being taken in this debate and perhaps it would be for the convenience of your lordships if i were to touch on each one of them or rather to cover the whole field in the remarks i make <e>", "<cs> if it would be helpful to the committee i am of course ready to move each of those five which are the subject of this moments debate <e>", "<cs> i think that we would all want to thank the noble baroness lady lane-fox for what was a very moving argument and i think totally convincing <e> <s> i do not think that any of us would say that disabled people were pressing their case too hard <e> <s> perhaps one noble lord did earlier <e> <s> i find that an appalling statement <e> <s> i think that we all have to press on behalf of disabled people to ensure that they get the rights they are not getting at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords why is there this delay <e> <s> surely it is true that the prime minister set up this new review body to take the question of nurses pay out of cross-party or any other type of controversy <e> <s> it was a review body set up to determine <e> <s> if the report has been received can the noble viscount explain why first it has not been published and secondly the answer has not yet been given by the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my

organisations is he not aware that ever since this per cent <e> <s> was introduced the charities and a very large number of members of both houses of parliament from all parties have been pressing successive chancel-lors and that they have been thinking about this constantly but nothing has been done <e> <s> can the noble lord give the house any assurance at all that these charities will not just continue to suffer as a result of the decision taken by the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords first i am sure the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur for his explanation of this highly controversial bill <e> <s> secondly i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord caithness on his first appearance on the government front bench to wind up this debate <e> <s> my only wish for him in the mood of sympathy with which i start my speech is that he had a more attractive bill to defend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will have his opportunity to make a speech <e> <s> i want to set out from the front bench the many important things that need to be set out <e> <s> the second issue affects opticians and the public <e> <s>

roundly condemned from all sides <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to point out a side which has not condemned it of course i will now give way <e>", "<cs> my lords this is grossly unfair <e> <s> the noble lord has put his name down to make a speech <e> <s> he ought not to make such a long intervention <e> <s> if he wishes to say that the bma does not know its job that the doctors do not know

fact that the secretary of state has had this particular rayner report before him now for several weeks <e> <s> why therefore has it not been published <e> <s> i have asked the minister questions such as this on similar occasions <e> <s> when documents are prepared why can they not be <e>", "<cs> my lords first i most warmly congratulate the noble baroness lady faithfull for the way in which she

society of physiotherapy there are only practising physiotherapists and very few of them relatively are in the community <e> <s> is <e>", "<cs> my lords having been the mover of the original amendment may i say like the noble baroness lady lane-fox that i welcome enormously the statement that was made by the noble earl lord avon when he said that dial-a-ride schemes and i presume that this also means the black cab schemes could be financed under the terms of the proposed amendment and also under amendment no <e> <s> which will obviously be approved <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords under those circumstances if there are to be these further discussions to try to improve and i hope perfect the governments amendment then it would be churlish of me to press my amendment <e> <s> but i must give the noble earl warning that if at third reading we have not reached a satisfactory situation it may be that the matter must be taken again <e> <s> i hope that that will not be the case <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the permission of the house to enable the noble earl to find his notes <e> <s> the point that is really difficult it will be touched on

by now if the noble earl did not realise before he does perceive that there are some major problems of financing and of organisation and i think that as a result of this brief exchange even and of the reply that he gave and if i may say so with a little more leg pulling i think the chap who writes his briefs on this subject is certainly better than the chap who writes his briefs on some of the other subjects there will be a greater understanding by the london transport authority when it comes into existence that it has got to tackle these problems very seriously <e> <s> with the assurance

difficulties is that there cannot be an answer to the very proper question put by my noble friend lady jeger <e> <s> one has seen a number of estimates as to how much of an increase there may be in prices <e> <s> i am not going to go into the details of them <e> <s> some of them are very substantial but they may be exaggerated <e> <s> only time will tell <e> <s> this is the real problem we are facing <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment and in so doing i should like to support the generality of the argument which has been extremely well presented by both noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i think that it would he useful to give an example of a particular case and the amount of money about which we may well be talking <e> <s> i have an example of a year-old woman who now pays for nhs distance and reading glasses and who will in future pay a minimum of <e> <s> let us look at the situation <e>", "<cs> before we move from that point i want to understand it because what the noble earl is saying is very important <e> <s> he is saying that there will not be indiscriminate subsidy that therefore there will be discriminate subsidy <e> <s> who takes the decision <e> <s> how is the decision taken as to whether or not there will be a subsidy in a particular case of a person who is an out-patient <e>", "<cs> the hospital doctor <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press the minister on this matter and if he cannot give me an answer now perhaps he would do so in correspondence <e> <s> we are talking about patients who unless they are on supplementary benefits may have to pay a very substantial sum because of the nature of their eye condition <e> <s> when the minister says that the matter will not simply be decided by the doctor and that it will be decided on income grounds i need to know a little more <e> <s> surely part of the discretion will be the nature of the complaint and the amount of cost to which a patient will he subjected as well as the income of the patient <e> <s> i do not agree at all with the noble earls generalised view about means-testing but i hope that as he has corrected what he said about the doctor i asked whether it was the hospital doctor and he said yes he will before we reach the report stage write to me on this and send copies of the letter to noble lords who have taken part in this debate so that we can properly understand just how the decision is taken <e> <s> this is absolutely crucial <e>", "<cs> it will not be available <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would agree with me i am addressing the government more than i am addressing him that the question of financial need is much affected by the additional costs one may have to pay for spectacles and other services <e> <s> if a person is not at supplementary benefit level but is expected to pay more for spectacles and may require two sets in one year that affects financial need <e>", "<cs> is the minister about to make a concession <e>", "<cs> i am of course grateful to the minister for what he has said and for dealing with each of these four amendments <e> <s> i should like to make a general comment <e> <s> i have been involved with legislation in the other place as well as here for very many years <e> <s> i find it disturbing that there has not been at any stage of the bill as i understand it an occasion <e>",

service <e> <s> one reason why it is constantly argued that it would be nonsense to reduce the number of doctors community nurses and the rest is that it is at the primary health care level where health education is so important <e>", "<cs> perhaps i am too kind <e>", "<cs> i shall say that again too <e> <s> the general practitioner is of course responsible but the family practitioner committee is responsible for all the contractors who are providing services including the general practitioners <e> <s> i shall now sit down so that the minister can give us his good news <e>", "<cs> it has not been widely welcomed by me and i am the one who is proposing the amendment <e> <s> i believe that the bill goes much too far in centralising powers with the minister <e> <s> one complaint that i made on second reading which was echoed by several noble lords from different parts of the house was that over people are to be appointed to the new family practitioner committees by the secretary of state <e> <s> i believe that this is all part of the system of excessive centralisation which is not good <e> <s> of course the minister did not give me any good news <e> <s> i knew that the bill made provision for monitoring to be done centrally but i do not believe that one can effectively monitor centrally a deputising service that may work for only two or three practices <e> <s> it can be done only at the level of the family practitioner committee <e> <s> the idea of going up to the kind of level of the secretary of state or the new general manager who will be appointed under the griffiths recommendations and the thought of how he could carry out any such responsibility make the mind boggle <e>", "<cs> i rise simply to say that i agree with every word of the noble baroness lady robson <e> <s> her wisdom confirms my own reason for having reappointed her as chairman of the regional health authority at the time she accepted it <e> <s> it was a great pity that she had to leave when she did <e> <s> she was an outstanding chairman of the authority <e> <s> the noble baroness speaks with great experience i speak only with the mere experience of a former secretary of state <e> <s> with the number of appointments that i had to make i can say that it was a monumental task <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief since i agree with so many of the comments that have been made by the noble lord and the noble baroness lady robson <e> <s> my noble friend lord prys-davies referred to budgetary and manpower control <e> <s> i simply do not understand <e>", "<cs> i did not say that and the noble lord knows that i did not say that <e> <s> i said that i did not impose upon the national health service a reorganisation or a series of reorganisations <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell me if not now perhaps later how many chairmen at present are laymen and how many are members of a profession <e> <s> i do not expect the noble earl to tell me now but i would be grateful for the information before report <e>", "<cs> it is for existing chairmen <e> <s> i do not expect the noble earl to answer now and my action would not be dependent on his reply <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment to a division <e> <s> i raised the matter because i think it is very important <e> <s> it is not just a matter of choosing the best person <e> <s> it is important as i have argued to have a

briefly i wish to support entirely this amendment <e> <s> i agree that it is a better amendment than the one my noble friend and i had tabled <e> <s> i do not see that there is any logic in saying there should be an optician this number of dentists and this number of doctors but not saying that there will be one nurse <e> <s> it seems to me to be absolutely obvious <e> <s> an assurance given by a minister that the government will do that does not necessarily carry the conviction of a future minister i have argued this on many issues <e> <s> if it is the governments firm intention that there should be a nurse representative on the family practitioner committee then the best thing to do is put it in the bill <e> <s> i cannot see any possible argument against it <e>", "<cs> before he sits down <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl what is the logic of this <e> <s> i really do not understand it <e> <s> it may be that there will be nominations of nurses hut it may be that there will not <e> <s> there may be nominations of doctors dentists or opticians <e> <s> of course they are open to make those other nominations <e> <s> but if it is thought that the community nurse should be there in the same way that it is important that there should be representation of the other professions it should be included in the bill <e> <s> with deep respect to the noble earl he has not given any reason at all why it should not be in the schedule <e>", "<cs> why not <e>", "<cs> i am certain that the noble lord would not want to have a division at this stage but this is a crucial issue <e> <s> would the noble lord be satisfied if the noble earl lord caithness were to say that he would take the matter away and consider it with his right honourable friend before we come to the report stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may support this in one sentence only <e> <s> there is no logic at all in having some professions that can have deputies and others that cannot <e> <s> it is quite clear from my consultation with both the dentists and the pharmacists that they feel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed in the reply given by the noble earl <e> <s> i do not for one moment doubt his sincerity <e> <s> he has been kind enough to consult his colleagues and he has told us the conclusion which is that our proposal is the right way <e> <s> he has consulted his colleagues <e>

day-by-day basis <e> <s> what consultation has there been with bodies such as radar and the joint committee on mobility for the disabled <e> <s> i would guarantee that if the noble earl had had consultation with any of them the spastics society or the rest they would also have said that they need not just a ministerial assurance or two ministerial assurances as he has said they need it written into the bill <e> <s> it is not good enough simply to say we will leave it to the london boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not make it absolutely clear <e> <s> the four amendments being taken together are amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name and that of the noble lord <e> <s> lord kilmarnock amendments nos <e> <s> and also standing in the names of myself and the

<s> it is however part of the same debate <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up this debate and as the mover of the amendment i should like to repeat what the noble baroness lady faithfull said <e> <s> i thank the minister very sincerely for the trouble that he has taken and i greatly appreciate the amendment which he has tabled <e> <s> we may still find that discussion about its application may be helpful later on <e> <s> i also agree that guidelines will be necessary not only for local authorities but for voluntary organisations <e> <s> until they are told exactly what this will mean i do not think that they will be at all clear about the situation <e> <s> as citizens advice bureaux are registered charities i presume that they will be included and are not omitted from the ministers

he say a little more about how the revised recall system will work bearing in mind that the previous recall system did not really succeed <e> <s> finally can he say something of the role of general practitioners who have the closest contact with patients and of the family practitioner committees in helping to make the scheme work <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord prysdavies i am not very satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> i certainly do not intend to press the matter to a division but i should like to consider whether it is a matter that we might return to at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a word to the words of the noble baroness <e> <s> she speaks with a great deal of experience <e> <s> some of the experience of which she speaks was acquired when i was secretary of state <e> <s> it was i who had to negotiate with difficult treasury ministers <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> i have to say to your lordships that nothing that the minister has said has satisfied me at all <e> <s> i of course agree and perhaps i may address these remarks to my fellow schoolmate the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that there needs to be a degree of retrospection <e> <s> that is the way in which over the years we have determined levels sometimes up and sometimes down but we can do it within the course of months <e> <s> if we had no system of adjustment in the light of say a year s trading then we should be grossly unfair to the taxpayers let alone to the contractors because sometimes it is one way and sometimes it is the other <e> <s> one cannot tell which way it will be or how much it will be until roughly a year has elapsed <e> <s> so to that extent i go along with the minister but i go along with him no further <e>", "<cs> i am not objecting at all to a retrospective settlement and the amendment makes it perfectly clear that there needs to be a retrospective settlement but that retrospective settlement should relate to payments made by both sides over a period of months <e> <s> it may be that the actual money is not paid until the months have elapsed but unless my amendment is carried or unless the minister comes forward with something else at the report stage the period of retrospection could be five years six years or seven years <e> <s> the minister could have absolutely unlimited powers <e> <s> surely noble lords cannot tolerate that and we should think for a moment about the morality of the issue <e> <s> of course i accept a period of up <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton has rendered the committee a great service <e> <s> i did not know that the matter was to go to appeal and i think he said the minister did not know <e> <s> i should have known but it is even more the case that the minister should have known <e> <s> it would be absolutely wrong for us to go through report stage without the courts having decided <e> <s> i hope that what the noble lord lord renton said will be taken very seriously by the government otherwise inevitably we shall have to come back to it at report stage <e>", "<cs> what a good idea <e>", "<cs> i really fail to understand the argument put forward by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he said they are not associated employees <e> <s> that is the problem and that is why i tabled this amendment <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord kilmarnock said one wants to see in the interests of the service people free to move from one area authority to another <e> <s> that is particularly so now that we have quite rightly following the reorganisation an increased number of health authorities <e>", "<cs> with respect those who are employed by a local authority are in an entirely different position from those who are employed by a health authority <e> <s> a local authority is an elected body <e> <s> it determines its own policy and draws its own rates <e> <s> it is not almost totally dependent as is the national health service on tax contributions <e> <s> the national health service is of a unity <e> <s> it is not of a unity to the extent that we should like it to be and there have been arguments about this on other amendments <e> <s> but we all wish it to be of a unity <e> <s> so to say that teachers for example would be put at a disadvantage does not impress me one little bit <e>", "<cs> agreement reached across the front benches which cannot of course bind those who are not on the front benches was that we would have a comprehensive debate taking in amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i too am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has reassured me on a number of important points <e> <s> i cannot say he has satisfied me i will come to that in a moment or two <e> <s> but i want to say that i think the whole committee welcomes the abolition of the household duties test though i would not follow the logic of the noble baroness lady lane-fox <e> <s> she said we consulted and got it wrong <e> <s> i hope she does not go on to say <e> <s> therefore consultation is a bad thing <e> <s> it is true that we did consult and it is true that we got it wrong <e> <s> but i hope that will not be a precedent for getting it wrong again <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> that was not my suggestion at all <e> <s> i would not like that <e> <s> i think that all noble lords who have taken an interest in this whether they are on the front benches the back benches or the crossbenches certainly this includes my noble friend lord stallard should be able to do it in that way <e> <s> i think my noble friend has misunderstood <e>", "<cs> i am glad that there has been a ready response from the noble lord the pm minister and also from noble lords on different sides of the committee <e> <s> under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment that i have tabled and i shall not be moving a number of others that have not yet been reached <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord in the answer that he has given is not ruling out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have permission to ask the question standing in the name of my noble friend lord molloy <e>", "<cs> my lords who can know better than the junior hospital doctors working as hard as they do right across the country <e> <s> the committee represents junior hospital doctors <e> <s> who better than they can know the situation in the national health service <e> <s> has the minister read their report and has he seen the resolution from which i should like to quote two sentences only <e> <s> one is <e>", "<cs> my lords sometimes one wonders whether ministers who answer from the dispatch box see very much of doctors nurses and hospitals around the country <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for saying that he will supply a copy of the correspondence which he has had <e> <s> in return i shall supply a copy of the correspondence which i have had which involves not only the hospital junior staff committee but the british medical association itself in support of them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as a result of my previous constituency interests i know the area in question extremely well and have tramped over halvergate marshes <e> <s> is he aware also that to say that it is an isolated piece of land is really far from the truth in the sense that it is part of a very special sssi <e> <s> would he not agree that once one eats into one part then that is the thin end of the wedge <e> <s> he called it a cleft stick but it is the thin end of the wedge <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from what the minister has just said that if there is a chipping <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the points made by my noble friend apply equally to the elderly <e> <s> would he agree that the provision of private homes is now one of the fastest growing industries in the country <e> <s> is he aware that this is largely due to a quite dramatic increase in many cases in payments made from supplementary benefits directly to those concerned at a substantial cost to the taxpayer <e> <s> is he aware that the directors of social services have already expressed to his department much concern about this and that there is great concern in the medical profession as well <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a happy coincidence for non-smokers that the noble lord lord airedale has asked this question on the day when the london underground has gone smokeless <e> <s> in relation particularly to the nurses is the noble lord the minister aware that the royal college of nursing and other organisations representing nurses are very worried about this problem <e> <s> is there more that he thinks his right honourable friend can do to ensure that nurses in training have an opportunity to have brought to their attention the grave dangers of smoking and the importance of their setting a lead for others <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has on a number of occasions indicated the attitude of the government towards hospital waiting lists does he not agree that it should be a responsibility of the government to look at waiting times in accident and emergency units <e> <s> is he aware that the association of casualty surgeons tells me that it is not unusual for patients to wait for up to five hours at st thomas hospital and three-and-a-half hours at kings college hospital and will not the situation become very much worse when the middlesex hospital and st leonards hackney close very soon <e> <s> are there any other hospitals that are now at risk and is this not likely to be a growing problem on which the government really should take some serious action <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord said quite rightly that this question relates to central london will he comment on the very imminent closure of the accident and emergency centres at the middlesex hospital and at st leonards hackney and say whether any others are in danger <e> <s> surely this is absolutely relevant to the question which i put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that the british refugee council in which i am deeply involved will greatly welcome the statement she has made <e> <s> does she not agree that if flowing from the icara ii conference there are specific projects which may fall outside the additional million that the government will at least give sympathetic consideration particularly if the projects are being run by british voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister pursue the noble baronesss plea that the department itself and not only the regions should look very carefully at this shortage of ent consultants whether through absence of applicants or through shortage of funds <e> <s> is he aware that this covers quite a number of areas in the north of england including i understand middlesbrough hartlepool grimsby hull and darlington and it is for them a serious problem <e> <s> bearing in mind that the northern region is a rawp benefiting region would the department look carefully at the capital and revenue programme to see whether assistance cannot be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> i just want to say to the minister that i hope that he will make no concessions whatsoever to the arguments that have been put forward even by my noble friend <e> <s> even on our side it has been known that we have differences and there is nothing disgraceful about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say one sentence <e> <s> since we debated this at length in the committee stage and i made quite a lengthy and i thought totally convincing argument in favour of a similar amendment i shall not repeat it now but i totally support lord cullen <e>", "<cs> my lords is this point made clear in the bill which is before us <e> <s> if it is it is a very encouraging reassurance <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> he gave one or two assurances which i found helpful <e> <s> one concerned post-cataract cases <e> <s> whether he satisfied my noble friend lord ross of marnock i am not sure <e> <s> the minister had to admit that this provision was not in the bill <e> <s> i am always interested as <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say only a few words because much of the argument in favour of this amendment i sought to set out though without effect or without effect for those who voted against in connection with the previous amendment <e> <s> the question is should we run the general optical service on a means-tested basis or not <e> <s> the government are saying yes it must be run on a means-tested basis <e> <s> we could ask precisely the same questions in regard to other services should we run the health service on a means-tested basis <e> <s> should we run the dental services on a means-tested basis or not <e> <s> certainly on these benches we believe in the fundamental and original principles of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord accepted the principle behind the series of amendments which really amount to a new paragraph proposed by the noble lord lord mottistone and since he argued perhaps with some cogency that the terminology could be improved why cannot he say in view of the fact that he and his noble friend lord caithness have accepted the principle that on third reading he will have put in a form of words that will meet the wishes of the noble lord lord mottistone supported by myself and my colleagues in order to achieve clarity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> first it is not dealing only with free spectacles because it includes the words <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the very first occasion during the committee stage and report stage on which the noble earl or the noble lord has accepted an amendment from these benches perhaps i may say hip hip hooray and thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few brief words in support of this amendment <e> <s> i should have liked my name to be down to the amendment and that applies to several other amendments but we found ourselves taking this report stage rather earlier than expected and so my name is not attached to it <e> <s> certainly when i was secretary of state for social services i should have been happy to have accepted this amendment because history will certainly show that i did not make a change in allocation in the last three months of a year nor do i think that effective planning for a health authority would ever sanction a change during the last three months <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i would not have wanted to be in a position in which parliament suddenly debated the financial allocation that it had already made but i cannot see that that could happen under this amendment <e> <s> could the noble lord explain how that would be the case <e> <s> maybe the amendment is badly drafted in which case i am not blaming the noble baroness but as i understand it parliament would only come in if the secretary of state decided to make a change which a health authority be it region or district was not prepared to accept <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is to stop the secretary of state making changes upwards or downwards during the last <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could say that i was as satisfied with the ministers reply as the noble lord lord renton is although he was not totally satisfied <e> <s> my dissatisfaction extends further <e> <s> first i shall need to read with great care the speech made by the noble lord explaining what clause actually means <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton read it out in such a way that we realised that it was almost if not totally incomprehensible <e> <s> the noble lord did his best i am not criticising him to try to make sense out of a nonsensical statement a difficult task even for an able minister <e> <s> therefore i must be glad that he is to ask the draftsmen to see whether they can come up with something better <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the difficulty and i like the noble lord not being a lawyer myself would equally find it difficult to determine how a government should act when a case is before a court on precisely the issue that the government are trying to incorporate within legislation <e> <s> for the moment be that as it may although i find it very unsatisfactory <e> <s> i am not suggesting for one moment that the noble lord lord glenarthur intentionally misled your lordships but your lordships were misled at the committee stage and lord justice parker made it clear that the house had been misled <e> <s> of course i am not suggesting that was in any way intentional but it adds to the problems that we are facing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i am not in the game of playing dirty tricks even though it may have seemed that that is what i was doing <e> <s> but because it is not clear and it is not easy for the minister to state what would be the consequences of not having this clause my own assumption is that the situation would remain exactly as it is now <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton is nodding assent i think so clearly there is a possible course of action that could be taken when we reach the third reading namely that that clause should not be included in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to take only two or three sentences to support the amendment tabled by <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i always hate to find myself not in agreement with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i believe that he has misunderstood the effect of this <e> <s> it may be that the minister is going to deal with this and if he is i shall promptly sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that this is a very great advance on the situation and i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> as i understand it there is already a handbook for industrial injuries and there is a comparable handbook although in a different form for war benefits <e> <s> i was saying that there should be a separate third handbook or whatever one might call it to deal with the new benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords unless there is disagreement among any of my supporters i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords to save my making a speech in the course of this debate may i say now that if the labour government had not introduced the allowance it would not exist at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does not mean lord banks <e>", "<cs> my lords as would be expected i naturally totally support the amendment proposed by the noble lord <e> <s> lord banks <e> <s> i think that one of the saddest things that was done when this government came to power was the taking away of the right of pensioners to keep pace with rising earnings or rising prices whichever was to their best advantage <e> <s> since wages are negotiated and usually marginally keep ahead although naturally the government wish it to be only marginally ahead but inevitably they keep ahead or otherwise we would not have any inflation at all it is inevitable as the noble lord said that if the government stand by their policy of inflation-proofing only while earners are able to get something above the inflation rate bit by bit year by year pensioners will fall behind <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that we are satisfied that the rawp fair shares policy which was initiated by the previous labour government has been continued to the real advantage of the traditionally deprived regions and that we are grateful for his indication that the gap has been narrowing <e> <s> does he also accept that the benefit for the other regions is being achieved at the expense of real cuts in services in the overfunded thames regions at a time when in real terms growth is virtually nil <e>", "<cs> not at all <e>", "<cs> or before my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords having been associated with the noble lord lord cullen on the original amendment to which the noble lord lord mottistone has referred i strongly support this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the government will be able to give a conciliatory and co-operative answer because the issues covered by this which i shall not go into in any detail as they have been dealt with in detail by the house are of great and grave importance and have caused considerable concern to many organisations and individuals <e> <s> this is one of those cases where an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament would be appropriate <e> <s> i want to give my full support to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it always seems to me that if one thanks the noble lord for what he has done he is more likely to do something when one is about to make a request <e> <s> let us recognise that the minister listened very carefully to what was said on both sides of the house and has made a considerable improvement <e> <s> with that expression of thanks to him i shall reserve my further words for what i want him still to do <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so taxation has been with us for a very long time <e> <s> this is not a bill to introduce a form of taxation income tax or any other form of taxation <e> <s> this is a bill which is instituting measures which would retrospectively authorise the government to do something which the courts have questioned or rather which is still questioned by the courts as to its legality <e> <s> i would submit that there is no similarity at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment to a vote but i wonder whether he can say a little more about the negotiations and what he hopes to propose because i made very clear to your lordships that the principle of retrospection to a limited extent and over a limited period has been recognised over many years as part of the system of payment as the noble lord said in terms of taxation <e> <s> much of my objection during the various stages of this bill through your lordships house has been based on the point that four years is an intolerable period of time <e> <s> if the noble lord is to propose that it should be a shorter period of time i wonder whether he will say something about that which would be reassuring to the profession and to your lordships since i cannot be the only noble lord and i am less noble than most who has been worried about a situation in which retrospection would be carried through for four years <e> <s> this really is a very serious situation for those who are seeking to carry out an honourable business in contract with the national health service seeking to serve the needs of their patients <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord can perhaps say something that will be helpful to the contractors as well as reassuring to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed it is <e> <s> i have said before that a year is a reasonable period of time to reach a calculation and if that can be worked out i shall be very satisfied <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord the minister used the term rebuilding the relationship <e> <s> i hope he recognises that that is a task he will have to fulfil because as a result of this measure which will pass through your lordships house today a great deal of damage has been done to the relationship between the noble lords department and the opticians as well as other professions <e> <s> a great deal of damage has been done not only to the opticians as contractors but to individuals who gain benefit from the services provided by opticians <e>", "<cs> my lords just a few final words from this side of the house before the bill passes <e> <s> the only matter i want to defend the government on is having a miscellaneous provisions bill <e> <s> it makes it a ragbag but there are times when there are good things which one wants to do and one puts them all in a bag and brings them forward <e> <s> the trouble is that there are not any good things in this bag <e> <s> that is why at the beginning i called this a ragbag <e> <s> as one plucks out each little bit from the bag one realises that there is not a single item which it was necessary to bring forward at this stage or in this form <e> <s> but we have made some advances and therefore i too thank the ministers on the government bench for their courtesy and helpfulness <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister can say that again <e>", "<cs> my lords the question basically is about the number of doctors and nurses who are unemployed <e> <s> is it not very disturbing that the minister cannot give those figures <e> <s> is it not the case that his right honourable friend the secretary of state is responsible to parliament for the provision of the national health service and surely the figures should be available <e> <s> has the noble lord read the bmas claim that there are now doctors unemployed and that is a current figure and the claim of the royal college of nurses that there are roughly nurses who are unemployed <e> <s> is it not grossly unsatisfactory that the noble lord cannot give the actual figures to the house when the professional bodies themselves are giving figures which are deeply disturbing to the health service and to the nation <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the medical research council which of course has the main and central responsibility for research into this very disturbing problem <e> <s> is he aware that professor john davies and dr colin morley of addenbrookes hospital cambridge submitted three projects for support from the medical research council costing in all <e> <s> they received a grant of which was a drop in the ocean <e> <s> as i understand it that was because of the inadequacy of dhss funding <e> <s> they are highly reputable researchers <e> <s> would not the minister together with his right honourable friend look at this with some sense of urgency because here is a problem the answer to which he himself admitted is not clear <e> <s> here are highly qualified people prepared to launch research in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect and following on from that as i mentioned there were three projects and the minister has referred to only one of them <e> <s> is he aware that the medical research council was prepared to fund the other two had funds been available <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the safety standards that are supposedly required for home-produced toys should not these same standards apply to toys imported from abroad particularly in view of the fact that quite obviously there has been a substantial increase in the number of dangerous toys being imported into this country <e> <s> is not this a rather urgent problem <e>", "<cs> my lords having seen the statistics of new notifications of drug addicts published by the home office which show a per cent <e> <s> increase in the number of new addicts in compared to the figure in will the government not agree that they must accept some share of the responsibility for what is now a plague of epidemic proportions first by their own decision to cut back on the number of customs officers which happily they have now rectified and secondly by the totally inadequate financial provisions made available to health authorities for treatment centres <e> <s> in most parts of the country there is no place where drug addicts can be treated <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like with other noble lords to thank my noble friend lord rea very sincerely for enabling us to have this debate and for so much expertise which came from the noble lord lord colwyn and the noble baroness lady cox as well as from those of us laymen who threw in such good advice as we possibly could <e> <s> i was delighted to see that the noble baroness lists among her hobbies hill walking and she will note that i list among mine camping which implies the same <e> <s> i shall state my own personal interests first <e> <s> i do not smoke <e> <s> as a result of the wisdom of my wife and the advice of the coronary prevention group at home we have only skimmed milk wholemeal bread no sugar salt substitute and fibre-rich carbohydrates <e> <s> i do not get enough exercise and thus i am marginally overweight <e> <s> both my parents lived well into their s and so i reckon i have another years or more in your lordships house but i could he proved wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this is the sixth occasion on which we have asked him <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say why he previously said that it would be published soon and he now says that it may be published <e> <s> what is the reason for this withdrawal from a commitment that it will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that research into the treatment and cure of diseases is as vital to the national interest as research into industrial development is vital for the economic outlook of this country <e> <s> does he not feel a deep sense of concern because there will be million less available for <e>", "<cs> my lords at the start of this very important debate let me make it quite clear that though i am speaking from the opposition front bench nothing that i say is other than my own <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not very unsatisfactory that after what i think is now eight months the minister should still not be able to give a date when the binder hamlyn report is to be published <e> <s> it is obviously of great importance to the whole question of our system of primary health care <e> <s> first of all it was going to be published then it was said it might be published then it was possibly to be published then it was fairly soon to be published and now we are back to might be published <e> <s> are not the professions the house and the public entitled to see a report which after all has been paid for by taxpayers money <e> <s> why are the minister and his right honourable friend so cagey about this <e> <s> or could it be that like the log of the conqueror it has been lost <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one or two questions to the minister <e> <s> first will the minister confirm that the advertisement for the chairman of the board nationally first appeared on th april <e> <s> does the minister not feel that seven months is an extraordinarily long time in order to find the right person <e> <s> would it not have been easier for the whole operation to have been carried out at regional and district level after the national appointment had been made <e> <s> finally will he say whether he thinks it is a good thing that the secretary of state should interfere too much in the regional appointments <e> <s> do not the regional people know best <e> <s> in how many cases has the secretary of state called in short lists that have been drawn up by the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for what he said in response to my first question <e> <s> my second question related to regional appointments and to whether it was wise that the secretary of state should become involved in them <e> <s> is it not best that they should be made by the regions themselves <e> <s> in how many cases has the secretary of state called in a short list to seek to add names to it <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the un law of the sea convention deals among many other issues advantageous to britain with pollution of the seas why are the government so reluctant to sign this convention in the negotiation of which to my personal knowledge the uk has played so active a role <e> <s> are we going to sign this convention or are we not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that there was consultation at the time when the coin was introduced <e> <s> was there consultation with <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister cannot answer that specific question which was how many who ought to have gone to hospital for treatment have gone to prison where they cannot receive treatment is that not a very unsatisfactory situation <e> <s> is the noble lord not too easily satisfied by a situation in which surely he would agree a number of regional health authorities do not have suitable accommodation whether it be special hospitals regional secure units or hospitals with secure wards <e> <s> as he looks at his notes is he not able to find out and to say how many such people have been sent to prison <e> <s> is it not clear that since the mental health act was passed there have been a number of cases where people are now in prison people who are dangerous to the community and dangerous to themselves and who desperately need treatment <e> <s> is the minister not being much too complacent in the answer he gave to the noble lord lord broxbourne <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the mental health act commission is now looking at this disturbing situation <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned a number of sections of the act <e> <s> can he say how many times use has been made of section which enables the court to find out what facilities exist in the different regional health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house owes a great debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for introducing the debate <e> <s> we may be thin on the ground at the moment but the debate has attracted not only the minister but eight former ministers three former heads of the civil service department and two other very senior officials within the government service <e> <s> they have all expressed themselves with great clarity <e>", "<cs> well my lords they are they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what statements i have made might be called astonishing <e>", "<cs> my lords it has also been said in this house by noble lords who have given names that the number of those who are coming forward to join the civil service and who see this as a prospect for them of a rewarding career is significantly decreasing <e>", "<cs> my lords be that as it may it is clear that those who are now in the civil service are by one means or another expressing concern <e> <s> when the noble lord lord allen who after all has had a lifetime of public service if the noble lord wants to write me off let him do it but he will not write off the noble lord lord allen whose experience is far greater than mine and whose knowledge and i would say wisdom too is greater than mine <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not mention names i will mention the situation which of course i did not intend to do but the noble lord has asked me <e> <s> the prime minister made it perfectly clear that statements were made in another place concerning the sinking of the belgrano which were known to be untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not raise that myself <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell asked me to give an <e>", "<cs> not paid my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> does he not realise that members of your lordships house are so kind and so generous that of course they say nice things to him about his speeches <e> <s> they actually say nice things to me about my speeches and no doubt that applies to others as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur for answering so completely the questions that were put <e> <s> when i say completely i do not mean satisfactorily i mean completely <e> <s> he would not expect me to be satisfied with a number of the answers that he gave <e> <s> i am going to take only a couple of minutes in dealing with a few of the points <e>", "<cs> but it is still the case my lords that it will not be until april as i understand it that it will be free to advertise in a way which up to now has been denied it under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put two questions to the minister <e> <s> first bearing in mind the strong condemnation of the governments proposals by the british medical association the pharmaceutical industry the pharmacists and those who speak on behalf of the elderly and infirm what support do the government have for the proposals that are now before the country and before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister recognise that the reason why the bma have not cared to comment is that they are totally opposed to the whole principle on which the government are now basing a limited list <e> <s> does he not understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that his reply is very disappointing and will he think again about this <e> <s> is he aware that the researches that have been published by a number of institutions show that so far as the long-term unemployed are concerned there is a per cent <e> <s> increase in suicides that by the age of most children of the long-term unemployed are an inch shorter than those of employed families and that there is a substantial increase in mental and physical illness as well as a very serious increase in family breakdowns <e> <s> will he not consider that a major overall survey is essential if he is not satisfied by the research that has already been published <e>", "<cs> my lords the researches to which i referred were done not in the united states but in this country <e> <s> is the minister aware that it was not i who cast doubt on their validity but he himself <e> <s> if he does not accept the validity of the researches done in university research departments would it not be sensible for him to institute precisely the proposal made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the secretary of state by his constant changes in the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme by his peremptory cuts in the drugs bill and now by his proposal as referred to by the noble lord to introduce a limited list of drugs for prescribing by gps is threatening the research basis of the pharmaceutical industry in this country and has already deterred significant inward investment and damaged the export prospects of one of the most important and successful industries in britain today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that i have not been pressing him on the limited list because there is an unstarred question down on that for i believe next week <e> <s> however i want to press him and ask whether he is aware of the seriousness of the situation <e> <s> is he aware that i can produce evidence not only of inward investment that is not now proceeding but also of inward investment that has been cancelled by the drug industry which is deeply concerned at the present situation <e> <s> does the minister comprehend the importance of what is now happening as a result of these cutbacks <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for introducing this dicussion and for the way in which he did it <e> <s> i must say that i agreed with almost all that he had to say <e> <s> i think that perhaps to ask the government to delay for two years may be going too far but i would certainly join in his plea that the present method which is proposed should not be proceeded with and that there should be effective consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords in defence of the noble earl may i ask whether he would not agree that this is an extremely serious problem <e> <s> has the noble earl seen the comments of dr jonathan weber an aids specialist from st marys hospital paddington and mr richard wells of the royal college of nursing to the effect that the governments response to the new and growing threat of aids is derisory <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that hospitals hit by health service cuts are now having to cope with upwards of aids patients some of whom are very seriously ill <e> <s> can he say why this has not yet been declared a notifiable disease <e> <s> finally will he confirm that there has been no investment in special aids units or in the education of the public and the health service staff <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important that the government should take a very early decision on this question <e> <s> since i have dared to rise to my feet again can the noble earl answer my question about what resources not just the question of research but resources the government have put into the provision of units and also into education <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept that in the very useful debate to which he has just made reference not a single speaker from any of the benches supported the proposals put forward by the government <e> <s> referring to the question of consultation has there been any consultation with people who live in the rural areas <e> <s> does he not accept that quite apart from the elderly the disabled the sick and the poor the people who live in rural areas will suffer very considerably in so far as they may have to travel to chemists at a very considerable distance in order to get drugs if those drugs are not on the list that is under the national health service <e> <s> will he give some consideration to relieving the already heavy pressures upon people who live in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very valuable debate and of course in this house we have a vast wealth of experience <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl who is to reply will ask his right honourable friend the secretary of state to read this debate because it has been very interesting <e> <s> last week we had a debate on the governments proposed limited list for prescribing <e> <s> not a single speaker in that debate except the minister supported the governments proposals <e> <s> in todays debate with only one exception every speaker has been critical of the governments approach <e> <s> i believe that the secretary of state for social services should have his attention drawn to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all most grateful to the noble lord lord hunter for raising this debate and for the manner in which he did so <e> <s> inevitably i suppose we have concentrated on the governments sudden proposals for a limited list and i want to take a minute or two of your lordships time in broadening the subject a little <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that he had done so before and then he would have saved the noble lord lord molson a great deal of money which i am sure the noble lord would have welcomed <e> <s> but that does not undermine the argument <e> <s> i am just saying that there are circumstances which have to be taken into account whether it is mogadon or the noble lord lord molson or some other person or some other drug <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble earl lord halsbury was involved in finding a solution because i do not think there was any doubt at all that the drug produced the thalidomide children with all the problems from which they are now suffering as young adults but the compensation that was paid can never be proper compensation <e> <s> it led to the committee on the safety of medicines and that was a good result which came from a great tragedy <e>", "<cs> i disagree my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> holland and belgium my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not more likely that the investment will go to belgium holland and possibly to ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble earl for repeating his right honourable friends long statement made in another place <e> <s> make no mistake about it this is an extremely important statement <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original intervention it was not my wish to promote the noble lord nor would it be my wish to demote him because i know that it was not his statement it was the statement of his right honourable friend and it is his right honourable friend whom we must blame <e> <s> may i make two points <e> <s> first the noble lord has not really answered the question about consultation <e> <s> surely he <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> he will be aware that in the debate on the warnock report in this house on st october when we all spoke as individuals though there were differing views on many of the recommendations in the warnock report there was near unity in the strength of feeling against the practice of surrogate motherhood and the need for early legislation especially to make illegal the agencies making money out of these negotiations <e> <s> thus in my personal view most members of your lordships house will welcome the governments intentions as set out in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble lords first answer would it not be better if he did have information centrally <e> <s> but secondly is it not even more important that residential accommodation should be made available in the community for many of these long-stay psychiatric patients who no longer need hospital care <e> <s> can the noble lord say how much additional accommodation has been provided in the community under the governments so-called community care programme <e> <s> to what extent does the noble lord expect this to be affected by reductions in rate support grant and by rate capping <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place by his right honourable friend the secretary of state but i have to say that that is about the end of the thanks that i am going to give him except that i am glad that the secretary of state is not narrowing the range of exemptions that is one relief <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister was kind enough to ask me a question which is perhaps strange but i shall try to answer it <e> <s> he asked how we would pay if we did not use the method that the government have chosen <e> <s> throughout the period of the last labour government prescription charges remained at p nothing like at all <e> <s> of course there must be a limit to the total cost but it should be borne by the taxpayer <e> <s> i argued very strongly and this is the answer to the noble lords question that in our view it should not be borne by the sick it should be borne by the whole population who pay taxes <e> <s> when the noble lord said that exemptions cover <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering a question asked by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he was talking about exemptions <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that there are over million unemployed people who are not exempt at all <e> <s> if he hinks that those people are not entitled and are not in need then he is absolutely wrong <e> <s> this level of charge is a deterrent and it is silly for either ministers or opposition spokesmen to think that they know better about their patients than doctors and dentists <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for repeating the answer given in another place which inevitably leads to a large number of questions <e> <s> i am sure he will agree that a disturbing and sad situation has been revealed in oxfordshire that looks like the tip of a frightening and large iceberg <e> <s> does the noble lord the minister accept that cervical cancer is the one form of cancer which not only is easy to detect with a simple smear but can be cured if treated in good time <e> <s> does <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may follow up on the point made by the noble baroness about the breakdown of the total figures <e> <s> quite obviously the largest figures were in the age group between and <e> <s> could there not be a tighter breakdown in this higher age group <e> <s> i should be fascinated to know the figures for the to age group <e> <s> as the minister said it is perhaps at the age of where the greatest danger lies <e> <s> i should have thought that the figure for the to group is a crucial one <e> <s> can he say whether the dhss issued a statement as i quoted saying that there were going to be no new initiatives as a result of this sad situation <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords and baronesses i think we all owe a very great deal of thanks to the noble baroness lady cox for opening this debate and for doing it as the noble lord lord richardson said with such skill knowledge and sensitivity <e> <s> it has been interesting that four of the speakers have been professional people with two general practitioners a consultant and a very senior nursing baroness <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham referred to the minority of women in your lordships house <e> <s> if we look at todays debate we see that they have distinguished themselves as they usually do <e> <s> that means that male laymen like myself are in a very small minority in todays debate so we must just do our best <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers last reply can he help to create some clarity out of what i believe to be chaos in the primary health care field <e> <s> with greatly increased prescription charges and dental charges changes in the nhs optical service limited list prescribing vouchers for people on supplementary benefit to pay for their nhs spectacles the failure to publish the binder hamlyn report and the governments own green paper can we now be assured that the rumours that seem to be circulating of a voucher scheme for paying to general practitioners is untrue <e> <s> will he say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was really asking whether the noble lord could give the assurance that the rumours were not true <e> <s> i certainly read what appeared in the newspapers and i hope it is not true <e> <s> i drew attention to it following an extraordinary number of changes in the primary health care scheme <e> <s> does he understand that this is causing great concern <e>", "<cs> my lords why not say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty praying <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to the noble lord that i am very sorry if i was speaking too quickly <e> <s> it was due to the fact that there are so many others who wish to speak and i do not want to deprive them of the opportunity because i happen to be the first speaker <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> will he withdraw that remark <e> <s> i made no such suggestion at all <e> <s> i made no attack on the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> i said that there are savings to be made <e> <s> i did not say that profit was a dirty word <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will withdraw allegations that are quite untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords because they are not sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an unfair attack upon doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise at precisely midnight but it certainly was not my fault that the debate started as late as it did or that so many noble lords took such an interest in it <e> <s> i want briefly to thank those who have supported my motion as amended by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and indeed others who have spoken in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it will only prolong the debate but yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i will make it absolutely clear <e> <s> when i was secretary of state for social services i made it plain that it was not the policy of the government to nationalise the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> had i not done so it would have been impossible to attract into this country the new investment as a result of which the present secretary of state is having the pleasure of opening research laboratories for which i made provision as secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to move my motion formally <e>", "<cs> my lords in order not to put my foot in it again may i also be associated with those who congratulated the chiropodists on the excellent work they perform in particular for the elderly and the handicapped <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that my noble friend lord wallace is right in two respects <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that there is a great shortage of chiropodists partly because of shortage of funds but also contrary to what he said simply because of a shortage of trained chiropodists <e> <s> is he aware that there are applications for every place in the training schools in the country <e> <s> with an ageing population and therefore a steadily increasing demand for chiropody is it not essential that more places are made available for people who are anxious to be trained in this important task so as to help elderly people keep on their feet <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that if it had not been for the generous charitable contribution from the united states there would have been upwards of high-risk patients who were waiting for surgery who would not have had that surgery <e> <s> will he also recognise that the westminster hospital cardiac unit is now threatened with closure <e> <s> we therefore have two major cardiac units of absolute <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the contribution made by mr james

of state <e> <s> i broadly welcome this statement <e> <s> i want to say that we owe a very great debt of gratitude to those doctors and dentists who came to <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to an earlier question the noble earl referred to the green paper on primary care which is still to come <e> <s> in my more aggressive moods and he will have noted i am not in such a mood today i have been

this house <e>", "<cs> my lords a week ago today i said that i thought that it was scandalous that a debate on a very important issue such as limited list prescribing should begin shortly before eight oclock and be voted on after midnight <e> <s> may i repeat my complaint tonight <e>", "<cs> this debate began at <e> <s> i really think that that is grossly unfair to your lordships house and undermines our proper ability to give careful scrutiny to bills which are passed to us from another place <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down and in the welcome presence of the

support grant rate-capping and rate penalties local authorities are finding it more and more difficult to give the support to which she referred to drug units in the community <e> <s> will she accept

colwyn for introducing this bill which as he said comes to your lordships house from another place <e> <s> i and my colleagues fully support the bill with the amendments which he hints will be brought forward at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept the widespread view of the medical and nursing profession that the decision of the government to abolish the national system of call and recall placing the responsibility on local health authorities and on family planning committees was a serious error of judgment <e> <s> secondly does she accept that having taken that decision there really was very little guidance or surveillance by the department of the way in which the local health authorities and family planning committees fulfilled their responsibilities so that only seven out of local authorities now have an effective scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness the minister accept that there are in the country increasing numbers of patients who are turning to these alternative methods of therapy sometimes recommended by their own general practitioners <e> <s> this is recognised by the bma itself <e> <s> does not the noble baroness accept that if people are to turn to alternative forms of therapy it is extremely important that the therapist should be both well trained and effectively registered <e>", "<cs> my lords although i very much welcome the statement made by the minister does she agree that there have been remarkable advances in producing oxygen both cheaply and efficiently <e> <s> bearing in mind that the british oxygen corporation is at this stage making enormous profits at the expense of the national health service will she accept that on this side of the house we would enormously appreciate the early movement forward of the documentation and tendering to which she referred <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the noble lord put a very relevant question <e> <s> is not one of the great problems that more and more youngsters are taking up what we know to be a seriously addictive habit <e> <s> i am talking about cigarette smoking <e> <s> can the noble earl say when the present voluntary agreement is to end <e>

make one of the briefest speeches on record <e> <s> all the amendments that are to be moved by the noble lord lord colwyn are ones that we recognize and that he himself recognised on second reading <e> <s> he promised that he was going to bring them forward and he has brought them forward entirely satisfactorily <e> <s> i want to say that as far as these benches are concerned we totally support the amendments <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the noble lord lord colwyn who has presented the bill and is piloting it through your lordships house will accept this amendment <e> <s> i warmly supported the bill support it now and will support it at every stage because i think that in our health service while it is on the whole extremely efficient there are cases where people are not treated as well as they should be <e> <s> the purpose of lord colwyns bill is that people should have a way in which they can make their complaints <e>", "<cs> may i intervene to ask one question <e> <s> i am delighted with what the noble earl is saying <e> <s> i do not know of course whether the noble baroness will be equally pleased but i wonder whether there will be consultation about the guidelines <e> <s> i think that is important and i should like to be reassured about the consultation before feeling myself to be fully satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding that the noble baroness says she is not going to reveal what the green paper will say and despite what she says about consultation does she agree that there could not have been consultation about the state earnings-related scheme because it was made clear by the prime minister during the election and by her right honourable friend mr norman fowler in announcing the reviews that the state earnings-related pension scheme would not be part of the study <e> <s> does she not accept that if there were now to be changes in a national agreement reached in with all the parties and all organisations that would be a gross betrayal not only of trust regarding national agreement but also of the interest of many millions of pensioners <e>", "<cs> may i say first how much all of us feel indebted to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for raising this extremely important issue and equally for having attracted in what will inevitably be a short debate so many people of experience and skill from whom i know we shall all learn <e> <s> may i also congratulate him on the timing of this debate because it is of course national deaf childrens week and nothing could be more appropriate than that we should be discussing this subject during this week though there are problems which go beyond those children <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> will he agree that it is really almost as important to ensure that we have the teachers who are trained as it is that we have the speech therapists <e>", "<cs> my lords i was at work <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that i am very disappointed at her reply <e> <s> is she aware that in the report by the royal college of nursing to the pay review body the college revealed that there is now a deficiency of nearly per cent <e> <s> in the funded establishment of trained midwives and that the trend is getting worse each year <e> <s> rather than just referring to the health authorities can the minister say what the department is doing to ensure that the pay and career structure within the midwifery profession provides adequate reward and encouragement to get people to join what is a noble and important profession <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness realise that only one-fifth of those who have been trained as midwives are now in the midwifery profession due to the pay and conditions <e> <s> is she aware of what is said in the report from the royal college of midwives <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that that is an encouraging response <e> <s> may i further ask whether she accepts the recent strictures by the comptroller and auditor general sir gordon downey on the failure of health authorities to collect the fees of private patients and the recent study which suggested that the loss amounts to about million a year <e> <s> does the minister accept that the responsibility for the collection of these private patients fees lies with the health authorities <e> <s> is it not really appalling that when the health service is so desperately in need of funds there is money that is simply not being collected <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recognise that it is not just a question of information that may be given in another place <e> <s> i have had detailed correspondence with the british medical association who are themselves very much concerned about this <e> <s> will the noble baroness say why she is not concerned about it <e>", "<cs> i rise to support most strongly the amendment moved so ably by the noble lord lord hayter and the amendment moved by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i have a great deal of respect for much of what was said by the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> my objection to it has already been stated by the right reverend prelate but much that is said in that amendment could be incorporated within the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hayter <e>", "<cs> i wish that i had the confidence of the minister <e> <s> i have to say that i do not have it at all <e> <s> all the evidence of past performance suggests that there are some local authorities who with the wishes of their electorate will wish to contribute and others who will do as i say they have done and who have decided that they are not going to increase the funds concerned <e> <s> we have to accept that <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must make my speech <e> <s> the minister gave an assurance <e> <s> in your lordships house we would always give due respect to an assurance that is given but we would give much greater respect if that were placed in the bill <e> <s> if i may mention one of the assurances to which he referred it was that there will be as much money next year as there was last year <e> <s> all he has to do is to accept amendment no <e> <s> aab which calls for subsection to be deleted because that in fact goes in exactly the opposite way <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is an answer at all <e> <s> i am speaking in favour of the amendment which would give some guarantee and some commitment <e> <s> after all even with the million we are only talking about transitional figures <e> <s> it is only a transitional period <e> <s> the noble lord made it clear himself that it is million for one year then it is reduced by the next year and then it is phased down to nothing <e> <s> he also brought out of the hat this new trust the sort of community chest which as i understand it i will certainly give way if i am wrong is a million sum that will come from selling the glc building county hall <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> i did not expect that it came just from one building <e> <s> but this is an entirely new proposal <e> <s> it is similar to the community chest schemes which have operated in the united states <e> <s> it is quite new so far as this country is concerned <e> <s> if it is million then presumably it would be the interest that would be available and that would be roughly million out of a million capital sum <e> <s> we have to bear in mind the enormous gap and the amount that we have already seen which was contributed by the glc <e> <s> the minister was absolutely fair <e> <s> the vast majority of the grants that were given by the glc were for worthwhile projects <e> <s> i think it was quite right that he should emphasise that <e> <s> but a new trust producing million extra a year if that is roughly what the estimate would be depending on interest rates the noble baroness thinks it is million or it may be a little less is clearly no answer at all to the problem <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i greatly respect what the noble lord had to say about the voluntary organisations and about his own contribution <e> <s> but is he now saying that all of these organisations have not followed the debates have not read the bill and that they are dupes who do not understand what is going on <e> <s> if he is he is doing a great disservice to some fine people who have at the head of their notepaper the names of people as distinguished as the noble lord and others who are here today <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the point raised by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> if he looks at subsection of the amendment he will see that it says <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down she referred to a meeting at which i had presided which was not of course a meeting called by me but a meeting of the national council of voluntary organisations <e> <s> i think that if the noble baroness were to consult the national council she would find that they are by no means satisfied with the assurances that have been given and that they are deeply worried as worried as they were before <e>", "<cs> may i just ask one question for clarity <e> <s> in respect of the nine london boroughs which are rate capped and the which are in grant penalty does the explanation mean that the level on which they will be either capped or in penalty will be adjusted according to the contribution that they make under the clause <e>", "<cs> my concern is exactly the same as that expressed by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> it is all very well for the noble lord the minister to point out that any such scheme shall provide but there may not be a scheme at all <e> <s> i had rather expected that the noble lord the minister would accept these two amendments <e> <s> obviously the two are dealing with different things and i should like to say a word or two about each one of them <e> <s> there is no point in having a scheme mandatory if there is not a scheme at all <e> <s> it is possible that if the word may remains there rather than shall there simply will not be either in london or in the metropolitan areas any scheme at all <e>", "<cs> i was not going to say that at all i was just saying to my noble friend that every word the minister says shows that we have now landed ourselves with a dogs breakfast <e> <s> that is what i was saying <e>", "<cs> i am very disturbed by the way in which this debate is now proceeding <e> <s> i shall immediately take up a point made by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> i find it disturbing that she should be telling us of what was said by the minister in a private meeting as a means of explaining to this committee how the bill is to work <e> <s> if a statement is to be made it should be made by ministers before this committee and not in some private meeting <e> <s> whether sir george explained the matter in exactly the way that the noble baroness recounted i just do not know <e> <s> i do not know either whether the noble lord the minister will explain this point in exactly the same way as sir george did in that private meeting <e> <s> but i do not consider that we can conduct our business in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords after what was obviously an extremely useful visit to the united states by his <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i say that i am under a challenge from the noble lord lord harris of high cross that i must not make a long speech <e> <s> what i will say is that i shall not make the longest speech of the evening <e> <s> it is most interesting that the most powerful speeches in this debate have come from two medical practitioners who know very much more about the subject than the rest of us here certainly judging by some of the speeches that have been made <e> <s> there has been a speech from one brave woman who wishes that she could stop smoking and has desperately tried to do so <e> <s> there has also been a speech by one noble lord who is a youth leader and does not wish to see any young people caught up in smoking <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that i entirely agree <e> <s> i did not suggest in any words that i used that the government were any less concerned than i was about the gravity of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl paused expecting me to get up <e> <s> i did not think that he wanted an interruption but i rise to my feet to make it perfectly clear that there are differences of view in the party <e> <s> i thought that i had made it clear right at the beginning that i was speaking for myself and that i was not attempting to speak for the official opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the point just made by the noble baroness lady trumpington is she not aware that some doctors are themselves very much in a quandary <e> <s> certainly some doctors who treat patients particularly children can find no satisfactory alternative at all to expectorants or to mucolytic drugs both of which have been banned <e> <s> can the noble baroness say what progress has been made in the establishment of the appeal system which it was announced would be introduced and also in the review system for the black list <e>", "<cs> my lords almost finished <e> <s> since the state earnings-related pension scheme and child benefits were introduced during the period that i was secretary of state for social services i wonder whether the noble baroness can confirm one or two points <e> <s> does she accept that the scheme when it was approved by both houses of parliament in was totally supported by the conservative party then in opposition as well as by the labour party in government <e> <s> does she accept that when it was launched in it was launched again with the full support of the conservative party and that mr patrick jenkin as my shadow spoke at the launching ceremony <e> <s> will the noble baroness also accept that during the period of the last election when the question of the state earnings-related pension scheme was put to the prime minister she said there were no plans to change the earnings-related component of the state pension <e> <s> it was brought on to the statute book she said with the full support of the conservative members <e>", "<cs> it was voted for on third reading my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the asian committee of the british refugee council supported by the government which has been following this situation very closely over the past few weeks may i ask why the government have not considered it appropriate to consult with the voluntary organisations who have been dealing with this issue <e> <s> will the minister accept further that the rules that have now been adopted by the british government are more stringent than those of any of our partners in europe <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the question of the united nations high commision for refugees but the united nations high commisioner is extremely concerned about the way in which the british government have handled this situation <e> <s> the high commissioner himself will be in london on <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords while very much echoing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will understand that it is at least reasonable in the light of her tribute as well as others that one should ask for an assurance that as a result of an inquiry into the method of administration of these laboratories none of their work is going to be undermined bearing in mind such cases as we have had on aids and legionnaires disease <e> <s> all i asked for was an assurance that none of the laboratories were going to close as a result of the review <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i found the noble baronesss reply very unconvincing indeed and i entirely agree with every word that was said by the noble earl lord kinnoull <e> <s> the noble baroness is not saying that what is contained in amendment no <e> <s> is not an extremely good idea <e> <s> she just says that she knows it is going to happen anyhow <e> <s> just how can she be sure it will happen anyhow <e> <s> she cannot speak on behalf of health authorities <e> <s> they act for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely accept that and i was just going on to give the noble baroness some congratulations <e> <s> as she will realise the reason i did not move amendment no <e> <s> was that she was wise enough to write virtually the identical words of amendment no <e> <s> in the names of myself and my noble friend lord prys-davies into her new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to support the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> as he pointed out and as has been said by noble lords on all sides of the house we are after all concerned with the central crucial issue of this debate that of consultation <e> <s> i do not believe that this house this reforming chamber has had adequate time to discuss this most important part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i needed advice <e>", "<cs> i am advised that in order to proceed with my speech which i wish to do

lords i have listened with great care to the noble baroness <e> <s> i trust that she will not only listen as she has but that she will read in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble earl on knowing what is a plasmaquad mass spectrometer <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether it is <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that as the then minister who introduced this into another place i am grossly dissatisfied as i am certain are very many members on both sides of the house with the reply that has been given by the noble earl <e> <s> does he recognise that this bill was introduced before the government or the opposition for that matter had given consideration to the recommendations of the royal commission chaired by lord pearson and that it was not intended to be a form of compensation for a gross degree of disablement <e> <s> we are talking after all about only a few hundred youngsters here <e> <s> it was thought at the time that it would be followed by a scheme <e> <s> but of course governments changed <e> <s> therefore it is really unfair to the individuals and the families concerned that what was a small sum at that time is an even smaller sum now <e> <s> is it not time that the government recognised that this is grossly unfair to those people involved who after all undertook this particular form of inoculation as part of the protection of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that it is actually the advice of his own department the department of health and social security that people should be vaccinated unless there is some contraindication at the time that it is unwise <e> <s> does he not accept that it is public policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i much welcome the latter part of her answer <e> <s> is the noble baroness also aware that according to the survey carried out by the college of occupational therapists itself the unfilled vacancies stand at per cent <e> <s> is the noble baroness further aware that short-staffed occupational therapy departments have to turn away patients who are in great need of occupational therapy especially amputees elderly people stroke victims and victims of long-term disabilities like multiple sclerosis arthritis and parkinsons disease <e> <s> she recognises this i hope as a very important problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the average shows an increase of almost what do ministers claims that they are reducing the hospital waiting lists now mean <e> <s> is this not the first time it has been revealed that in fact during the period of this government people are having to wait very much longer to go into hospital and more of them are having to wait to go into hospital than was the case during the period of the previous administration <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness the minister accept that during the periods of both the labour government and the conservative government there were industrial disputes which affected the length of waiting lists <e> <s> i am certain that we deeply regret that <e> <s> when will the government bring the level of waiting lists down to that at least of the average during the period when i and my predecessor were secretary of state and by what actions will it actually be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has been most helpful in the information that she has given <e> <s> i wonder whether she can say what is the present number of people on the waiting list compared with the which was the average during the period of the last government <e> <s> i understand that the figure is going down but perhaps she can tell us what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not fully understand whether the noble baroness answered the second part of my question relating to the number of beds that have been closed <e> <s> will she confirm that the figures given by the minister of state mr kenneth clarke show that on balance there has been a reduction of over the past six years <e> <s> does this significant reduction in the number of beds partly explain the very substantial increase in the waiting lists which were reported by the noble baroness on monday <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have now established that finance is not the cause of the -bed reduction may i ask whether it was the reduction in the number of nurses <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that was the first year since the creation of the nhs in which there were fewer nurses employed in the service than in previous years <e> <s> for the first time there was an actual reduction in the number of nurses <e> <s> is not that part of the explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords what about the reduction in the number of nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl recall that there were very many members on both sides of the house who were deeply opposed to the measure that was introduced to which reference has been made <e> <s> is not the question that has been raised by the noble lord lord rugby the response that immediately came from other sides of the house and the absence of knowledge on the part of the noble earl precisely what could have been prophesied as a result of the governments decision to put onto the open market or in other words to privatise the making and sale of spectacles <e> <s> was it not almost certain that we should get this kind of pathetic argument which is now taking place <e> <s> was it not the governments action itself which so many of us criticised that as has been said has created hardship to the british manufacturer and also to the patients <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble earl aware that the opticians themselves who

intentions in the world and with all the expertise at his disposal comments on prescriptions written out by opticians as if they were themselves professionals <e> <s> is not this precisely the kind of situation which all of us knew would be created when the government introduced their iniquitous bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a number of reasons for wishing to support the amendment which had originally been tabled in my name <e> <s> i was then not certain that i was going to be here at this moment and the noble viscount lord buckmaster put his name down first <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness how short is shortly <e> <s> is it true that her right honourable friend the secretary of state has had no contact with the abpi the association of the british pharmaceutical

baroness if she is able either to find a particular type of labour authority which took that view and was therefore obstructive in relation to the generality or to find the case that has been referred to by the noble baroness of a conservative authority which was prepared to be obstructive in relation to others <e> <s> it is precisely that situation towards which the amendment of the noble baroness is directed <e> <s> surely the noble baroness is not now suggesting that particular authorities because they hold a way-out view as she refers to it should be able to obstruct a scheme on behalf of

trust <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> before she leaves the subject of housing benefit does she accept that the proposal for the simplification of supplementary benefit and housing benefit are to put straight or to make clear legislation that was introduced by the present conservative government within the last four years <e>", "<cs> quite wrong

doctors and nurses <e> <s> also with fewer acute beds and longer waiting lists does the noble baroness believe that this is a good way of running the health service <e> <s> does she not accept that guys hospital is one of the countrys centres of excellence and ought not the secretary of state intervene in some way to prevent a hospital such as this being further cut back <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree with this <e> <s> if she simply freezes posts if that includes doctors nurses and professions supplementary to medicine the inevitable consequence will be that there will

leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that the agreement involved was reached between her department and the

on this <e> <s> has there been consultation with the pharmaceutical society the patients association or for that matter the monopoly committee <e> <s> why are the government seeking to clamp down as

appropriate health authority will she say whether she means that it will go to the regional health authority or to the district health authority or will it in some way be divided between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry but the reply of the noble baroness sometimes one sometimes the other is not perhaps as illuminating as it might be because it relates does it not to the question put by the noble baroness lady robson on the matter of incentives <e> <s> would she not agree that if a district health authority knows that it will receive more money for patient care if it sells some unnecessary property then it has a much greater incentive <e> <s> what does the noble baroness actually mean <e> <s> will she be more specific about <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene very briefly to say that i agree with the conclusions of the noble baroness <e> <s> i have no doubt that if it were the case which i think is unlikely that evidence emerged to show that fluoride was

discussions with the association of water authorities <e> <s> they said we dont want to have to take these decisions <e> <s> surely they ought to be taken by people who are actually elected to take

understand how she can stand up and make a point like that <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i would wish to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> it does not as he said go as far as the previous amendment which was very nearly carried <e> <s> but it certainly does indicate to the health authorities that they have to do rather more than simply have <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly support the amendment proposed by my noble friend <e> <s> i have here some of the research findings on the benefit of milk <e> <s> there was a five-year study of schoolchildren in scotland and

costly operation and that the capital cost will be about million if it is carried out all over the country <e> <s> but i am afraid that i do not think that will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept my pleasure that there is to be this meeting this afternoon <e> <s> did he give an assurance that the point made by the noble lord lord airedale in his question will be referred to the tobacco industry <e> <s> furthermore has the noble earl the minister seen the more flagrant breach in my view of the voluntary agreement which i believe has almost collapsed in the advertisements

players in the world all of whom are non-smokers <e>", "<cs> my lords what about this one <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl permit me to press him further on the question that i have just put <e> <s> surely it is part of the voluntary code that there should be no suggestion that the smoking of cigarettes is in some way linked with physical prowess and fitness <e> <s> surely if linked with tennis it is precisely that <e>", "<cs> i am assuming that the intervention of the noble baroness was before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> perhaps i may therefore reply to the point before i sit down <e> <s> the question of who is aged is not dependent upon the age but is dependent upon the need <e> <s> the majority of your lordships are not aged <e> <s> you may receive a pension it may even include the extra pence a week god bless you which will make a whole difference to your lifestyle <e> <s> but it is need with which we are concerned <e> <s> at a later stage we shall be concerned with

retirement age and who are as fit as a fiddle <e> <s> they may be they may be they may be <e> <s> whatever their age the question is do we make provision for those whose advancing years have lessened their ability to climb on to a bus without difficulty <e> <s> with respect to the noble baroness who i always respect and whose wisdom is known to the committee if we had sought to include a provision

as one feels <e> <s> that applies to all of us <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all those who have taken part in what has been a most useful debate <e> <s> i remember that the noble lord lord zouche

my noble friend <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes i shall of course give way <e> <s> well let me say that i do not intend to divide the committee <e> <s> one of the great advantages of having the privilege of winding up is that one can count on so much wisdom from those who support the cause here <e> <s> if the minister has to argue the case with his right honourable friend the strength of the case is immensely increased by the fact that we have decided not to put this to the vote <e> <s> the interventions of the noble baroness and the noble lord lord mottistone and others who have said do not put it to a division add to the strength of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness was not suggesting that there should be competition in the particular field that is the subject of the question asked by the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> since the minister has confirmed that it is supposed to be an absolute rule confirmed by the british dental association and by the dental schools that syringes should not be re-used and since there may be evidence that some practitioners are in breach of that rule would the noble baroness not consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that i was not proposing that there should be legislation <e> <s> in the same way that we have health and safety legislation that is obligatory upon employers and since this too is a safety matter i was simply asking whether the noble baroness will consider with her right honourable friend whether this is perhaps a matter that could be dealt with by legislation at some stage <e>", "<cs> my lords while warmly welcoming the establishment of the working party to which the noble baroness has referred may i in support of my noble friend lady ewart-biggs ask the minister whether she has seen the recent statement made by the director of the cancer research campaign that a substantial number of the women who die each year could be saved by a breast cancer screening <e>", "<cs> may i from these benches say how much in the light of the debate that took place on th july on this issue we welcome the fact that the minister has taken on board many of the concerns that were expressed from both sides of your lordships house <e> <s> i welcome all of the amendments that he has proposed especially the reference to services such as dial-a-ride which is described in amendment no <e> <s> zba and also the fact that this relates to unsubsidised services as well as to subsidised services <e> <s> this was one of our principal fears when we were debating this matter on th july <e>", "<cs> it seems to me from his last sentence that the minister almost used the words of amendment no <e> <s> za subsection d which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords even before the noble baroness visits roehampton does she accept that over many years the limb and appliance centres have done a very remarkable job for disabled and handicapped people especially ex-servicemen

assurance that if the working party recommends that the work of these centres should be allocated to health authorities the money will be there to enable the work to be effectively carried through <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister therefore confirm that the future of st thomas hospital is in the balance because of financial restraints <e> <s> does that situation not cause her great concern <e> <s> also bearing in mind the recent decision by the minister of health to close the cardiac surgery unit at westminster hospital the plans to withdraw beds at guys and now the uncertainty about the future of st thomas hospital is not the promise that the national health service is safe in the hands

i am concerned with the three hospitals not just with st thomas hospital <e> <s> will she also accept that the rawp formula which was introduced when i was secretary of state with the provisions made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock has happily also been totally accepted by the present government <e> <s> does the noble baroness not agree that there is no difference between the previous government and the present government except that at present it is very difficult to apply the rawp formula when in real terms the rate of growth is so small <e>", "<cs> both my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i associate these benches with the deep sense of urgency conveyed by the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether apart from the representations made to the department by mind

contamination <e> <s> does she agree that there seems to be a lower standard of blood collection in the united states where of course payment is often made <e> <s> may i ask what the government are doing to make britain independent of all but british blood <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble baroness again but is it not deeply disturbing that we are only per cent <e> <s> independent for blood products in this country <e> <s> is there not something that the government can do urgently now that aids has become really one of the most serious problems that the nation faces <e>", "<cs> my lords neither the noble baroness nor i had heard of aids when i was secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i wish that i could be a little more impressed by the arguments put forward by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i should have thought that the final moment that we are now talking about which is accepting and taking a decision on a tender that has been put forward is precisely the moment at which the principle which is already written into the bill should be not uppermost but borne in mind <e>", "<cs> i accept the logic of what the noble lord said but in that case why is it emphasised that there must be <e>", "<cs> i understand the logic of the argument presented by the noble baroness <e> <s> if there were to be written in a phrase which did not necessarily specify the elderly or the disabled but which added to this phrase effective and economic application and referred to all the other obligations at which an authority is obliged to look the subsection would be clearer than it is at present <e> <s> the emphasis is on efficiency and economic application <e> <s> there is really something missing <e> <s> it may be that my words are too <e>", "<cs> i should like to give my full support to the amendment that has been moved by the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> i think the section that we seek to remove which is referring to relevant services is really not adequate <e> <s> i think it is outdated and unnecessary <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that we need something that quite clearly includes rail services <e> <s> an area that i can easily think of derbyshire for instance and the village of edale which i know well does not have a local bus service at all but it has a local railway service <e> <s> for the people of edale concessionary fares on

mottistone amendment <e> <s> your lordships have to ensure that the noble lord is able to come to the house <e> <s> otherwise he is isolated on his island <e> <s> i was delighted that the minister said he would look at the matter including dial-a-ride and ferries a little more widely than in relation to the scottish islands <e>", "<cs> i only want to say in positively one sentence since it has been so much better said by the noble baroness lady stedman and by my noble friend lord shepherd that i want to associate myself totally with this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister will agree to take it away and think about the principle even though he may come back with this either in a different form of words or in a different place in the bill <e>", "<cs> may i ask one question of the minister <e> <s> he has very kindly said that he will be willing to look at this amendment again <e> <s> of course he gave some warnings to those who moved it that he could not commit himself <e> <s> sometimes it happens in your lordships debates that between committee stage and report stage not only does the minister do some thinking but a little collective thinking can be done <e> <s> i wondered whether the minister would agree that some of those who have obviously thought a lot about this subject as well as feeling strongly about it could have an opportunity to discuss with the minister to see whether we can find a basis for something that will satisfy us all <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord the minister need apologise at all <e> <s> he actually gave a very short speech

partly from natural goodwill but that however they resulted they were achieved <e> <s> i do not believe the fact that achievements have been made in other parts of the bill can be used by any stretch

it later <e>", "<cs> my lords if this person who was recommended unanimously was thought to be unsuitable why did the minister accept him as a member of the short list <e> <s> surely if there was an objection it should be stated then <e> <s> is not this central interference inimical to good management <e> <s> is she not aware that sir maurice dorman a very distinguished public servant who is

children that there is the absurd ruling that in spite of his condition an asthmatic taxi driver must take someone who is smoking and finally that there is a massive increase in sponsorship by tobacco companies on television does she not feel and does the secretary of state not feel that both houses have a right not just to be informed of a decision that has been taken but to be consulted about the decision on such a vital question <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that there has been a tremendous change in public opinion concerning actions that the government might and should take and an increased awareness and in the light of the concern that has come from all sides of the house about the need for the house to be consulted will the noble baroness draw this to the attention of the secretary of state and will the leader of the house recognise that there is very great concern that this issue should be discussed by both houses before a decision is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the situation when i was responsible for the national health service so there are no party politics involved here <e> <s> is it not really quite illogical that hospital kitchens should be protected by crown immunity from responsibility to the courts if standards fall <e> <s> does the noble baroness now accept the report of the environmental health officers that hospital kitchens in

postponement entails no saving at all since particularly if it is a building repair job it adds to the burden of cost that may fall within the forthcoming year <e>", "<cs> that is tomorrow my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be delighted to know that i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> i want first to thank all those who have taken part in this wide-ranging debate and

unesco to the commonwealth countries and to the ec countries that the fulfilment of the threat to withdraw was dependent on progress being made <e> <s> since very substantial progress has been made on

commonwealth of the all-party select committee as has been said and yesterdays massive majority in the united kingdom commission for unesco appointed by the minister himself <e> <s> is there not a degree of betrayal of our friends in this decision announced today <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will go into a little more detail about the waiting lists which were asked about earlier by the noble lord <e> <s> will she give us the actual figures <e> <s> can she confirm that the present figures for waiting lists are still roughly higher than they were during the days of the previous administration even taking into consideration the time when waiting lists shot up during periods of industrial action <e> <s> will she give the house some more information please <e>", "<cs> my lords

and his colleagues for the thoroughness of their report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to return to two points made by the noble baroness <e> <s> the first is on the question of crown immunity and the noble baroness quoted from the report <e> <s> inevitably she was selective and that is no criticism of her <e> <s> paragraph to which the noble baroness referred states that it would

dhss survey which showed that in northern ireland some per cent <e> <s> of the to year-olds thought that they had seen cigarette advertising on television is it not clear that sports sponsorship by tobacco companies has become a very powerful weapon used by the cigarette manufacturers to get at young people the main participants in sport <e> <s> is it not time that the government intervened to stop this damaging and needless encouragement to children to take up this deadly habit <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept my gratitude and i am certain that of noble lords on all sides of the house for the reply that she has given <e> <s> in fairness to the bma would she confirm that there is no evidence at all that the document that she and i have read and that the noble viscount must also have read provides inaccurate statistics <e> <s> may i also ask whether she would dissociate the government from the view expressed to the bma by the noble viscount that early death saves the state from pensions and other consequences of longevity <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the answers which have been given by the noble baroness and i hope especially denying that the national health service is a charity when it is in fact a national service paid for by the people would not the noble baroness accept that contrary to the suggestion of the noble lord lord obrien a national lottery would encourage a cost-cutting chancellor to rely increasingly upon private funds rather than financing the national health service in the way in which both she and we believe <e>", "<cs> absolutely right my lords a fine answer <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what have been the savings so far to the national health service as a result of the limited list <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government have patched up their rather damaging dogfight with the pharmaceutical industry <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not right in believing that a stock of smallpox virus is known to be held in the united states and in the soviet union <e> <s> if that is so can the noble lord say why it is so and for what purpose it is held bearing in mind as the noble lord has said that the who has declared that smallpox has been eliminated <e> <s> secondly can the minister throw any light on the apparent failure of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine to co-operate with the health and safety executive in the light of the circular to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she can say something about the situation as it affects mentally handicapped youngsters <e> <s> from figures at my disposal i understand that there was a very substantial increase in hospital beds available for young mentally handicapped but in fact only an increase of places in the community in terms of day care support <e> <s> this occurred between and <e> <s> does this not create some concern about the extent to which community care is really operating when a large number of patients are discharged without there being adequate day care facilities in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the part of the reply given by the noble baroness which indicates that she and her department are making inquiries into what is a deeply disturbing problem <e> <s> in in the stroud district this type of meningitis was times the national average <e> <s> my second point and i wonder whether i may press her on this concerns the disturbing factor that per cent <e> <s> of cases have it seems not been reported <e> <s> does this not show an extraordinarily lax attitude on the part of the medical profession <e> <s> can the noble baroness assure the house that she is considering that side as well as the very high incidence of meningitis in the stroud district <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect is not the real question not whether the community medicine specialists are on the staff but whether they are part of the management team <e> <s> is the noble baroness not aware that there is great concern both among community physicians and even more so among nurses that they are not included among the management team <e> <s> in view of the point made by the noble lord about the importance of inoculation and communicable diseases all of which are the responsibility of the community physician is this not quite a serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry to get up again but in support of the supplementary question put by the noble baroness lady seear surely planning is not part of the responsibility of community physicians <e> <s> does the minister not agree that planning is a totally different task <e> <s> perhaps she means family planning or some other type of planning but certainly not the normal concept of planning within a health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the great public concern about the development of aids and i think logically and justifiably so is it really good enough for the government to say that it is for health authorities to decide <e> <s> is it not in fact for the government themselves to be satisfied that there is an adequate supply of virologists <e> <s> is it not a real problem at the moment that a number of very valuable research projects into this precise matter submitted by virologists are being turned down because of the cutback on medical research <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that i visited a school last week to talk on this very subject <e> <s> a young -year-old admitted he was a smoker and i asked him why he did not take note of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support my noble friend lord wallace <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the association of optical practitioners which has information on these subjects says that many poor people are not attending for eye tests because they fear that they will not be able to afford the spectacles which will then be prescribed and that poor people who may not actually be exempt from payment have been deterred from obtaining spectacles especially complex ones because of their price <e> <s> as with heating allowances does it not seem that the elderly and the poor are the people who suffer particularly under this government <e>", "<cs> in the north my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very remarkable debate <e> <s> all your lordships are deeply grateful i believe to the noble baroness lady cox for opening the debate and for the manner in which she did so <e> <s> the noble baroness made a remarkable speech exemplary in every way <e> <s> it was as i believe the noble baroness who has to reply to the debate will recognise a damning indictment of the way in which the nursing profession is being treated in the national health service today <e> <s> no one can accuse the noble baroness of irresponsible talk or of playing party politics with a dedicated profession <e> <s> she cannot be accused of over-dramatising the situation <e> <s> and certainly she cannot be accused of talking about a subject of which she does not know very much <e> <s> she knows much more than i do and much more with due respect than most of the men who have spoken in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister comment on an article on this subject in last weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will forgive me for rising again may i say that i warmly welcome the news of a campaign given by the noble baroness <e> <s> could she give some thought or ask her right honourable friend to give some thought to the idea of guidelines as proposed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for reading the statement made in another place <e> <s> the only thing that i welcome is the fact that there are to be no further increases in charges for dental and optical services <e> <s> the damage has already been done there and any further action would virtually take dentistry and optical services out of the national health service altogether <e> <s> to add more would make it rather like a bald man having a haircut <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> of course we want to see more money paid for the national health service but not at the expense of the sick namely the patients <e> <s> while thanking her for the information she gave to the house may i ask her one or two other questions <e> <s> first how much money will be raised by what she has announced today <e> <s> secondly can she refresh her own mind about the history that she told me about <e> <s> in the period of the last labour government from to there was no increase at all in prescription charges <e> <s> we inherited prescriptions at p and they were p when the conservative government took over <e> <s> they are now so we ought to get the record straight <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like as other noble lords have clone to thank the noble lord lord winstanley for introducing this timely debate and for the manner in which he did so <e> <s> it is indeed timely as other noble lords have noted following the recent ruling of the law lords on the victoria gillick challenge to the legality of the dhss guidance to doctors on family planning and advice and treatment of girls of and under <e> <s> it also follows upon the new guidance issued to doctors by the general council of the gmc and the pleas by the bma and the family planning association to the gmc to revise those guidelines <e> <s> i want to say how much i welcome the dhss circular of th march particularly in so far as it gives absolute clarity concerning confidentiality <e> <s> i wish that it had had more to say about the main subject of our debate this evening but i shall come to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will be grateful to the noble earl lord halsbury for presenting a bill which enables this extremely important subject to be aired once again particularly when mr steptoe and dr robert edwards of bourne hall clinic in cambridge have so recently announced new and i suspect controversial plans to produce surrogate babies at their clinic <e>", "<cs> i have not said anything yet my lords <e> <s> let us remember that the original bill which went quite quickly through the house in july last year did not take a position on the principles or practices of surrogacy <e> <s> it outlawed commercial surrogacy agencies in my view absolutely rightly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many of the problems which are so described apply to all sorts of other people with mental illness and that there is a very serious problem of health authorities discharging into the community patients who have been suffering from mental illness when local authorities do not have or are not using funds to provide community care <e> <s> is this not a problem which is happening all over the country <e> <s> is it not possible for the noble baronesss department to play a more active role in tackling this problem which in a sense lies between the health authorities and the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that we shall study very carefully the list when it is published <e> <s> is she aware that there is a widespread view throughout the country that membership of the government party is a very important consideration when choosing authority chairmen <e> <s> is it not wrong that authority chairmen who have criticised government policy or regional policy should in any way be excluded from reappointment <e> <s> as the noble baroness herself rightly said is it not the commitment of the persons concerned to the national health service their competence and their skill regardless of any political considerations which should govern who should be appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords the remarkable quality of this debate leads me even more than i had anticipated to congratulate my noble friend lord bottomley on his decision to inaugurate it and on the warmth and absolute commitment which he contributed in his opening speech <e> <s> we are greatly in his debt for this as we are for so many other things that he has done in his lifetime of service <e>", "<cs> my lords while i disagree with the last conclusion of the noble baroness and while i did not see the television programme to which the question refers i should like to ask whether the noble baroness is aware that my own personal hospital watch last week was involved with the proposal to close westminster hospital <e> <s> will the noble baroness assure her right honourable friend that any such move would be vigorously opposed in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords can we get a little more clarification on this because it was a very important statement that was made <e> <s> is it not the policy of the noble baronesss department at this stage to ensure that certain categories of people who might be more in danger including nurses and doctors have flu vaccine available for them <e> <s> if that is the policy surely it must be thought by her department to be of some value <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say just what ministerial discretion there is <e> <s> is she aware that there were hospitals up and down the country that had to declare a red alert <e> <s> they were unable to take in any other patients because of the patients who were admitted suffering from hypothermia or low blood temperature <e> <s> she referred to exceptionally severe weather <e> <s> is there not some discretion by which the minister can determine that these are exceptional circumstances requiring exceptional action to save exceptional people rather than the decision being taken after the crisis is over <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the end of starred questions may i ask the noble viscount the leader of the house whether he has had any indication of the intention of the minister from the department of health and social services to make clear the governments policy on flu vaccine <e> <s> he will no doubt recall that on thursday there was an exchange in this house in which my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos and i were involved when the noble baroness made a statement which was strongly critical of her own departments policy on flu vaccine <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked whether a statement could be made and i am asking the leader of the house whether there is the intention that the statement should be made <e>", "<cs> my lords what is out of order about that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not always that the noble baroness and i are in total agreement but we are in absolute agreement on the order that is laid before us <e> <s> not only do i want warmly to support the noble baroness in her proposal but i should like to express my gratitude to her for giving us a little bit of the history that led to this amalgamation <e> <s> i would agree with her that amalgamations are always welcome where they are due to the success of those concerned all too often organisations of one sort or another find themselves open to splitting or to multiplying and actually to get them to come together is always a difficult task <e> <s> i think that both organisations are entitled to the thanks and congratulations not only of the whole house but of the national health service <e> <s> this does enable us just to say a few words as the noble baroness did of thanks and congratulations to both organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that per cent <e> <s> of the time of the state registered chiropodists is spent serving the needs of elderly people and that elderly people are very high among those with low incomes and very dependent upon the national health service is it not disturbing to the minister that only per cent <e> <s> of state registered chiropodists work in the national health service because of pay and conditions and that per cent <e> <s> of funded posts for chiropodists in the national health service are not filled <e> <s> what do the minister and her colleagues propose to do about what is a very disturbing condition at a time when the number of very elderly people is growing steadily <e>", "<cs> my lords forgive me for coming to the dispatch box again but perhaps i may again ask the noble baroness the crux of my question which was is there something that can be done by the department to remedy the fact that per cent <e> <s> of those who have been trained as registered chiropodists are now working privately and not in the health service <e> <s> is there something that can be done about that because it is a trend which seems to be progressing <e>", "<cs> at this stage i want to be extremely brief and say only that the noble and learned lord lord denning in moving this amendment drew upon a recommendation in the report of the committee presided over by the noble baroness lady warnock <e> <s> if we were to do that we could go right the way through and what we really wait for is the governments considered approach to this <e> <s> it would be quite absurd to take a decision one way or the other on this amendment or the wording as it stands at present at this time of night without having had that consideration <e> <s> it does not make much difference to me whether we accept one form or the other <e> <s> at a later stage i shall say why i think that it would be unwise to proceed either with the amendment or with the clause <e>", "<cs> may i say firstly in case i forget to do so later that i am speaking purely for myself <e> <s> i am not neutral about the bill and i am not speaking for my party but only for myself <e> <s> to save the time of the committee since i and the noble lord lord winstanley have proposed that clause should not stand part of the bill that clause should not stand part of the bill and that schedules and should not be schedules to the bill i hope that the committee will permit me to deal with them all in only one speech rather than make the same speech four times <e> <s> i hope and no doubt other members will agree with me that this will be the only speech i shall make on this bill <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief because the noble lord has just said half of what i was going to say <e> <s> there are few of us here <e> <s> most of us are unwhipped and some of us are unrepresentative <e> <s> we speak for ourselves <e> <s> i do not believe that at this hour of night with this number of members we would learn anything about the views of the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness the minister accept that when the document to which she referred is published the house will want to consider it very carefully <e> <s> does she further accept that in terms either of diagnosis or of treatment by radiological methods there is always a balance of advantage and disadvantage in which medical judgments are clearly essential <e> <s> finally is the noble baroness satisfied that the whole list of regulations both international and national to which we are bound are being effectively fulfilled by the practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not the final blow to our great british national sovereignty that greenwich no longer controls timing throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the proposals were supported by the trade unions rather contrary to what was implied by the noble lord bearing in mind that as has been said cervical cancer is the only form of cancer which can be detected and therefore treated bearing in mind also as the noble baroness has said that the proposal is basically for there to be a small unit available from time to time i ask the noble lord whether it would not be absolutely right that this palace the house of commons and the house of lords should give a lead to the nation on one of the most disturbing health issues of today <e> <s> i should also like to know how many women were on the select committee which took the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow up the matter <e> <s> will the committee consider the matter again bearing in mind the great reluctance that has been shown by hardworking people to see their gps and that if there was a screening service here they would then follow that up by seeing their gps <e> <s> is not this really a matter that ought to be reconsidered with additional evidence given <e> <s> will the noble lord answer my question as to how many women were on the services committee which produced the report <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness accept that this is precisely what the royal commission on environmental pollution was doing <e> <s> it said in relation to incinerators and other methods of waste disposal that it was an historic anomaly that the national health service was excluded and that many would fail to meet the standards required by the existing acts <e> <s> can the noble baroness explain what is the logic of making a change in relation to crown immunity for kitchens when so far we have not been prepared to do so for incinerators <e> <s> will she accept that clearly there is little logic in this and if the matter is now under review will she note that there are certain to be amendments which will seek to make greater sense of the bill than it now makes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that the act which established the national health service placed the responsibility for the provision of a health service upon ministers <e> <s> does she agree that it is the responsibility of ministers to ensure that an effective health service is provided throughout the country and that for ministers constantly to say that this is the responsibility of a local health authority is not good enough <e> <s> may i ask a further question <e> <s> is she aware that there are growing numbers of hospitals being closed without adequate provision being made <e>", "<cs> my lords having spent most of the weekend at a food and health conference may i ask the noble baroness whether she is aware that i am very conscious of the poor dietary standards which still apply in this country especially in relation to children <e> <s> in its final form will the report give figures for the number of children still receiving a school meal which is so important for children from deprived families and will those figures make a comparison between those now receiving school meals and those who were receiving them before the changes in the responsibilities laid upon local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement made by her right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> i am sure she will understand that we welcome the fact that there is to be major consultation over a considerable period of time rather than a rushing in as has sometimes been the case and that your lordships will wish to have the opportunity of a debate on many of the important recommendations that are contained in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble baroness for the way in which she has dealt with the questions that have been put <e> <s> i should like to mention two small points that arise from what has been said <e> <s> can the noble baroness give an assurance that the local authorities will be included in the consultation process <e> <s> she did not mention this so that is why i ask the question <e> <s> secondly can she give a slightly clearer idea of the timescale of the operation <e> <s> i see that comments have to be received by st december and that there will have been a series of meetings conducted by ministers in different parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> is it envisaged that we shall start seeing changes fairly early next year <e> <s> is it anticipated that there may have to be legislation or can all this be done without legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for the answers that he has just given <e> <s> i wonder whether he or his right honourable friend can look more closely into the birmingham operation <e> <s> as the noble earl said it is conducted primarily through the university of birmingham <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that in respect of motor disorders such as cystic fibrosis multiple sclerosis cerebral palsy spina bifida and parkinsons disease there has been a tremendous advance by dr andrew sutton based partly on the research that has been carried out in hungary <e> <s> is the noble earl aware also that funding is a major problem <e> <s> approximately is needed in order to proceed with that absolutely vital research affecting as the noble baroness said many many children who are in a very severe condition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for what she said <e> <s> may i ask two questions in relation to whooping cough <e> <s> is there now a steady increase in the number of parents who are sensibly having their children vaccinated <e> <s> secondly in view of the number of court cases that are to be heard concerning compensation for alleged vaccine damage and the possible effect that a court ruling one way or another may have on public attitudes is the department prepared with a contingency plan for publicity in case a court ruling should have an adverse effect <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend is aware of the recently announced proposals to make drastic cuts in the clinical services of the maudsley hospital one of the greatest psychiatric hospitals in our country which will affect young adolescents disturbed children and drug addicts <e> <s> they are some of the people in our society who most need treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for the very satisfactory answers that she has given <e> <s> certainly so far as i am concerned i would not accept the advice given by my noble friend lord molloy <e> <s> however is the noble baroness absolutely satisfied that the trade in britain has been widely circulated with the names of the firms and bottlers which have been guilty of what is a very serious crime <e> <s> is she able to give an assurance that people who sell the wines all know the danger spots or the danger bottles <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly welcome the statement just made by the noble baroness concerning <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness referred to other fields but can she explain why there seems to be no change in neurosurgery <e> <s> i understand from my visit to the maudsley yesterday that there has been an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the waiting lists for beds in the neurological unit <e> <s> some of those are extremely urgent cases <e> <s> surely that ought to be included among the issues that should be postponed <e> <s> is she aware that it is not only the maudsley that is in peril <e> <s> if she looks at this evenings <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the noble lord <e> <s> lord campbell of croy may i ask whether the noble baroness recalls that when this issue was considered on a question by my noble friend lord molloy on th april i referred to the court case for compensation for vaccine damage which i said might have an adverse effect on the take-up of pertussis vaccine and to whether the department had contingency plans for such a situation <e> <s> the noble baroness quite rightly said that because of the court case it would be inappropriate to comment <e> <s> now that the court has found in favour of compensation for a plaintiff does the minister feel that she can now state what are the special publicity measures if there are special publicity measures to counter the inevitable effect of a successful plea in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the most encouraging factors about this debate has been the unanimous support from all parts of the house for this bill <e> <s> i certainly want to add my thanks to the noble baroness lady masham for her presentation of it and for what is going to be quite a difficult task in piloting this bill through your lordships house <e> <s> i should also like to give my praise to mr tom clarke the member of parliament who introduced it in another place to those voluntary organisations who helped and advised him and also to the minister of health mr barney hayhoe <e> <s> it was important that they managed to put together a package and if any of us try really seriously to destroy that package the bill may suffer as a consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly welcome the statement made by the noble baroness in clarifying the statutory instrument <e> <s> i have no worries about the statutory instrument <e> <s> in fact i congratulate not only the noble baroness but also the draftsman because i actually find the wording possible to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i first congratulate the noble lord lord cullen upon introducing this very valuable bill and echo his tribute to the iris fund <e> <s> i think it shows the role that a voluntary organisation with dedicated commitment can play by bringing forward a bill which we laymen would not have thought of <e> <s> i should like to add as the noble lord lord cullen did my thanks to mr john hannam of another place for having introduced the bill in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords while i warmly agree with both the noble baroness and the noble lord about the importance of minimising waste and danger will the noble baroness confirm that with the introduction of higher prices for prescriptions many gps are prescribing larger doses or doses for a longer period and that this sometimes has the same effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may be aware that i introduced the system of child-resistant closures but i do not know whether that will bring me any credit <e> <s> but is it not true that pharmacists will always supply on request to elderly or arthritic people

i have used tremendous restraint in not responding to the statements made by the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> i wish to make only two very brief points in supporting my noble friend and in congratulating him <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble baroness for her replies especially that to the supplementary may i ask to what extent there is a social motivation to include medication for people with chronic conditions bearing in mind particularly the present cost of prescriptions <e> <s> to what extent is the motivation cash saving as opposed to the promotion of good health <e>", "<cs> my lords i would first thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement made by her right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> one has to accept that this is a devastating blow to the secretary of state and to the national health service <e> <s> personally i had the privilege of knowing mr victor paige over many years <e> <s> in my view he is an extremely able man and deeply committed to the national health service <e> <s> his record is not one of a man who acts lightly or in a fit of temper <e> <s> he has confirmed today that his decision to resign is one on which he had been reflecting for some time so that we must assume that the decision to resign from his a year job with the undoubted effects which this action would have and would have on the national health service was over a major and fundamental issue <e> <s> in order that we may learn some of the lessons from this resignation there is a range of issues which i think we need to probe and which with respect were not dealt with in the statement read by the noble baroness but delivered by her right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for some of the comments she has made <e> <s> however may i press her a little further <e> <s> what she did not say in answer either to my questions or to those raised by the noble lord lord kilmarnock was what went wrong <e> <s> certainly the statement made by mr victor paige was very clear indeed and i expect we have all read it <e> <s> but if there is not to be an inquiry then surely at some stage in a public appointment of this kind with a resignation after months we are entitled to know what went wrong <e> <s> how can we learn anything unless we learn from the experience of this particular matter <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to horses for courses <e> <s> was this the wrong horse for this course or was the course the wrong course <e> <s> is it better that you appoint as general manager for the national health service someone whose experience has not been in that service <e> <s> all these questions are going to be asked and at some time or other if not now answers will have to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i must thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement given in another place by her right honourable friend <e> <s> one recognises that this is in a sense an interim report and that there is more to come <e> <s> however having had the opportunity of only glancing through this very <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness having established herself as the listening baroness or minister may i pursue two points briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords we are greatly in the debt of the noble lord lord hunter for having introduced this important debate and i want to thank him <e> <s> at one stage he was wondering whether there would be adequate response to the subject that he had chosen <e> <s> when i realised that he had attracted a former assistant director of the nuffield foundation a professor of nursing two general practitioners a dentist and two old politicians if i may say so i began to ask myself is there a pharmacist in the house <e> <s> we have not actually got a pharmacist but we have got the patron of the dispensing doctors association so we have done the next best thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not paid for it if that was the suggestion

committee of which the noble baroness lady faithfull is chairman i start by saying that i agree with every word that she said and that very much includes the welcome and gratitude that she expressed to the noble baroness lady lane-fox for introducing the measure and admiration for dennis walters for introducing the original measure <e> <s> however i have to say that had it not been significantly changed through all-party collusion in another place as some might say i should have found myself standing at this dispatch box disagreeing with what was perhaps the major part of the bill <e> <s> as we recognise we are now dealing with a bill which in almost every respect is different from the one that was introduced with the very best of motives by dennis walters with all the experience that he has and the sympathetic approach that has been referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like warmly to congratulate the noble baroness on introducting the bill and on the manner in which she did so <e> <s> on reading the report of the second reading in another place it is interesting to note that the mover of the bill did not indicate its purpose at all <e> <s> i believe that the house and those who read our reports will greatly appreciate the clarity with which the noble baroness presented the bill this evening <e> <s> i welcome it totally <e> <s> i can perhaps give two main reasons for doing so <e> <s> first there is the general principle of greater openness to which the noble earl lord grey referred <e> <s> in society as a whole there is an increasing feeling that we have too much secrecy and that the public are not sufficiently involved <e> <s> any step such as this that can be taken which enables the public to know what is going on and so enable them to participate more effectively is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> may i add a word to the arguments that have been put forward both by my noble friend and by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> yesterday i had a meeting with longstanding traditional welfare <e>", "<cs> may i respond very briefly to the points very eloquently made by the noble baroness <e> <s> it is quite right that elderly people are very proud and do not like to go and ask for means-tested benefits <e> <s> this is the advantage of the amendment that has been put forward by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> the noble baroness says that it is an entitlement but it is an entitlement only when you have proved the extent of your poverty <e> <s> that is the case <e> <s> to me that does not mean an entitlement <e> <s> an entitlement is something that the state accords to you because you are an elderly person and not because you are poor <e> <s> that is why i think it should be in this part of the bill and not simply related to the social fund <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness is not going to expand the argument and having sat like a trappist monk until the last amendment perhaps i may say a word on an issue on which i feel very strongly <e> <s> having myself been involved in the introduction of the new pension scheme as secretary of state i want to express myself and to state the arguments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord recently asked the noble lord lord banks to give way <e> <s> will he now give way <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> the noble lord was saying that only half the population is included in serps <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord why that is so <e> <s> we should like to see included the whole of the population who have had earnings at any stage during their working lives <e> <s> that can apply to people who were at some stage unemployed and who were at some stage employed <e> <s> it can apply to disabled people who may have gone through training courses who have been earners but who are now disabled and unable to work but who may perhaps return to part-time work <e> <s> it could apply to women and all the other categories about which i was speaking who are all people we want to see within serps <e>", "<cs> i quoted an important statement that the noble baroness made on second reading when we were talking about the unemployed <e> <s> it was that she did not in any way suggest that there might not be a problem in relation to this group in the early part of the next century <e> <s> she thought that it was a problem which could be sensibly examined in relation to the unemployment problem that existed at that time and was not one which we needed to settle at this time <e> <s> she said that it was an issue that we could look at in committee <e> <s> did she not at that stage give us hope that there might be a morsel thrown towards us <e>", "<cs> i fear that i gave notice that i would move that clause should not stand part of the bill although i hoped that i would not have to do so because we would have had something from the noble baroness <e> <s> i know she said that she would look again at amendment no <e> <s> but that is not enough <e> <s> i believe that this is the most important clause in part i of the bill <e> <s> it is absolutely fundamental because it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for getting up and saying exactly what she said because that is always far better than any attempt to paraphrase <e> <s> i disagreed with what she said just as much as i was going to disagree with my paraphrase of what she said <e> <s> i do not believe that every years we should have a look at our pension scheme and therefore change peoples expectations <e> <s> what matters is not just the serps cuts but the total effect of the governments policies on the future value of the state pension basic earnings-related as a proportion of pre-retirement earnings <e> <s> if earnings rise by an average of per cent <e> <s> per annum as the minister suggested was the basis and we know it is of the governments calculation the effect of tying the basic pension to <e>", "<cs> it would be presumptuous and quite unnecessary for me to add any further argument to the very well argued case put forward by the noble lord lord tranmire who himself drafted the amendment <e> <s> i was impressed by it and put my name to it because i felt that there was a case here to put right an injustice <e> <s> this was in my view typical of the noble lord whom i had the privilege of knowing when he was in another <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up just two of the points which have been made <e> <s> first it seems to me that rural doctors should receive as was suggested by my noble friend such information as the government have <e> <s> secondly may i support the point made by the noble lord lord walston that there should be some research into this matter <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness said that they would look at the possibility of research <e> <s> i wonder whether some research on this subject could be initiated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement made by her right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> of course we must be thankful for small mercies in terms of grants this summer and in terms of the additional increase in the grant goes a long way over a year i have to admit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her helpful reply <e> <s> i shall not ask her for any more factual information <e> <s> there was one point that i wanted to ask and i put it in my first intervention <e> <s> i do not understand perhaps it can be explained to me why the secretary of state for social services and the secretary of state for education and science decided to have their review after the secretary of state for social services reached his conclusions in january rather than having the review before <e> <s> it seems a most peculiar way to come to policy decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i once again thank the noble baroness for repeating the second statement made by her right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> does she accept that this statement is another step in an extraordinarily sad story of government incompetence <e> <s> the fact that ordinary board and lodging payments rose after not to million as had been estimated but to over million an increase of per cent <e> <s> in just one year while the number of boarders increased from to seems to me to be a sign of ineptitude even by the standards of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also say that i did not comment unfavourably <e> <s> i said that i wanted to study the figures very carefully before i made comments <e>", "<cs> i totally support the new clause and the words used by the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> if on second reading the noble baroness had been able to give some idea of when the governments major legislation will come forward i would have been reluctant to be associated with an amendment to strengthen the bill <e> <s> however she has not given any idea and it may be two or three years before we have any child care legislation covering a wide range of issues <e> <s> this particular issue is felt very strongly by parents and indeed by most who have looked into it <e>", "<cs> i had not previously heard the date on which the white paper will be published <e> <s> i very much welcome the statement that the secretary of state will be publishing it in the autumn <e> <s> that will enable many organisations that have concerns about various aspects of child care to be consulted and if they wish they will in advance be able to put forward proposals to the secretary of state though i know that he has a whole pile already on his desk <e> <s> i entirely agree that it would be unwise to press an amendment short of those which are proposed by the noble baroness lady lane-fox but i want to welcome the statement made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness lady lane-fox replies i must admit that i had supposed that the noble baroness lady trumpington was going to say yes to her noble friend <e> <s> i suspected that the amendments might not have been tabled unless the noble baroness lady lane-fox expected to get a more positive response <e> <s> i wish therefore to say that i support the amendments very fully <e> <s> i know that they will not go through <e>", "<cs> a direct question was put to me <e> <s> i believe that an illegitimate child is at a very considerable disadvantage in most cases by not having a father able to act in any of the normal ways in which a father can act <e> <s> that is not always so but it is very often so <e> <s> therefore i would not object to seeing a grandparent playing a father substitute role which is one of the reasons why i warmly supported the amendment <e>", "<cs> first i must thank the noble baroness for her courtesy because i shall want to move certain amendments later on <e> <s> however i wish to welcome most warmly the initiative in the tabling of this amendment both by the noble baroness lady trumpington and the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to those officials not only within the department but also of the voluntary organisations who have taken a very active interest in the matter <e> <s> as i am in a sense speaking as the chairman of mind which has a very close interest in this matter and whose clients stand to gain greatly from what has been done in clause i i should like to mention william bingley john healey and peter mitchell of mind and radar who have played very important roles and spent many hours producing this great improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> almost any amendment that i draft is technically defective <e> <s> it is an argument which during long years as a minister i always used as a means of arguing against something that i did not like <e> <s> it is always within the ability of the government at the next stage then to bring in an amendment which is technically not defective <e> <s> but the minister did not say that she would do so <e>", "<cs> i simply echo that point though not in relation to the noble baronesss noble kinsman because i do not want to touch upon the relationship between them <e> <s> however i feel that the assumption that the nearest relative is always the right person to represent the interests of the disabled person is fundamentally wrong <e> <s> the choice must be that of the disabled person concerned <e>", "<cs> i did not find the answer given by the noble baroness in the least bit satisfying <e> <s> i do not think that she expected that i would <e> <s> i shall not press any of these amendments to a division <e> <s> the only little bit of hope that i received from her lips was the assurance that she would think about what i said <e> <s> if that thought is reflected in the child care legislation that we discussed earlier tabling the amendments will have been worth while <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to withdraw the congratulations that i gave to officials for their excellent draftsmanship at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> instead of doing that i shall simply withdraw my two amendments <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble baroness may i suggest that on future amendments since all of us have studied the bill with such care she should feel <e>", "<cs> i only rise in order that those who read with fascination the <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that there is now greater recognition within the dhss of the value of natural therapies and a greater acceptance also by patients is it not important that medical students should have some training in these alternative therapies perhaps in the same way as the chinese who practise many of these therapies are also required to study western medicine <e> <s> is it not important that doctors being trained for the future should have some knowledge of these forms of treatment that are increasingly popular and accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a matter which should be carefully examined by the government <e> <s> there is widespread and growing interest in it and obviously these two questions are linked <e> <s> bearing in mind that qualified doctors gps do not have to pay vat but qualified practitioners of complementary medicine do is there not some injustice in this <e> <s> will the government now decide that the time has come to look again at this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that really does not answer the question <e> <s> my question implied that the government have some responsibility here it is not just the professions supplementary to medicine <e> <s> i asked the noble lord and i ask him again to draw <e>", "<cs> i should like to give total support to the amendment that has been proposed <e> <s> i-think that the government when they introduced the bill probably had not reckoned that there would be this as the noble lord lord henderson has said small number of severely disabled people disabled in one way or the other mentally handicapped mentally ill physically handicapped who would be worse off <e> <s> in fact it was said during the course of our second reading debate that the bill would in general be greatly to the advantage of disabled people <e> <s> i am not going to argue that at the moment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the noble lord intervened <e> <s> that is quite right <e> <s> if one listed the number of organisations dealing with particular disabilities one would find an enormous spectrum of organisations who are absolutely united on this matter <e> <s> it would be very sad if the government did not recognise that for this small group of disabled people they should accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask one more question before the noble baroness sits down <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull asked whether there had been consultation with local authorities <e> <s> may i ask whether there has been consultation with the charitable organisations on whom many of these people would have to fall back <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness challenged me to respond and it was right that she should do so <e> <s> i think that she sometimes has to do battle with the treasury <e> <s> that applied to the labour government <e> <s> when the allowance was introduced we should very much have liked to introduce it for all but that was not possible <e> <s> at least we introduced it for some people and therefore we created a precedent whereby we have been able to have todays happy announcement <e>", "<cs> i want to support this amendment as strongly as i can <e> <s> the noble lord gives a great deal of time to the problems of refugees and has a great understanding of them <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness this question before she sits down <e> <s> i am most grateful to her for the concession that she has made <e> <s> it is a very important one <e> <s> it will presumably therefore be recorded only in her own words in this chamber and in no way in the legislation <e> <s> is there not some way in which by regulation it could become quite clear so that the people concerned and especially the organisations who work on their behalf can know <e> <s> a bus might run over the noble baroness heaven forbid but one never knows <e> <s> may be the bus would stop if it hit the noble baroness i do not know <e> <s> but it would be very nice to have something even more than the strong and cheerful words of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i were to say a few words about amendment b which is part of the group <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say just a few words in support of my noble friend lady fisher <e> <s> the noble baroness said that she would take very seriously the arguments i was going to put forward in regard to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i should not like her to spend her time fruitlessly and so i shall write to her and set out the very powerful arguments <e> <s> i accept her word that she will look at this very carefully <e> <s> but the argument that amendment no <e> <s> removes the need for what is sought here is one that i certainly do not accept <e>", "<cs> i am sure that no one will object to the dhss or any other department taking appropriate action against fraud or against suspected fraud <e> <s> this was done when i was secretary of state myself <e> <s> what i find objectionable are some assumptions of guilt concerning groups in particular areas <e> <s> it is to that that i object <e> <s> the noble lord has given me an assurance that it will not be done <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not an increase among children at school <e> <s> is it not quite clear that advertising whether it be on posters or in publications or televison sponsorship of sports is the most effective way of drawing cigarettes to the attention of children <e> <s> is it not clear that unless something is done about that in an agreement the purposes that the noble baroness stated cannot be achieved <e> <s> can we be assured that the bill now before the house directed particularly <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking on this third reading i am speaking only for myself and not for the massed ranks of my colleagues behind me <e> <s> i have several times in the consideration of this bill thanked the noble earl lord halsbury for introducing this bill because it has given us the opportunity to discuss issues of very great importance <e> <s> but i have also expressed grave personal reservations about passing this bill into law <e> <s> i must admit that i should have fought harder against this bill if i had thought that it had any chance of becoming part of the law of the land <e> <s> i think it is unlikely that that will be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord give way for a moment <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> he is describing a very grim situation and of course this house and parliament have already abolished agencies and thank heavens they have <e> <s> i wonder what the noble and learned lords comment is on these two sentences from page of the warnock report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also say a word of thanks to the noble baroness <e> <s> though she did not say so i suspect that this amendment must have resulted from consultation that took place following four <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down what advantage is there if as the new system proposes officials act as reviewers and the claims are turned down <e> <s> claimants will only go to such a review if they have been turned down by another official <e> <s> what conceivable advantage can there be for them <e>", "<cs> not at all <e> <s> he is merely another official <e> <s> there is no independent appeal <e> <s> there is a great deal of difference between another official who is obviously operating under some sort of guidelines from the secretary of state and looking at what one official has done and an independent tribunal <e> <s> over many years indepedent tribunals have proved their independence by the judgments that they have made <e>", "<cs> i support absolutely everything that has been said by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> in my view most people hate to be in debt and that applies especially to elderly people who are not even prepared to get into debt as they call it by hire purchase <e> <s> they believe in being paid-up at the end of the week <e> <s> there are very many people who suffer hardship <e> <s> again i am thinking particularly of the elderly because most of those who will be receiving loans or grants will be elderly <e> <s> such people will find it unacceptable to be in debt at the end of the week because that was not the way in which they were brought up <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether before the noble baroness replies i may make three points clear <e> <s> first i entirely agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that there are circumstances in which loans are appropriate <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble baroness lady macleod that some people may actually opt for a loan as opposed to a payment <e> <s> i find that totally acceptable <e> <s> i would not agree for one moment that those coming out of a psychiatric hospital would want loans and i say this as chairman of mind because the chances of their getting a job in the next few months or even in the next few years are not too great and even accommodation could be a great problem for them <e> <s> so i would put them down as people who if they were to inherit a loan on coming out of a psychiatric hospital would be adding another burden to the burdens they already bear <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter asked what the word normally means <e> <s> he will know that we are debating with this amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that amendment reads <e>", "<cs> it is exactly the opposite if i may say so <e>", "<cs> the purpose is to say to the secretary of state what parliament thinks he should do <e> <s> if this amendment were carried parliament would be saying that we think the secretary of state should say that normally it should be grants as opposed to loans <e> <s> that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do <e>", "<cs> i want to be very brief in supporting both the amendments the one that is proposed and the one that has been spoken to <e> <s> i have added my name to both amendments <e> <s> the group of persons upon which i should like to touch is a group that has been mentioned earlier in particular by the noble baroness lady macleod namely those who have been discharged from psychiatric hospitals having in many cases been there for a long time and who are either moving into group homes or into some other form of community accommodation <e> <s> certainly they will come out of hospital without furniture or household effects and in some cases there may be need for essential household repairs <e>", "<cs> as chairman of the ockenden venture which has been responsible for the resettlement of half the quota of vietnamese refugees settled here i happen to be deeply involved <e>", "<cs> very successfully yes but not in terms of employment <e> <s> that was the point that i was going to make to the noble lord <e> <s> they arrive here without linguistic abilities and often with skills which are not immediately needed and they may often need retraining <e> <s> for many employment possibilities in their first two years or so are slight <e> <s> otherwise i agree absolutely with everything that the noble lord said <e> <s> he recognised that there were certain circumstances when loans would be appropriate and other circumstances when grants would be appropriate <e> <s> if the noble baroness agreed about that i should be happy <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i ask one or two questions as to how this will operate <e> <s> first can she tell me since this is clearly a demand-led service what is the difference between this and the family practitioner service <e> <s> would it not be inconceivable for a doctor to say to someone i am very sorry we have finished <e> <s> i have done my ration for the month or the week or the quarter or whatever it was <e> <s> because it is a demand-led service it is the only part of the health service that is not cash limited <e> <s> cash limits apply to all the rest <e>", "<cs> it will be for the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth to decide whether or not to press her amendment to a vote <e> <s> however i was very disappointed in the reply of the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> certainly in my day and i am certain that it applies now the question of confidentiality was taken very seriously by the department <e> <s> i point out to the noble baroness lady macleod that in my view and the facts may prove me wrong a computer is a safer measure of keeping information secret than a collection of papers in a file <e> <s> i think effectively-run computers with people not having natural access to them are a much safer measure <e>", "<cs> i want to support strongly the amendment moved by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> after all the social security advisory committee is an extremely responsible body <e> <s> it is appointed by the government <e> <s> therefore it is a body in which the government have confidence <e> <s> it seems to me that in a new venture such as has been outlined the social fund it is vital that there should be some responsible body able to advise the government on the progress it has made <e> <s> the noble baroness said in an earlier debate that there were issues on which lessons would have to be learned <e> <s> we were talking then about cash limiting <e> <s> she was saying if it does not work we will have to change it <e> <s> the we refers to the government <e> <s> it seems to me as it does to the noble lord lord banks that someone other than the government will advise the government on what should be done <e> <s> it is not the case that some other body can do this <e> <s> i remarked earlier that the traditional charities would give their advice but that they cannot give any assistance <e> <s> so far as i can see none was consulted on how the social fund would affect its work for hardship cases <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i see whether i understand what she is saying <e> <s> as i understand it she is saying that the government have great confidence in the social security advisory committee and that the social security advisory committee would be perfectly free to study the operation of the social fund and to report to the government and publicly on its impressions <e> <s> if i have interpreted the speech of the noble baroness aright that seems to me a considerable advance <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> indeed i touched upon this matter in relation to an earlier amendment <e> <s> i was perhaps out of order in doing so but one occasionally strays from the terms of amendments if one feels very strongly about something <e>", "<cs> and how would he find out <e>", "<cs> in view of the representations that have been made including by the leader of the liberal party in this house would the noble baroness not agree to at least take it away and think again about <e>", "<cs> that really is no reply to a question that absolutely strikes at the heart of the whole of this new social fund <e> <s> in earlier debates we have said it is quite wrong that the social fund should be cash limited <e> <s> if you cash limit a social fund you are saying that regardless of the personal need of any applicant during a particular year unless there is some supple-mentary estimate and there rarely is the social fund officer is going to have to take note of the amount of money that is available <e> <s> in other words he must take note not of the need of the person involved but of the amount of money that is available <e>", "<cs> i did not quite understand what the noble baroness was really saying <e> <s> she was trying to reassure me and was saying that i was making a fuss about nothing <e> <s> was she saying that if there is a claim which has to be dealt with at a particular time by a social fund officer and if that officer is running short of money he will by some means be able to get some extra money from the government <e> <s> if that is so it is interesting news but it is not cash limiting it <e> <s> the noble baroness knows as well as i do that cash limiting means imposing upon an authority a limitation above which it is not allowed to go <e> <s> that is how the health service operates <e> <s> when the noble baroness made her comparison with the health service she put her foot in it absolutely because there it means waiting lists or ward closures <e> <s> in this case it means refusals <e> <s> however if she is now saying that that is not really so and that steps will be taken by the government to ensure that the money will be available then i should be absolutely delighted <e> <s> if she would simply say to the committee that the government will think again about this in the light of earlier decisions we should all be happy <e>", "<cs> in which case how can it be said to be cash limited if the noble baroness says we are not going to run out of money <e> <s> she cannot have it both ways <e>", "<cs> i want strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> in my view the introduction of child benefit was one of the most important measures that was taken by the last labour government <e> <s> it was a measure that had the full backing of the other political parties and i believe of all the organisations working in the field <e> <s> however it was never the view of the labour government at that time that the level of child benefit achieved at its point of introduction represented the ultimate target <e> <s> it is therefore rather depressing that seven years later the real value of child benefit is actually slightly lower than in as a result of the cut that was made in <e> <s> it is also depressing that we have no guarantee or commitment <e>", "<cs> i heard the chief whips long intervention on the subject <e> <s> i just want to say that we have not had three days on this bill <e> <s> the first day of debate on the social security bill began at half-past six in the evening <e> <s> on the second day of debate on this bill two hours were taken up by the dinner break <e> <s> today nearly two hours were taken up by the dinner break <e> <s> so it is not correct to say that there have been three full days on this bill <e> <s> i submit to the chief whip and to the committee that it is in fact the management of the business that is at fault in not ensuring that a bill of this importance <e>", "<cs> of course i will give way <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for saying that together with her right honourable friend she will look at this <e> <s> i should like in that consultation to be able to submit some information that might be helpful not that the secretary of state is not able to decide for himself <e> <s> but i am most grateful to the noble baroness for the concession that she has made and in those circumstances i most willingly beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> for my part i greatly welcome the announcement and statement and the amendment that has been proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to do no more than be associated with the congratulations to both the noble baroness lady masham and the original sponsor of the bill in another place mr tom clarke <e> <s> it is very rarely that a bill such as this which appears in the end to be of such importance is actually presented by a private members bill and it owes a lot both to the government and to the voluntary organisations which entered into very serious discussion and negotiation with them <e> <s> to them also i want to offer congratulations and thanks <e>", "<cs> my lords while i warmly agree with the statement just made by the minister may i press him on the question of the timescale regarding this new unit <e> <s> since the decision was announced to the house several months ago is it not appropriate that some timescale should be established <e> <s> i should also like to ask about consultation in respect of the new unit <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that mind of which i am chairman has been extremely involved in this operation for a long time <e> <s> it has not been consulted at all about the new unit <e> <s> should there not be widespread consultation <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and accepting that this also is a tax issue since the noble lord has himself said that there is an entitlement to pay additional contributions then why does he not agree that it should be in the bill <e> <s> is it not a good thing that people should follow such a course and if it is a good thing then is it not a good thing also to put such a provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords having been involved with the establishment of the act from its earliest stages perhaps i may say a very brief word on this matter <e> <s> the best years rule was perhaps one of the most important elements within the bill that eventually became an act <e> <s> another important element was the provision which ensured that the scheme would reach maturity in years time <e> <s> we consciously put this provision into the act so that those people who were already disadvantaged would not be disadvan-taged in their retirement years <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the minister said that the majority of people are unemployed for only a short time <e> <s> a significant number may be out of work for a few months only and then go back into another job <e> <s> but my noble friend said that in april there were unemployed people of all ages many of them were middle-aged and will never have work again <e> <s> when the calculation comes to be made they will inevitably find that their pension is lower because they have the disadvantage of being unemployed <e> <s> how has the minister applied his mind to that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he was surprised that this matter had not been raised before <e> <s> he may also be surprised to learn that i wish to support him as regards everything he said except his final conclusion <e> <s> i wish to support him very strongly on the concept that we should not be moving towards a single inflexible pension age <e> <s> i say that as someone who was a member of the house of commons select committee in another place at the time when it was drawing up its proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say how delighted i am with the speeches made by the noble baronesses lady vickers and lady faithfull and also by other speakers who have recalled the history of child benefit <e> <s> before the minister replies i think it would be wise if we went back because with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord thorneycroft he has forgotten part of what happened when he was chancellor of the exchequer and who can blame him <e> <s> he has also forgotten some of the things that happened when he was chairman of the conservative party and again who would blame him for wishing to do that <e> <s> so anything i say to the noble lord will be said with great appreciation of his kindness <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that i have never really understood why the government have introduced this measure <e> <s> during all the years that i recall since the welfare state was created we have never sought to draw a distinction between the financial responsibilities of those who are aged and those who are aged <e> <s> i can well understand it if the government came forward with a measure which sought to make provision for those who were living at home so that they could say that within a home situation parents would be able to look after a young lad or a young girl but eventually they would move on and become adults <e> <s> in this clause the government are trying to draw a distinction between different groups of adults <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the leader of the house to say a few points in regard to my intervention before the noble lord lord banks winds up the debate <e> <s> a number of important points were made concerning refugees which the noble baroness did not touch upon <e> <s> i am involved with the british refugee council and to my knowledge one-third of the young unmarried adults who seek its advice are under the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords if i ask the leave of the house and it appears that the house does not wish to give me leave i am the servant of the house <e> <s> if the view of the noble baroness is shared by the house i make no further comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the amendment which has been tabled by the noble baroness lady faithfull and to say that i agree with the arguments which she has put forward <e> <s> we are talking about something which is not expensive in fact it will probably not cost any more than the present measures contained in the bill <e> <s> however it will lead to rapid decisions which i think is what the noble baroness has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her a question <e> <s> obviously it is important and she would agree that those who have to take decisions about this sort of payment in offices up and down the country would want to have some common pattern <e> <s> how will she be able to ensure that common pattern if the nature of the cases is not prescribed as suggested by her noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add a word <e> <s> i know that at some stage in this bill and possibly in a previous bill i made a criticism of the way in which the noble baroness said no to everything however convincing the arguments seemed to those who presented them <e> <s> i remember saying to her that the purpose of a committee stage here or in another place was to get the best possible result and therefore to give way if the case presented to the government was a convincing one <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief in supporting the noble baroness <e> <s> i think the problem of definition between a volunteer on the one hand and a volunteer who gets a small honorarium for the work he or she does on the other is a very difficult one <e> <s> as i have had the privilege of seeing there is a very substantial growth across the country of schemes sometimes based on a volunteer plus a driver and sometimes based on a volunteer plus a home helper not a home help for those who are disabled and elderly <e> <s> i think it is difficult to say just what the difference is between a volunteer and a volunteer who might actually be making a very small sum of money because he or she probably lives on a low or modest income <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble baroness has hit on a very reasonable way of dealing with this particular problem <e> <s> i shall be very interested to hear the ministers answer because clearly an answer has to be found and if the minister has that answer i shall leap up and say thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i want warmly to support this very important amendment <e> <s> i certainly do not want to repeat the issues that we covered when we debated this at committee stage <e> <s> we had a jolly little exchange between the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the right reverend prelate the bishop of southward about what normally means <e> <s> in a sense the purpose of this amendment is to see that we do not have any argument about what is normal because there would be listed items <e> <s> but i must say that i have absolute horror about forcing people into debt <e> <s> i argued the point on the last occasion and i shall not develop it again this time that there are many people for whom debt is misery and debt sometimes leads to suicide <e> <s> i very much agreed with the point made by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton that we are often dealing with those who are inadequates <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks made the point that we had a fairly full debate on this matter in committee <e> <s> the amendment is designed to meet the problems that were raised in committee <e> <s> i am unhappy with the principle of an officer saying well it may be that someone else could pay this maybe an aunty could pay it maybe we could find a relative to pay it or maybe someone will be leaving a legacy or something <e> <s> the officer could say maybe some charity will pay <e> <s> has he gone to the british legion or to ssafa <e> <s> all sorts of different things may be suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i counted in the noble baronesss reply how many times she used the word reasonably in relation to how judgment would be made <e> <s> she used the word times <e> <s> that seems absolutely to support the case for the amendment <e> <s> the possibility is not enough <e> <s> it is a matter of being reasonable about it surely <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for the statement that she has just made <e> <s> she has made a statement of profound importance that i personally enormously welcome <e> <s> although there has been no opportunity for discussion i suggest that most noble lords on this side of the house will also welcome it <e> <s> the noble baroness said that there will be no formal cash limit in the early stage <e> <s> i do not know at what stage the noble baroness might change her mind or at what stage her mind might be changed for her but that is an extremely important statement <e>", "<cs> my lords in the same way that from these benches we never hesitate to criticise the government for all their failures i think it is right proper and courteous that we should pay due respect to the government for the decision that was announced by the noble baroness and for the amendment which she has placed in the bill <e> <s> from this front bench i want to thank her and the government for the steps they have taken and to add to the point made by my noble friend lady lockwood about publicity <e> <s> i think it important that maximum <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord pitt has rendered the house a significant service by bringing this matter to our attention <e> <s> i feel very guilty in that when originally reading through the bill i did not realise the implications of clause <e> <s> until my noble friend put down the amendment here i make my own confession i did not realise what a miserable and wretched piece of work the government are doing <e> <s> i wonder whether those on the other side have recognised before now just what the bill does to a significant group of people <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says that people will be affected and that there will be a saving of million <e> <s> is it really worth it to inflict that hardship on people <e>", "<cs> my lords i added my name to this amendment largely because i wanted to know what the noble baroness would say <e> <s> it was not my intention that this should be an amendment on which there should be a vote <e> <s> however i think we have to recognise as the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> has said that in our society a vast proportion of our elderly population an increasing proportion of the mentally ill the handicapped and the mentally handicapped are now living at home <e> <s> they are cared for at home by a variety of different people who do not necessarily come under the invalid care allowance and some of the people who are being cared for are not necessarily invalids <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any way in which we can reduce this very considerable increase in the importation of these products which are damaging to the nations health <e> <s> also can the noble baroness say whether imported cigarettes have on average a higher tar content than those manufactured in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assure the noble baroness that this side of the house has always been when it was on that side of the house also as opposed to abuse as that side of the house has ever been <e>", "<cs> my lords today <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the question prompted by a rather scaremongering article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am able to support fully the speech made by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton and if i may say so to congratulate him upon the role which he played when this house originally passed this amendment and his role today <e> <s> i cannot fail to express my deep regret that in an extremely brief guillotine debate in another place last night the secretary of state and the government cancelled out an amendment which had been very carefully worked out in this house in conjunction with not only peers on all sides of this house but also organisations of disabled people <e> <s> the proposal had been presented to this house in a non-party amendment which was carried by a very substantial majority <e> <s> the minister in fact took that action the day after his own social security advisory committee had strongly criticised the extent of the governments succession of measures to cut benefits for the poorest in our society <e> <s> i should like briefly to quote what was said by the social security advisory committee <e> <s> the committee warned that ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton for that intervention before i sat down <e> <s> perhaps i may draw his attention to the conclusions of the royal association for disability and rehabilitation <e> <s> i said that they do not believe that there are people in receipt of high rate attendance allowance who are living on their own <e> <s> this is in fact the centre of the point being taken <e> <s> unless there is some flexibility it is likely as stated by those who are far more expert than i or most people in your lordships house that the figures that have been given will not be accepted by the most responsible organisation which i believe exists in this country to represent the interests of disabled people <e> <s> the number may be or no one knows <e> <s> that is why flexibility is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble baroness for her very clear explanation of the bill and say to her that i shall read very carefully what she had to say in her concluding remarks about the new clause concerned with the bill on disabled persons so that i may fully comprehend what is to be done <e>", "<cs> proprietors my lords <e>", "<cs> and to me my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the consultative document to which he referred has led to a considerable degree of concern in the mental health movement particularly the thought and what lies behind it that we may be amending the mental health act in a criminal justice bill <e> <s> may i ask the noble earl two questions <e> <s> first what research preceded this consultative document and secondly is it not possible that proposals made in the document could lead to an increase in the prison population when the prisons are already bursting at the seams <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i am surprised to hear her say that she is satisfied that there will be sufficient consultant radiologists in the years ahead as the population steadily ages and the demands upon rheumatology services steadily increase <e> <s> as she did not answer the question put by the noble baroness lady masham about the number of districts which did not have a rheumatologist does the minister accept from me that there are substantial parts of the country where there are no rheumatologists available to provide a service for elderly people <e> <s> to say that the service can be provided by other means means that one is taking a consultant away from a task that he is already perfoming <e> <s> will the minister answer the question about what the government are doing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having asked that question <e> <s> as i understand it it in no way makes a judgment on actions carried out by medical staff or by nursing staff in carrying out their duties <e> <s> clinical judgment and the way in which a nurse fulfils a clinical judgment is not affected by that act as i understand it nor would i wish to move that it should be so <e> <s> i think the health service would suffer if those who are fulfilling their tasks within the health service were to have their freedom of action based on clinical judgment in any way affected by legislation <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord before he sits down whether he is suggesting that he does not want the immunity removed at all from kitchens and catering departments <e> <s> is that the purport of his remarks <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will permit me i shall touch upon one or two of the points made by other noble lords before turning to the helpful comments that she made <e> <s> i took note of what the noble and learned lord lord denning said <e> <s> he said that this is not the time to deal with crown immunity in anything but the kitchens <e> <s> i do not understand that <e> <s> i have to ask him as i would ask the government whether he is proposing to bring forward a bill at another stage or whether he expects the government to bring forward a bill at another stage <e> <s> what does he conceive as the right time to deal with this problem <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for that intervention and i welcome the assurance <e> <s> but if she and the secretary of state for social services had felt that there was no advantage in the law being able to intervene they would not have taken the action that they have in relation to kitchens <e> <s> they would have said that notices have been issued and action is being taken <e> <s> but they have deemed it advisable in the case of kitchens that the law should stand behind any circular crown immunity notice or what have you <e> <s> i am delighted to hear what success there has been in kitchens and i am sure that the very fact that the bill has been announced before it has become law has had its effect on the cleanliness of kitchens and the dangers that we all face <e> <s> but it will not have this effect so far as the rest of the hospital is concerned unless we carry an amendment either the one that i am proposing or one slightly different if the noble baroness has any different words to suggest <e> <s> the fact that hospitals are complying so effectively means that it is unlikely there will be many prosecutions and if it is unlikely that there will be many prosecutions why is she worried <e> <s> the same applies to dealing with a dirty situation in one part of the hospital as it does to dealing with a dirty situation in the kitchens <e>", "<cs> i have only a few sentences to add at what i presume will be the end of this helpful debate <e> <s> first i deal with legislation <e> <s> the noble baroness said that this was not the proper time to legislate and she does not want piecemeal legislation <e> <s> but this is the proper time because if we do not do so now it will be piecemeal legislation <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that this is exactly the tiime to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will recall that i asked a question during the second reading debate and she kindly gave me an answer which i received last night and for which i am most grateful <e> <s> in that answer she said that she did not believe that there were too many pharmacists <e> <s> so the noble baroness is not using that argument is she <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter chided my noble friend lord ross and the noble lord lord harris of high cross for not speaking to the amendment <e> <s> i must chide the noble lord because his remarks did not apply to the amendment <e> <s> i want to explain since most of the debate has not been on the amendment that i proposed <e> <s> it is as if i had proposed that the contract should not go through and that there should be no regulatory system <e> <s> of course i was tempted to do that <e> <s> i was pressed by many to do it <e> <s> i restrained myself however from doing what i was pressed to do <e> <s> i thought that it was right and proper that the agreement of another place to this would make it difficult and that it would be wrong for us as non-elected legislators to decide simply to say no to a contract <e>", "<cs> my lords i have done this before have i not <e> <s> i have upgraded the noble baroness on a previous occasion <e> <s> that is only because the noble baroness normally impresses me so much <e> <s> that was not the case in her contribution to this debate <e> <s> if the noble baroness lady carnegy examines my amendment no <e> <s> which we shall reach later she will see that i am concerned as was the nuffield report about the quality of pharmacists <e> <s> i propose in that amendment that we should have a good practice allowance rather than the basic practice allowance <e> <s> no one could conceivably say that this is to the advantage of chains <e> <s> it is to the advantage of the small pharmacist who can give an invaluable service to customers and patients whom he or she knows <e>", "<cs> the proposal is that the application shall be granted if the committee is satisfied <e>", "<cs> i must say in answer to the noble lord although i had sat down that although we are reaching the end of the session this does not in any way lessen the responsibility upon your lordships to do what we think right and to improve legislation that has often not been properly and effectively considered in another place <e> <s> this is what i have sought to do <e> <s> i do not apologise for one moment <e>", "<cs> i have only a few sentences to add if i may <e> <s> i cannot understand why the noble baroness said that it would not be possible to have guidelines as to what should be the criteria <e> <s> there is nothing here that says there cannot be criteria <e> <s> the regulations will still have to be drafted and come before this house and the other house so that argument cannot possibly be right <e> <s> i feel that this amendment is too restrictive and too damaging to the normal recognised interests particularly of the small pharmacist and of the pharmacy which wishes to become established in an area where the noble baroness accepts that there is a shortage <e> <s> that is the reason that i feel it is necessary to put this to the vote <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble baronesss pardon <e> <s> i recognise that the other amendments within the group have not been either voted upon or further debated <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i have already moved both amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> was purely a paving amendment for no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> has not been passed <e> <s> therefore i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> yes i am so sorry that i did not mention it <e> <s> i am dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> it appears no other member of the committee wishes to speak <e> <s> i must say i am very disappointed <e> <s> i find the reply most unconvincing <e> <s> having worked on a local paper i know what the cost is of putting a small advertisement into a paper saying that an application has been received by a pharmacist to establish a pharmacy in a particular estate where there may be no other pharmacy <e> <s> not only does it not cost much to put an advertisement in but there is a news story there as well <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what has been said by the noble lord lord rugby in moving this amendment <e> <s> i also welcome the assurance given by the noble baroness that if things take too long she will reconsider it <e> <s> i wish she had accepted it as it was <e> <s> as she hinted the draft regulations will stipulate the precise limits of the period in which an appeal may be lodged <e> <s> if that can be done i should have thought that a time limit could be given for the application <e> <s> however the noble baroness has said that if things go wrong she will look at it again and i think it would be discourteous of me not to accept that <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord rugby will accept it too <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for the comments she has made and for some recognition of what lies behind the nuffield report <e> <s> i do not take credit for that <e> <s> i am giving credit to the nuffield committee for wishing to do something like this <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness like me to say something before she replies <e> <s> i am coming to her aid <e> <s> she was referring to what this bill did and to this small licensing system <e> <s> but on pages and of the bill it goes into considerable detail about what the regulations shall include <e> <s> it goes through heads <e>", "<cs> i am grateful not only to noble lords from all parts of the committee for their support for this amendment but also to the noble baroness for agreeing to take it away and think about it again <e> <s> we shall look very carefully at her reply when we come to report stage <e> <s> i agree with other noble lords that this amendment raises absolutely crucial principles <e> <s> the noble baroness must recognise that otherwise she would not take it away <e> <s> with those thanks i beg leave at this stage to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find most of what the minister has said very encouraging and reassuring <e> <s> there is just one little worry and it was on a previous amendment that the noble baroness has taken back for consideration concerning the composition of the committee which will decide on the contracts <e> <s> if we come back with an entirely different set of seven members or five or or whatever number the committee consists of and if none of them is a contractor it may very well be that the psnc will be in no position to impose its will upon those whom it does not represent <e> <s> since the noble baroness has undertaken to look at the composition of the committee will she look again at this issue which is a related one because assurances given in good faith by the psnc might not be able to be carried out if the composition of the committee is substantially different as i proposed in the amendment that the noble baroness was kind enough to agree to consider <e>", "<cs> i shall not press the matter at this stage <e> <s> it is a matter to which one can return at report stage so i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the concept that the list should include representatives from the community health councils in the same way that with regard to amendments nos <e> <s> and it was proposed that community health councils should appoint one of the representatives at local level <e> <s> it is a good idea to have a representative at local level and on appeal <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness possesses a great deal of information which no other member of the committee has unless someone has leaked it <e> <s> how could any of us know that a decision had been taken on the role of community health councils which i warmly welcome <e> <s> it is difficult for members of the committee to table amendments in relation to the initial committee and the appeal committee when we do not have the documentation <e> <s> can it be published <e>", "<cs> we do not have the guidance <e> <s> if the guidance could be made available to those of us who are taking part we might be better informed and might not table amendments that have already been dealt with <e> <s> will the noble baroness circulate the guidance before report <e>", "<cs> how are we to know <e>", "<cs> no information has been given to us that there is a copy in the library <e> <s> we could go to the library during the recess and ask whether there happens to be a copy of the guidance but would it not be easier if there are guidelines for them to be made available to members of the committee who are obviously extremely interested in this subject <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am not going to press this amendment <e> <s> i think it is best withdrawn at this stage <e> <s> i thought it was a measure of clarification <e> <s> the noble baroness says the position will be made clear in regulations and we shall have the opportunity of considering regulations when they are prepared <e>", "<cs> i should certainly like to hear the ministers explanation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of high cross has returned too <e>", "<cs> i should like to make two or three points <e> <s> first i want to make quite clear that i do not follow the noble lord lord harris of high cross in his attacks on the psnc <e> <s> quite often i disagree with it and when i do so and it is a matter that is before this chamber i table amendments or criticise or what have you <e> <s> but basically i have had and hope to continue to have a good relationship with the psnc and i do not feel the same antagonism as is felt by the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will know that all the professions to which we have referred by name are not satisfied with the present situation and are not satisfied with the provision that is made in clause <e> <s> i shall consider very carefully what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i make no bones about it i shall discuss this and obtain from them their views as to whether what she has said gives them any satisfaction <e> <s> i shall not press either of these two amendments now but reserve to myself the right to do so at report stage if in the light of what she has said there is still a deep sense of grievance which i feel is justified on the part of the professions concerned <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is welcome to do so <e>", "<cs> i am a little puzzled <e> <s> if the system is not being changed as i understand the noble baroness to say by the introduction of clause i do not know why clause has been included at all <e> <s> presumably its purpose must be to change the system <e> <s> i suppose that this was necessary because the government were taken to court and lost their case <e> <s> i should like to put a question though i do not expect an answer now <e> <s> it would perhaps be better if i put it on the order paper <e> <s> i should like to know how many times the government in the shape of the dhss have been taken to court and lost their case <e> <s> it must run into double figures on many issues where the government have been forced to think again <e>", "<cs> since amendment no <e> <s> is being grouped in this debate and the noble baroness replied to it it is not very satisfactory to say that this is not retrospective legislation <e> <s> if there has been retrospection in the past it is now putting legal approval to retrospective legislation <e> <s> i do not think legislation should ever be retrospective <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the case that has been made by the noble lords lord cullen and lord mottistone <e> <s> that is why i did not move my amendment which had a similar purpose <e>", "<cs> i am speaking on behalf of my noble friend lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i should not wish to intervene in scottish affairs but i welcome the fulfilment of a commitment that was made when we were discussing the earlier disablement bill <e> <s> my only difficulty here is that this appeared only very recently and there has been very little opportunity either for consideration in the chamber or for consideration with voluntary organisations that will benefit from extending this bill to apply to scotland <e> <s> i have for instance received today a telephone call from the scottish council for the single homeless who have some concerns about this matter and who will be getting in touch with me <e> <s> through either my channels or those of my noble friend lord ross of marnock we may want to make some suggestions when we come to report stage <e> <s> but the basic concept of the bill is one which we warmly welcome and we may find ourselves <e>", "<cs> i was going to say that in view of the amendment which was passed at the beginning of the debate on clause we shall need to submit an amendment to the long title of the bill which takes account of the change in crown immunity <e> <s> we shall need slightly to adjust it in order that when we come to the report stage we can have before us a correct long title <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the many occasions on which the need for a call and recall system for cervical cancer screening has been raised in the house and in view of the strong pressure from the british medical association and the national association of health authorities what real progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to ask the noble baroness whether she reads the <e>", "<cs> forgive me my lords but if cervical cancer screening is a high priority can the noble baroness give the figures in order to show just what progress has been made <e> <s> that is what i asked for <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first say how much i welcome amendment no <e> <s> a which has been proposed by the noble baroness and beyond that that i think the whole house will appreciate the way in which the government have handled the decision taken at committee stage <e> <s> it was quite clear then that there was strong feeling on all sides and this is how our system works <e> <s> i congratulate the noble baroness and indeed her noble friend the leader of the house on ensuring that this was not a matter passed to the other place and then thrown back and forth at the end of the session <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for supporting me because he has said better than i did what i wanted to say <e> <s> i am not going to press this matter to a vote but i hope that the noble baroness will consider this point because i know there are many pharmacists who feel that the bill in its present form will act against them and against their opportunities as entrepreneurs who wish to develop and use their skills in the community <e> <s> although it is a modest amendment i should like to think that the noble baroness could give at least a little thought to this before we come to the final stage which will be at third reading <e> <s> i have no intention of pressing this to a vote this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the permission of the house tabling the amendment was worth while in order to get the assurance from the noble baroness that there would be no weighting against the applicant for a licence <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that this is an occasion when we do not need to have a long adjournment <e> <s> i do not think this debate will last a very long time and an adjournment of an hour may keep us all up later than need be <e> <s> i suspect that after this amendment the debate will not be a long one and i should like to think that some of us could eat at home instead of here <e> <s> if the noble baroness wishes to press the case i suggest an adjournment of half an hour <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i understand that amendment no <e> <s> a has not yet been called <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i thought he said that he would not move either amendment no <e> <s> or amendment no <e> <s> and that he would contribute to the debate which is about to commence <e> <s> under that supposition the next amendment to be taken is no <e> <s> a <e> <s> maybe the noble lord lord harris can clarify the position <e>", "<cs> my lords as i did at the beginning in moving amendment no <e> <s> a i should again like to thank the noble baroness for the amendment which she has tabled and also now for the explanation that she has given <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord brucegardyne that one could argue one way or the other <e> <s> i think the main point is that the noble baroness has met the concern expressed at committee stage that it would appear and in fact could be the case that people would be protecting their own commercial interests <e> <s> obviously i should like to read again carefully the explanation given by the noble baroness in case there is some need to return for further clarification at a later stage in this bill but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for the sake of the record let me say that i cannot possibly support the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e> <s> i made it clear from the very beginning that on these benches our concern was with the small pharmacist and the community pharmacist <e> <s> the noble baroness is absolutely right <e> <s> i presume that the amendment would mean that tesco or any other large store could set up a little pharmacy in the corner <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be recalled even if only by me that in the debate that we had at committee stage i was involved in the discussion on retrospective payments and expressed some concern about the situation <e> <s> my amendment was taken as one of a group to which i have no objection <e> <s> i was delighted to receive also a copy of these lovely little missives that have been distributed so freely around your lordships house <e> <s> i want to say that i was delighted to receive it and delighted at the news that it gave <e> <s> i think it will be very reassuring to the opticians that they will not be expected to pay for any ups and downs or rather downs or ups i cannot think which it will be beyond the period of st january <e> <s> i welcome the decision taken by the noble baroness <e> <s> i think this is the third occasion on which in this bill she has clearly reacted to the expressed views in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords having been in another place a member of the social services committee which produced the recommendations to the government may i assure the noble baroness that we shall be looking forward anxiously to the proposals that will be made for changes in legislation <e> <s> also will she accept that as other members of your lordships house have said it is a matter of great urgency to get the matter right <e> <s> does she recognise that i agree with her that it may well be that although we are now facing a crisis in terms of numbers and horrors of sexual abuse in many areas things that have been going on unknown for many years are now becoming known <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for the figures that she has given <e> <s> does she recognise that it is an extremely disturbing fact that on average there have been roughly more people on waiting lists during the period of this government than there were during the period of the previous government <e> <s> does she also recognise that the figure of that she gave took into consideration a sharp rise during the period of industrial disputes <e> <s> does she recall that the figure that she gave me from may to may was under a labour government and that from may to september the figure was which is a rise of <e> <s> as the government have been in office so long is it not time that they brought down the figures to below the average or at least to the average during the whole period of the labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i go back to the figures that were given to me by the noble baroness <e> <s> surely it is much more reasonable to compare a whole period of a government <e> <s> under the labour government there were on in-patient waiting lists there are now under a conservative government <e> <s> can the noble baroness say that that is improving the position <e> <s> is not the position very much worse than during the period of the labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her reply but what i should really like to know is what action is being taken <e> <s> does she accept that two operating theatres at st thomass hospital are closed indefinitely because there are no trained staff to assist in operations that st marys hospital in paddington may have to

as if i am using flattery because flattery normally is designed to produce favours to come and i am not expecting any <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the two most important habits which if begun at school age are likely to persist into adulthood and contribute to coronary heart disease are cigarette smoking and a diet leading to overweight <e> <s> in view of the very high levels of coronary heart disease which tragically we have in britain is she really satisfied that enough is being done in schools to discourage smoking and to encourage a balanced diet <e>",

statistics <e> <s> when he asks himself the question can he also try to find out what is the balance between the national health service and the private sector <e> <s> does he agree that inevitably as we see such new developments coming in there has to be a steadily rising income for the national health service to meet them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that certainly from these benches we very much welcome the comprehensive initiative that is now being taken by the government for a disease which i suppose most of us accept is probably the greatest challenge to health in this

certain where they stand <e> <s> can the noble lord assure me that the facilities will be found and that financial restraints will not stand in the way of such screening as is thought to be necessary

visiting this unit at holloway later today in my capacity as chairman of mind and of phoenix house a drug project and intend to discuss this important form of therapy for psychiatric and also drug cases i wonder whether the minister can give some slightly more encouraging words which i might he able to use when discussing the issue at holloway this afternoon <e> <s> i am particularly bearing in

visitors association with its very alarming figure of cities and towns in which there are no health advisers at clinics to assist those who may be sufferers from aids and who are seeking advice <e>

very substantial number of those who arrived in hong kong and are now behind barbed wire have very close relatives in britain whom they wish to join <e> <s> can the british government be slightly more generous in promoting family reunions than they have been so far <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many people have so far received the statutory allowance <e> <s> bearing in mind the two

amusing episode i must say <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that in their continuing educational campaign which i very much commend the government will reflect on two points first that some genuine warm human relations are endangered by unjustified fears and secondly that at the other extreme there are still some irresponsible youngsters who say that they just do not give a damn <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has given some new and disturbing figures <e> <s> can she now explain the serious discrepancy that has occurred in <e>", "<cs> my lords so the noble baroness accepts that

what the noble lord lord winstanley said except the part where i stated my disagreement i find myself much opposed to the general approach of the noble lord lord colwyn in the sense that it seemed to

"<cs> does the noble baroness know if she does not i do not wish to embarrass her whether the new vaccine is a single cell vaccine or an acellular vaccine <e>", "<cs> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is she aware that almost years ago i was involved in the appointment of the noble baroness lady birk as the first chairman of the independent health education council which was free to comment on government policy concerning health education <e> <s> can the minister say why this independence is now being destroyed and the health education council replaced by a body which is directly accountable to the secretary of state <e> <s> why did the government intervene if they did intervene on thursday to stop the publication of a major report by sir douglas black who is one of our most distinguished physicians <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree that this interference is quite intolerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reassured by something that i understood the minister to have said but did she actually mean that the new authority will be independent

of world excellence and that the uncertainty ought to be removed as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while i welcome the ministers initiative the fact that this issue has now been with the minister for more than months does not imply the sense of urgency that i think is required <e> <s> does she agree that this situation is very disturbing and will she bring the exchanges in this house to the attention of the minister responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords while of course accepting the ministers words that no minister was involved in this does she accept that the decision that there should not be a press conference concerning the document was taken by sir brian bailey appointed by the minister <e> <s> he said that the report would be electoral dynamite <e> <s> if the noble baroness has read the report she will be aware that it shows that the gap between rich and poor not only in terms of money but of health has substantially increased in the last few years

may ask her whether the community health council has taken a position on this and has supported it and if it has not done so whether this is a decision that has been taken by the secretary of state to close the existing service <e>", "<cs> my lords if the hospital building programme is doing as jolly well as the minister says it is why is the number of beds available to nhs patients now fewer than it was eight years ago <e> <s> why is it that except for two periods of industrial action hospital waiting lists are longer than ever before devastatingly and cruelly long <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can respond concerning what he himself said <e> <s> why does he insist on giving figures for new patients either day patients or in-patients when he does not know such figures but only the number of admissions <e> <s> does he accept that the figures which he keeps giving are simply not based on the facts in any way whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question

have said that i have drawn my amendment too widely <e> <s> there are a number of situations which would be covered by my amendment which i do not think should be covered <e> <s> there are more of

the proposal for a formal inquiry made by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs will he consider making available for debate the draft advice that it is proposed to send to the various authorities and

reported <e> <s> i go back only to th march this year when there was a debate in your <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to follow the delightful speech almost life story of the noble lord lord ferrier and his last words in congratulating the noble lord lord kindersley not only on the quality of his presentation but on the timing of the debate <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement that has been made <e> <s> i very much hope that in answer to this supplementary question the minister will say what the current figures are on the waiting list <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that in march of this year there was a significant increase over the previous year <e> <s> is the minister also aware that there are health authorities across the country which are having to reduce the number of beds available or close wards or close units <e> <s> in the case of one of the london hospitals it is necessary to close theatre units for one week in five <e> <s> is not the noble earl aware that this is a growing problem across the country and is he satisfied that the announcement which the minister has made is going to bring the long waiting lists steadily down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving that assurance <e> <s> is the noble earl aware of the outstanding record of westminster hospital as a centre of excellence being efficient economic and caring <e> <s> is he aware that over the past years to my knowledge there have been repeated proposals for the closure of this great hospital which successive secretaries of state have refused <e> <s> does he understand the very serious problem of morale in the hospital when it is constantly being suggested that its future is uncertain <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that the most recent figures given last week by his noble friend concerning waiting lists are the highest in the history of the national health service except for periods of industrial action <e> <s> can he say how many beds are now closed purely because of financial shortages <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not ask about the number of patients treated or the reduction in the number of beds <e> <s> i asked about waiting lists <e> <s> can the minister answer my two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there is growing concern particularly among nurses who are usually the people who see patients first at the growing level of assault <e> <s> does he accept that any of that is due to long periods of waiting <e> <s> will the new category of nurse practitioners in accident and emergency units be a useful way of deploying scarce nursing staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for reading the statement that was read in another place by the minister for health <e> <s> for once it is a pleasure to give an unqualified welcome to a statement of government policy <e> <s> it is a rapid and positive response to the proposals which came not only from the haemophilia society but from both sides of your lordships house in the debate on tuesday of last week including the speeches made by the noble lord lord campbell of croy and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one brief supplementary remark <e> <s> the minister accepted that the government agreed with one of the negative conclusions of the pearson report but so far as i know they have not agreed with any of its positive proposals <e> <s> i happen to disagree with the one conclusion that the government have accepted <e> <s> i wonder whether the issue which has still not been answered is one to which the government will give further thought <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the noble earl said this very serious problem raised by the noble countess has been solved by digging into the waiting list money what will happen next year <e> <s> will there be another freeze on cardiac patients being treated over a very large area <e> <s> will there be no funds to relieve waiting lists <e> <s> or will the government provide some money to enable the health authorities to do their job <e> <s> will the minister explain the situation so that we ensure that such tragic stories which have been repeated across the country are not heard again next year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why the government feel that they do not have any responsibility to suggest target figures <e> <s> is that not part of their responsibility in providing a national health service <e> <s> is it not true that there is a very great deal of variation between different regions in the service they provide for the group of disadvantaged children about whom we are talking <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be surprised that i am a little worried when he says if and when it is published <e> <s> is not this report in a sense long overdue <e> <s> are we not talking about a good deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> will he accept that it is not possible to divorce primary health care from the general state of the national health service <e> <s> will the minister also accept that the underfunding of the service and the consequent intolerably long waiting lists and waiting times which are now at a record level greatly affect the burden imposed by waiting patients on general practitioners and other members of the health care team <e> <s> is the minister also aware that the inadequacy of community care provisions for the elderly the disabled the mentally handicapped and the mentally sick also imposes burdens on the family practitioner teams which can be very costly indeed <e>", "<cs> not for inspection at all my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords but not for testing <e>", "<cs> my lords i first congratulate the noble viscount lord falkland on introducing this debate and linking it with the day on which the report of the noble baroness lady masham came out so close to the time when a bill is to be debated in another place <e> <s> it was extremely well timed <e> <s> i want also to express my very sincere thanks and congratulations to my noble friend lord dormand of easington who gave an outstandingly good and very moving maiden speech <e> <s> he always used to be fed up with my speaking in another place but i shall look forward to his speaking here <e>", "<cs> my lords i do challenge that because the figures that have been suggested show an increase of per cent <e> <s> i accept that that includes women as well as men but it shows that there has been a per cent <e> <s> increase in alcohol consumption in scotland <e> <s> i know that the noble lord said that he expected that women would drink more <e> <s> i do not look forward to that prospect or consider it a great success <e> <s> it may be that women are also smoking more and are doing more damage to themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not trying to change history <e> <s> i am simply saying that the facts show that there was a per cent <e> <s> increase in drinking during the eight years that i mentioned <e> <s> that figure was mentioned by the opcs <e>", "<cs> not by me <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not seeing a major crisis within the national health service with health authorities in every region short of nurses not because there is a shortage of nurses but rather <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many hospitals and ward closures there have been in the past months against the express wishes of the community health council <e> <s> is he aware that community health councils are no less conscious than the presidents of the three royal colleges of the deterioration in patient care the near breakdown of acute services the depressingly low morale of the staff and the heavy responsibility on the government to avert a crisis in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords from the figures that the minister gave in answer to my question was he suggesting that the presidents of the three royal colleges to whom referred were inaccurate did not know what they were talking about or were not close enough to the health service scene to say what i quoted they had said <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the last point made by the minister <e> <s> does he accept the disturbing figures recently presented by his department to the public accounts committee which showed a per cent <e> <s> shortage of mental illness nurses and a per cent <e> <s> shortage of nurses for mental handicaps <e> <s> does he accept that the pay level is a vital factor which leads nurses to vote with their feet and to leave their jobs <e> <s> does he stand by the answer that he gave on thursday to a supplementary question from the noble baroness lady cox that there is no substance in the reports that the government are contemplating increases in nurses pay <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that the health authorities have to spend their first years funding by the end of march which is really very near <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord how many staff would be involved and whether he is satisfied that they will all have had adequate training at the centres to which he referred through the royal college of radiologists <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept the fact that to the best of my knowledge there was never a time and certainly not when i was secretary of state when all those concerned with the interests of patients and all the organisations involved in the national health service were so united in their pleas to the government for additional funds <e> <s> in the light of opinion polls does the minister not accept that no government have ever had a greater mandate than do his government now to produce more funding which is quite clearly needed and demanded in place of the repeating of tired statistics that do not fit with the experience of those who work in the health service or those who depend upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not a repetition of what i called tired statistics and statements <e> <s> we are dealing with the situaton which exists today <e> <s> does the minister not accept that the public would prefer see much more money being spent on the health service rather than have some potential reduction of a penny or two on income tax <e> <s> they know where their priorities lie <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not something very unsatisfactory about a situation in which british women who suffered as a result of using this device are to be compensated but that another who suffered similarly are not to be compensated <e> <s> as regards the level of publicity that was required were the government not consulted by the a h robins company and if so can the minister tell the house what response the firm received <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for those remarks <e> <s> but is the minister happy about a situation in which the department in a sense is wiping its hands of the situation <e> <s> does he not recall that on a previous occasion sir gerard vaughan intervened in the case of the distillers company in order to secure justice <e> <s> would it not be appropriate to consult with his right honourable friend and take some initiative to ensure justice for those unfortunate women <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of noble lords who are speaking in todays debate indicates a very widespread interest in the subject of human fertilisation and embryology <e> <s> i want to say from these benches how grateful i am to the government for giving us this early opportunity of discussing the proposals in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the noble earls reply that he accepts that in real terms there was no growth in the acute sector between and as regards in-patients and that in fact there was a shortfall <e> <s> does that not explain the present crisis over beds closed wards and lengthening waiting lists <e> <s> does it not also explain why the secretary of state for social services at the end of last week said that there was a need to increase the total resources available for health care <e> <s> is not my noble friend right in saying that if there is money available to the chancellor of the exchequer a substantial proportion of it should be put into the national health service which is gravely ailing at the present time <e>", "<cs> my-lords does the minister accept that management training is of crucial importance to the national health service <e> <s> is he aware that twice in the past two weeks nhs managers have brought forward proposals of such crass stupidity that they have led hard-working and hard-pressed nurses to take industrial action and these proposals have subsequently been withdrawn <e> <s> is this not extremely damaging to morale within the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords presumably the chief secretary to the treasury mr john major must have known about them because he referred only a few days ago to some uncomfortable management questions <e> <s> the two cases that led to industrial action were widely known throughout the country not just within the health service <e> <s> could the minister not look up the facts and agree that this has been very damaging to the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that the main reason that there is a shortage of vaccine is that the influenza monitoring bureau financed by the pharmaceutical industry put out a warning of a flu epidemic which led to substantial demand and which certainly exhausted the supplies that were intended for priority groups <e> <s> can he say what was the evidence if any on which the bureau put out its warning and how much it cost the national health service to pay for something which seemed to be a form of scare tactic <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how much i welcome the declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords may i welcome the noble earls statement that he will make an inquiry <e> <s> may i ask whether in his inquiries he will consider to what extent it is right that a non-governmental body issues advice about an impending crisis rather than the ministry itself <e> <s> is it not for the department to take the lead rather than a body financed by the pharmaceutical industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on the decision to slash urgently needed beds at another regional cancer speciality hospital namely st bartholomews hospital in london where a -bedded ward is due to close this very day because of a shortage of funds <e> <s> is it really good enough to say that it is a matter for the health authority when in fact the health authority is deprived of the resources <e> <s> the government know they already have those resources and the prime minister and the secretary of state refuse to make them available for cases of urgent need like the treatment of cancer <e>", "<cs> my lords is it really adequate for the minister to say that it is entirely a matter for judgment by the health authority <e> <s> from the very beginning is not the responsibility placed on the secretary of state by the national health service to provide services for the welfare of the people and that includes all people and people with all types of disease <e> <s> is that not a specific responsibility upon the secretary of state <e> <s> why cannot the noble lord answer the question <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me <e> <s> before the noble lord leaves the point of the area of greatest need and the area of hardship can he say what fairness there is in seeking to cash limit hardship <e> <s> surely hardship is a need which has to he met and it is not a matter which can simply be decided by the money that is available on a cash limited account <e> <s> is it not grossly unfair and not in any way linked with acts of hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it should not depend upon the generous intervention of a noble lord to ensure that someone gets his operation instead of having to wait for three years <e> <s> is it not the case that in very many areas and districts right now the length of the waiting list for this operation is increasing <e> <s> does he not agree with dr john havard secretary of the bma yesterday that the national health service is being systematically starved of the resources it needs <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that there was a similar statement this morning by mr trevor clay the general secretary of the royal college of nursing <e> <s> is this not mainly an issue of finance and staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will accept that i too was encouraged by his reponse <e> <s> is he aware that the proposal from the central council has had very widespread support from the organisations concerned <e> <s> does he accept that the training of qualified social workers and the training for the certificate in social service has simply not kept pace with the rapidly changing legislation and with the enormous pressures that are placed upon social workers not just by particular inquiries such as the blom-cooper inquiry to which the minister referred but by the enormous number of cases with which they are now having to deal <e> <s> does the minister accept the urgency of giving an affirmative answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what are sometimes lethally long periods of waiting for an appropriate organ for transplant will the minister agree that the time has come for a new campaign to secure support for organ donation <e> <s> have the government re-examined or will they re-examine the proposals for opting out rather than opting in in order to make organs that could save lives more readily available <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear from the experience in other countries that any sort of private insurance scheme is likely to be approximately twice as expensive in terms of administration as a tax-supported service such as the national health service <e> <s> how does the minister justify the low proportion of gross domestic product dedicated to the national health service in comparison with comparable countries which have a far higher level of payment <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the ministers helpful reply that he is accepting that private or insurance-financed health care is far more costly from an administrative point of view than a tax-paid national health service <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords what did his reply actually mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the order because it meets the wishes of the united kingdom central council for nursing midwifery and health visiting to improve the system of democratic control of its organisation <e> <s> two major changes are involved <e> <s> in the registrar and chief executive of the ukcc was the returning officer and the director for professional conduct was the deputy returning officer <e> <s> this was felt to be a slightly sensitive matter in so far as it was a potential for an officer of the council to rule the nomination as invalid <e> <s> in both the returning officer and the deputy returning officer are staff of the electoral reform society which is taking a larger role in the conduct of the election <e> <s> the registrar of the ukcc will have responsibility for confirming qualifications and registration matters and for definitions of the term practising <e> <s> this term is defined in the nurses midwives and health visitors act <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the breakthrough in that life-saving surgery came in about and that if carried out in time that remarkable operation seems to have a success rate of between and per cent <e> <s> can he also confirm that there is now evidence that resource considerations are causing some delays which are disturbing to those involved in that form of cardiac surgery <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i express the view of all noble lords in offering thanks to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for introducing what has been a very thoughtful debate <e> <s> part of that thoughtful debate was an outstanding maiden speech by the right reverend prelate the bishop of worcester <e> <s> we should not have had that if the noble lord lord kilmarnock had not introduced the debate on this important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that that has had its effect and that if that is so these percentages would not have been the same <e> <s> however i do not think one can argue that that totally explains the remarkable fall in percentages <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not the word punishment is right is it not true that temporary closures are still taking place <e> <s> in view of what the minister said about health districts overspending is not the message to the government from doctors nurses patients and overwhelmingly from taxpayers quite clear that the chancellor really must use some of his surpluses to make a significant and major infusion of funds into the national health service to stop the bleeding that is now going on <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that this very last-minute inquisition by the prime minister is one conducted by ministers and civil servants and includes no independent people from the medical or nursing professions <e> <s> it is a political exercise does the minister not agree <e>", "<cs> should the information not be available my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the drastic proposals by the riverside health authority to reshape the hospital provision in the district which involves as the minister said the closure of four major and well-renowned hospitals leaving no hospital provision whatever in the westminster area and the demolition of st stephens hospital to make room for a new -bed hospital is it not imperative that the secretary of state should call in that proposal to satisfy himself that if carried through it will provide an effective and adequate service for the people of the whole of riverside and not just one end of it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those involved in the aids unit which is an extremely important unit at st stephens hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept the conclusion of the audit commission that many local authorities must transport employees a considerable distance before community care becomes a local reality for mentally handicapped people <e> <s> does he accept that much of that is due to the inadequate funding available to local authorities as a result of the governments restrictions and penalties on the amount that local authorities are permitted to spend <e>", "<cs> my lords why cannot the minister give a commitment to the house that the report will be published <e> <s> did he not hear from the earlier question that there is a great deal of interest not just in your lordships house and in another place but among families the community local authorities and the health authorities <e> <s> does he not agree that this is an absolutely central issue on the future of the health service and community care <e> <s> why cannot he say that the report will be published <e> <s> is it not extraordinary that the government will have such a report from sir roy griffiths and then sit on it <e> <s> surely that is inconceivable <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the fact that the minister has not seen it is not relevant <e> <s> the government must have decided when they asked sir roy griffiths to prepare the report that it would then become open to public debate as well as debate by the government <e> <s> does not the minister agree therefore that not to commit himself is secrecy <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister nevertheless aware that i had great pleasure in answering those questions and saying that of course reports would be published <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> while it may be that i think that over the years the government have been chipping away in a number of respects i did not say that in moving the amendment <e> <s> i hope that he will have a look at the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> without involving myself in the argument about who started it all whether it was in or i would not wish to make a claim that anything done by a labour government in must have been right just because it was done by a labour government <e> <s> that would be nonsensical <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said we sit here with the intention of trying to improve the bill that is before us <e> <s> we do not know when we shall have such a clause before us again <e>", "<cs> as the minister has so generously agreed to consider the matter although without any commitment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> from these benches i support the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> i understand that my noble friend lady turner of camden intends to withdraw her amendment in favour of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for agreeing to look at whether this is a genuine nugget or one that collapses if one presses it <e>", "<cs> let us say reconsideration further thought or whatever the noble lord would like <e>", "<cs> i must admit that i was a little disappointed in the reply from the minister <e> <s> he raised a number of points <e> <s> he has partly convinced me on one of them <e> <s> the minister states that home helps are to be replaced by home care assistants who will be concerned as they are not now concerned with bodily functions <e> <s> they will be fulfilling what might almost seem to be nurse-type care and suprervision which is very much part of the attendance allowance purpose <e> <s> i hope that the minister may add a little more on this issue <e>", "<cs> i agree with the last statement just made and the question of surprise is not one of shock horror it is of great interest in what seems to be a fairly fundamental change in the role of home helps who are providing as the noble baroness lady faithfull and my noble friend lord dormand said a great contribution to the lives of very many people <e> <s> most of the work that they do is not skilled and does not require training though supervision is essential <e> <s> most of them do the work more for the love of it than for the money <e> <s> it is because some of us perhaps we are out of touch had not received information about this very substantial change in care provisions that we were surprised <e>", "<cs> i am not very satisfied by the ministers reply <e> <s> i am sure that i am wrong but i felt that he did not seem to comprehend the severe problems for and i know we are talking about a minority applicants who are kept waiting for a long time <e> <s> i am not arguing that that is the majority of cases <e> <s> i shall give the figures shortly for the average delay time and i believe that that is acceptable <e> <s> they are rare cases <e> <s> i gave one example and could give many others <e> <s> i do not believe that the minister sufficiently recognises the problems that that creates for disabled people and their families and the stress for those working on their behalf <e>", "<cs> before this debate is wound up perhaps i may intervene briefly to say that i found the attitude of the minister towards child benefits to be almost shattering in the light of all my recollections of the period i spent in another place over many years and of all the pressure to which i was subjected not just when i was secretary of state for social services but long before that and after over child benefit <e>", "<cs> could not these matters be included in one of the schedules to the bill <e> <s> would not that be the appropriate place <e> <s> i agree with the point made by the noble lord lord henderson <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief in supporting the amendment which is now before the committee in the name of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> in his reply to the previous group of amendments the minister read out a very substantial and most interesting list of exemptions for which he said there would be regulations <e> <s> i believe that between now and the report stage we should seek a method of including the main categories of these within the bill itself <e>", "<cs> i was clearly told that there was an agreement between both sides of the committee that we would rise after amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not now facing a real and long-foreseen crisis with what the royal college of nursing today calls an horrendous shortage of paediatric nurses and a drastic closure of intensive care cots at specialised childrens hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the continuing drain on the resources of the national health service resulting from cigarette smoking particulary among women and children will the government promise maximum support for national no smoking day on th march and for the first ever world health organisation world non-smoking day on th april <e>", "<cs> if the minister cannot see any way out of the problem then we shall have to have another try <e> <s> i understand the problem <e> <s> i do not agree with him that to call a disregard earnings would be wrong <e> <s> i think that the minister also recognises the nature of the group of damaged people about whom i am concerned for whom work has not been a pattern of life often for or years <e> <s> those people as i said before the minister repeated me are being picked up by their own efforts with the help of society <e> <s> it is impossible to think that they could qualify for training allowances <e> <s> they can start by doing the most simple work <e> <s> some of the work we have organised has been gardening cleaning up gardens or cleaning the roads <e> <s> it is simple work <e> <s> office cleaning is perhaps the most sophisticated work that we have arranged <e> <s> we have cleaned dhss offices up to a reasonable standard <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment to a division <e> <s> i would not succeed <e> <s> in his response the minister seemed to be sympathetic to the problem that i raised but not to have an answer <e> <s> i have presented the problem but i too have no satisfactory answer <e> <s> i wonder whether he will say that he is happy that there should be discussions between his department perhaps the department of employment representatives of the organisations to which i have referred and maybe a number of others to see whether there is a better solution than the one that i have tried to foist upon the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for being so sympathetic <e> <s> it may be that we shall not find anything that can come into the bill although it may go into another bill <e> <s> if we find a way of resolving this problem it will not have been a waste of time to bring the amendment before the committee <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not expect the minister to accept the amendment just as it was proposed because i recognise that it is a very difficult one <e> <s> i have to say to him that many of the people who are in the sort of condition whether or not it is due to aids where they are faced with the problem of a choice between intrusive questioning and being very broke indeed would accept intrusive questioning <e> <s> of course they and we would all accept that any such decision would have to be based on a medical assessment <e> <s> it could not possibly be done by a layman <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a very brief comment so that it is not necessarily assumed that we on this side of the committee accept part of what the noble baroness lady faithfull has said <e> <s> i absolutely agree with her conclusion and i totally support the proposal made by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> however certainly my experience of social security offices is not that the staff are likely to be overgenerous <e> <s> my experience was often that they were not adequate in the payments that they made <e> <s> sometimes they were prepared to look at cases again if the person concerned was intelligent enough to see their member of parliament <e> <s> but it should not have been that way <e>", "<cs> will the minister agree that the great reduction was a result of decisions taken by the department to discourage the same size of payment <e> <s> single payments were much less and therefore were grossly inadequate <e>", "<cs> it came up last year <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that the two issues raised in the two amendments are absolutely right <e> <s> if amendment no <e> <s> were to be either accepted or carried then the need for amendment no <e> <s> a would disappear at least for the time being for one year or two as the case may be <e> <s> i believe that some agreement has been reached as to what time we should adjourn <e> <s> i need some advice as to whether we should take the two amendments together because that would require a further debate and possibly a division unless the government seek to change their position <e> <s> i do not know whether anyone can advise me on whether it is wise at this stage to take the two amendments together <e> <s> has anyone any advice <e>", "<cs> in that case i should like to hear the response from the minister <e> <s> however this may well be an issue on which the committee should divide <e>", "<cs> i am afraid the fact that this chamber took a decision on which i may have disagreed will not convince me of the satisfactory nature of the ministers reply <e> <s> he suddenly stopped giving the reply when i thought he was halfway through it <e> <s> the assurance he gave that applicants will not themselves <e>", "<cs> the example of aberfan is not on all fours with the normal considerations that a social fund officer would have to take into account <e> <s> if there were an aberfan circumstance of course the aberfan fund would respond <e> <s> normally however it is a matter of providing some essential furniture a cooker or suchlike to meet the needs of a particularly disadvantaged family <e>", "<cs> my lords following the figures given by the minister may i ask whether he can give the house a figure for the current waiting lists for the four thames regions and say whether the trend is up or down <e>", "<cs> my lords can i therefore ask the minister whether he is saying that the trend is still up <e> <s> and is it up compared with a year ago or compared with which previous statistic <e>", "<cs> my lords although i agree with the noble earl that the national health service is in a state of crisis does the minister really feel that this proposal is constructive <e> <s> would it not be a device that would enable the treasury to save money from the finances that it puts at the disposal of the nhs inadequate though they may be <e> <s> do not the government accept the conclusion of doctors nurses and indeed the public at large that health care is a national responsibility paid for by the people in the fairest way namely by taxation and not by lotteries sweepstakes coffee mornings t-shirts and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all thank my noble friend for raising this issue this evening and for bringing his professional expertise and knowledge for the benefit of your lordships house <e> <s> secondly i should like to make a general comment upon the importance of nutritional labelling quite separate from the specific interests of the coronary prevention group <e> <s> i do so from my interests as chairman of the all-party parliamentary food and health forum which was meeting earlier this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords are not both my noble friends right when they infer that a hastily conceived government review team made up of ministers and senior civil servants is unlikely to produce an unbiased and balanced appraisal and recommendations <e> <s> if changes are to be made in a much beloved national service surely the government should listen to those who really know the situation and should be seeking a consensus <e>", "<cs> my lords while i warmly welcome the support announced by the minister for lighthouse and the point just raised by the noble lord lord kilmarnock perhaps i may ask whether there is any form of government support for those who for the reasons stated by the noble lord lord kilmarnock are more likely to have their last weeks and months at home rather than in a hospice <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that i tried to do <e>", "<cs> my lords how can a minister justify a situation in which urgently needed special care baby cots are cut by a third <e> <s> how long can this game of russian roulette with childrens lives go on <e> <s> does he accept that whatever may or may not be the solutions to the problems of the nhs the most urgent need at the moment is to stop the bleeding and to stop those beds being taken out of use particularly when children are dying <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the decision to reduce the number of cots available is not a matter of resources <e> <s> if so how much is saved by a reduction in the number of these cots <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the increased abuse by or addiction of patients and the unnecessary charge on the resources of the national health service caused by the widespread practice of repeat prescriptions are the government and the committee on safety of medicines prepared to give very clear advice to gps that they should not give repeat prescriptions <e> <s> secondly will the noble earl congratulate mind on its highly successful campaign against minor tranquiliser abuse including widespread establishment of support groups by local mental health associations for those seeking to be free of addiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall only be a minute in indicating that we on these benches warmly support the amendment proposed by the noble lords lord carter and lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> my support is in no way based on doubts about the integrity of dig or its abilities <e> <s> i feel irritated by the fact that the government have put themselves into a situation where a bill designed to improve benefits has created this lacuna for the most needy people <e> <s> they must resolve this <e> <s> severely disabled people will be worse off and that is a great indictment of the principle on which the bill is based <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to understand what the minister is saying <e> <s> there seems to be no logic about it <e> <s> we are talking about the same words <e> <s> he has accepted the words that i quoted as being the words that were used by the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> when i had made the response in which i said that i thought it was a remarkable statement of profound importance she then repeated the assurance <e> <s> she said <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord has set a cash limit <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down or while he is standing may i ask him whether the figure of million that has been widely published is in the handbook was repeated by the noble lord in the debate at committee stage and has been made available is an actual cash limit <e> <s> as secretary of state i was involved with cash limits for years and years <e> <s> i introduced cash limits <e> <s> is that figure of million which has been stated to be the cash limit not a cash limit <e> <s> when is a cash limit not a cash limit <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the question was put to me before i sat down so perhaps i do not need to ask the leave of the house to reply <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> i am all for cash limits <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that the minister has not satisfied me one little bit <e> <s> of course i shall read carefully what he has said and look into the difference between the definitions of cash limit and budget to see whether i can decipher any way in which the minister has moved one way not just towards me towards what his noble friend lady trumpington said to the house on that occasion so long ago <e> <s> therefore i shall not press the point at present but we shall reserve our position for when we come to third reading <e> <s> it is an issue of great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the increasing number of hasty discharges and the all too frequent re-admissions of those discharged too early do the government accept the urgent need for the implementation of the section <e> <s> are resources a reason for further delay and if so what sort of sums are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied with a plan for a massive new -bed hospital in traffic-jammed fulham leaving no hospital services at all in pimlico victoria westminster belgravia and mayfair for residents the working population or indeed visitors <e> <s> secondly is he satisfied with the quite inadequate costings of this project <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his noble friend the minister for health has twice been publicly referred to as having given his approval to this proposal <e> <s> that is why i asked the minister whether he would call it in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the money from the sale of those hospitals will come to the district health authority automatically for its expenditure <e> <s> is he satisfied with the consultative arrangements by which only one plan is put out for consultation and no others are considered <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i warmly thank the minister for this amendment <e> <s> it is good that he has made a commitment and it is good that he has stood by that commitment <e> <s> from our side we warmly welcome this <e> <s> i very much support what has been said by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> we recognise as i said at report stage that the social fund is a completely new type of animal <e> <s> we do not know how successful it is going to be <e> <s> there have been very many concerns and criticisms expressed from the ministers own advisory committee as well as from very many voluntary organisations <e> <s> i shall refer to some of those when moving the next amendment <e>", "<cs> would the minister kindly repeat that last sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as to the wording of my own amendment i have no pride of authorship and agree that it could have been better <e> <s> it is not my intention to press my amendment partly because it is defective and partly because of the very important statements that the minister has now made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gives with one hand and takes away with the other <e> <s> the statement he made that i welcomed he has now withdrawn <e> <s> he said previously that there was a contingency fund an additional allocation <e> <s> i naturally assumed that it was additional to the sum of money that he mentioned <e> <s> on rd march he stated in col <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the amendment as far as it goes <e> <s> i welcome any opportunity for additional guidance to social fund officers to help in the course of what will be a very difficult task for them <e> <s> i note that the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> since the consensus among responsible organisations the bma the royal college of nursing the institute of health services management the national association of health authorities the kings fund and the all-party select committee on social services is that the national health service still needs an additional billion to cope with severe underfunding and since the consensus of the four most recent opinion polls is that four out of five taxpayers would have preferred the chancellor to have given that sum of money to the national health service rather than in income tax relief does the minister accept that the decision to do the opposite shows an extraordinary degree of insensitivity both to health needs and to the wishes of the taxpayers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that he was able to give the answers yes and no to his noble friend because of the excellent organisational structure of a tax-financed national health service <e> <s> is he aware that the current underfunding and the governments determined squeeze on the national health service with all the consequences that we understand lead some people to believe that the government are doing this quite intentionally in order to show that the nhs now needs some major re-organisation with the emphasis on privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that however successful the new income generation scheme may be it is unlikely to do much to solve the current grave problems of underfunding in the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the noble lords replies can he give a guarantee that the government will not introduce compulsory charges for eye tests <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say which types of strips will be available <e> <s> i know that the british diabetic association is not certain <e> <s> will there by any training for people to use these strips <e> <s> i know that that is another concern of the british diabetic association <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> can he say when the advice to gps will go out <e> <s> i understand that it has not yet been sent to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his detailed reply and for the pieces of good information which he gave <e> <s> i should also like to thank all who participated in the debate <e> <s> the list includes a professor of medicine a professor of pharmacology a working consultant a nurse two gps and a dentist <e> <s> the dentist was the one who thought that medicine is working against health <e> <s> however one would not find in the other place a better representation of those who work in the service <e> <s> i should like to thank most warmly the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford for an outstanding and humanitarian speech <e> <s> he spoke from personal and family experience <e> <s> his compassion shone through all that he said <e> <s> i look forward immensely to his further contributions to our debates and not just on the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept the estimate of the royal college of nursing that there are now about registered nurses who are in a sense the target for the back to nursing campaign <e> <s> will the minister also accept that there are some very severe recruitment problems due to poor pay and stressful working conditions <e> <s> there is also a drop-out rate of about a year of nurses in training <e> <s> can the minister confirm those facts <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not concerned about the information he gave the house about a trend towards agency nurses <e> <s> whether or not they are cheaper and i was surprised by what he said does he not agree that it is far better for a hospital to be staffed by full-time regular employees than by people who may be in for a week or two according to what their programme is <e> <s> does that not show the importance of being able to attract by good pay and conditions new nurses into the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very high figures which my noble friend has quoted of deaths of children in the first months of life is the minister satisfied that replacing two out of five beds is satisfactory <e> <s> is it not right that there should be a total restoration of the number of beds which have been cut and which are desperately needed not only in manchester but across the country <e>", "<cs> my lords was it not originally a shortage of money which led to a shortage of staff <e> <s> that is the point i was trying to make to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how pleased i was to hear the ministers welcome for the select committee report on medical research which i thought was rather critical of the government <e> <s> in connection with preventive medicine will the minister say what support her majestys government gave to the first ever world non-smoking day last week <e> <s> that was sponsored by the world health organisation <e> <s> will he say what further action the government propose to take on smoking in the workplace in the light of the very recent report presenting new and powerful evidence of the dangers even to non-smokers of being in smoke-filled rooms <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the supplementary question asked by the noble baroness may i ask this question <e> <s> can the minister say why the government are giving top priority to bitterly opposed legislation concerning such matters as social security education the poll tax and optical and dental charges rather than to this measure which is likely to receive support from both sides of the house as regards which there is a deep sense of urgency that it might do some good for the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that lady lane-fox was a shining example of what can be done by disabled people not only for parliament but also for other disabled people for whom she cared so much <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking not only from this bench but also as chairman of the national association for mental health i should like to associate myself with the view that this is an extremely important report on a crucially important issue <e> <s> if the government have not yet made up their mind may it not be that their mind will be more clearly made up as a result of a debate in your lordships house <e> <s> will the noble earl press his colleagues to ensure that time is given for a debate on this important subject <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> wrong on both points my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords first i owe the house a small apology in that i missed part of the speeches of two noble lords <e> <s> however that was only because of a small private illness rather than public health <e> <s> therefore having made that small apology i move on to the subject of public health <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> yes i expected such an announcement <e> <s> although many of the issues were admittedly not put into the report which was not seen by ministers until four months ago they are ones that have been discussed in the department for <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that mind has a great deal of evidence of failure to inform the families of discharged patients under the terms of section and that that is causing great hardship to both patients and families alike <e> <s> can the minister say what action he can take to improve the situation and to facilitate the kind of multi-disciplinary advocacy provided for in the disabled persons services consultation and representation act <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister would he accept that unless the information is available it is simply not possible for the multi-disciplinary advocacy to which i referred in the disabled persons services consultation and representation act to take place <e> <s> without the information concerning when a patient is going to be discharged how can that advocacy operation as conceived in the act be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on these benches there is a great deal of concern and that we look forward to the publication of the policy statement which we shall want to debate in your lordships house <e> <s> without underestimating the importance of the statutory role of des and the local authorities will she say a word about the work of the voluntary organisation sense the national deaf blind and rubella association and especially its pioneering work at its new centre in birmingham <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the close link between this question and the previous question will the minister say whether the policy statement that she referred to in connection with question no <e> <s> goes any wider than deaf-blind children <e> <s> does it deal with other disabilities <e> <s> can she give some idea as to when the statement is likely to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will understand the lack of wisdom i would show if i were to become involved in this discussion between two experts <e> <s> i have two questions <e> <s> the first is to what extent is the need for training facilities and courses for dentists as opposed to time for treatment of patients taken into consideration in assessing the <e>", "<cs> my lords does not that reply conceal what i consider to be two scandalous facts in the report of the comptroller and auditor general <e> <s> first the dhss has not even monitored the claim made five years ago that there is now a maintenance backlog of billion in nhs properties <e> <s> secondly health authorities have failed to achieve annual savings of between million and million <e> <s> that money could have been saved by the effective disposal of surplus property <e> <s> it could have gone into patient care or contributed towards the maintenance bill <e>", "<cs> my lords why then did the report not give those figures <e> <s> why was it stated that the dhss had not even monitored the figures claimed five years ago <e> <s> was that information available <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the question put and the answer just given perhaps the minister would take note of page of the report <e> <s> at paragraph there is a quite clear statement <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a long time since we had a debate which concentrated purely on mental illness and mental handicap <e> <s> i suspect there has not been one since the debates to which the noble lord lord winstanley referred in connection with the act <e> <s> as a member of the other place at the time i was extremely grateful to your lordships house for making some improvements to that legislation <e> <s> i wish the house equally well in dealing with other legislation still before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i shall say what i was going to say in case he should come under pressure <e> <s> it has taken a long time to initiate the movement towards hospital closure and the improvement of community services <e> <s> it took a long time before the first hospital was closed in banstead <e> <s> if we turn our back on this as i know some people are suggesting it would be a terrible tragedy and we might not get the impetus again <e> <s> i believe the emphasis must be on additional resources for community care <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was really saying was that the priority should be to do what we have to do as regards community care and not to take the easy course which is to slow down the whole procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not need to add much to what has already been said <e> <s> i very much welcome this bill and congratulate archie kirkwood on introducing it in another place and the noble lord lord tordoff on introducing it here in a somewhat amended form following its passage through the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords is it conceivable that the secretary of state or indeed the minister could have given his approval to a decision by a district health authority simply to make a ruthless overall cut in the work of one of its hospitals <e> <s> is he aware that this cut is due to continue for a total of months regardless of the consequences for patients <e> <s> does he agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the health authority requires a per cent <e> <s> cut in its workload is not that a cut in its workload <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that naturally i welcome the additional funds that have been found <e> <s> will he say when the report will be available indicating what the situation will be like for the other centres in the region to which he made reference <e> <s> can he also say how a decision is taken by doctors as to who should be refused renal dialysis when it is known that the outcome will be death <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the main problem in establishing a national framework is that of training radiologists <e> <s> perhaps he can tell the house what progress is being made in that field so that we shall know how long it will be before the service is fully effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i start with a small apology <e> <s> i am at the moment under treatment for a chest infection and should not be here <e> <s> i was very determined to be here but if by any chance i have to leave before the end of the debate bearing in mind that my noble friend is replying i hope that those speaking in the debate will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i did not intend to intervene <e> <s> however i should like to know why in the white paper the minister did not say and one of the things is charges <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that in the fields of mental illness and physical and mental handicap there is a serious inadequacy both of housing and community services which leads to great hardship <e> <s> does he further accept that the failure of the government to respond to the recommendations of the griffiths report is leading to uncertainty in local authorities and great difficulty in planning for services in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why he said that my question was wide of the mark <e> <s> surely it was absolutely directed to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> and physical handicaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i said physical handicap mental illness and mental handicap <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that though the voluntary hospices and there are more than of them will greatly appreciate his tribute that will not ease the fact that their budget is now being increased by per cent to pay the nurses award <e> <s> does he not realise that if beds are lost or whole hospices are closed it will be serious for the patients concerned <e> <s> will he ask his right honourable friend to consider whether as an interim measure in view of the fact that the health authorities have already planned their budgets for this year he can find some resources to help out this extremely valuable service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat the question that i put to the noble earl <e> <s> i asked him if in the light of what has been said indeed more has been said since i put the question he would discuss with his right honourable friend the secretary of state whether some funds could be found to enable health authorities which have already allocated their funds to make a special grant just for this year to assist voluntary hospices <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may emphasise the urgency of the recommendations in the report and express consternation that either there has not been a reply or a reply has not been sent to the department <e> <s> if there is a reply with further recommendations will the minister kindly find out about it because this is urgent <e> <s> is he aware that one of the main conclusions of the advisory committee on the misuse of drugs was that hiv is a greater threat to public health than drugs abuse <e> <s> in the light of that will he give a little more information on first departmental support for gp services as recommended by the report and secondly on the recommendations of the report on the identification of drug misusers in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still a little concerned over the lack of urgency about the recommendations and the response to them <e> <s> i should like to help the minister as to the two recommendations about which i asked for some report <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can explain in words which i can understand why the government do not intend to carry through the decision taken in this house which was not reversed in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords no it would not be duplicated <e> <s> is the minister therefore saying that it is simply not convenient to carry out the legal obligation which has been written into the act <e>", "<cs> my lords what kind of situation are we in if we decide whether or not it is convenient to carry out the law of the land <e> <s> i simply do not understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concern expressed by the noble lord lord auckland <e> <s> will the minister explain why his right honourable friend the secretary of state has been giving nods and winks in advance about certain attitudes taken within the review body such as his support for the proposal for tax relief for those who opt out of the national health service <e> <s> is it wise to start giving hostages to fortune in advance of the decisions being taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard what the secretary of state said with my own ears <e> <s> it was clear <e> <s> was it not plain that he was taking a clear position indicating what was happening within the review body <e> <s> i put my question again is that wise <e>", "<cs> my lords if as i presume is so from the reply given by the minister the government see merit in riding for the disabled and i know many noble lords certainly do could they explore alternative prospects in view of the likely closure including perhaps an approach to the grosvenor estate to finance such a scheme <e> <s> i understand that that estate has the odd copper and it might offer to assist <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister had his attention drawn to the exchanges in the house which <e>", "<cs> my lords with deep respect drug abuse is an important cause of aids <e> <s> very many cases have been identified as being the result of shared needles <e> <s> the minister will know that that applies out in the community and within prisons <e> <s> had it not been so the advisory committee on the misuse of drugs which considered specifically the question of aids and drug misuse would not have thought it appropriate to make the recommendation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that the funding problems of the health and safety executive which have been given some publicity do not mean that it is unable to give inspections which are as frequent as it would like <e> <s> has the executive indicated that the quality of its work is somewhat reduced as a result of funding difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that i like my noble friend lord murray am amazed by the figures he quoted <e> <s> is he aware that i have seen a survey which indicated that of homeless people per cent <e> <s> were identified as having psychiatric problems <e> <s> does he accept that there seems to be no evidence of an increase in the number of people who are mentally ill except in the case of the very elderly and that the problem lies in the increase in the number of psychiatric cases discharged from hospitals and arriving in the community <e> <s> is he further aware that in that connection there is an increase in homelessness because there is not a satisfactory response in terms of the community care needs in our local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that consultants throughout the country are very concerned about the financial situation affecting their districts <e> <s> bearing in mind the statistics which have just been given by the noble countess is the minister prepared to withdraw a statement that he made on th november that an orthopaedic surgeon mr john guy in worcester royal infirmary made a statement which misrepresented the situation <e> <s> is he aware that the facts that the noble countess has given substantiate the claims made by the consultant at that time <e> <s> is he aware that the consultant much resented the allegation made by the minister that he was misrepresenting the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords in the minister aware that while some noble lords were sitting very late last night i was with the hereford health district where i was being told by the chairman of the medical committee of drastic cuts in the basic services to patients including the closure of theatre wards and the standing down of theatre staff doctors and nurses <e> <s> is he surprised that some local people were saying to me that this is a deliberate policy to boost the private sector of the health service because people are now having to wait longer and longer <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very strong feeling in westminster including opposition by the westminster city council and the community health council concerning the plans to close the westminster hospital and the westminster childrens hospital <e> <s> therefore will the minister confirm that the secretary of state is giving careful consideration not just to the proposal rejected by the community health council but to the proposal from the westminster hospitals development fund <e> <s> that has the advantage not only that it retains the westminster hospital and the westminster city hospital but also that it does so in a way that fits into the financial guidelines set down by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the last exchange on the point raised by my noble friend lord cocks does the minister agree that in view of <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether butane gas is used extensively <e> <s> this is a serious problem <e> <s> on the wider question of solvent misuse am i right in believing that the incidence of this form of abuse among youngsters is no longer increasing <e> <s> if so can the minister give some statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the point put by my noble friend if the minister is going to look at the statistics more carefully is it possible for more research to be carried out into the ways in which this problem can be tackled <e> <s> the figures given to me by the minister for were i thought disturbing but as he said they can be interpreted in different ways <e> <s> is it possible to have these figures the causes and cures better known <e>", "<cs> my lords while regretting that the minister is unable to answer the question i put perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> will he and the whole house express thanks to those who work in the national health service on its th anniversary for their magnificent achievement in improving the quality of life for the people of britain over the past years <e> <s> i ask the minister whether he recognises the double irony that first the national health service is now suffering from a cumulative underfunding of over billion pounds <e> <s> that is according to the <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a great celebration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that during the period of the labour government from to there was an increase in real terms to the health service more substantial than increases during the past nine years <e> <s> will he accept that there was a happy celebration of the th anniversary of the national health service and that at that time there was not nearly the controversy there now is about underfunding bed closures and lengthening waiting lists <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place and for its very balanced tone <e> <s> perhaps i may also add my warm congratulations to lord justice butler-sloss on her thorough sensitive and painstaking report which carries with it a deep understanding of the appalling damage which is now being done to young children and their families on a previously unrecognised scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the minister that we should not be misled by scare stories <e> <s> does he feel that his first reply was rather dismissive of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly support the campaign <e> <s> but does the minister agree that in view of the very serious problems of coronary heart disease referred to by the noble baroness and the clear link between heart disease and excessive fat in our diet it is time the government had a clear food policy that they could commend <e> <s> in this connection will they consider consulting the parliamentary food and health forum which would be very glad to be associated with the campaign <e>", "<cs> we could get through it quicker that way could we not <e> <s> i should like to express sympathy with the noble lord for his throat condition <e> <s> if i rise to my feet and put a number of questions it is not that i am trying to tire his throat but that i am trying to satisfy myself about what best to do in the interests of the bill and the general practitioners involved <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reassurance <e> <s> my concern is not to raise an ideological issue but to ensure that what we are doing is best for the general practitioners <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for the assurances that he has given and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have to say that i am not impressed by that reply from the minister <e> <s> he seemed to rest part of his argument on the fact that the amendment would perhaps be giving too much power to the secretary of state <e> <s> however the amount of power given to the secretary of state in clauses and is enormous <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> i am very happy with the amendments <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister could say a little more about the job protection aspect on which he touched briefly just now <e> <s> does it give an absolute guarantee that no jobs will be lost <e> <s> what provisions will be made <e> <s> otherwise the arrangements made by the government are entirely satisfactory and perfectly reasonable <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we are dealing with an unusual case in which a public corporation established by the government with a clear and distinct function within the national health service and owing allegiance to the secretary of state is to be replaced by a new and private company <e> <s> we have to ensure that that new and private company fulfils its public role no less efficiently than its predecessor <e> <s> this is not like any ordinary private company that is simply in the market and is doing its business for profit as is the natural responsibility of a private company <e> <s> it is established by this bill and it is to be given a precise job <e> <s> we all accept that it has a heavy responsibility to the doctors and other practitioners whom it serves and to the health service as a whole <e> <s> if it has a responsibility to the health service as a whole it has a responsibility to parliament <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord accept that if questions were put in this place about a report for which the secretary of state has no responsibility he has a perfect right to say this is not for me <e> <s> will he not agree that that is right <e> <s> therefore there is no opportunity for questions in this place <e>", "<cs> i am shaking my head because i do not think for the reasons given by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford that they are on all fours <e> <s> british telecom amersham international or any other public corporation are not fulfilling part of a statutory responsibility held by a secretary of state in another place and accountable to both houses of parliament <e> <s> so this is as he said a unique situation <e> <s> if the minister cannot think how best to deal with the matter now perhaps he can take it away with him and think about it <e> <s> we must find a way to deal with this <e>", "<cs> before the minister adds his own honeyed words to all this may i say that when i was listening to the noble lord lord trafford it seemed to me that he was just looking at paragraph f as if there had not been an enormous debate on the principle of new contracts <e> <s> of course there is an enormous debate and it has been going on for many months <e> <s> i am looking at a piece of paper dated th october which says <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> thank you very much <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is to raise income for improving the health service <e> <s> that is what is covered by the clause <e> <s> how could it be more all-embracing <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> he says that it is perfectly ok do not worry about it we already have it in another piece of legislation section of the national health service act <e> <s> i suggest to him that two wrongs do not make a right <e> <s> if we made a mistake then why should we make another mistake now <e> <s> perhaps he will look at the words <e> <s> i challenge him to say what cannot be done under those terms <e> <s> it is not just a case of whether someone could raffle the office of the secretary of state <e> <s> he should get a lot of money for it because it is a very expensive office in the centre of london <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for responding as he has <e> <s> however i cannot see that the secretary of state is not given powers here to adopt a different method of funding other than tax funding for the purpose of improving the national health service <e> <s> i am very sorry but i must press this to a division <e>", "<cs> the minister cannot imagine that i would wish to leave a situation in which leagues of friends with their trolleys could not charge p for a yorkie <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to deprive the secretary of state charging p or even making a profit from p for a yorkie <e> <s> i am perfectly satisfied that if i am successful in securing the deletion of this

own constituency when he was member of parliament for norwich north <e> <s> throughout his period in public life he has been a tremendous champion of the work of voluntary organisations <e> <s> he has done great work himself and i think he has given a lead to others <e> <s> it would be very sad as he himself said if in putting this bill through the interests of the voluntary organisations were somehow not fully recognised <e> <s> this is the right place to do that because after all in order to do their work the voluntary organisations have to raise money <e> <s> i am thinking particularly

course is to drop it <e> <s> if i am prepared to do so i hope that if there are occasions later in the bill when the minister finds as on second reading that he has no support at all for some proposals in the bill which are condemned all round he may be prepared to do the same <e>", "<cs> i should like to give my total support to the noble lord lord colwyn and the amendment he has proposed <e> <s> the committee will recall that at second reading i strongly criticised the government for their move to abolish the statutory role of the cds <e> <s> i tabled my own proposal to remedy that mischief <e> <s> i then saw on the same day the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord colwyn i recognised that it was more comprehensive and more suitable that it took in groups such as pregnant and nursing mothers <e> <s> the elderly and the handicapped <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i decided that i would withdraw my amendment and give my support to his <e>", "<cs> in view of the concession from the minister which i warmly welcome i do not wish to oppose this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister surprised that five months after the report was presented to the secretary of state some people who are deeply concerned with community care are not satisfied with an in due course response <e> <s> does he also accept that sir roy griffiths has spoken of the urgency of the governments response <e> <s> bearing in mind what he said about local authorities how can he expect local authorities to plan community services for the elderly mentally sick and handicapped and physically handicapped

people will be deterred from having the examination <e> <s> even though the figure of as she says is not huge people know that if they have their teeth examined that may well lead to a number of jobs

into the same trap as his noble friends lord nugent of guildford and lord trafford <e> <s> they spoke as if charges for screening or examination were just the same as charges for treatment <e> <s> at this stage we are not discussing charges for treatment although the minister did so in his response <e>", "<cs> i hope that that will be the case because it will save the committee a good deal of time

<e> <s> i understand that there are a number of sight-threatening conditions which are symptomless particularly in the early stages <e> <s> they include glaucoma diabetic retinopathy and muscular degeneration <e>", "<cs> surely not <e>", "<cs> i intentionally waited until after the minister made his speech before making my contribution from these benches <e> <s> i totally disagree with the last conclusion that he reached <e> <s> on the basis of the arguments which the minister and a number of other members of the committee such as the noble lords lord cullen lord trafford and lord hunter have advanced i think that the best thing is to defeat the amendment and not have to come back to it again <e> <s> it seems to me a fairly offensive amendment and one which has some dangers to it <e>", "<cs> i notice that the noble lord lord orr-ewing said no no <e> <s> but the letter comes from the royal national institute for the blind and i do not think that we can simply dismiss it out of hand <e> <s> the british college of optometrists which has carried out a survey states <e>", "<cs> i recognise that the noble lords second point has been mentioned during this -minute debate <e> <s> i did not intend to suggest that those who moved the amendment were doing so as a result of a campaign run by magnivision <e> <s> however the noble lord can hardly have been following what has been going on in the field of medicine or comfort or whatever he may call it if he is unaware of the magnivision story which has gained tremendous publicity <e> <s> i do not suggest for a moment that any member of the committee has been influenced by that commercial enterprise <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord requires the permission of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i wish to oppose the withdrawal of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i need say no more than a few sentences as the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne has set out the matter clearly <e>", "<cs> the minister made the point that when this was put into the bill in another place it was on the assumption that there would be sight tests that would be paid for therefore private sight tests <e> <s> that has now been deleted <e> <s> is there not an argument for his thinking again as he suggests <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he said <e> <s> having a suspicious mind i always cavil a little at statements like i have no plans <e> <s> sometimes three months later someone then has plans <e> <s> i remember at the time of an election a few years ago the prime minister said that she had no intention to increase prescription charges <e> <s> at that moment she had not but as soon as she became prime minister she jolly well did and we have suffered from them ever since <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble earl for his constructive reply <e> <s> i should also like to thank the three doctors who fully supported the principle underlying my amendment <e> <s> it was most encouraging and i know that members of the nursing profession will also find it so <e> <s> i indicated that it was not my intention to press the matter to a division <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl <e> <s> under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the amendment has been spoken to but if it has i apologise <e> <s> it looks as though it is a little more than a technical amendment and perhaps the minister can explain it to the committee <e>", "<cs> if the consultation between the minister and the noble lord lord winstanley could include handbags then people would be even better equipped <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the noble lord lord skelmersdale to say how much we have appreciated the way in which he has dealt with the issues <e> <s> we have not always agreed on everything but <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that there will be no more money over and above that which has already been paid <e> <s> is he not aware that according to the estimates from regional health authorities over million is under-provided in terms of fulfilling or covering the nurses pay award <e> <s> does he accept the fact that the secretary of state gave an absolute assurance in the other place and it was repeated in this place that the government would fully fund the nurses pay award <e> <s> does he recognise the fact that if the additional money is not provided not only will there be cutbacks in patient <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister look at the wording used by his right honourable friend the prime minister in answering questions in another place when as i understand it she expressed herself clearly on the basis of the estimates but did not say that if there was a difference between the review bodys estimates and the reality of covering the pay award that additional money would be found <e> <s> will the minister look at that matter again <e>", "<cs> it would be nice if they matched up <e>", "<cs> my lords without necessarily supporting the comments made by my noble friend may i support his constructive proposals <e> <s> does the minister accept that there is now a major problem in diazepines and tranquilliser addiction <e> <s> it is almost always due to ill-advised repeat prescriptions <e> <s> does the minister accept from me that the task of escaping from this addiction is a major challenge which requires a great deal of support for those who are seeking to break from something so addictive <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend did not suggest that this form of medication should be prohibited <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take this opportunity of congratulating the noble lord on his new appointment and express the hope that he will continue to speak in this house on health as well as social security <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many disabled people and many of those who represent them believe that the continued delay in publishing the report under section of the act is linked with the governments prolonged delay in publishing the results of the opcs survey which shows that at million there are about twice as many disabled people as the government had assumed <e> <s> will the minister confirm that the review of disability benefits will quickly follow the publication of the surveys <e> <s> can he give any more information about when those surveys will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said and no one would disagree with him that the information should be correct why did his two colleagues in another place indicate first that the report would be published last year and then that it would he published this year <e> <s> if the information is available in the library why cannot it be published according to the act of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to hear the minister say that he had had his attention drawn to the study which showed that we had only roughly a quarter of the number of speech therapists who were needed in the country <e> <s> i am talking about the report referred to by my noble friend <e> <s> does he accept the conclusions of that authoritative study <e> <s> bearing in mind that per cent <e> <s> of local authorities are at present quite unable to meet the educational needs of speech therapists and that the provision of speech therapists in britain is roughly half of that which is accepted by most ec countries will the government take determined action to increase the number available <e> <s> many of them are leaving the profession and taking up other work because of the salaries offered for speech therapy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the minister seemed to think that salaries were satisfactory <e> <s> we must bear in mind that in most cases trained speech therapists have received four years training as compared with the two years training for an occupational therapist <e> <s> therefore does he really feel that a year will encourage speech therapists to remain in this very demanding profession <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say why the secretary of state for social services last night refused to see the leaders of the rcn and other unions that represent the nurses <e> <s> why has the minister said this morning that the time for talking is past <e> <s> is it not totally intolerable and irresponsible at this time to treat nurses in such a cavalier manner when feelings are running so high <e> <s> is he aware that feelings are running high not only among the nurses but also among the health authorities many of whom are now obliged to cut back on services to their patients because the government are not fully funding the award <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state himself is responsible <e> <s> simply to say that he has delegated to his minister an issue that affects nurses right across the country is surely another sign of irresponsibility is it not <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that it is comparable with the irresponsibility that he showed when for a whole month in the summer he failed to tackle the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord prepared to clarify the confusion that seems to exist <e> <s> did he hear the statement as i did by the minister for health on the radio this morning <e> <s> does he have the text before him <e> <s> did he or did he not say that the time is past for talking <e> <s> did he or did he not mean that <e>", "<cs> my lords when there are no words before us i find it very difficult to legislate standing on my feet <e> <s> when the minister started his reply he said that there was not really a dilemma <e> <s> i think that there is one or rather several dilemmas in which your lordships house is placed at the moment <e> <s> the noble lord said that the new contract had been in operation for months or whatever it was <e> <s> it may be that some people have not read the small print <e> <s> it may be that before having secured legislative approval the government decided that they would not wish to implement the new powers that this bill would give to the secretary of state <e> <s> if they had implemented those powers and if we were now debating ways in which the secretary of state had used the new powers at a time when the bill was still going through both houses i think there would have been very great anger indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is an argument in favour of withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> almost all noble lords who spoke including the noble lords lord trafford lord winstanley lord adrian lord peston lord beloff lord auckland lord russell and lord halsbury said to the minister please take it away <e> <s> they did not say give some little concessions <e> <s> they may be major concessions i do not know whether they are without having them in front of me and going through them with a toothcomb <e> <s> the minister would not take it away <e> <s> perhaps he will on the manuscript amendment which i have tabled on a later matter which is not on an issue as important as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for intervening <e> <s> the minister has mentioned two points on which he is prepared to make adjustments perhaps he could clarify this <e> <s> can he say that he will take this away and look at it in the light of the debate that has taken place here <e> <s> one must recognise that except for the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the minister did not find any friends in the situation as it now is <e> <s> if the noble lord takes it away and looks at the whole issue in the light of this debate and then comes back i assure him and i hope that my noble colleague agrees that i shall not press my amendment to the vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful i think that the minister has moved further <e> <s> can he take back paragraph g as well <e> <s> it has been pointed out by more than one noble lord that what is not contained in paragraph f could well be contained in g <e> <s> that authorises the secretary of state to do anything whatsoever which appears to him to be calculated to facilitate etc <e> <s> it will be recalled that at the committee stage i sought to delete this <e> <s> i did not succeed but since there is a link between the two will the noble lord look at the two linked paragraphs and come back with what he thinks is best <e> <s> this would give the opportunity for noble lords themselves to decide what is best <e> <s> can the minister give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords under the circumstances and with the assurances that have been given by the minister i think it is best to leave it to him to return later provided that in doing so he takes into consideration the views that have been expressed by your lordships house which the minister will understand have been extremely critical <e> <s> if he comes back with something very similar to what is down now he will have a hard time <e> <s> i think all of us genuinely want to get it right and to secure agreement <e> <s> with the assurances of the minister i shall not press my amendment <e> <s> however it may be quite a different matter for those movers of amendments to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the noble lord lord trafford and the course of action that i think he has in mind i wish to make two points <e> <s> the first relates to the linkage between paragraphs f and g which he quite rightly suggested <e> <s> in one of my too frequent interventions at the close of the debate on the previous amendment i sought to get an assurance from the minister that he would look at paragraph g <e> <s> he was quite right to tell me that we were only debating an amendment which touched on paragraph f <e> <s> however we are now debating an amendment which touches on paragraph g <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend who has tabled this amendment <e> <s> he has behind him a lifetime of commitment to his local hospitals as indeed has the noble lord lord auckland <e> <s> that would also apply to many noble lords in all parts of the house <e> <s> i should like to go a little further than the noble lord because this is not just a question of television sets sofas and other small items important though they are <e> <s> increasingly friends are involved in helping to raise money for much larger equipment such as scanners <e> <s> although they themselves cannot shoulder the responsibility for such equipment nevertheless they help with it in part <e> <s> one cannot make a contribution towards anything unless the presence of voluntary organisations whether they are friends or other types of organisation are taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the same view as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> at present it is a very rigid rule <e> <s> i entirely agree with the argument that has been made by my noble friend lord pitt <e> <s> he is not trying to undermine the basis of this retirement concept but to ensure that it would not be against the law for someone over the age of to have a role but not as a principal <e> <s> i think that that is perfectly right <e> <s> i did not know how he would manage to put forward this proposal <e> <s> he has found a very ingenious method without weakening the argument <e> <s> i very much hope that the minister will feel able to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also say thank you <e> <s> i remember that it was a year or possibly two years ago or maybe both one year and two years ago that i criticised ministers because they did not seem to take any notice of what went on in this place <e> <s> we argue amendments with total conviction and consummate skill and ministers do not seem to take any notice <e> <s> this is a good example of being proved wrong <e> <s> my sadness is that the minister proves us wrong with his farewell and goodbye appearance here <e> <s> i believe he is now justified in staying to do his job in health as well as in social security for at least two and a half or three more years <e> <s> however we are not to have it <e> <s> we thank him for what we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not disagree with the proposal made by the noble lord <e> <s> i understand from what he said that he is doing so because of the important victory achieved in the last debate in relation to charges and that it confirms the fact that the government are happy to leave judgment on that issue to your lordships <e> <s> thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords there are times when i am glad that the noble lord accepts the conclusions of the house <e> <s> however there are times when i believe that he should fight a little harder for that which is good proper right fair and true <e> <s> i am a little disappointed that he is satisfied with the bill as it now stands and as it is intended to pass it another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would not be missing too much <e>", "<cs> my lords under the circumstances since the minister wishes to have more time i will not proceed to move manuscript amendment no <e> <s> a now <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason to object <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he has said but all this has been dealt with at a cracking pace <e> <s> i am not referring merely to the noble lords speech but to the whole matter which has suddenly come before us leaving us two days in which to consider it and here we are now discussing it <e> <s> in principle i am not happy that we should have new clauses presented to us with so little notice <e> <s> therefore i am all the more grateful to the noble lord for having set out in some detail the reasons behind the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister answers that i was not sure of his answer to my question about what exceptions he would envisage under subsection a of the new clause that is who will be allowed to continue selling the hiv testing kits and to whom they will be able to sell them <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has just given a very important assurance that if we draw his attention to situations where we feel that there is a failure to communicate effectively with an overemphasis on secrecy rather than public knowledge he will seek to do something about them <e> <s> he will not be surprised that i was a little disappointed in his reply <e> <s> he anticipated one point that i would make that since the government had been given six months for consideration i thought it was fair that that line could have been used for that as well as for other things <e> <s> it seems to me that if a health and medicines bill is going through parliament one should do as quite clearly the government have done with the rush of new clauses in the past few minutes or days <e> <s> i put it that way to be fair <e> <s> when there are things that the government think should be done if there is a vehicle for doing them if the government think it important they should use that vehicle <e> <s> if they do not think it is important they do not use that vehicle <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting that i should like to thank the minister <e> <s> the fact that we are finishing just about on the dot of when we planned is because the minister was so reasonable earlier in the debate and did not force us to go tramping our way through the division lobbies which none of us likes doing unless we are forced into it <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the ministers reminder that this is not a fund for compensation is he aware that about cases for compensation are being prepared for court hearings <e> <s> is he also aware that it is immensely time-consuming and costly that some of the cases concern people who contracted aids several years ago and that in some cases the court hearings are being undertaken by widows because the victims have died <e> <s> is this not the most compelling possible case for the introduction of some form of no-fault liability <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word <e>", "<cs> my lords if the intervention by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding is about courtesy i have already written to the noble lord in a conciliatory sense in advance of question time today <e> <s> if the question raised by the noble lord is about what actually happened in i am happy to justify precisely what i said yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the point made by the noble baroness will the minister broadly accept that across the political spectrum and within the statutory and voluntary organisations there is a consensus that the proposals of sir roy griffiths are about right <e> <s> does he further accept that the main organisations involved with community care recognise that there is a growing crisis in providing the services needed by some of the most vulnerable people in our society <e> <s> finally will he accept that some of the concerns are now turning into anger that for so long the government have refused to give a lead <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i welcome the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord offered the amendment in the discussion which he kindly had with a number of peers from all sides of the house who had taken part in the debate on report <e> <s> we did not feel that it took us much further <e> <s> as he will know a further amendment was tabled which might well have proceeded to a division today had not amendment no <e> <s> been tabled at which we shall look later <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him also to send the letter to the association of university teachers which has shown very great interest and a great deal of concern <e> <s> if they receive reassurance whatever the letter says they will appreciate that just as much as the vice-chancellors <e>", "<cs> my lords just for the record i totally accept the ministers amendment <e> <s> i think that it is an absolute and complete fulfilment of the pledge that he gave and under those circumstances it is almost churlish to start making representations about it <e> <s> i am glad it is there and will be in the bill and the noble lord lord wallace is to be congratulated as well as the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has made an overwhelming case and a very convincing one <e> <s> i am only sorry that the second speaker on the amendment is not the noble earl lord halsbury who certainly on report spoke with great vigour and conviction <e> <s> it would have been helpful for your lordships house to hear his speech today <e> <s> however the noble earl unfortunately has a medical appointment which keeps him away <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no sense that there has been any waste of time on this nexus of issues either in the debate on report or in the debate today because we have achieved a number of things <e> <s> the first is the amendment moved earlier by the minister <e>

assurances that he gave in reply to the debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that we have gained a great deal is a matter of some satisfaction to those who have been concerned about certain aspects of the bill <e> <s> it is a significant victory although no votes have been won <e> <s> it is a mistake to assume that a victory is won only when it is won in the division lobbies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord hesketh for what he said and for the amendment <e> <s> i consider that it completely meets the points that i raised and also the concerns of the british medical association <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i am very happy to see this amendment go through <e>", "<cs> my lords when this bill came before the house on second reading i did not welcome it <e> <s> i do not believe that it has very much to do with the objectives set out by the noble lord a few minutes ago <e> <s> however i believe that the bill has been greatly improved at its various stages or to put it another way there has been a good deal of damage limitation as a result of the wisdom of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> does it mean that the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister look into this matter carefully <e> <s> i gave him the date of the very full report <e> <s> unless the minister can correct me i understand that the report has not been challenged by the department <e> <s> it indicated a subtantial increase <e> <s> will he check the report so that members of your lordships house and i may know and press a further question on the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be prepared to put into the library the full statistical details which he gave us in his answer to my question <e> <s> clearly there is a misunderstanding of the published figures <e> <s> secondly will he check on the figures that were given by the noble baroness in relation to the period between and years ago <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will check <e> <s> she may see that those figures are absolutely incorrect because i know them to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a misunderstanding <e> <s> i asked whether the minister would put the figures that he quoted to me from his department in the library for reference <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that beds in hospices are quite inadequate in view of the steady increase in the number of aids cases and deaths due to aids <e> <s> is he satisfied that some hospices receive no help at all from national health service funds <e> <s> in view of the urgency of this matter will he ask his right honourable friend to take some initiative in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question that i put to him <e> <s> i asked him whether he was satisfied with the situation in which such a high proportion of hospices receive no financial assistance although many of them have asked for it <e> <s> will he raise this matter with his right honourable friend in order to give some sense of urgency to the provision of hospices especially in view of the growing number of aids cases <e>", "<cs> my

hunter who like the noble lord lord cullen speaks with great authority on these issues <e> <s> i was however disappointed in the assurance given by the noble lord the leader of the house and i should not imagine that what he had to say could satisfy the concerns of those who are facing a difficult issue this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords as it seems that no other lord wants to take part i shall briefly reply <e> <s> the noble lord said that this issue had been debated several times before <e> <s> yes i said that but it has never been voted on before <e> <s> that is because in your wisdom your lordships have always sought to protect the whole population from these new charges <e>", "<cs> yes i certainly do <e> <s> i do not think that pensioners would respect us much if they thought that even in your lordships house we were playing politics with their interests <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say to what extent the current shortage of nurses could be met by a bigger influx of auxiliaries <e> <s> does he also accept that inadequate pay of auxiliary nurses is one factor which mitigates against the enrolment of nurses at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first as other noble lords have done to express my warm thanks to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale not only for chairing the committee but also for presenting the report and for opening an extremely important and valuable debate this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to thank those noble lords who served on the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the number of homeless people has increased dramatically in recent times to what is probably a record level <e> <s> is he further aware that there is increasing evidence that many of the homeless are people who have been in hospitals for the mentally handicapped or who have been discharged from psychiatric hospitals and are homeless because there is inadequate community care <e> <s> do not those two facts add a sense of urgency for the government to respond to the griffiths recommendations as has been repeated time and time again from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble lord lord winstanley and

skelmersdale is back in his place <e> <s> i hope that we shall not continue to have these fleeting visits <e> <s> we should like to see him more and more sitting there to answer our questions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether this was one of the cases on which the health and safety executive made a report <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is one of the questions that the noble lord nearly asked <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a debate of high quality and happily entirely on non-party lines <e> <s> that augers well for the remaining stages of this important bill <e> <s> it is a great relief to me that we are not arguing across the house but that all of us are arguing in the interests of children <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept that uncertainty is not a good reason for taking the wrong decision <e> <s> does he further accept that there is tremendous opposition in westminster and that includes a petition bearing the signatures of over people to this proposal for the closure of four hospitals including the major hospitals of westminster and westminster childrens which are internationally famous <e> <s> moreover does he accept that there is tremendous opposition to the proposal to move to a thoroughly unsatisfactory and indeed dangerous site for those wishing to have emergency treatment in what would be a very large hospital <e> <s> who in fact supports this unwanted unsatisfactory and expensive project <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very powerful debate <e> <s> it was opened by my noble friend lord carter to whom we are all grateful for his lucid case <e> <s> we have also had some very moving speeches in the course of this quite short debate particularly from the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark the noble countess

the situation existing now in our society <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give some idea of when we are likely to have a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that on wednesday of last week the chief medical officer sir donald acheson gave evidence before the select committee examining this question <e> <s> he said that the public health laboratory service had been correct in using the term epidemic to describe the increase in reported cases of salmonella due to contamination either of carcases or of eggs <e> <s> is she satisfied that by now her department and the department of health are speaking with one voice <e> <s> it does not seem like it <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that up to per cent <e> <s> of district health authorities

down these proposals for a reduction <e> <s> if so will he accept from me our grateful thanks <e> <s> will he go further and ensure that the family planning services are not reduced as it is now proposed they should be <e> <s> will he take a firm stand not just on behalf of the family planning association and its requests but of all of us who are concerned about this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware or is his right honourable friend the secretary of state for health aware that there is a good deal of concern about these unsolicited unwanted and sometimes unwelcome visits from sales representatives <e> <s> such visits can sometimes be quite oppressive for the elderly when they are confronted in their homes <e> <s> will the government consider whether some of the proposals for changes in the hearing aid council which are contained in a private members bill in another place might not make the sort of improvements that have been referred to by the noble lord lord campbell <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the inquiry of mr john spokes dealt with the urgency of improving the quality of community care on which sir roy griffiths has made important recommendations is it not now a very serious matter that the government are still refusing to give any lead either to the authorities or to the public on this patently serious and sometimes tragic issue <e> <s> will the minister give an assurance that at least by the time the presentation is made on tuesday there will be a statement about the griffiths report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for having filled the gap <e> <s> what he had to say was most relevant and provided a useful way of bringing this debate to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> what is proposed as he accepted in his last paragraph is a massive shake-up of a fine service that has suffered in the past from too little money and too many ill-conceived reorganisations at the hands of successive conservative governments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may endorse the congratulations and tribute to the noble lord <e> <s> accepting that there is always a possibility however small that a doctor may make an error of judgment which causes damage to a patient and that insurance is an absolute necessity would it not be far more equitable to introduce a system of no-fault liability <e> <s> i should have thought that that would be fairer both to patients and to the medical profession <e> <s> knowing that the government have their doubts about that perhaps it could be an issue for discussion on the white paper which was published yesterday prior to legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to repeat what has been said by other noble lords in thanking the noble baroness for the way in which she introduced the debate <e> <s> i often find myself profoundly disagreeing with many of the things which she says in the house but every time she rises to talk about nursing i agree with her <e> <s> i think that she made an outstanding speech <e> <s> i do not agree with the conclusions of the rcn about the griffiths report but i profoundly agree there must be a decision <e> <s> however i shall say a word about that in a moment <e> <s> the noble baroness timed the debate very well partly because of our feeling about the griffiths report but also because it comes just after the release of the governments white paper on the new proposals for the national health service <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a serious issue behind the question put by my noble friend <e> <s> is it not disturbing that there have been many ministerial appointments from the conservative party to the national health service in recent times <e> <s> does the noble earl understand the suspicion that some people have that it could be designed to assist in pushing through the extremely controversial proposals for reorganisation which we are debating later today <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the many occasions when your lordships house has had good reason to be grateful to the noble lord lord hunter for facilitating a crucial debate at a crucial time <e> <s> his decision to initiate the debate may well have accelerated the publication of the eight working papers although they have done very little to clarify most of the fundamental questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer that the noble lord gave was that the government were proceeding quickly in the interests of

involved in the national health service the professionals the patients and the community organisations have an opportunity of seeing that if <e>", "<cs> it is not rubbish <e> <s> the proposals will increase the bureaucratic proportion of the costs of <e>", "<cs> no just consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the important question who within a hospital actually decides to opt out <e>", "<cs> my lords first i congratulate my noble friend on having achieved the third reading of this bill <e> <s> i congratulate the government for not having raised difficulties which would have meant that the bill did not proceed to another place <e> <s> i consider it to be very satisfactory that your lordships have passed a bill which is very necessary

extremely interesting debate <e> <s> despite disagreements across the floor of the house certainly not on party lines there has been a call for legislation <e> <s> everyone feels that the present situation of a voluntary licensing system is not enough <e> <s> i believe that it is true that the scientists who are working in this field are as strongly in favour of legislation to govern control and manage the work that is being done as has been expressed by noble lords on both sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise very much with the point made by the noble lord lord renton that this should be a project which deals with mental handicap as well as physical handicap <e> <s> i also wish to express my support to the minister for his indication not only of support for the secretariat but also of the willingness of the government to consider supporting particular projects when they are brought to the attention of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that the site of the new westminster and chelsea hospital to replace westminster st stephens and three other london hospitals is so overcrowded that it will not provide adequate parking for patients and staff when one considers the size of the hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am most grateful <e> <s> one of the reasons why i nodded in agreement with him was that he had to take that action in order to put right the tremendous increase in quangos created by his predecessor as secretary of state the noble lord lord joseph

lords does the noble lord accept that the first two organisations that he mentioned supported some parts of the proposals but have been generally critical of them <e> <s> would it not be profoundly unwise for the government to ride roughshod over the strongly held views of people who work daily in the national health service <e> <s> does he recognise that there is a massive amount of opinion against the proposals which are thought will cause grave damage <e> <s> would it not make sense to give a longer period of consultation so that views can be considered genuinely rather than the question just being about the implementation of what the government have decided <e> <s> is that the way to govern the country or the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the criticisms that have been made of the bma which do not seem to promote good relations apply also to the royal colleges which have been strong in their condemnation of the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in the disabled persons act an assurance was given and a statutory requirement was made for there to be proper planning for people discharged from psychiatric hospitals <e> <s> will he give an absolute assurance that those obligations will be carried out before patients are discharged from hospital into a community which seems not to care for them and to leave them destitute on the streets <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that that is not happening <e> <s> it was because it was not happening that the former secretary of state for social services mr norman fowler asked sir roy griffiths to produce a report <e> <s> does not the minister realise that the department is heading into absolute chaos as regards these tragic people <e>",

patients who are waiting for treatment as a direct result of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that waiting lists now seem to be averaging a year <e> <s> the number is far higher than the average experienced by the previous administration which after all was years ago <e> <s> will he now say what in the white paper will help to reduce this problem of pain for such a large number of people <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was about patients and not about money <e> <s> does the noble lord not accept that it was about patients getting into operating theatres <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that yesterday was the closing date for hospitals to indicate their wish to opt out or whatever phrase he wishes to use <e> <s> will he also explain how decisions on opting out or whatever other term he likes to use will be taken to ensure that the wishes of the community are met rather than those of some small special interest group <e> <s> will there be some sort of workplace ballot or some other procedure enabling people to express their views on whether opting out is a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how these views will be assessed

professional register last year and the fall of per cent <e> <s> in those entering nursing training besides the fall in the total number of nurses employed in the national health service the first time for many years that the figure has actually decreased does he not agree that we are facing a real crisis in nursing manpower at the present time <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the nursing organisations including the royal college of nursing are very dissatisfied with the governments response despite what the minister has said <e> <s> what is the use of appointing an extra consultants

the terms in which it was moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> my own view would be that of the griffiths report that the lead authority should not be the health authority but the local authority of course in collaboration with the health authority but as the lead authority <e> <s> however it is no time to argue the central issue of griffiths within the context of this bill <e> <s> the argument set forth by the noble baroness is one with which i entirely agree and thus i support the amendment that she has proposed <e>", "<cs> please do <e>", "<cs> as the minister is being so forthcoming perhaps i may follow up on the statement he made which i found of great interest but which puzzled me <e> <s> of course i welcome the fact that there will be additional guidance to go out to the health authorities which will be relevant in the context of this bill to mental after-care services for the treatment of those who are suffering or have suffered from mental illness <e> <s> i do not understand how the government will be in a position to give those guidelines until they have responded to the very specific proposals made in the griffiths report <e> <s> perhaps i can have the timing of this from the minister <e> <s> i know that he cannot say when the government will make a decision on griffiths but surely he can say that they will not publish guidelines without having done so <e>

<s> does the noble lord not recognise that this also happens the other way <e> <s> i have a very close connection with a situation in which someone diagnosed as being schizophrenic was in no way a schizophrenic <e> <s> it was later determined that his condition was something quite different which required quite different treatment <e> <s> therefore the confusion must be very substantial among doctors who really are not sure from what condition a patient is suffering <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for recognising that i said at the beginning of my remarks that i had no intention of seeking to remove the clause from the bill <e> <s> i then congratulated the noble lord and said that i hoped that the bill would go through <e> <s> i felt that the noble earl lord haig was a little unfair to me <e> <s> i made it absolutely clear in my introduction that i had wished to propose amendments but that they were not in order <e> <s> therefore my only way of stating what is a perfectly reasonable argument was by opposing the motion that clause stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord lord mottistone has said i shall not press the amendment to a

minister studied the evidence given to the government by the medical research council <e> <s> it included the statement that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not quite extraordinary after such an assurance that no person involved in research has been appointed to the management board which we were discussing earlier <e> <s> would not that have been the logical way to give some indication of government support <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it is proper for me to intervene in this marvellous debate between these two great campaigners the noble lords lord mottistone and lord northfield one of

the noble lord lord mottistone is a rugged and testy battler for the other side whichever the side is <e> <s> i feel that i am in the wrong place and i hope that the minister will help me out <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the question about the direct effect on the funds available for health authorities as a result of inflation <e> <s> will the minister say just what is the figure by which health authorities are going to be underfunded because of the higher rate of inflation <e> <s> does he accept that unless there is some replacement of those funds health authorities are bound to provide a poorer service than they had planned to do <e> <s> surely the government must do something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not quite clear that if there is a higher rate of inflation health authorities are not able to buy the same amount of services or to pay the money for the same services that they would have done if the rate of inflation had been as anticipated <e> <s> that being the case surely the department must know the figure and must have taken a decision on whether or not to replace that missing money <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much we appreciate the governments active role in connection with the campaign and alcohol concern <e> <s> bearing in mind what seems to be a national problem demonstrated by all types of drink-related violence i am also thinking about the next debate and about what sometimes goes on at football grounds committed by young people has any research been done into why young people seem to think that there is something macho about getting drunk <e>", "<cs> my lords after massive rejection by the professionals working in the national health service the electorate have now spoken <e> <s> does the minister agree that all the signs are that there is a very deep sense of public concern throughout the united kingdom about the governments proposals for the reorganisation of the national health service <e> <s> will he

lords in which case does the minister accept that he has not followed the european elections because it was a central issue in every constitutency across the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply respond to say that i am grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for meeting the points that i made in the course of our previous debate <e> <s> he has totally met my concerns and i welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i again briefly intervene to say that in the amendment which i sought to move in committee there were some major points relating to civil liberties and i am grateful to

before the house with an amendment <e> <s> i support it <e> <s> my hope is that the government will be as sensible in the whole of the bill as the noble lord lord mottistone has been in this part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that one of the images that may have influenced the way in which people voted in the european elections on thursday was the secretary of state for health refusing to co-operate in a european campaign against smoking which used frank and explicit health warnings <e> <s> may we assume that the government will be prepared to think again on this matter as well as the important taxation issue raised by the noble lord lord airedale <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that the united kingdom was once again on its own on this

these sections being undertaken in association with the current governments review on the griffiths report which we are very anxious to see published <e>", "<cs> my intervention will be brief because my noble friend lord carter and the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale stated the case <e> <s> i intervene because it was my responsibility as secretary of state to introduce the benefit <e> <s> i

evidence which has come from all parts of the country <e> <s> a report relating to north london which appeared in my local paper this weekend suggested that evidence from opticians shows a fall of

secretary of state and his ministerial colleagues so crude in their condemnation of the doctors <e> <s> if the doctors who work in the health service genuinely feel that the proposals put forward by

saying <e> <s> they have been saying it very publicly and openly <e> <s> can he suggest any reason why they should do that other than because they believe what they say <e>", "<cs> my lords up to now the system of justice has weighed heavily against the plaintiffs <e> <s> it is to be welcomed that an initiative is now being considered <e> <s> perhaps i may ask two questions of the noble lord <e>

group of people who are dedicated skilled professionals but at the same time very low paid <e> <s> why does the minister not seek a settlement rather than confrontation <e> <s> why does he not seek arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not most unfair of the minister to refer to strike action <e> <s> no strike action is being taken by these men <e> <s> is it not also most unfair of him to suggest that any ambulance workers have <e>", "<cs> my lords my question concerned a report commissioned two years ago which was received in the department in august and which i hope will be published <e> <s> will the minister give an explanation as to why there is a discrepancy between assurances given during the passage through this house of the bill of my noble friend lord rea that the situation of overworked junior hospital doctors was improving and the reports finding which the noble baroness will see when she reads it that five hours extra per week are worked particularly by casualty doctors and obstetricians <e>", "<cs> my lords in the view of the interest shown by your lordships house as demonstrated by the bill which passed through it does the minister not agree that that information should be made public and that it is not something which the department should keep to itself <e> <s> does she not agree that this issue concerns the public who will wish to be informed about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave notice to the ministers office that i intended to ask the question because i was anxious that we should know whether or not we were to have a further debate on the issue <e> <s> not to worry <e> <s> i shall not go in detail at this stage into the errors that have been drawn to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords in conclusion perhaps i may thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i should also like to express my thanks to the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i shall make but three brief comments <e> <s> first it is noticeable that except for the noble and loyal baroness lady elliot there has been no presence on the back benches to support the minister <e> <s> that is a sad situation <e> <s> she must have felt very lonely <e> <s> and it is perhaps a precursor of the debates which will follow in the next few months <e> <s> however i know and understand that the noble baroness feels happy with her front bench support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> the figures were certainly published in some form and were quoted by his honourable friend mr mellor in another place <e> <s> will the minister confirm that the total number of patients awaiting treatment in march was that is the worst figure for six years and that there was a fall in the number of patients treated and the number of beds available on that date <e> <s> why does the performance in those respects appear to be getting worse within the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why his honourable friend mr mellor made comments and referred to certain statistics <e> <s> he said that the latest statistics are impressive by anyones standards <e> <s> can the minister explain why he does not have the same figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the number of out-patients treated fell for the first time in years and the number treated as day cases is more than per cent <e> <s> lower than in the previous annual figures <e> <s> i know that the minister said that he does not have the figures but they are published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords until this year <e>", "<cs> my lords since the minister has raised the question of the ambulance service has he a statement to make concerning any action that may be taken by the secretary of state in the light of the initiative taken by the ambulancemen over the weekend <e> <s> it would be very encouraging for all those who are extremely concerned at the present basis of cover <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall bear in mind what the noble lord the leader of the house has just said <e> <s> however since this white paper has not been published and since parliament prorogues on thursday what are we to assume from his reply <e> <s> are we to assume that the white paper will be published some time after the loyal address <e> <s> if that is to be the case can he give us a guarantee that there will be an opportunity for consultation on the white paper before a bill is presented to the house <e> <s> further will there be opportunity for a debate in this chamber which is customary procedure after a white paper is published or are we suddenly to receive a bill following the publication of a white paper which no one has had any opportunity of considering <e> <s> will the noble lord kindly clarify the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extraordinarily wide ranging debate and we have had a prime example of what this house can best offer <e> <s> it brings together people of remarkable experience who are able to exchange their views <e> <s> today we have brought together meat for at least well informed debates <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although i very much welcome the additional payment that has now been offered i am concerned that the macfarlane trust said over the weekend that the government had put it in an impossible position <e> <s> i am very glad that talks are to take place <e> <s> can the minister give an assurance that the full amount of million which is what is required will be made available <e> <s> secondly can the money be made available before christmas <e> <s> that is the least that the trust would want <e>", "<cs> my lords before christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain why she is answering the question at all <e> <s> does not the decision taken last year to end free sight tests throw the whole issue into the free market with profits and prices replacing questions of health for millions of members of our population <e> <s> does not the real question concern the information about the heavy fall in eye examinations with the consequent failure to diagnose and treat eye complaints such as glaucoma <e> <s> does the minister now feel able to give information about that survey <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if i were to put a question about the comparable prices of washing liquid or garden furniture some minister would answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are once again indebted to the noble lord lord hunter for giving us an opportunity to air our concerns and uncertainties including todays report that three-quarters of all health authorities are heading for a deficit this year with further cuts in services <e> <s> despite the fact that the bill begins its process in another place it is important that the house feels itself to be involved in the debates about the bill <e> <s> i am sure that we have an importan role to play <e> <s> although the bill is in another place the issues are ones upon which we can concentrate today <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean therefore that the health authority can require of the trust that it provides those services <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the whole house will want me to express thanks to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his lucid presentation of the bill <e> <s> it was eminently fair and balanced and the advice that he gave to the house was sound and temperate <e> <s> i share with him sadness that lord trafford is not with us to take the part that he would have taken in the bill and i pay tribute to the noble baroness lady warnock whose work years ago is the basis of what we discuss today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> would she at least consider with her right honourable friend whether it could possibly be done by an amendment to the long title <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may declare an interest as president of the tibetsociety and president of the all-party parliamentary group on tibet <e> <s> but far beyond that i think that all of us would wish to thank the noble viscount for not only a courageous but i thought a brilliant presentation of the tibetan case <e> <s> he could not have timed his presentation to your lordships house better than now so soon after his holiness the dalai lama received the nobel peace prize <e>", "<cs> my lords that is disgraceful <e>", "<cs> my lords six thousand were destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give some example of a concrete step that has been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down did i really hear him aright <e> <s> did he say that if the nobel peace prize winner his holiness the dalai lama should come to london as the noble lord the minister said he had every right to do he will not be received by a british minister <e> <s> did the noble lord really say that <e>", "<cs> my lords all too often when one winds up a debate one realises that the notes that one had prepared before the debate started were quite inappropriate to use at the termination of the debate <e> <s> while i agree with a number of the points made by the noble lord lord mcgregor i take the view that those who take a point of view different from me in whatever party they may be mine or others do so with a sincerity no less than mine <e> <s> i expect that they will treat me in precisely that way <e> <s> i may think that they are wrong and they may think that i am wrong but we take part in a debate as civilised human beings <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the studies to which she referred include the new cases of aids which obviously make a difference to the situation <e> <s> i imagine that they would do so <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may assist the minister on that point <e> <s> bearing in mind the fact that according to the departments own figures the number of available hospital beds has actually been reduced i repeat reduced during the past years by per cent <e> <s> can the minister explain how all the new hospital projects to which she referred have created a situation in which last year there was a significant fall in the number of in-patients treated a significant fall in the number of day patients treated and a significant fall in the staff caring for such patients <e> <s> therefore i ask what sort of success story is that <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to greater efficiency <e> <s> is it really greater efficiency if we decrease the number of patients but if we increase the waiting period for those patients and we even decrease the number of patients on day treatment as well as those undergoing in-patient treatment <e> <s> how can one possibly call that increasing efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept the estimate given by the national association of health authorities in england and wales that health authorities need each year funds which are per cent <e> <s> above inflation in order to achieve even a modest increase in services and particularly services for the growing numbers of the elderly <e> <s> does the minister further accept that current estimates of inflation were set at per cent <e> <s> and that that is now totally unrealistic <e> <s> does the minister therefore accept that the figure of per cent <e> <s> is a much more realistic estimate on which the health service has to operate <e> <s> if that is the case is not the noble lord lord alport right that the likelihood is that we shall once again see closures of wards beds and operating theatres during the course of the next few months unless some more money is provided <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that over the past years every year has shown a higher figure for health expenditure than ever before <e> <s> there is nothing exceptional about having the highest figure ever <e> <s> that is the case every year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy that in the last exchange that we shall have before christmas there is no basis upon which the minister and i will disagree <e> <s> i warmly welcome the decisions that have been taken for the census and the competent and clear way in which the minister explained the order to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept with his greater knowledge that nowadays people are more willing to admit they are black even if their pigmentation is not very dark than was the case in the past <e> <s> is there not some difficulty in being able to make comparisons when the politics of the situation mean that one may be more willing to admit to being black now whereas years ago one would have said one was dark pink or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the christmas spirit abounds and i warmly welcome the ministers presentation and the regulations before us <e> <s> however i am slightly quizzical and cannot be totally complimentary <e> <s> i remember that when the government came to office years ago there was a marvellous campaign slogan saying that they would get rid of all the quangos <e> <s> i suspect i might put down a written question after christmas about this that we now have far more quangos than we did years ago <e> <s> we are always setting up new ones <e> <s> the idea that we should call this authority ultra is intolerable <e> <s> there should be a regulation stating that in future no one should refer to it as ultra <e> <s> ultra is obviously a tory word and i would not serve on an organisation of that name <e> <s> so i plead with the minister to think of some better way of referring to a body which has such a responsible task <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was not on taking decisions but whether it could consider and make recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put two questions to the noble baroness <e> <s> first is she aware that on th november peers and cross-benchers wrote to the secretary of state about the ambulance dispute <e> <s> they were all people who had had great experience with the national health service <e> <s> it took him five weeks to answer <e> <s> he then said that he would not receive a deputation <e> <s> was that not rather discourteous <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the staff of the red army is now being cut but perhaps that is not relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords that is spending more on fewer patients is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disturbed that the noble baroness did not reply to the question from the noble baroness lady robson <e> <s> is it really true that another place is now considering the national health service and community care bill without <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a rare privilege for me to be able to speak in this house on a subject other than health <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend on the front bench for permitting it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bonham-carter for introducing the debate and grateful too to the foreign secretary for having invited me together with timothy raison to go to vietnam and submit a report on the boat people <e> <s> my main contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin as others have done by congratulating the noble baroness on the first occasion on which she has replied to a debate <e> <s> we always say on these occasions and we hope that she shall do so many times <e> <s> that will depend upon what she says <e> <s> having seen the noble baroness at work i have great confidence that i shall want to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been higher spending on the nhs every year for the past years <e> <s> will the minister report on the success or otherwise of the special cash initiative of which was designed to reduce the appalling length of waiting lists <e> <s> will she confirm a statement made by the general secretary of the national association of health authorities that many health authorities are now using that money to prevent making the service cuts necessary due to funding problems <e> <s> secondly will she confirm that the latest figures from her department show that in march last year there was an increase of in the number of patients awaiting surgery compared with when the initiative was launched <e> <s> the figures have gone up not down <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness help me because the figures that i have received from her department show that the number of people waiting for more than a year rose from to in the year ended march last which are the latest figures that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that we are totally dependent upon one supplier for this vitally important programme for the health of children <e> <s> do we in britain supply other countries from that supplier <e> <s> is it wise to be dependent upon one supplier for a programme as important as this whether or not other countries are also dependent upon us <e> <s> our own schoolchildren depend upon this vaccine <e> <s> the noble baroness herself knows the importance of the programme <e> <s> i am glad that she gave us the date for the autumn <e> <s> but is it not very unwise to be dependent upon one producer <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean not only that there was a delay of a year in availability of supplies in britain but also as a consequence a similar delay in other countries where the incidence of tuberculosis is very much higher than here <e>", "<cs> my lords as there are other world suppliers why did we not turn to them immediately <e>", "<cs> since this is the first intervention which i make in this debate i should say that i shall be speaking in a personal capacity <e> <s> that saves me repeating myself on every intervention which i make <e> <s> speaking from this front bench i am speaking for myself <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the spirit in which the noble baroness moved the amendment <e> <s> what she said about the mood of the debate was absolutely right <e> <s> if someone has used the word wrecking it certainly is not anyone i know <e> <s> we are grateful both to the noble baroness for raising the issue and to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for saying that the time for us to look at this matter will be after we have debated clause which calls for the major decision and before we move to report stage <e> <s> secondly i very much appreciate the fair and balanced way in which both at second reading and today the lord chancellor presented the case <e> <s> all sides of the committee will appreciate the way in which he did so <e>", "<cs> if it is any reassurance to the noble and learned lord i agree with every word he said <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what lies behind the amendment moved by the noble lady but i am very unhappy and i hope that the committee will not go down what i think is a disturbing road <e> <s> i believe myself to be a family man sharing family values <e> <s> i do not think it is my responsibility to tell other people what they should do <e> <s> having children is a private area of human affairs <e> <s> i believe that it is really not for the state to decide who should or should not be allowed to bear children <e>", "<cs> the noble lady made that point but i was not quite certain of the significance of that statement <e> <s> often a couple who are living together not necessarily in wedlock but cohabiting have as great a need for children to bind them together and create a family as an adoptive family <e> <s> many of the judgments that have been made support that view <e> <s> in any case there is no reason why a single mother should not subsequently marry and allow her child to gain a father whereas if she delays having a child until she has found her lifelong partner it may be biologically too late for her to have a child <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that all the arguments he has put forward are arguments against the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to the plea for the government to give an assurance that they will consider the matter between now and report stage <e> <s> a powerful argument was put forward by the noble lord lord walton <e> <s> i hope it will be responded to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that in my view the noble baroness has got the position absolutely right <e> <s> it was only proper that the issue should be raised because there is some concern in this connection <e> <s> however i do not think that the secretary of state should have such a power injected into the bill at this stage <e> <s> the responsibility must lie with the licensing authority and obviously guidelines would be the best way to deal with the matter <e> <s> i am certain that members of the authority would not wish to see the kind of abuse to which the noble lord lord robertson referred take place <e>", "<cs> the issue of the value of the hamster test shortly put has already been debated <e> <s> various concerns were expressed and by a substantial majority of two to one the matter was decided <e> <s> these tests have been carried out for the past years without at least so far as i know protest from any side of the chamber or from elsewhere <e> <s> i suppose some people may say that part of the horror is the use of animals in research <e> <s> however we have recognised that this is a test which has substantial backing which has a considerable effect and which if it had been abolished although fortunately the amendment was not carried would have led to most unfortunate consequences for those people suffering from infertility namely one in of the population <e>", "<cs> i had more sympathy with the previous amendment than i have with this one <e> <s> whoever is appointed must administer the law <e> <s> if someone wanted to go outside the law namely beyond days they should not be appointed <e> <s> to require that there should be a balance and that for example half the members should disagree with the legislation is rather like saying that half the members of a health authority should not support the national health service or that per cent <e> <s> of the church commissioners should be atheists <e> <s> if we want the job to be done properly such a limitation rather than a broad spread of membership as suggested in the previous amendment would be very unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to be a change for the worse <e> <s> i cannot see how a change for the worse could be recommended <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that there is growing concern among many organisations about among other things the cleaning point raised by the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> one organisation told me that those who have had a home help for some time have had the number of hours reduced or the home help discontinued and those who now apply for a home help are either refused or are not given the help that they identify <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that this is a matter for her department <e> <s> does she recognise the strength of concern throughout the house <e> <s> will she discuss the issue with her right honourable friend <e> <s> surely this is an issue for her department and its secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord harvington spoke before i did because he referred to lynne dodd <e> <s> i should say that i know this lady and i am aware of the conditons from which her child has suffered <e> <s> she is well aware of what this research is all about <e> <s> i shall not say that she is better informed than the noble lord but she is absolutely committed and dedicated in this respect <e> <s> she knows that there is no way in which her child will be helped <e> <s> her only motivation is to speak on behalf of mencap <e> <s> i should perhaps at this stage refer to the wonderful work which has been done for that organisation by certain noble lords in this chamber namely the noble lords lord renton and lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> lynne dodd supports the campaign because she does not want any unnecessary handicapped children to be born if it can be prevented <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend himself does not understand the legislation or the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord walton <e> <s> we are talking about <e>", "<cs> with respect perhaps i may answer the question which my noble friend has put to me <e> <s> there is no suggestion that after days when an individual or the beginnings of an individual has been created that should be destroyed <e> <s> the most reverend primate has explained it well <e> <s> during this period there is a brief time when it cannot be said this is a person a human being with identifiable characteristics <e>", "<cs> what are the fears of the right reverend prelate as to where the noble lord lord walton is likely to take us <e> <s> what is this slippery slope <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment moved by the noble duke the duke of norfolk <e> <s> if the secretary of state is to have the power which the bill now says the authority shall have it will totally undermine the role of the authority <e> <s> i believe that it would do great damage to the concept of the bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble duke will not proceed with the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to hear what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has to say <e> <s> we cannot possibly ensure that an embryo will survive if placed in a woman <e> <s> i do not know why the noble duke thought that one could provide any such guaranteee so i hope that he will not press the amendment <e> <s> however i am anxious to hear what the noble and learned lord has to say <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask the noble baroness whether it could relate to things like temperature or <e>", "<cs> i think the provision in the bill is necessary <e> <s> it certainly should remain and not be deleted <e> <s> it is important <e> <s> if we are to place confidence in the authority that is what we intend to do and the secretary of state is to determine who will be on it and we are satisfied that it is a responsible body it is important that there should be a degree of flexibility <e> <s> we do not want the authority to say there is something which does not fall absolutely within the terms of the headings a to f but which needs to be done as regards treatment <e> <s> to deny that kind of flexibility in the area of research which will lead to certain forms of treatment is wrong <e> <s> i hope the amendment will not be passed <e>", "<cs> i was arguing the case on an earlier amendment for having some flexibility <e> <s> if we set up a statutory body in which we have confidence with people whom we trust but hedge it around with limitations on what it can do and we are here setting out what it may or may not do it is important that it should have some flexibility <e> <s> i suppose that we could have added a rounded term such as such other activity as might be in the public good or what have you <e> <s> it is perfectly clear as my noble friend lord houghton said that it is important to have an improved contraceptive and this seems to me to be the right body to approve research in this field <e> <s> i should therefore be very happy if the matter were to be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> we are all grateful to the noble duke for saying that he will place a copy of this in the library <e> <s> i have not seen those figures and therefore took at face value the summary given by the noble duke <e> <s> i wish to ask him to place all the figures including those quoted by the noble viscount in the library <e>", "<cs> we cannot hear <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly say that i absolutely agree with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i should be very concerned if he moved an inch in terms of writing anything on to a birth certificate which would give some indication concerning the actual nature of the birth <e> <s> the child is born as the child of those parents and anything which is sought to distinguish that child in any way at all could be very derogatory to the future of the child <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for withstanding any pressure <e>", "<cs> and a good contribution it was <e>", "<cs> i must confess to being very disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> in the course of the debate she has given some able replies <e> <s> by able replies i mean those replies with which i agree <e> <s> in this case i found myself profoundly dissatisfied so it was not an able reply <e>", "<cs> can the minister give us any figures in that respect <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister needs time to bring forward the answers to my questions <e> <s> i do not think that the committee can be expected to take a decision on the matter when she is not prepared to say what sort of sum of money the government are expecting to pay to the licensing authority what sum of money the clinics are expected to pay as regards a licence or how this is likely to fall upon patients <e> <s> i hope therefore that between now and the report stage the minister will make those inquiries so that we may have a debate with adequate information to enable us to take a decision on the matter <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e>", "<cs> without saying a word for or against the amendment as the noble lady who moved it referred to the mental health act and as the noble lord lord mottistone who raised the issue a few weeks ago knows perhaps we may put on record the fact that it took from to to produce a satisfactory code of practice which was then debated and approved by both houses <e> <s> i hope that it will not take seven years for the operation to be completed <e> <s> it should be said and i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will confirm <e>", "<cs> it had not been my intention to rise before the noble and learned lord

similar amendments to the family law reform bill <e> <s> however i have been a little disturbed by the trend of the debate so far and i wanted it to be known that there are at least some who are very strongly opposed to the amendments put forward and the concepts <e>", "<cs> when we come to legislate we always have to balance one argument against another and of course the medical argument is one of them <e> <s> i believe that the social argument against doing this is very much more powerful <e> <s> it is not for us as legislators to tell parents what they should tell their children <e> <s> i believe it is for parents to decide what they should tell their children <e> <s> in many cases at a certain stage a mother may say to the child i want you to know the circumstances and how it was that mummy and daddy just were not able to produce you without a little bit of help from elsewhere <e> <s> the parents might feel they wanted to tell the child that but i do not think they would ever want to add and mr so-and-so was the man from whom we managed to get the little bit of sperm that did the trick <e>", "<cs> if i may just respond to that point immediately and then sit down these are matters for decision by parents <e> <s> that is the argument i am putting forward <e> <s> i am not saying that children should never know but i do not think it is for legislators to decide what

lord replies will he comment on what effect this provision might have on donors <e> <s> would it not be a considerable deterrent to a potential donor coming forward if there was the danger that at some stage he might be accosted and accused of the responsibility of parenthood <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount has very well made his case and i entirely support it <e> <s> if the words are not entirely appropriate the noble and learned lord will say so but i hope that the principle will be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord stallard for having raised the debate on an urgent issue <e> <s> he said that there is great respect and indeed admiration for the way in which ambulance staff do their duty and often far more than their duty <e> <s> he put the ambulance workers case fairly <e> <s> in this debate we are clearly not able to produce a solution but it gives us the opportunity as the noble lord lord rochester has done to put forward some ideas for consideration and as some of my noble friends have done to draw attention to the disgraceful way in which the ambulance workers have been treated <e>", "<cs> but this was compared with other similar times <e> <s> therefore such figures as are available suggest that there has been an increase <e> <s> when the time comes no doubt the government will give their figures to prove that that is

went through this house two years before the general election <e> <s> it was not rushed through this house at all unless your lordships wished it to be so <e>", "<cs> i was not able to take part in the debates in because i was a minister at the time <e> <s> however i gave my personal support to mr david steel <e> <s> when i became a minister of state and later secretary of state for health i thought that it was the responsibility of the secretary of state to see that the legislation was administered as fairly as possible <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> is he suggesting that the noble and learned lord lord brightman actually agrees with the amendments that he is proposing <e> <s> i am not quite certain of the drift of his argument <e>", "<cs> i greatly respect the noble earl and i liked his way of explaining the matter <e> <s> i am sorry that i intervened part of the way through his remarks <e> <s> i share with him the deep regret that the noble and learned lord lord brightman is unwell for i am certain that he would have been with us today <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> i put it on record that that is the advice that i have received from the bma <e> <s> i was interested to hear about the telephone conversation but that cannot be read into the record because there are two sides to any telephone conversation <e> <s> i simply read this into the record as the views of the bma as we know them <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i know what the views happen to be of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists the royal paediatric association the royal college of general practitioners the royal college of midwives and the british medical association about the governments nhs bill <e> <s> they are all opposed to it <e> <s> but has the secretary of state taken any notice of them <e> <s> he is not required to do so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord misunderstood me <e> <s> i know what their views are in relation to the nhs reorganisation bill because those organisations have made their views clear and the secretary of state has taken no notice whatsoever <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> i was implying that it was an intolerable burden to place on any secretary of state and particularly on a catholic secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to put two questions to the minister <e> <s> first she referred to legislation <e> <s> can she tell the house in relation to the community care part of the legislation at what stage the government will make a statement about the additional resources to be made available for the fulfilment of the obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will look again at the assurance she gave me last week <e> <s> i thought that it was fairly firm <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly say that having opposed the amendment put forward by the noble baroness lady elles in committee i am now delighted with the outcome of the exchanges <e> <s> it shows the wisdom of the intervention by the noble baroness and also the noble and learned lords own wisdom in arriving at a compromise that i hope will satisfy the whole house <e>", "<cs> my lords although i speak from this dispatch box i speak for myself and do not seek to speak on behalf of those behind me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount was kind enough to notice that i shook my head <e> <s> surely the bill already prohibits any profiteering in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is absolutely right it is a very difficult problem <e> <s> behind the remarks made by the noble lord lord walton there is a strong medical and scientific argument <e> <s> the very fact that the royal college is considering the matter at such an appropriate time will give the government and members of your lordships house an opportunity to study its advice <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will feel it is appropriate to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i take precisely the same view <e> <s> i took that view when we dealt with annual reports and i was delighted that the government accepted that amendment <e> <s> the more information that is made available to those who naturally have a sense of concern and wish to be informed the better <e> <s> i warmly welcome the amendment proposed by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may say a few words <e> <s> i greatly welcome the initiative taken by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> it adds great strength to the code of practice <e> <s> the more i think about the code of practice the more i recognise how important it will be <e> <s> as i listened to the noble and learned lord speaking on the question of who would take the decision in answer to the noble baroness lady faithfull i realised what a burden and what a difficult decision would be placed upon whoever must take that decision <e> <s> we are all concerned with the welfare of the child but perhaps some more thought is needed about what goes into the code of practice in order that it may provide additional guidance <e> <s> i do not see how that decision could be taken simply on the basis of the four words in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke at length in committee when we debated the amendment moved by the noble lady lady saltoun which would have limited the treatment to married couples <e> <s> i am glad we have not returned to that point <e> <s> i want to be brief <e> <s> if the amendment were carried it would be unenforceable <e> <s> a woman who is living on her own who may or may not be a widow or a woman who is living with another woman let us consider all the possibilities who wanted the treatment and wanted a child the issues raised in the previous amendment having been considered would not be put off by the fact that she had to bring with her a man with whom she was at that moment living <e> <s> she might rent a man <e> <s> she might bring in someone to show that that is the man with whom she is living <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for her explanation but i have to admit that i am still very puzzled <e> <s> the minister gave what appeared to be a very important assurance that there was no question of nhs patients being charged <e> <s> that means that the institutions that are licensed to provide services and treatments and indeed research would not be able to pass the cost on to nhs patients although possibly doing so in respect of private patients <e> <s> i think i hinted that we should perhaps be looking for a different type of regime <e>", "<cs> my lords that is totally different <e> <s> it is not comparable at all <e> <s> there we are dealing with large multinational pharmaceutical companies who pay their licensing authority <e> <s> they do not have a shortage of money <e> <s> they do not need to pass the cost on to their patients in the same way that in this field it has to be passed on to patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not press the amendment <e> <s> there are many difficulties but i shall mention only one or two <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow the words used by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that the matter will be brought to the attention of the licensing authority <e> <s> it will be brought to the attention of the licensing authority in the same sense as the issue had been raised not in the sense that the house had taken a view on it because other issues may come up on further amendments which might be appropriate for guidance in the code <e> <s> i should not like to think that because someone who disagrees with a point has not spoken some seal of approval has been given with regard to drawing the matter to the attention of the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the statement made by the minister <e> <s> however at a time when there is increasing evidence of inappropriate placing of people with psychiatric illness in the criminal justice system where so few treatment facilities exist how is it that first so little progress has been made by the home office in developing psychiatric bail hostels <e> <s> secondly why does the number of psychiatric probation orders seem to be going down <e> <s> that is obviously the home office side of the joint working partys recommendations <e> <s> can the minister answer those questions <e>", "<cs> my lords they cost a lot too <e>", "<cs> my lords i first thank my noble friend lord molloy for introducing the debate <e> <s> he is a great campaigner for the national health service and he should receive the credit that he deserves <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness leaves the point has she any comment to make on the morality of proceeding to implement proposals that have not even been debated in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for allowing me to intervene at this point <e> <s> i do not understand how she can say that what is proposed is not designed to privatise <e> <s> i say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say a few words to congratulate my noble friend on his achievement in piloting the bill through the house <e> <s> he is not only a doughty fighter for his convictions he is a tactician <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this amendment apply only to information which might be made available to the college of arms or the lord lyon <e> <s> it does not relate at all to the question of whether a person has access to that information from the age of onwards <e> <s> am i right <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add a brief word to what has been said by my noble friend <e> <s> this is an important amendment and i do not think that we should prescribe what competent means <e> <s> normally an inspection team consists of three people with qualifications <e> <s> i should have thought that we should have a scientist a doctor and a lay person <e> <s> each of those three is as important as the others <e> <s> probably the fourth member should be a secretary to take notes of what happens in that inspectorate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why the figures that she gave were so different from the figures given by her honourable friend mr freeman in another place on th february which showed a fall from - million examinations to - million examinations <e> <s> can she explain why there were half a million fewer examinations than before the charges were introduced <e> <s> will she also say what she thinks of the views of the dentists themselves and the bda that people are waiting until they have trouble with their teeth before going for an examination <e> <s> finally can she give an assurance that in april we shall not see a further increase in examination charges <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister really saying that the figures that were quoted in another place which showed a reduction of half a million examinations were the most recent figures although she gave different figures which showed a much smaller reduction <e> <s> why <e>", "<cs> my lords broadly speaking i support the proposals made by the noble baroness and believe they are an improvement as was the first amendment that she proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome this amendment from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i had not recognised that there was a defect and therefore i am grateful to him for recognising that <e> <s> the reason that i welcome the amendment is first that i believe that anything which removes uncertainties about whether the mother is the mother of the child and the child is the daughter or the son of the mother must be good <e> <s> with the amendments written in during report stage where the interests of the child were always to be taken as paramount it seems to me that the bonding between mother and child is as important if not more important in those births which are not identical to normal and regular births <e> <s> therefore i believe that by strengthening the law in that respect the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has made an important contribution to that relationship <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a brief word with regard to the amendment because once again the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has achieved a very difficult task <e> <s> when this issue was first debated i took a different view from that of the noble lady and the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> one noble lord accused me of preaching against the significance and value of marriage <e> <s> i was not doing that i was seeking to emphasise perhaps unsuccessfully the importance of the responsibility which is placed upon someone recognised as a father whether or not that father is married <e> <s> quality of parenthood cannot always be judged by whether or not a father and mother are married <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to see an amendment passed or any piece of legislation enacted which discriminated for or against a child because it had been born as a result of insemination <e> <s> discrimination either way is wrong <e> <s> once it became known that in terms of inheritance there was to be discrimination against a child because of the circumstances of its birth that immediately challenges the admirable amendment that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor presented <e>", "<cs> my lords if we have a bill that deals with those issues i might intervene but they are not affected by this legislation <e>", "<cs> absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords that word is not in the bill <e> <s> my noble friend brought in that word <e> <s> that is the first time that it has been mentioned in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome my noble friend to the benches on which he now sits but that is the only welcome i have for anything that he has said this afternoon because i totally disagree with every word that he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i am surprised that my noble friend is so ignorant <e> <s> he said that we are all ignorant <e> <s> we have had the benefit of the advice of the noble lord lord walton who has brought into the house refreshingly genuine knowledge <e> <s> all the rest of us have learnt as we have gone along <e> <s> we have also had the benefit of the advice of the medical research council <e> <s> we have tried to understand the bill as best we can <e> <s> i want <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is already held in high regard in this house both personally and for his professional qualifications <e> <s> his reputation has even been enhanced by his performance during our debates <e> <s> we have seen him at his very best clear in his presentation of a difficult subject and firm in his handling of contentious issues <e> <s> every time that he took away an issue which was of concern to a noble lord and came back with it he came back with it in an acceptable form sometimes bringing together those who had profoundly disagreed when the issues were first debated <e> <s> we have today had an example of the way in which he has enabled the bill to be improved as we have gone along <e> <s> i thank him deeply for what he has done because part of our task is to send to another place a bill in the best possible form <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a long way to go yet <e> <s> this is a very important bill <e> <s> i am pleased that we have dealt with that part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> there was a third amendment tabled by the chief rabbi which he did not move and which he did not take to a division <e> <s> that would have prohibited research in an attempt to improve or create a vaccine for contraceptive purposes <e> <s> he did not press that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am absolutely amazed that she said that there is not a crisis at the maudsley <e> <s> a visit to the maudsley and discussion with the consultants and the management team indicate that it is a crisis which with a cut of will mean reductions in the services for seriously mentally ill patients the mentally handicapped at the hilda lewis hospital and the -hour emergency drop-in service <e> <s> does the minister accept that the maudsley is a national flagship of high quality services for the mentally ill and that for that hospital to have to make reductions after it has already made cuts of million in the last three years is intolerable <e>", "<cs> not so <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the question on the order paper will the minister please discuss the matter with her right honourable friend <e> <s> does she recognise that the suggestion that the proposal is all part of a natural tendency to changes in psychiatric services is not accepted at all by the consultants and the doctors at the maudsley who are horrified by what is about to happen <e> <s> as president of mind perhaps i may say that i share their horror <e> <s> will the noble baroness take the matter more seriously and discuss it with the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble baroness for her clear and low key explanation of what i believe to be the most important legislation introduced by the government in this parliament <e> <s> i welcome much of what she said <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to the speech of the noble baroness <e> <s> of course i accept her word that she referred to those statements and perhaps in that case she is giving evidence in my favour <e> <s> perhaps she will say what organisations in the national health service have supported these proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply say very briefly that i referred to patients throughout my speech <e> <s> i talked about patients choice patients views and patients relationships with doctors and nurses <e> <s> it is largely the patients who are opposed to these proposals <e> <s> can the noble lord not recognise that <e> <s> the words are clear the polls are clear <e> <s> every time the patients are asked for their views out it comes clearly and boldly <e>", "<cs> my lords the royal colleges proposed that two regions should be used as test areas <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he tell me who he considers should decide whether a hospital should become a self-governing trust <e> <s> is it the consultants other doctors nurses or others who work in the community services or even the community itself <e> <s> is it right for just a small or even large handful of consultants to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that at that time there was enormous public demand for the service <e> <s> the whole nation wanted to see a health service <e> <s> it was totally different from the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the point just made by the noble baroness about the close link between those who are homeless and those who are psychiatric patients the fact that london has a very much higher proportion of homeless pshychiatric patients than other parts of the country and the question we had last week about the likely closure of the maudsley hospital as well as the beds which may go as regards the bloomsbury health authority is there not a case for some sort of funding for london to try to deal with this special problem of the homeless of which every visitor every tourist and every human being who lives here is now consciously aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome that announcement by the minister <e> <s> i particularly welcome the involvement of voluntary as well as statutory bodies <e> <s> however perhaps she can tell the house whether some resources will be made available to enable such initiatives to take place <e>", "<cs> pilot studies <e>", "<cs> i am happy to support the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> i was delighted to see it when it appeared on the marshalled list <e> <s> it is a very appropriate amendment with which to start our debate <e> <s> as the noble lord wisely said over the past few weeks and months an attempt has been made to agree some measure of all-party approach to some of the amendments which will come later in the course of the committee stage <e> <s> members of the committee will have looked at some of the amendments and seen how broad is the basis on which they appear <e>", "<cs> i thought that i stressed the quality skill and experience aspects <e> <s> if a secretary of state were to find on analysis that for example per cent <e> <s> of health authority chairmen were conservatives he would feel that there was something wrong <e> <s> i am not saying what he would do that responsibility does not fall upon me <e> <s> but i should want to ensure that we had the best possible people <e> <s> i totally support both the principle and the wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very surprised at the reply of the noble baroness <e> <s> she seems to think that slimmer and more effective bodies are less likely to have a political chairperson appointed <e> <s> we shall argue later about how slim or how efficient a body should be <e> <s> however i entirely agree with my noble friends intervention <e> <s> any secretary of state whatever his political party must be under great pressure to make appointments or not to make appointments or to ensure that someone who has held a political point of view is not reappointed <e> <s> i find it quite staggering for the noble baroness to say that her department and her ministers do not know <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord jenkin would take the same view that i have done <e> <s> of course it is known <e>", "<cs> if i misunderstood the noble lord i am sorry <e> <s> however i do not think the logic of what he has said is conclusive <e> <s> i believe that appointments should be made on the basis of skill and not on the basis of political commitment <e>", "<cs> that is the purpose behind the amendment <e> <s> i very strongly hope that it will be passed <e> <s> we may make some further adjustment at report stage to ensure that appointments are made on the basis of merit and not political allegiance <e> <s> that might be a better way of proposing it <e>", "<cs> i have put my name to the amendment and i support it <e> <s> we are talking not only about chairmen of regional and district health authorities and family health service authorities in england and wales <e> <s> we are also talking about all those who serve as members thousands of outstanding people up and down the country who serve voluntarily as members of health authorities <e> <s> many of those people have made the national health service as good as it is and we wish to retain their services <e>", "<cs> i wish to support all that has been said by the noble baroness and the noble lord lord walton who moved the amendment <e> <s> it may be argued by some that they are doing special pleading on behalf of their own professions <e> <s> i do not believe that that is the case <e> <s> i believe that they are doing special pleading on behalf of the patients whom they serve for whom they care and whom they understand <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says politically motivated <e> <s> but my fear is that this group will be out of touch with reality <e> <s> we argued earlier that people should come on to the authority whether as appointees or by invitation because of their experience <e> <s> in running a health authority one needs the experience of people who know of particular interests <e> <s> one needs doctors nurses and people who work in the community who have some knowledge of voluntary organisations <e> <s> we need people who have some knowledge of the work done by local authorities in community care <e> <s> if we go too far we shall set up bodies which are out of touch and isolated from those with whom they work insensitive and too conscious of cost cutting and cut off from the human needs of the patients whom they serve <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord accept that there are some of us who understand the purpose of the white paper but who believe that the argument is simply unproven <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> if a non-executive member happens to be associated with a firm is it then assumed that that person will be representative of that firm on the health authority <e> <s> surely you cannot have it both ways <e>", "<cs> the amendment came back on report stage <e> <s> i cannot quote from the record at the moment i shall inform the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that i am right <e> <s> if not i shall apologise <e>", "<cs> both <e>", "<cs> buzzwords <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply which i found very unsatisfactory <e> <s> i am not trying to suggest that local authorities should have powers to appoint councillors to health authorities <e> <s> i am suggesting that among those who should be brought into membership of those health authorities a significant number i say up to a quarter should have local authority experience <e>", "<cs> i know that i shall hear this argument on every amendment that i move this evening <e> <s> the minister will not say any more than he and his secretary of state have said <e> <s> he is keeping his cards close to him <e> <s> clearly he has decided what should be the size of both the regional and district health authorities <e> <s> he will not move from that and so i shall hear that answer again and again <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised at the reply given by the minister but i am not happy with it <e> <s> i appreciate a number of the things that she has said one of which was that there might even be a local councillor <e> <s> i suppose there might even be someone associated with voluntary organisations <e> <s> there might be all sorts of people but it all rests with the secretary of state and those whom he appoints <e>", "<cs> with even greater brevity i should like to support the new title of director of public health <e> <s> i support the amendment and the arguments of the noble lords lord walton and lord hunter of newington <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not intend to suggest that there should be a statutory requirement for a minimum number of disabled people in this committee <e> <s> we all eventually become disabled if we do not die first <e> <s> however the point made by my noble friend lord pitt is correct that we perhaps show a greater interest in disability and the services for disabled people in this place because we are forever conscious of the subject <e> <s> i believe that that would also apply to a health authority if one of its members was constantly aware of how to meet the needs of disabled people <e>", "<cs> i warmly support the point made by the noble lord lord hunter <e> <s> i presume that he was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is a way of dealing with some of the other problems that we experienced during the course of the evening that there should be a pattern of consultation <e> <s> i take my pattern of consultation beyond the professional bodies listed in the amendment though i certainly include them <e>", "<cs> i wish merely to say that i support what has been said by my noble friend and by the noble lord lord winstanley <e>", "<cs> it should be the other way round <e>", "<cs> and repeated time and again <e>", "<cs> i support this important proposal and in doing so i shall concentrate on the evaluation aspect <e> <s> the committee will be grateful to the noble lord lord nelson <e> <s> i am sorry that he is not present today <e> <s> he and his committee recognised not only the crucial importance for the nations health of medical research but drew attention to the inadequacy of research and evaluation in the nhss own operations <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i said that i would concentrate on that aspect <e> <s> others had concentrated on the medical research aspect <e> <s> i agreed and associated myself with what others had said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond straight away to the minister <e> <s> there are certain aspects of what she said that i welcome <e> <s> i am glad to hear that the officer will be a director and that he will sit on the management executive <e>", "<cs> the members of the committee who have spoken to the amendment have done so on the basis of special knowledge and experience <e> <s> it was brilliantly presented by the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> i present my own partys point of view <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for giving way <e> <s> is there any single hospital which has expressed an interest in becoming an nhs trust in which any but a small minority supported the proposal <e> <s> is there a single hosptial where there has been a ballot in which the majority of staff have said yes they wish to go <e> <s> is there a single hospital where there has been a community ballot <e> <s> why is the minister saying that that has been done with great enthusiasm <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> she referred to me nodding my head perhaps i can explain why <e> <s> she is aware that from april all health authorities will be obliged to contract for all services <e> <s> they have never done that before they are ill-equipped to do so and it will create from my experience and discussions with health authorities throughout the country terrible uncertainty <e> <s> when the noble baroness says that there will be no big bang i fear that there will be a big bang <e> <s> they are all being plunged into doing something which they have never done before without evaluation <e>", "<cs> why is it that per cent <e> <s> of the staff at guys hospital when given the opportunity of expressing an opinion said that they did not want to become a self-governing trust <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord lord jenkin has said is the basis of my fear namely that with the new commercialism the approach may well be that if the service is to pay then there will be concentration on that service <e> <s> one recognises that no district hospital will be able to provide all the services <e> <s> if what the noble lord said is to become policy then one may see more and more people having to travel further and further for the treatment that they expect to get in their own district <e>", "<cs> the noble lord takes me to my next point <e> <s>

very dissatisfied with the present situation and they are the best people as we shall discuss on the later amendment to represent the interests of the community <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i find it totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> she does not seem to realise or indeed she realises that the government are taking us into a new type of health service with new types of authorities <e> <s> we debated that on the last day of the committee stage <e> <s> in those circumstances it is clear that community health councils must have a stronger role than they have at present <e> <s> if that is to be done i believe that it must be on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment originally appeared in the name of the noble lord lord hunter and also that of the noble lord lord carr who unfortunately cannot be here at the moment <e> <s> i added my name to this amendment which is grouped with my own amendment no <e> <s> g which refers to consultation with

<e> <s> it is difficult to compare a general practice with a company which is surely designed to <e>", "<cs> therefore one can well understand why many general practitioners in a practice with the appropriate number of patients do not like the idea at all <e> <s> with the prospect of receiving soon and per cent <e> <s> of computer costs and if that is accepted then obtaining it is not surprising that gps think the idea terrible <e> <s> they will come along and say here is all this extra money and the department does not seem to know how to spend it <e> <s> why these sums of money will be spent unless it is thought that they will produce a remarkably improved service to patients i do not know nor do the doctors <e> <s> that is why they object to it and why as i gave notice i shall have something to say on the debate as to whether the clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> however in view of the assurances given to me by the noble baroness i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe the government should now drop this proposal in the face of the opposition that has been shown by the profession the government cannot doubt that it exists and by the

<e> <s> i do not believe that the health service will be ready on st april to introduce the provisions of the internal market <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the noble baroness <e> <s> i have not yet found any gps who are in favour of the idea so my discussions have been with those who have asked to speak to me because they are so much opposed to it <e> <s> with regard to the point made by the noble baroness about those organisations which have written to say that their members are opposed to the proposal i hope that she is not casting aspersions upon the sincerity and genuineness of the conclusions reached by some worthy voluntary and professional organisations <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness and i was glad to have her assurance that it is not the intention that gps should now start fulfilling the role of pharmacists <e> <s> that would be a very unfortunate step to take <e> <s> it is difficult to know peoples motives <e> <s> i heard what the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour said in relation to some doctors in scotland <e> <s> i heard the noble lord lord butterfield say that he knows of some gps who are enthusiastic <e> <s> there are gps and not all

association it has been shown that the vast majority of gps are against it <e> <s> we can all say yes i know one who is not and i am certain the noble baroness knows three or four <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness knows who have written in to express an interest <e> <s> for heavens sake <e> <s> i am surprised the number is not more than that <e> <s> i should have thought that every gp who could qualify would write in to express an interest <e> <s> it would be sheer nonsense if they did not find out what was on offer <e> <s> they now know what is on offer and i suppose that some may act

practitioners have <e> <s> if the noble baroness asks me what my motive is <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid i do not have the statistics in front of me but it was a very large majority of gps who expressed the view that they were opposed to this and did not believe that it would produce better services for their patients <e> <s> as i said in answer to a question put by the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour i do not doubt the motives of the gps <e> <s> the majority of them in expressing this view are thinking of the interests of their patients <e> <s> i do not think they are

bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for her assurances <e> <s> the fact that there will be no form of clawback immediately removes the necessity for this amendment <e> <s> therefore with pleasure i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i also support this amendment and my

baroness says is simply not in conformity with the view of the <e>", "<cs> my lords he is warmly welcomed <e>", "<cs> it is not the noble viscounts fault <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down did he notice an interesting statement in a recent press release on th february by mr roger freeman the parliamentary under-secretary <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord

is the actual comparison <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> does the noble viscount wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have a right to comment briefly on the ministers reply <e>", "<cs> i have not very well <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will give way <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to have the point clarified on admission when

grateful to the noble baroness for her sympathetic reply <e> <s> it was not sympathetic to the amendment i understand that <e> <s> however i hope that she will consider it again <e> <s> i am not at all certain that the report of sir raymond hoffenbergs committee applied itself to this proposal <e> <s> i have no intention of pressing the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i wish to consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his very helpful reply <e> <s> i assume therefore that until there has been a review or until there is some new proposal the present system will continue unchanged <e> <s> however i wonder whether the minister can make any comment as to the wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not expect the minister to be able to give that kind of assurance <e> <s> however i thought it important to emphasise that joint funding would dwindle away if there was not some form of protection against inflation and particularly higher than expected levels of inflation <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his help and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to leap to my feet again <e> <s> i originally gave notice of my intention to oppose the motion that the clause shall stand part of the bill because of my wish to explore the new system of weighted capitation which the government intend to introduce as a substitute for the rawp formula in which i was also involved when i was secretary of state <e> <s> that was designed to bring greater fairness to regional and district resource allocation in view of the gross inequalities in health care provision in different parts of the country and particularly the extent to which there had been under-provision for the north-east north-west and trent regions <e> <s> to a large extent the passage of time and the rawp formula have helped to achieve that <e> <s> it was never a popular measure <e> <s> those who received more than they might have expected without the rawp formula did not seem to notice it they were never satisifed and those who received less were extremely angry <e> <s> it is comparable to the poll tax except that my formula produced results <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words before the minister replies <e> <s> obviously i did not make myself clear and was misunderstood by the noble lord lord mccoll of dulwich and my noble friend lord young of dartington <e> <s> there is no fixed level of beds <e> <s> i was simply quoting one or two examples <e> <s> i raised the issue at this stage because the junior health minister mr roger freeman is quoted as saying that there will be no net development and some qenuine reduction in services <e> <s> i am concerned about the reduction in services <e> <s> it is a serious statement made by a minister to the effect that during this year we shall see a reduction in services at precisely the time when many of those same people will be involved in trying to organise themselves to cope with the consequences of the bill <e> <s> it is not just an example of one hospital <e> <s> i do not have a fixed idea of what should be the bed level <e> <s> as i understand it unless i am told that the information has been incorrectly stated i gave the minister notice some hours ago that i would raise the issue a minister <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his confirmation that he was concerned though not necessarily as concerned as i was when he read the report in <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a few words from this bench in total support of the amendment and the admirable presentation made by my noble friend <e> <s> at one stage my name was among the sponsors of this amendment <e> <s> i withdrew it in order that the noble baroness lady cox could add her name to the proposal <e> <s> i am very glad that i did so because she has made her comments with all her authority <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has dealt very effectively with the argument that we need to monitor standards we being the department regional and district health authorities and the professionals <e> <s> she did not really apply herself to the thought that perhaps an independent body needs to monitor our standards <e>", "<cs> there were several initiatives mentioned by the noble baroness during her reply which i very much welcome <e> <s> i am much in favour as i think we all are of more flexible working arrangements such as job-sharing schemes opportunities for people to return to work on a part-time basis in-service training and so on <e> <s> those initiatives are all good and necessary but we need to go much further down that road than we have gone thus far <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies if it is always left to local initiative there will be variations in the carrying out <e> <s> there will come a time and i believe that that time is now when if we want to get nurses back we must provide facilities <e> <s> that often will not happen if it is left to local initiative <e>", "<cs> from these benches we are satisfied with the logic of the amendments that have been proposed by the noble lord and will support them <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone on raising the issue and quoting such tragic cases as that of beverley lewis <e> <s> i shall not respond to what was almost a challenge that i should put the opposite view <e> <s> this is not a mental health bill there are controversial issues involved in the proposal for a community treatment order <e> <s> i should like the house to hold a debate about precisely this subject <e> <s> however i do not believe that this is the right legislation on which to have such a debate <e> <s> i do not believe that until the secretary of state has had wide consultation which is certainly not yet completed there would be any basis for agreement <e> <s> therefore i hope that the government will not accept the amendment <e> <s> i say that without in any way wishing to be critical of the noble lord lord mottistone who never loses any opportunity of representing the interests of the people for whom he cares very much <e> <s> i care for them too <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is best in that event that i do not move the amendment because i want the ministers amendments to be accepted <e> <s> perhaps she will comment on the residual problems that i raised when she moves her amendments <e>", "<cs> so far as i can see the ministers amendments and her comments on them have met the principal concerns which i expressed <e> <s> i should like to have the opportunity to read her remarks more carefully and to consult with the bma to see what its feelings are <e> <s> perhaps i might enter into correspondence if need be with the noble baroness <e> <s> in the meantime we welcome the amendments <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble lord would say whether the bma was consulted on the series of amendments that have just been presented <e> <s> can i have his assurance that the bma was happy about them <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her helpful comments on this matter <e> <s> there was a little misunderstanding here <e> <s> i did not suggest nor does the amendment suggest that at the end of the review conducted by the secretary of state of the number of places available for the mentally ill in long-stay hospital accommodation there should be no patients requiring long-stay accommodation <e> <s> i have no doubt that there would be some people i do not know how many who would not be able to be discharged into the community <e> <s> that is part of the purpose of seeking that there should be a review <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she would answer a question <e> <s> she said that it was her view that many vulnerable people were likely to receive less assistance rather than more <e> <s> i wonder why she feels that this is a party political issue <e> <s> all the local authority associations of whatever political complexion are in favour of ring fencing <e> <s> so far as i know from the massive amount of correspondence that i have had almost all of the voluntary organisations most of which are non-political take the same view <e> <s> they take that view because they share the concern which the noble baroness expressed at the beginning of her speech <e> <s> if the government can make an assessment of the needs of the national health service why can they not also make an assessment of the needs of community care <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say this <e> <s> one of the troubles with former secretaries of state or any former head of department is that they are inclined to stand still and not to move with the times <e> <s> the noble lord may think the same of me as i think of him <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> it may be that when the minister replies she will have an explanation <e> <s> however on the face of it it is a strange situation where as the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale said clause which deals with the scottish responsibility takes in precisely the words <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do perhaps i may say that i am grateful to the noble baroness for suggesting that she would consider this before the report stage <e> <s> a little earlier she implied and i may have misunderstood that the handling of the provision would be in guidance rather than being included in the bill <e> <s> i am glad that there will be good guidance but i believe that it needs to be on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> this group of amendments is not at all pernickety <e> <s> i speak particularly to amendment no <e> <s> a but the group hangs together very properly <e> <s> unless some adjustment is made we are building up for ourselves a great deal of ill-feeling between health authorities and social services departments <e>", "<cs> my questions may be even simpler than those posed by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> it is rather difficult stuff it is not like poetry <e> <s> one has to follow every word <e> <s> i have three simple questions <e> <s> first clause b states <e>", "<cs> i felt that the noble lord was about to withdraw his amendment <e> <s> before coming back on report perhaps he will bear this point in mind <e> <s> obviously a number of members of the committee have been involved in the care and rehabilitation of offenders <e> <s> we are not suggesting at least i do not think the noble lord is suggesting that all those who may have committed an offence are necessarily to be excluded <e> <s> as i understand him he is saying that we need to know <e> <s> there are some offences the nature of which would make such people entirely unsuitable for coping with those who need help and understanding and also very frail people <e> <s> there are some types of one-off offence which would make a person totally unsuitable to be in charge of a home but which might not preclude other types of employment <e> <s> however we must know <e>", "<cs> the minister has been most helpful <e> <s> however i hope that she will give some thought to the point made by my noble friend about guidelines <e> <s> we want to ensure that local authorities can specify that the workers employed in non-statutory agencies are properly trained and have appropriate working conditions and rates of pay <e> <s> they should also ensure that service providers are equal opportunity employers and that they are able to deliver services which meet the religious or cultural needs of the client groups <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble baroness would never intentionally mislead the chamber <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment to a division <e> <s> however i shall study carefully what has been said and consider whether i shall return to the issue on report <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his helpful and detailed reply <e> <s> i wish to press him a little further <e> <s> he thinks that the proposals in the amendment are inappropriate but for that matter i think that the proposals in the bill without the amendment are inappropriate <e> <s> they are so because there is an enormous range of differences in the residential costs <e> <s> i know that the noble lord said without services but often one cannot provide housing without services <e> <s> the range of charges for a youngster who is placed in a sense residence or in a spastics society residence with all the costs that that involves will be enormously different from the charges for those who are in no way disabled <e> <s> i do not see how a satisfactory arrangement will be arrived <e>", "<cs> will the minister give me any hope that we shall get some feedback so that we can deal with this matter in a realistic way on report <e> <s> after all there are only a few weeks between now and report <e> <s> does the minister anticipate that we shall be able to agree on a measure across the floor of the chamber by then <e>", "<cs> what the minister says is very interesting helpful and kind <e> <s> in that spirit i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i hope that we can consider the matter carefully before we come to the report stage <e> <s> i hope that the minister and representatives from this side of the chamber will be able to confer with organisations <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord allen who is so aware of the problems of organisations which are concerned with accommodation for disabled people will also be able to take part <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl lord balfour wanted me to give way <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for her answer <e> <s> will she confirm that in its <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness saying to me that the health authority can do without four psychiatric wards the geriatric ward and the family planning service <e> <s> i cannot believe that for a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the rawp formula which was referred to by the noble lord lord mccoll was introduced by me years ago <e> <s> it received the support of both sides of another place <e> <s> it has not been stopped because it succeeded in its purpose <e> <s> further does she accept that some of the blame for what has happened at st thomass has been put on the former finance director for spending too much time on health service reforms <e> <s> we should bear in mind the fact that that hospital has just voted by a margin of five to one against becoming independent and self-governing as the national health service bill requires it to be <e> <s> is that not one of the matters that is causing the problems in the national health service and st thomass at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure to conclude the debate from this side of the house <e> <s> i should first declare an interest <e> <s> as the noble lord lord colwyn said both he and i are joint presidents of the all-party parliamentary group on complementary medicine <e> <s> moreover although he did not say so we are also both patrons of the research council for complementary medicine which was referred to by other noble lords <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him two questions <e> <s> first in the studies that will be made by the secretary of state i presume that the different levels of cost of care homes in different parts of the country will be taken into consideration <e> <s> i am aware that the cost of care homes in london is on average per week higher than the income support level <e> <s> i hope that the variations will be considered <e> <s> secondly and perhaps more fundamentally will the noble lord give an assurance that none of those people now in care homes without the resources to pay the fees required will be evicted between now and the time when the legislation to which he referred comes into effect <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that local government in scotland is dominated by the labour party <e> <s> it is not is is dominated by the voters <e> <s> local government elections are the people expressing their view whether it happens to be conservative labour or liberal <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with that that is what democracy is about <e>", "<cs> i am not quite certain why the noble lord is so worried <e> <s> this committee is entitled as we did on tuesday to pass an amendment to a bill which has come from another place <e> <s> the other place must then decide what to do with it <e> <s> when we come to consideration in committee of the social security bill we are equally entitled to pass amendments if we believe that it is right to do so <e> <s> again another place must then decide what is the best course to take <e>", "<cs> i certainly support the amendment <e> <s> consultation is absolutely essential <e> <s> as the noble <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that it is a recipe for delay <e> <s> does that mean that there is a possibility that they would not be consulted <e>", "<cs> here we are dealing with this quite new clause <e> <s> it is a new responsibility placed on local authorities <e> <s> it is not something about which they have been consulted up to now <e> <s> it is about the plans and the nature of the plans presented to the secretary of state and revisions of them as the years go by and whether the secretary of state should seek the advice of the local authority associations <e> <s> the fact that they have been consulted up to now is not the point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fully support the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness presented the case on behalf of the royal college of nursing and i support her in that respect <e> <s> however i should stress that the arguments do not apply only to nurses as i am sure she recognises <e> <s> we must consider for example occupational therapists <e> <s> i have an interest through the college of occupational therapists <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord seebohm for raising the issue because housing is one of the most important provisions for those with social need <e> <s> as he said there is no acknowledgement in the legislation that many people with social care needs are either homeless or inappropriately housed <e> <s> that fact should be recognised in the bill <e>", "<cs> i support the principle of the two amendments <e> <s> the name of my noble friend lord carter is attached to amendment no <e> <s> at <e> <s> if i had to make a choice i might choose the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> but we are not in the game here of choosing <e> <s> i wish to make a number of points which i hope will eventually see their way into the bill whether by means of these amendments or by something put forward by the government <e>", "<cs> i shall say a little more than that <e> <s> i am somewhat surprised that the government have only now got around to realising that it was necessary to make these clarifications of section of the mental health act <e> <s> this enables us to return to the debate that we had on the amendment of the noble lord lord allen <e> <s> the inclusion of the services described under section of the mental health act on the face of the bill perhaps gives some encouragement for the argument that we put forward in relation to other parts of the bill and a clear list of the category of persons covered by community care <e> <s> this seems to follow on the amendment which the noble baroness herself proposed and which i support <e> <s> perhaps she would re-examine the debate on the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord allen to see whether she could consider a follow-on amendment to those now before us <e>", "<cs> the case has been powerfully put by the noble baronesses lady seear and lady cox and the noble lords lord allen of abbeydale and lord mottistone <e> <s> however i feel that i must emphasise some points <e> <s> before doing so it should be noted that the last five amendments in this very large group apply the same principles to scotland <e> <s> therefore it is not necessary for my noble friend lord carmichael to speak to this amendment <e>", "<cs> that was not a reply at all <e> <s> however it is half-past eleven and no one expects me to press the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will recognise <e>", "<cs> i submit that that is not the case <e> <s> the amendment clearly states that the local authority <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws the amendment as i am sure she will perhaps i may point out that it is a long time since that statement was made <e> <s> i do not have the exact date i have the wording but it must be over two months ago that the minister gave that assurance <e> <s> knowing that the amendment was to come before the committee i should have thought that at the very least the statement would have been turned into a conclusion either positive or negative <e> <s> for the government to take two months and still not be able to make up their mind on the issue which the minister was <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am amazed by her answer <e> <s> if there is no shortage of nurses why has she referred to a massive advertising campaign to recruit more nurses <e> <s> further has the minister seen the report that was published today which showed that in every single region there is a grave shortage in the number of nurses being recruited <e> <s> this is more serious in some regions than in others <e> <s> did the minister also see the statement made by the general secretary of the royal college of nursing which emphasised the problem of the shortage of nurses and the need to improve conditions not just pay but also creche facilities and opportunities for part-time work <e> <s> those facilities have proved to be absolutely inadequate <e> <s> i am amazed by the answer the minister gave <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble baroness would comment on whether or not the government intend to postpone implementation of the proposals <e> <s> comments in both the sunday press and todays newspapers give the impression to anyone who has been in politics for some time that there has been some discreet off-the-record briefing <e> <s> my noble friend read some words from the <e>", "<cs> please translate <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord accept that clause is entirely about the inspection of premises used for the provisiion of community care services <e> <s> it is not about the quality of care provided which is what this amendment is about <e> <s> here we are dealing with service standards of community care and so on <e> <s> clause is about premises <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all who have taken part in this interesting debate and of course to the minister for her reply <e> <s> the noble baroness lady cox said that this is not a party political matter and the debate proved that it is not <e> <s> the debate was in fact more interesting and well -informed between the members of the government benches than on these benches because there was not much debate on this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am glad that i provoked the noble baroness into making that response because it yet again brought out her experience from which we always benefit in these debates <e> <s> we have learned much from this debate and it is a matter to which we must return on report <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that there are <e> <s> frankly we should be moving towards some system where the regional structure of the ssi is developed so that it can perform the kind of function that lies behind this amendment <e> <s> a number of noble lords have said including the noble lord lord renton and the noble lord lord seebohm who did so with some strength that it is important to reach the standards we are seeking to achieve and that anyone from outside who looks at those standards should do so with independence <e> <s> none of us is the best judge of our own performance <e> <s> it is always better to have someone with a degree of impartiality brought in to look at the service <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble baroness on this amendment <e> <s> as she said private and voluntary care homes are subject to registration <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness say what those powers include <e> <s> are services other than residential services covered <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask a further question before the minister replies <e> <s> i should have asked the same question if my noble friend had not done so <e> <s> the part of clause that the minister read did not seem to include inspection <e> <s> inspection may not be the correct word <e> <s> it did not seem to include the observance of domiciliary services <e> <s> i bear in mind the point made by the noble lord lord butterfield <e>", "<cs> before the minister decides what to do i am still puzzled <e> <s> i understand that in another place the government gave assurances that there would be inspection of clients homes <e> <s> if that is the case i cannot see how clause can cover domiciliary services in the way the minister suggested <e> <s> we are anxious because the home help service is only one service provided by local authorities but it is an important one <e> <s> the quality is sometimes worsening <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham referred to the fact that home helps often do not do cleaning and yet that is frequently the most important thing that an old gentleman or an old lady there are some old gentleman who need home helps because they are not as good at housework as the ladies needs <e> <s> there is still some ambiguity and uncertainty about the matter <e> <s> the minister should settle our minds about it or assure us in some other way <e> <s> we need to be sure about this matter <e>", "<cs> that does not include private houses <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble baroness will look at this because we are in a state of great confusion <e> <s> on page clause states <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should say that the matter may also involve a long-acting medication that may have been given in the premises in question by a psychiatric nurse <e>", "<cs> i agree with everything that the noble baroness has said <e> <s> however will she not go further and recognise the fact that many of the voluntary organisations providing services either in conjunction with local authorities or independently have professional staff members as skilled and as well-trained as those working for statutory bodies <e> <s> for instance mind runs a casework and legal advice service and those employed to provide that are trained and highly-skilled professionals <e> <s> it is a voluntary organisation because a great deal of its money is raised in that way <e> <s> it has inspired and is helped by many volunteers throughout the country <e> <s> however its central work is carried out by highly-trained highly-skilled professional people <e>", "<cs> i certainly have no intention of pressing this amendment to a division <e> <s> i welcome the assurances given by the noble lord that joint funding and joint finance will continue <e> <s> i recognise the fact that he cannot give a timing for when the study will continue <e> <s> the minister gave some welcome to the principles contained in this amendment <e> <s> does he agree with me that there is merit in having some reference to joint funding within this bill <e> <s> will the noble lord consider that in the light of the discussions that have gone on it may be that more money will be provided or that different principles will be applied and as there is much agreement between us it would be a good thing that the provision should be written into the bill between now and the later stage <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i entirely support the remarks made by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> he has done this chamber a considerable service in raising this issue on three previous occasions <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull has supported him <e> <s> i too support him because we have had no indication from the government as to what they will do about the fact that hospital social workers are now an endangered species <e> <s> unless they take some action soon and take a grip on the situation before the bill becomes enacted that means during the course of the passage of the bill there will be no hospital social workers because no one will be able to pay the bills for them <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words of support because this is an important matter <e> <s> i have in mind all those organisations that represent the interests of and often include among their memberships those people who are disabled in one way or another <e> <s> i too very much welcome the amendment moved by the government but if it were left to individuals to make their complaints it would be very difficult for them <e> <s> i refer to the mentally handicapped <e> <s> obviously mencap has a role in that respect <e> <s> i also think of the deaf and blind where sense and other organisations have a role <e> <s> the royal national institute for the blind and the royal national institute for the deaf together with a whole group of other organisations exist not only to improve services for such people but also to represent their interests <e> <s> unless they are entitled to present complaints on behalf of the handicapped many complaints would go unheard <e>", "<cs> does that mean that if the minister finds that provision is not in the bill she will return with an amendment <e> <s> it is important that organisations should know what their rights are <e> <s> it is a piece of legislation in which their rights are defined <e> <s> it is not enough to say that it is the custom or that it should be done <e> <s> i know that this procedure has not always been followed <e> <s> on a number of occasions i have put forward on behalf of mind proposals for an inquiry but no inquiry has followed <e> <s> anyone has a right to ask for an inquiry but that does not mean anything <e> <s> anyone may write to anyone a cat may look at a queen or whatever it is <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i wish to point out that in looking at the wording of the new amendment no <e> <s> fc which i welcomed none of those described as person in paragraphs a b and c would be other than individuals <e> <s> subparagraph a states <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble viscount for giving way <e> <s> i feel that i should point out at this stage that amendment no <e> <s> ha has been extracted from that grouping and that it will be considered separately <e>", "<cs> i shall speak very briefly <e> <s> i shall try to confine myself to three sentences <e> <s> first it is quite clear that alcohol services have received very low priority for funding from social services departments <e> <s> secondly alcohol concern says that the proposed changes in the funding of residential care will result in the wholesale closure of residential drug and alcohol projects unless specific measures are taken <e> <s> thirdly when one asks why those services have received such low priority a variety of answers are given <e> <s> i shall give only one namely that there is no statutory responsibility on local authorities to provide those services <e> <s> that is the overwhelming reason for the amendment <e> <s> it should be a statutory responsibility <e> <s> if it is not there is no reason to expect that local authorities will automatically pay <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may both support the noble lord in the amendment that he has proposed and say a few words about it <e> <s> i also speak to amendment no <e> <s> ha <e>", "<cs> when you go i will say the same <e>", "<cs> i do not expect the minister to start giving a review of the public expenditure white paper to be published later this year <e> <s> however it is important that local authorities should know what is the per centage of the grant whether it be per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> and so on <e> <s> the local authorities need to know that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i am very disappointed in the ministers response <e> <s> it is the first time that i have heard any minister say that this grant will be only a small proportion <e> <s> i have heard so many speeches by roger freeman and have seen written answers given in another place <e> <s> at no stage did i gain the impression that this would be a small proportion of local authority expenditure or any expenditure on the mentally ill <e> <s> i was very disturbed to hear what the minister said not so much in relation to the amendment but my probing produced a very unsatisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is saying that the initial application does not require consultation with those concerned <e> <s> will she confirm that in every case where hospitals expressed an interest in becoming self-governing either there has been no effective consultation or if there has been a ballot all of them by a large majority have gone against the proposal <e> <s> if as the minister said consultation is <e>", "<cs> my lords while associating myself totally with the view that the community should have an opportunity of expressing its views and that those views should be reflected in decisions perhaps i may ask whether the government are faced with a difficult timetable <e> <s> from what the minister says all that has happened so far is that interest has been expressed <e> <s> the bill will presumably become law at some time <e> <s> how will the consultation take place in order for the bill to take effect on st april next year <e> <s> is that really possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not bizarre with health authorities across the country now cutting back on patient care including the closure of wards because of under-funding that at precisely the same time c million is being made available for <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the gps contract <e> <s> is she aware that there is considerable concern that under the operation of the new contract gps who see no hope of reaching the target will simply stop carrying out regular smear tests <e> <s> cm the minister comment on that <e> <s> is she aware of the recent report made by the association of community health councils which criticises the current screening campaign for its slowness in informing patients of the results of their tests following abnormal smears <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that informative reply <e> <s> however does she accept that if per cent <e> <s> of those who may be facing some danger do not receive information within a month there is some real danger for them <e> <s> is there not something that can be done to improve that performance level in terms of reportage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for her reply <e> <s> she has said briefly and succinctly what she said repeatedly on a series of amendments on th april <e> <s> however i believe she <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for putting that question because it allows me to clarify the position <e> <s> we refer to the desirability rather than an obligation of making such appointments <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure to support the noble baroness lady cox and to agree with every word that she said <e> <s> there are matters on which we shall not always agree and i shall refer to one or two of them during my presentation <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i have sought to ask myself two questions <e> <s> first why is the subsection in the bill at all <e> <s> i find it difficult to discover what would be lost and this is the second question by the government if the subsection were to be deleted <e> <s> there is no question of principle here <e> <s> i have no doubt unless she intends to accept the amendment that the minister will be able to explain why the subsection must remain in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to interrupt why if we are trying to say that it is not an authority have we consciously put in the word authority <e> <s> it was a family practitioner service in this legislation it is called a family health services authority <e> <s> having done that a small clause is needed which says of course we are calling it authority but no one must think it is an authority <e> <s> why are we doing that <e> <s> it does not make sense <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she tell me what is the right way to do it <e> <s> the problem is that unless one gives a nudge and a reminder at the time when people are appointed then too often what we want does not happen <e> <s> if we took a poll of members of health authorities and asked how many of them not necessarily those who are themselves disabled i have tried to cover the matter both ways were experienced in the needs of the disabled we might find that the number is small <e> <s> we must find a way of putting matters right when something is wrong <e> <s> if the noble baroness had not simply said that my method was wrong but had then suggested another method that might have helped <e> <s> however in the absence of another method this at least is one way of dealing with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am not satisfied <e> <s> of course i am always grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> the first point i wish to make is that if someone on the board is either disabled or conversant with the needs and interests of disabled people those are not that persons only interests <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham is the best example we have already heard the noble baroness lady camegy say that she is on the health board not because she is disabled but because she brings a vital element to it <e>", "<cs> my lords first i congratulate my noble friend on his constancy <e> <s> he brought a private members bill from another place which did not get further <e> <s> he raised the issue at committee stage and now at report stage <e> <s> he has raised it during parliamentary questions <e> <s> there are certain issues where unless one sees progress it is important that they should be constantly raised in the house <e> <s> it is not a party issue <e> <s> the noble lord lord auckland said that it is not a new issue <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> it was an issue when i was secretary of state <e> <s> it is an issue now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness did not comment on paragraph d of the amendment <e> <s> it recognises that there are certain circumstances in which one cannot prescribe hours or any other number and it offers flexibility <e> <s> secondly all members of the house will wish mrs bottomley and her working party well <e> <s> would it not be useful if they had a target towards which they could work to have in place two-and-a-half years from now namely the figure stated in the amendment which the government have accepted as their target <e> <s> i believe that that would encourage and help the working party <e> <s> does the minister agree <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate the extent to which the commitment made has been written into the bill <e> <s> i am grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may point out that if there is no advisory committee then there is nothing in the amendment <e> <s> the amendment is <e>", "<cs> my lords it never occurred to me when i moved the amendment that it would bring down the house <e> <s> it seemed such a modest little amendment <e> <s> i never thought that it would have such a reaction from above <e> <s> whether it was the almighty giving support to my amendment or trying to bomb the minister during his response i do not know <e> <s> i hope that all cross-benchers are safe from whatever was being thrown down <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite see the logic of the ministers thoughtful reply <e> <s> she said that health authorities will have objectives and will produce targets <e> <s> if this is to be so of course they must be locally produced and locally worked out <e> <s> i cannot imagine that a regional health authority would publish a statement of health needs without consultation with the district health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to thank the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for having brought the amendment before us <e> <s> when he made his maiden speech several of us said that we hoped to hear more from him <e> <s> it is good to hear more from him in such a constructive way <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been support for the amendment from members on all sides of the house <e> <s> some noble lords have spoken with a great deal of experience about the subject <e> <s> i do not wish to be unkind to the minister i like her very much and she is always helpful <e> <s> however i sense that her reply will be the same despite whatever any of us say or how many of us say it <e> <s> let us suppose that everyone now sitting in your lordships house spoke on the subject and that the debate took another minutes with short speeches such as those made by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i believe that the minister would still give the same reply <e> <s> i find that most unsatisfactory not only in committee we heard it then but on report <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that he is dissatisfied with the present situation in which gps have the right to refer patients wherever they wish and to inquire about the length of waiting lists and so on and whether a patient is prepared to go to birmingham or elsewhere <e> <s> does he believe that the current situation is so unsatisfactory that the present rights of gps to do this should now be taken from them and should be restricted <e>", "<cs> that is patients choice that is what it is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords who decides <e> <s> is it the health authority or the gp who decides what is in the best interests of the patient <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord henley for his reply <e> <s> the case has been powerfully made <e> <s> i made it only in a modest way <e> <s> it was greatly strengthened by two general practitioners who know far more about the matter than i do <e> <s> and it has been overwhelmingly supported in the country by gps through their national representatives <e> <s> for good reasons or bad depending on which way you look at the matter patients seem to agree with the general practitioners <e> <s> so the government find themselves unable to persuade most people that they are trying to achieve what they say they wish to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords that will mean more staff with more independent inquiries challenges and questions from gps about their rights <e> <s> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords most doctors would say that it was a matter of their clinical judgment <e> <s> since the health service was created in great emphasis has been laid on the clinical judgment of doctors as to what is in the best interests of their patients <e> <s> a new system is being imposed here in which other people decide what is in the best interests of patients <e> <s> inquiries will take place people will hear evidence and presumably litigation will follow as to whether the health authority or the general practitioner is right <e> <s> that is grossly unsatisfactory <e> <s> the minister pretends that that is broadening choice <e> <s> of course it is not it is limiting choice for reasons which the noble lord lord mccoll and the minister must think satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am being encouraged to divide but i shall not do so <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i know that i shall lose a division <e> <s> everyone knows how we stand on this <e> <s> i totally disagree with the government <e> <s> i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment because i know that a division is pointless at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> can she say what consultation the department and ministers have had with community health councils and their national organisation before that reply was given <e> <s> i shall speak long enough for an answer to be given <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be right for the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i must say that i did not fully understand the position with regard to visiting rights <e> <s> i take it that this means that they can go on the premises <e> <s> however does that mean that they have observer status at annual meetings <e> <s> does it mean that they can visit any premises for which an nhs trust is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords the principle set out in the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord morris applies to other professions allied to medicine <e> <s> it applies to physiotherapists in some cases to occupational therapists and perhaps to chiropodists <e> <s> indeed one could go through the list <e> <s> it is an important principle and perhaps if we had thought about it we may have tabled an amendment which comprehensively dealt with that whole range of services <e> <s> i wish to have my name associated with the amendment in view of the contact that i have had with speech therapists and my great respect for their work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister and particularly for the last part of his response <e> <s> i thought that his disrespect for year-old documents was out of place <e> <s> those documents are of some historic interest <e> <s> they should be preserved embossed reproduced published and sold widely <e> <s> they may never appear again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> i endorse all the points that she made <e> <s> i too am grateful to the minister for introducing the amendment <e> <s> it is definitely better that there should be a responsibility on the regional health authority to consult rather than that there should not be a responsibility to consult <e> <s> i am grateful for small mercies those are all the mercies that we have and we must be grateful for them <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is associated with this amendment and i shall do no more than say that i support it <e>", "<cs> of course it is <e> <s> that is what my noble friend lord peston and i have been saying <e>", "<cs> my lords it was certainly not my intention nor i believe that of the noble lord lord hunter that such a decision should be considered as something to be taken lightly <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this brings us back to the question of ballots <e> <s> i hope the minister will consider that there is a problem here <e> <s> she said the measure could represent a form of threat <e> <s> however it could also work the other way for a group which wanted to retain a trust <e> <s> it is the basis of what might be an unfortunate argument <e> <s> this is an issue which could be dealt with in some form of guidance <e> <s> i hope the minister will get the department to give some thought to this question <e> <s> there is a problem here and i know that my noble friend lord hunter feels so too <e> <s> perhaps the minister agrees with us <e> <s> in any case i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was surprised to hear the minister say that there would be no effect on patient care <e> <s> is she aware that the district manager mr david knowles at the time of the announcement of the bed closures said that the total effect on patients would be very significant indeed <e> <s> no one could deny that its impact on london was traumatic in the extreme <e> <s> at a time when there are bed closures in many parts of the country is it at all surprising that the secretary of state yesterday used the occasion of a television programme to argue his case for more funds for the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that as the minister said on th april these bed closures will be reviewed on st march but that it is unlikely that they will be reopened <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much we on this side of the house welcome the ministers announcement <e> <s> will she tell us roughly the size of the sum involved and why it has taken all this time to move away from a system that was disadvantageous to the district health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome these amendments as far as they go but they do not really go very far <e> <s> as amendments nos <e> <s> and seek to tackle the problems touched on by the governments amendments i think it will be best to leave the arguments until those amendments are proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> she said that the new clause is <e>", "<cs> my lords it was this particular front about which i was asking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for her comments <e> <s> one of her supporters is the noble lord lord mccoll who gave an example of quite extraordinary incompetence by a health authority which seemed to me to be quite irrelevant to the new clause which we are seeking to persuade the government to accept <e> <s> none of us in his right <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment which also carries my name <e> <s> i thank the noble baronesses lady robson and lady cox because they have put forward reasons that can hardly be refuted <e> <s> when the noble baroness lady cox speaks she speaks from the depths of experience of a profession in the national health service an experience that most of us do not possess <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say from what he is quoting and to what it relates <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was to what they were referring when they made that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords it was well before i became secretary of state for social services but i thought that in the interests of my predecessor i ought to find out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for replying <e> <s> the amendment was designed to help and not to be obstructive <e> <s> i believe that the minister sensed that <e> <s> she referred to wholesale delays <e> <s> i have to deal with wholesale delays on one side and on the opposite side my noble friend who says that the delay is not long enough <e> <s> i believed that the proposal to introduce a years delay was reasonable <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister has not accepted that proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords for once the minister has been very persuasive <e> <s> she has convinced me to withdraw the amendment not because i do not agree with it nor because i thought her solution was better than mine but because i appreciate that there will be detailed guidance <e> <s> the practice will be required to prove that all partners agree which is very important <e> <s> they must be able to provide the information necessary that is also important and there will be certain requirements on standards <e> <s> i want to read again what the minister said on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of that helpful explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> i am glad that we do not at present have a liberal-democrat government wildly unlikely as that is <e> <s> the ministers reply was a jolly sight better than i could have expected from the noble lord lord winstanley who does not want such a report <e> <s> i am very satisfied with the reply which shows that the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> it was a probing amendment which has produced a reply for which i am grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdaw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is one of those giving support to this amendment and i want to support it very strongly <e> <s> i want first to congratulate the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley on the way in which he moved it because he brought together all the arguments <e> <s> he very kindly sent me a copy of the letter that he sent on th june to the noble baroness lady hooper the minister <e> <s> i thought the letter was very succinct in its presentation of the case <e> <s> that was the first point that made me glad about this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the group will be able to act on its own or will it still act at the request of the secretary of state or the health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> my name appears on the list <e> <s> it has reached third place <e> <s> the first time the amendment appeared my name did not get there at all <e> <s> perhaps i got into the middle and pushed the others outwards <e> <s> i too warmly welcome the governments initiative which is an important step forward <e> <s> it is very much in line with concerns which were expressed on both sides of the house on second reading and in committee <e> <s> i agree with all that has been said it is too small a step <e>", "<cs> my lords both our names are down jointly <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that before the noble lord sits down he will not mind changing

baroness winds up the debate with the leave of the house i should like to make a proposal <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kilmarnock said the series of amendments to the government amendment have not been taken <e> <s> we have not spoken directly to them <e> <s> i hope that at the end of our debates whether it is today or on third reading we shall not be making a choice between the governments proposals and those of the noble lord lord young <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is right <e> <s> homeless people have the same rights as others the problem is that they do not have the same opportunities <e> <s> i am afraid that for many years the government have said that they recognise the problem of homelessness but have not taken action to deal with it <e> <s> homelessness has worsened year after year <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been noted that during the committee and report stages i have endeavoured to ensure that there is written into the bill the awareness of the government and parliament that we need to make special provision for the elderly and disabled and for other underprivileged groups <e> <s> successive ministers have given reassuring answers <e> <s> i have always had to say that i was not satisfied with those reassuring answers and that is what i say now <e> <s> in a years time when the bill comes into operation we shall see whether the needs of these people whether they be homeless elderly or disabled are better looked after or worse <e> <s> i have my fears but shall not press the amendment to a vote tonight <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand why the minister could not do so <e> <s> it is an unsatisfactory amendment <e> <s> i was just doing my best <e> <s> that is all it was <e> <s> the minister has convinced me that the amendment in its present form is not satisfactory but she has gone further than that <e> <s> she has given two very important assurances which i think will be very satisfactory to the medical profession <e> <s> in particular i am glad that there will be consultation before the regulations are drafted <e> <s> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case amendment no <e> <s> is not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the minister said that this would not be in conformity with the views of the government about the errors of any central direction <e> <s> that is where the government and i and those on these benches must part company <e> <s> this happens to be one issue <e> <s> i believe that there are certain issues which the government must state as a matter of national policy <e> <s> this is one such issue on the basis of equal treatment <e> <s> i agree with the minister and i am sure that everything she said is being done <e> <s> i believe that she would have wished to have an even stronger impact provided in an amendment such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said politely and constructively what the noble lord lord mccoll said in brief <e> <s> he said i do not know what good this amendment will do <e> <s> the minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness finally sits down perhaps i may ask her why she feels that it is better to leave the matter in vague terms rather than to be specific <e> <s> will she take on board the point made by her noble friend lady faithfull who was arguing that if these matters are written on to the face of the bill the public the local authorities and everyone else who reads the bill will know that certain categories of people who need care will be included <e> <s> why is it best to leave that in vague terms <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> does he not think that there is something very strange in the way the government decide that tomorrow the day after these amendments are debated in your lordships house they will publish guidelines for discussion <e> <s> does he not feel that that shows disrespect for noble lords and noble baronesses who have spoken with experience on behalf of a vast range of organisations that are interested <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite extraordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords or is it a water authority <e>", "<cs> my lords if no indication is given as to how long temporary is does the minister not agree that there will be all kinds of argumentation with the authority about whether six months three months or a year is necessary <e> <s> surely there has to be some clarification of that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are entitled to ask questions <e> <s> if an amendment is moved which we do not understand how can we possibly take a decision on it <e> <s> i thought it was clear from earlier advice taken through the appropriate channels that we were entitled to ask questions otherwise what is a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i can think of no answer that the government can give <e> <s> i entirely agree with everything said by the noble lords lord allen of abbeydale and lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment stands in my name as well as that of the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> she has made an overwhelming case and i simply wish to summarise one or two points <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness says that the secretary of state will require how does he require other than by legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she accept that it is precisely the voluntary organisations with whom i know she has been in consultation that support this amendment <e> <s> was the impression that she gained from her consultation with them that in fact they thought that this amendment was the way to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i will withdraw the amendment not because i have been convinced by the noble lords arguments but because i am convinced that there is not much point in putting it to a division <e> <s> in his reply the noble lord referred to my noble friend lord carter we thought we would provide an alternative with at least the two of us making the same argument as having presented the worst case in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i only say that i thought his argument in defence was the worst defence <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i shall withdraw what i intended to say <e> <s> i intended to say that the minister had made the worst defence but as he did not accuse my noble friend i shall not accuse him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that helpful explanation of the fact that what is proposed in the amendment will be effected as she said <e> <s> i am grateful to her for her careful answer and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord seebohm and lord mottistone for their work in preparing the amendment following their discussions within the department <e> <s> speaking from these benches and as president of mind i totally support the argument <e> <s> i agree with both noble lords that this is an extremely important amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness really saying that it was necessary for the draft guidelines to be published after todays debate and that that could not have been done before <e> <s> i find that very difficult to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords does the guidance deal with the days notice <e> <s> does it deal specifically with the issue in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> my lords t am grateful to the minister for her reply but my view has not changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask as one who for many years spoke as a minister in another place whether it is conceivable that a cabinet minister can give a personal view as opposed to a collective view of the government <e> <s> are not the world and all of us entitled to expect that what is said by one cabinet minister represents the views of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords let us move away from semantics <e> <s> i have two questions for the noble baroness <e> <s> first is it still the governments aim to see more and more health care provided by the private sector as opposed to the national health service <e> <s> secondly will she accept that by snipping away at nhs provisions such as the introduction of charges for eyesight tests the health of the nation is increasingly imperilled as a result of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness reconsider the words that she has just spoken <e> <s> the british medical association represents the vast majority of consultants hospital doctors and general practitioners in this country <e> <s> to speak of them in such a way on behalf of the government in your lordships house is surely a disgraceful way to treat the profession <e> <s> does she agree that it is absolutely vital that the medical profession enjoin with the government in what they are trying to do <e> <s> is not such an intervention likely to do damage to the relationship with the medical profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i give the fullest possible support to the amendment which stands also in my name <e> <s> the noble baroness is correct <e> <s> if community care is to become a reality it is vital that the established methods of working together embodied in multi-disciplinary teams should have some formal recognition within the bill to ensure the best possible and most appropriate services for consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> it would have been a great advanatage to have the draft guidance in front of us so that we could try to speak with the same authority as the minister <e> <s> however he is obviously very much seized of the problem and i am glad that he accepted that there needs to be a review depending on the nature of the condition of the person <e> <s> as the noble lord lord swinfen said the condition of people varies <e> <s> the condition of some people will be stable while that of others will change particularly as they age <e>", "<cs> my lords i can condense what i have to say into one sentence <e> <s> in my view it is utterly deplorable that here we are four years after the bill was enacted having to ask that its provisions be implemented <e> <s> that is terrible <e>", "<cs> my lords four years have elapsed since the enactment of the bill <e> <s> therefore how can the minister say that the government will proceed with all possible speed <e> <s> i know that they have an agreement to take the implementation of all three sections together but if they had wanted to implement them they would have been able to do so <e> <s> i am sure that the local authorities would have been prepared to go along with them rather than see a four-year delay <e> <s> the situation is really quite intolerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> it is important that as many disabled people as possible and as many as can cope should have the independence to negotiate and be involved in their own packages <e> <s> by packages we mean life enhancement <e> <s> there is a great deal of support for that policy <e> <s> it is a pity that the government have not brought forward an amendment to deal with the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down does that mean that there could be consultation before third reading in the hope of some agreement on an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords having been so critical of the failure of the government to move and since my name is on the amendment i thought i should speak <e> <s> i am grateful on this particular occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> on the third day of the report stage i spoke at length about the problems that would be faced in the near <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make some comment on amendment no <e> <s> as well as on other amendments <e> <s> at committee stage in congratulating the minister on tabling the amendment concerning the clinical standards advisory group i said that there were issues which concerned many of us <e> <s> some of those concerns were reflected in amendments though most of them have been subsequently withdrawn <e> <s> however they will reappear in one form or another at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble lords remarks <e> <s> i hope he will agree that when we come to legislate on such issues we are not legislating for a particular government or for a particular secretary of state we must legislate for whatever government is in power and for whichever secretary of state is involved <e> <s> in my view clarity is absolutely essential <e> <s> i have served as has the noble lord lord carr as a secretary of state <e> <s> the worst thing we can have is legislation which is not clear and which leaves room for argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make exactly the same point <e> <s> on the last occasion when we discussed the matter the minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very surprised by the ministers statement concerning st thomass hospital <e> <s> is she aware of the recent statement by dr anthony kaiser who is consultant for the special baby care unit at st thomass hospital that babies are dying because londons hospitals are underfunded and understaffed <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there have been major cutbacks in expenditure in st thomass which are partly responsible for the situation that i have brought to the attention of both your lordships house and the minister <e> <s> does she really believe that such cutbacks do not indicate complacency <e> <s> does she deny the statement that babies are dying as a result of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i deeply resent any suggestion that my approach to the national health service is negative <e> <s> i have been involved with the national health service for over years on one side of the house or another <e> <s> i am involved with countless medical organizations i am president of the college of occupational therapists and so forth <e> <s> my approach is very positive <e> <s> tomorrow i am presiding all day at a conference which i convened on co-operation my lords i am being attacked <e> <s> i am defending myself and i have a right in your lordships house so to do <e> <s> tomorrow i am presiding at a large conference on co-operation in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is true that there has been marvellous progress in medical science and in the health service during successive governments over and more years <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never been to ascot but i know that many noble lords and noble baronesses go there for ladies day <e> <s> it would be nice if some of them had come here today because undoubtedly it has been ladies day in the house of lords <e> <s> it has been an historic event <e> <s> the bill was presented by a noble baroness two noble baronesses have made their maiden speeches and another noble baroness will reply to the debate <e> <s> my researchers tell me that during the centuries of history of your lordships house it is the first time that such an event has occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise <e> <s> it is so easy to make these mistakes at moments of tension and pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the best that the noble lord will get <e> <s> however i apologise most sincerely <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to be very brief in giving my total support to the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh and so well argued by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i do not need to set out the arguments i simply want the minister to accept the amendment because she has said that it is government policy <e> <s> the secretary of state has said that it is government policy <e> <s> the minister cannot be against an integrated comprehensive child care service nor can she be opposed to the links with the local authority <e> <s> it would be nice if on this day this celebratory day she were to accept what we know is already government policy and put it on the face of the bill <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords there never was a green paper <e> <s> it was a white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all those who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i am especially grateful to the noble baroness for her kind words about my head and my heart being in the right places <e> <s> it was reassuring to hear that because sometimes one wonders whether they have been overturned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for her forthcoming response <e> <s> i should not wish to give primacy to community health councils as opposed to gps <e> <s> i appreciated what she said about the role of gps <e> <s> however i do not believe that their role is simply to convey the views of patients it is to convey their own views as a result of their contact with patients <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will not be surprised to hear that i profoundly disagree with the conclusions of the government <e> <s> i said that during each stage of the bill <e> <s> i have had consultations with bodies such as the royal college of nursing and other nursing bodies with the british medical association and other trade unions representing groups within the national health service and with a number of bodies representing professions allied to medicine <e> <s> they are all deeply disturbed by the proposal <e> <s> they all believe that the government are going in the wrong direction <e> <s> i promised them that at every stage of the bill i would argue their case <e> <s> i have done so and i have failed and achieved nothing <e> <s> however the government will rue the day that they took the decision <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has set out the arguments clearly <e> <s> i rise to say that i support the case and i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too support this amendment <e> <s> i want first to say that i admire the way in which the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth has plodded on and has taken this amendment through each of the stages but always in conjunction with the minister <e> <s> i hope that she has totally satisfied the minister but this has all been <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> this is the first time that my arguments have really convinced the government <e> <s> i am deeply touched <e>", "<cs> my lords we must accept a very substantial gap between noble lords who spoke tonight and in earlier debates and the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had more than hours debate on the bill in your lordships house <e> <s> i want to thank noble lords on all sides of the house for the time and the trouble they have taken during the course of those long debates <e> <s> i want <e>", "<cs> not so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale is a master of understatement and also of profound judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down would she confirm that she agreed with ring-fencing alcohol and drug projects <e> <s> if i understood her aright does that not undermine the whole of her argument against ring-fencing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he recall any previous occasion when your lordships have debated the commons handling of debates in your lordships house when we have not been able to have the relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord renton has taken the words out of my mouth <e> <s> he has however set out the situation much better than i could have done <e> <s> i agree that the reason given on th june that the association of chief police officers did not agree simply did not stand up <e> <s> it was not good enough <e> <s> we cannot be told by the police how we should legislate <e> <s> the police do not determine the law they have to seek to assist in applying it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister really saying that she does not think that the housing part of a local authority and the community care part of a local authority should consult <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept in relation to the answer given to the noble lord lord bonham-carter that the minister has <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible to tell whether a case is urgent or not until the result of the screening is known <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that there is a good deal of concern when delays in receiving results from laboratories can be as much as several months <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware how grateful i am to him for having clarified the fact that there will need to be a change in the role of community health councils <e> <s> does he accept that under the new style of commercial management of the health authorities it is even more important that the views of the consumers of health services should be fully understood and taken into consideration <e> <s> in answer to the noble baroness he stated that there will be some change <e> <s> is it not time that that change was known to the community health councils and to the many voluntary organisations which look to and have members on the community health councils <e>", "<cs> my lords when is in due course <e> <s> the community health councils and the voluntary organisations are intensely interested in the health service <e> <s> they wish to know what the future holds for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to be associated with the remarks made about the hospice movement <e> <s> is it not deeply disturbing that some hospices in the country have not yet received any nhs funding <e> <s> can the minister say how many are in that category <e> <s> can she also say what effect the changes in income support will have on the funding of the hospice movement <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister does not accept the figures published by london transport from what other sources does the ministry obtain its information <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that her department recently published the results of a survey which showed that the requirement was not for fewer but for twice as many chiropodists <e> <s> is she aware that at present there is a tremendous growth in the number of elderly people requiring chiropody services <e> <s> is she aware also that the nhs chiropody service in london is almost at crisis point <e> <s> she sounded as though there is a marvellous success story <e> <s> she should speak to the old people because there is no such success story <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat puzzled <e> <s> is the noble baroness suggesting that those who run the nhs trusts will be employed by the national health service as opposed to being employed by the trusts and that the premises will continue to be in the ownership of the nhs rather than the ownership of the trusts <e> <s> secondly how can the government justify spending million of nhs money on conservative propaganda in the leaflet <e>", "<cs> my lords did i mishear the minister <e> <s> did she say that the purpose of the taxpayer-funded campaign on the nhs reforms was in retaliation against the doctors campaign against aspects of these reforms <e> <s> is that the set-up <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that she is or is not committed to the timetable accepted in the legislation to which my noble friend referred namely that it should be implemented from st april <e> <s> if she is not will she please say so <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that local authorities and voluntary organisations who are providing community care and the million carers themselves will be absolutely shocked if the government do not proceed with the legislation which both houses have recently passed <e> <s> would that not be a cynical betrayal for electoral purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government to provide the money to enable the local authorities and the voluntary organisations to go ahead with implementing the legislation passed by both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear to everyone that with a steadily ageing population and with improved but more costly medical treatment the objective must be to spend a higher proportion of gross domestic product on our national health service as does almost every other industrialised country <e> <s> if we were for instance to spend per cent <e> <s> of gdp instead of per cent <e> <s> still a much lower percentage than the united states france or germany roughly how much would that cost <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the noble baroness for reading the statement made by her right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> but i am afraid that this is the extent of the thanks that i can give her <e>", "<cs> my lords in consultation with the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not been critical of the community care proposals <e> <s> from these benches we have merely tried to give some strength to them to give some consultation to them and to ensure that they took place <e>", "<cs> whose muddle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way again <e> <s> i understand that there has been no request from the local authority associations and no indication that they are not ready <e> <s> they are all anxious to proceed and there has been no consultation with them so i understand although the minister did not reply before an announcement is suddenly made to the house that the whole plans have been suspended over a three-year period <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the assurances given by the minister <e> <s> however can she explain why there are such large regional differences in the spread of aids in the statistics in her departments publication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> however there must be a very profound or precise reason why there seems to be times the proportion of drug users with hiv in scotland than in wales <e> <s> is there any explanation which the noble baroness can give the house <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that there is a frequent comparison with from different ministers on different questions why under this question will the minister not give the figures for <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government decided to accept the advice of mr justice ognall to settle the claims of haemophiliacs infected by aids virus <e> <s> does the noble lord agree with the judge that the department has a moral responsibility to do so without any more ungracious haggling with these unfortunate people <e>", "<cs> my lords the question deals with the risk of people being infected with blood <e> <s> i should have thought that my question was absolutely relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept the fact that there is a good deal of anxiety about the subject <e> <s> in the light of that and recognising that the position of the general medical council was taken two years ago since when the aids situation has greatly advanced will he not ask his right honourable friend to reconsider the matter <e> <s> does the minister accept as was said by the noble lord lord ezra that almost everyone admitted to hospital has a blood test and that the patient is not saying i am prepared to be tested for this but not for that <e> <s> surely whatever the result of a blood test the information is important and the department should reconsider the answer that the minister has given <e>", "<cs> i did <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> but he was not talking about compensation as those are relatively small sums <e> <s> is he aware that there is growing anxiety and deep feeling among members on all political benches and also among the general public that the secretary of state

people are obliged to press their claims for compensation through the courts many of them may well be dead by the time the result is made known <e> <s> does the minister agree that it is not a matter of cash but of honour <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree <e> <s> in my view this is the best possible time for such a debate <e> <s> is it not appalling that people who quite clearly could only have contracted hiv and aids because of the blood they were given which they were required to have should have to argue their case before a court in all these circumstances <e> <s> surely it is at this
