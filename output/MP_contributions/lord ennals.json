["<cs> my lords may i first declare a personal interest although not a financial interest <e> <s> it is that declared by a number of noble lords a great enthusiasm for rugby football <e> <s> i played it a lot and i was proud to represent my regiment in its team <e> <s> secondly i was the founder chairman years ago of the anti-apartheid movement to which reference was made by my noble friend lord brockway and which launched the sports boycott <e>", "<cs> my lords on prescription charges how can the minister justify what is in fact an per cent <e> <s> increase since <e> <s> is he not aware that there are many needy people particularly the unemployed who actually cannot afford the medication which they have been prescribed <e> <s> on the greenfield report is he aware that many people will feel that his answer is not a satisfactory one <e> <s> if he looks very carefully at recommendation to which the noble lord lord kilmarnock referred in no way is the doctors clinical freedom interfered with at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that it restricts the clinical freedom of doctors <e> <s> may i challenge him on that because according to recommendation every doctor is entitled to say that he wishes a particular prescription to be for a particu-lar brand <e> <s> how can that be restricting his clinical freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is an increasing number of gp hospitals that are now being proposed for closure <e> <s> does he know of any case in which this is being done because the standards of clinical care for patients in the hospital have sunk below the normal level <e> <s> will he not agree that these small hospitals provide an invaluable service not only to their patients but also in linking the community services with the hospitals <e> <s> if hospitals are at stake what about the other that exist up and down the country <e> <s> cannot the noble lord take a more positive view about this rather than simply saying that it is a matter for other people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that four times during the three questions today he has referred to the responsibility being not that of the secretary of state but that of the health authorities <e> <s> as the secretary of state is restricting the amount of money available for the health authorities is it not time that he gave some lead in terms of priorities in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for her reply does this not reveal a very disturbing situation <e> <s> will not the noble baroness accept that in order to save million the government have decided that per cent <e> <s> of nhs optical patients will cease to be eligible for nhs spectacles lenses and frames <e> <s> since a high proportion of these are pensioners and since pensioners are seeing their income go down in relation to earnings does she not feel some concern on behalf of the government <e> <s> with the increase in prescription charges and dental charges is not this just another attack upon the services provided by the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the answer which the noble baroness has just given mean that she is going to add another means test <e> <s> why should this be the case <e> <s> is it not grossly unfair to elderly pensioners whether or not they have to wait four years like me and i do not know whether it is in the interests of the house that my age should be revealed across the dispatch box that they all of a sudden now find that they are going to have to pay in some cases much more <e> <s> it has nothing to do with competition <e> <s> would the noble baroness not agree that this is very unfair to the pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble baroness on appearing so much younger than she is <e> <s> why are the unemployed not included on her list <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how many doctors and nurses were affected by the cut in manpower introduced for the first time ever last year <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister understand that if one seeks from for instance the royal college of nursing the total number of trained nurses who are unemployed one gets a figure of between and because they do not know and the department does not know <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that the royal college of nursing would greatly welcome such an inquiry as i have been assured only today <e> <s> why did the minister give such a negative answer <e> <s> will the noble lord convey to his right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services the feeling that exists that it is gravely unsatisfactory that we do not know about how many doctors and nurses available and trained by this country are not now available for use in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is most grateful to my noble friend lord molloy for raising this matter and i think that each of the contributions in the debate has come from people with a very great knowledge <e> <s> it has been an extremely valuable debate <e> <s> of course i agree that the drug industry is open to criticism and in a moment or so i shall make my criticisms of the industry <e> <s> however i want to take up the point put forward by the noble lord lord chelwood because i believe that the value of the contribution of british-made medicines to the balance of payments which last year was over million is enormous <e> <s> this is one of the most success-ful industries in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally delighted that my noble friend lady gaitskell paid the warm tribute that she did to the national health service for restoring her to full health enabling her to give a bit of passion to this debate <e> <s> i am also grateful to see the noble baroness lady faithfull return because the noble baronesses have distinguished themselves today <e> <s> i should before saying that have thanked the noble lord lord hunter of newington for enabling the noble baronesses to do so and for the excellent speech which he made <e> <s> i am sorry that lady cox has had to leave but she left after making what i thought was an outstanding speech <e> <s> i hope she reads <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister one question <e> <s> the noble lord the minister is arguing his case very effectively <e> <s> i simply want to know why the view he now holds was not held and carried into practice at the time of the reorganisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to congratulate most sincerely the noble lord lord campbell of croy for piloting his bill through the house <e> <s> when it had its first reading i spoke briefly from the dispatch box and said that i warmly supported it though i saw it as very much a second tier or a less favourable bill than that which had been proceeded with by my noble friend lord longford <e> <s> i greatly regret the decision of the government for i can take it as no other to use their influence to ensure the defeat of that bill so that it was not referred to another place <e> <s> therefore in my mind this bill introduced by the noble lord lord campbell assumes much greater significance <e> <s> i want warmly to welcome it <e>"]
