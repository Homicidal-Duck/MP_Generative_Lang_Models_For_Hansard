["<cs> my lords a short while ago i was handed a telegram which had been sent to me by my colleagues on the south glamorgan county council <e> <s> it says good luck with your maiden <e> <s> i am not sure whether they misunderstand what happens in your lordships house but when i return to south glamorgan i shall tell them that the exercise was carried out briefly and non-controversially and i am sure that any illusions they may have will be wiped away <e>", "<cs> my lords- <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord bruce of donington said we have had the white paper for only a very short time and there is one problem that has been worrying me for some time <e> <s> it is stated somewhere in the white paper that the government have no direct control over local government expenditure of course we all know that to be true <e> <s> but in paragraph of the white paper we are told that <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who made his maiden speech only a fortnight ago i feel somewhat presumptuous in congratulating my noble friends lord stewart of fulham lord lever of manchester and lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl but i did say earlier that the indictment of the governments policies is the speed at which they have arrived at them <e> <s> the noble earl seems to be implying in his intervention that nobody has been affected and that there are no cuts <e> <s> if that is so what on earth have local government been engaged upon in the last few months <e> <s> i see the noble earl wants to intervene again <e> <s> i have given way once <e> <s> i think i should be allowed to make my point <e> <s> the fact is that in my county alone million has been cut from current expenditure from present plans which were arrived at over six months ago <e> <s> the impression that the noble earl is trying to give is that there are no cuts <e> <s> if there are no cuts what on earth have we got a white paper for <e>", "<cs> my lords in any case i should have thought that the burden of my message is not so much that there are going to be cuts in government expenditure but that there are poor wretches on whom these cuts are going to fall <e> <s> that is what i was getting at <e> <s> one noble lord in this debate said that he did not want to finish on a pessimistic note <e> <s> neither do i somebody wrote somewhere that each nation has its secret collective dread <e> <s> in america it is communism in france it is revolution in germany it is inflation and in britain it is unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many british workers working in other member states are in fact sleeping rough because they cannot get accommodation and i am referring specifically to building trade workers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness not aware that many local authorities are forcing the adult education sector to bear a disproportionate share of these cuts <e> <s> is the minister further aware that many local authorities in preparing their educational budgets have increased the evening class fees very substantially indeed <e> <s> one particular local authority has increased its fees by per cent <e> <s> and while on the surface the classes will remain in practice and in fact many people will not be able to afford these fees and that sector of the educational activities of the local authorities will fall by the wayside <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord to give way on that point <e> <s> would be not agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords not in hong kong <e>", "<cs> we were provoked <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount will give way for a moment <e> <s> will he not accept that the social and regional funds of the eec are constantly under-spent and would it not be to the advantage of the people of wales if the government were to press for extra moneys for areas like wales which are suffering the terrible consequences of these closures <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> as the government have suggested an enhanced role for the voluntary sector in the light of the public expenditure cuts would the minister not agree that many voluntary organisations are already operating on a shoestring and will be further hit by the fact that local government will be unable to help them <e> <s> does he not feel that the government should allocate extra resources to the voluntary sector in order that it can play its enhanced role <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord not have been a little more explicit in his answer to my noble friend lord lee <e> <s> is it not the case that if the government were to suggest selling those parts of publicly-owned industries which did not show a profit they simply would not be able to sell them for that very reason <e> <s> private investors would not be interested in purchasing them <e> <s> therefore that leaves only the profitable parts of public ownership and it is the intention of the government to sell off the profitable parts of publicly-owned industry <e>", "<cs> i have other amendments in this group <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of all the possible permutations that the minister has suggested might come about if we were to vote on the matter i shall press my amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the minister has said i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord james of rusholme has missed a very important <e>", "<cs> may i put another welsh point to the noble baroness <e> <s> she said quite rightly that special schools should be treated in precisely the same way as other schools <e> <s> that will be correct if the government are expecting as they obviously are to have an unamended bill at the end of the day <e> <s> but if the noble baroness had listened to and conceded some of the points that have been put on previous amendments then she would have been able to say yes of course we can concede this amendment because the special schools will then be treated in exactly the same way as the other schools <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady david has made one of the two points i was going to make <e> <s> the other point is that i am not convinced by the ministers reply <e> <s> a figure of pupils with two teacher governors even with the inclusion of a further foundation governor would not necessarily make the governing body unwieldy <e> <s> however i shall not press my amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if biographies of this kind were made available to all the electors in an area that would tend to make parents who have children at school all the more interested in what was going on in the school <e> <s> i am in favour of secret ballots in principleindeed following our experience a few moments ago it would not be a bad idea if we had a secret ballot to decide who is to move certain amendments <e> <s> time and again yesterday it was said that very often governing bodies of schools are packed with party hacks <e> <s> if biographies of candidates were to be handed to those who were to elect school governors such hacks would be brought to light <e> <s> i have sat on governing bodies and have been quite unaware sometimes although i have been suspicious of the political leanings of some of the governorsthey hide it very successfully on occasions and indeed there are more non-political conservatives on governing bodies on which i have sat than i thought there were in the whole of the country <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was absolutely right <e> <s> the ideal situation is for a local authority to have a high standard in all its schools but unfortunately that does not apply in many areas of the country and perhaps i may cite my own example <e> <s> until there were five schools in my area which did not have sixth forms so clearly there was tremendous interest within those catchment areas on the part of parents to get <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will give way at that point it seems to me to be the essence of the argument <e> <s> what we are saying is that it is a tiny minority who will be having the choice <e> <s> when a parent goes along to an appeals committee the parent does not say i have come to listen to the reasons why my child cannot go to the school of my <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble baroness has not really addressed herself to the very serious problem that many local authorities will be facing on her own admission fairly shortly as a result of about one million fewer schoolchildren in our schools <e> <s> she also seemed to be assuming that education authorities are rational beings not persuaded by pressures and who always behave in a uniform manner <e> <s> they simply do not do so <e> <s> many local authoritities will need the protection of a limit on their entry in order that they will be able to retain some kind of rational system of education within their boundaries <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by offering an apology to your lordships for not attending the early part of this debate <e> <s> i arranged that i should speak rather late in the afternoon because i had to attend an important meeting which i could not possibly avoid <e> <s> i think it is inevitable that if i were to make a speech at length i should be repeating much of what has gone before <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord listowel for arranging this debate but i am most pleased that i was here to listen to my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> i have been listening to him and reading him for more than years and whenever i listen to him the words of conrad come to me <e> <s> he said that mankind was forever walking on a thin crust which was likely to open up and engulf him at any time <e> <s> i think the time is drawing near when something like the kind of proposals contained in the brandt report must be put into operation if our world is to survive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very puzzled by the series of answers that the noble lord has given <e> <s> indeed whenever the noble lord lord cockfield replies to questions i am never quite sure whether he is giving us good news or bad news <e> <s> which is it on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the government front bench has made great play throughout the whole of the passage of this bill on the freedom it is giving to local authorities <e> <s> but there is another bill which will shortly come before your lordships house which is opposed in many respects by the local authority associations and particularly by the association of county councillors which is conservative dominated <e> <s> is it not the case that many of the so-called freedoms which local government is being given in this bill much of which we would dispute are going to be taken away from them in another bill to come before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> the secretary of state for industry said on th november <e>", "<cs> before i make my main comments on this amendment may i say a word or two to lord mottistone <e> <s> i quite understand the view he has just put that people should stand on their own feet that they should not hang about and wait for auntie government to assist them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that one of the reasons for having high interest rates is to contain inflation <e> <s> as a layman and in a pure spirit of inquiry i wonder whether he can tell us why the higher interest rates go the higher and faster inflation seems to increase <e>", "<cs> i get a little weary and i am sure some of your lordships are wearying of my constantly referring to the fact that much of the economy of wales relies on the fact that the public sector is predominant and the main clause in the bill is to allow the agencies to dispose of assets to promote <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal for introducing this debate on the <e>", "<cs> my lords defence is always the most difficult complicated and emotive subject to be discussed in both houses of parliament <e> <s> there are many members on my side of the house with a number of years interest in this subject and having read the white paper and the whole spate of newspaper reports and comments it is difficult to cover the whole of the statement in a speech which would do it justice but i am aware of the fact that there are a number of noble lords wishing to speak in this debate and i shall try to keep my remarks within tolerable limits <e>", "<cs> i have been a docker and i have worked with black dockers <e> <s> i do not know where the noble lord gets his information from <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should come to cardiff and he would find many black workers in the docks <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i ask him this how does the position affect an employer with more than six perhaps or women where they are in small groups of two or three <e> <s> are they affected by this legislation or are they not <e>", "<cs> could it be that the noble earl is not prepared to accept that when god created man she made a terrible mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the intention of the government declared over and over again to set the local authorities free why do the government insist on interfering with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble lord the minister in particular for reminding us that in recent times the placing of this order has given members of your lordships house an opportunity to go into matters outside the order <e> <s> i am certainly not intending to repeat the performance of i think when members of your lordships house spoke on the order at very great length <e> <s> indeed one noble lord whose speech i read mentioned i think every weapon ever manufactured with the possible exception of the bow and arrow and the gatling gun <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has referred to these missiles being used only by joint decision <e> <s> he will know that there is a great deal of concern as to what exactly this means <e> <s> does it mean that there is a dual key system or does it mean at the end of the day that if the unthinkable happens the finger on the trigger will be an american finger and not a british finger <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin must be feeling very lonely <e> <s> until the last speaker he had virtually nothing to support him but his briefs <e> <s> there is an irony in this occasion because the noble lord lord bellwin as many of your lordships have said has a long and distinguished record of service to local government and he finds himself saddled with a local government measure which is almost universally condemned <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl lord cathcart for initiating this debate <e> <s> i am personally grateful to him because in his usual considerate way he informed me before the debate that he intended to make some comments on the apparent attitude of the labour party to defence <e> <s> i am sorry in a way that this debate is taking place in isolation it would appear <e> <s> there was a debate last week on foreign affairs and defence and anybody who read the <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords it was the noble lord lord chelwood who it seemed to me gave the impression that this betrayal was afoot <e>", "<cs> it is late and i must get on my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i had to take it <e> <s> i do not see why noble lords opposite should not take some of it <e> <s> i suggest that if one looks at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure he would agree that many thousands of young people who have read the speech have interpreted it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that intervention <e> <s> no i did not misunderstand what she said <e> <s> indeed i was going on to develop my theme because i am sure the noble baroness would agree that the more information we can give our young children in the schools about what is actually going on in the world the more likely it is that they will be able to resist any attempts of the kind to which she referred <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is well known that our new chairman is the noble lord lord chalfont and what a good job he is doing <e> <s> i merely emphasised the role in it of the noble earl lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house is aware of the deep interest taken in defence matters by the noble lord lord orr-ewing and i know of course perhaps more than some members of your lordships house of his interest because we share a place on the all-party defence committee <e> <s> we are particularly grateful to the noble lord for introducing this very important topic of air defence <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be pleased to learn that after a very long day i intend to comply with the request of my noble friend the leader of the official opposition and to make my comments as brief as i possibly can <e> <s> it is almost exactly a year since i initiated a debate in this chamber on the social and economic situation in wales and asked the government what policies they were pursuing to <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount would give way on that point <e> <s> would not a better analogy be the story of the man who kept batting his head up against a wall because it was so wonderful when he stopped doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble viscount for his reply may i ask him whether he is aware that many members of both houses involved and concerned in these matters are completely unaware that this situation exists and will his department consult with other relevant departments in order to rectify the situation and to ensure that these youngsters who are unemployed receive exactly the same benefits as youngsters unemployed in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the foreign secretary welcome the statement of the israeli prime minister on television last night that israel would be prepared to sign the non-prolifieration treaty if the hostile arab states would sign a peace treaty with israel <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that much of the hawkish attitude of the israelis is due entirely to the repeated statements by many of the hostile arab states that they are bent on the destruction of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor tell the house how many representations he has received on behalf of the adamsdown community law centre <e>", "<cs> my lords mr arthur davidson paid tribute in another place to the chairman of the select committee on the bill and mr bruce george complimented the minister mr goodhart on his diligent attendance at the committee and also thanked the many witnesses from the ministry of defence <e> <s> i too would like to congratulate the members of the committee the minister and all the witnesses for their work in helping to produce an excellent report <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way on the point he has just made <e> <s> i have continually denounced the activities of the militant tendency in the labour party but would the noble lord not agree that all the classic ingredients for social instability are in our economy at the moment with high unemployment an unstable currency and very high inflation <e> <s> does he not agree that these aspects of our economy are bound to lead to trouble and that they allow these people to make hay <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to congratulate our three maiden speakers two of whom i was able to listen to <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord lord mayhew that i was not in the chamber when he made his speech <e> <s> but i think he will be amused to learn that i remember with some clarity almost the precise moment when he resigned from the labour government because that evening i was due to dine with the then chancellor of the exchequer who turned up rather late and informed me that the government were having a little trouble with one of their defence ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i did not want to lose the note that i had made on what the noble lord lord jenkins had said <e> <s> i was simply referring to what seemed to me to be the core of his speech which was that everything that the western powers were doing was wrong and he made virtually no mention of the external threat from the soviet union <e> <s> i simply wanted to try to put the record a little straighter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise in advance to the house for not being able to remain for the debate <e> <s> i have a long-standing local authority engagement in cardiff this evening <e> <s> i wish in particular to apologise to the noble earl lord cathcart to whom we are all grateful for introducing this debate <e> <s> in the debate initiated by the noble earl lord kimberley on th november last a great many comments were made which in my view did not assist in the aims which are shared by every member of your lordships house <e> <s> we are all agreed that the arms race is becoming more and more dangerous <e> <s> we all believe that nuclear stockpiles are capable of destroying the world many times over and although there are differences over methods there is a general <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the grateful thanks which have already been expressed by previous speakers to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for introducing this debate <e> <s> he was certainly right when he said that this house has within it a great deal of local government expertise <e> <s> indeed that expertise has already been demonstrated by the speeches of my noble friend lord mishcon the noble baroness lady stedman and the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> but of course all this experience presents us with a grave danger of too much repetition and i shall try to be as brief as i possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord shinwell has asked me to apologise to your lordships for having to leave this debate <e> <s> as we all know he invariably stays until the bitter end of such debates but he tells me that he has transport problems and i am sure that your lordships will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i was personally very pleased to see the noble viscount lord trenchard in the chamber this afternoon and taking part in this debate <e> <s> i by no means always agreed with him on these matters but he was unfailingly courteous to myself and to other members of the defence group of your lordships house <e> <s> we are grateful for the talents of those noble lords who we are told are to help us in these affairs but this cannot be a substitute for a minister in your lordships house with clearly defined responsibility for defence matters <e> <s> as the noble earl lord selkirk has said it is to be hoped that the present arrangement is temporary <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord skelmersdale comes to us this evening with an unboggled mind <e> <s> he must surely be feeling rather lonely after listening to an almost uninterrupted condemnation of his governments proposals <e> <s> i had expected at the very least that there would be some measure of support from the government side of the house and i wonder what the minister feels about the charge from a number of his noble friends that this bill is a nationalisation measure <e> <s> my own view is that it is a piece of th century fagin paternalism a philosophy which most of us on this side of the house discarded many years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i am indebted to the honourable member for gateshead east for piloting the bill so far <e> <s> i am delighted that he has used the opportunity of his success in the private members ballot to promote such a useful measure <e> <s> this bill will rectify anomalies in the powers controlling changes to the protection and operation of level crossings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord underhill and to the noble minister lord lucas of chilworth for the support that they have expressed for the bill <e> <s> i am confident that it will receive the fullest support of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill of the noble lord lord harris of high cross to repeal the truck acts is in our view premature <e> <s> the need for the truck acts arose out of the unsatisfactory and in many cases inhuman conditions of employees during the last century <e> <s> the abuses which led to the passing of the truck act and the subsequent truck acts are mercifully no longer present but before agreeing to the wholesale abolition of the five acts which lord harriss bill proposes we should satisfy ourselves that no employee will be worse off by the passage of this bill <e> <s> as has been said by many noble lords there are very good reasons why employers would want to make payment by cheque instead of by cash <e> <s> the security problem has been mentioned on a number of occasions and it is clear that in moving substantial amounts of money great cost is involved and it can be potentially dangerous to those concerned but this must be weighed against the factors affecting the position of those in receipt of cheques instead of cash wages <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have before us a rates bill <e> <s> that was promised in in the event of a conservative victory in the general election <e> <s> this bill seeks to give power to central government to limit the rate levying powers of local government <e> <s> the debate that we are having today <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first heard the noble lord lord beloff speak on local government matters in this house i felt most resentful but i have since learnt that the noble lord brings an otherworldliness to the debates on local government which is almost touching and i am beginning to develop what almost amounts to an affection for him <e> <s> almost always he confines his remarks solely to one or two local authorities or one or two individuals as though they and they alone abused <e>", "<cs> i can understand the problem faced by the minister but i am seriously disappointed by his reply <e> <s> i was hoping that there might be two compelling reasons for him to accept the amendment <e> <s> first i had hoped that he would have pity on us after what happened to us in france last saturday and secondly the tory candidate in the pontrypridd by-election might save his deposit if he can say that the government have accepted the amendment <e> <s> however in the light of what the minister has said i am happy to beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to those noble lords who have contributed to what has been an excellent debate <e> <s> i confined myself almost exclusively to the economic regeneration aspects of this proposal but i was aware that a number of noble lords would be raising matters which i did not cover during my speech <e> <s> the questions of flooding ground water levels and water pollution are matters best studied by the select committee and i agree that the instruction that the noble lord lord moran has tabled is perfectly appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the licensing act <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords from the comments i have just heard i believe that i was wise to ask mr alun evans to put that matter on paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls was disturbed by some of the expressions that were used in the course of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to noble lords and to the noble baroness for their support this evening <e> <s> opposition in your lordships house was described to me on one occasion as being like a british boxer boxing on the continent knocking out his opponent and getting a draw <e> <s> it seems to me that we have achieved rather more than that tonight <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for letting democracy prevail <e> <s> i ask the house to give the bill a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in moving the third reading i can do no better than to refer to the special report of the select committee which over sitting days together with a day to view cardiff bay and no doubt several sittings in private considered every aspect of the bill in the greatest detail <e> <s> your lordships will note from paragraph of the special report that the committee had before it an instruction from this house to pay particular attention to two aspects the achievement of an acceptable water quality standard and the effect on fish migration <e> <s> i draw your lordships attention to the select committees study of those aspects in paragraphs to and i commend the committee on its findings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>"]
