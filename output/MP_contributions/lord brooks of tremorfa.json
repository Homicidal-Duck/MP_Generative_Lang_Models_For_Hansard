["<cs> my lords could the noble lord not have been a little more explicit in his answer to my noble friend lord lee <e> <s> is it not the case that if the government were to suggest selling those parts of publicly-owned industries which did not show a profit they simply would not be able to sell them for that very reason <e> <s> private investors would not be interested in purchasing them <e> <s> therefore that leaves only the profitable parts of public ownership and it is the intention of the government to sell off the profitable parts of publicly-owned industry <e>", "<cs> i have other amendments in this group <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of all the possible permutations that the minister has suggested might come about if we were to vote on the matter i shall press my amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the minister has said i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord james of rusholme has missed a very important <e>", "<cs> may i put another welsh point to the noble baroness <e> <s> she said quite rightly that special schools should be treated in precisely the same way as other schools <e> <s> that will be correct if the government are expecting as they obviously are to have an unamended bill at the end of the day <e> <s> but if the noble baroness had listened to and conceded some of the points that have been put on previous amendments then she would have been able to say yes of course we can concede this amendment because the special schools will then be treated in exactly the same way as the other schools <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady david has made one of the two points i was going to make <e> <s> the other point is that i am not convinced by the ministers reply <e> <s> a figure of pupils with two teacher governors even with the inclusion of a further foundation governor would not necessarily make the governing body unwieldy <e> <s> however i shall not press my amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if biographies of this kind were made available to all the electors in an area that would tend to make parents who have children at school all the more interested in what was going on in the school <e> <s> i am in favour of secret ballots in principleindeed following our experience a few moments ago it would not be a bad idea if we had a secret ballot to decide who is to move certain amendments <e> <s> time and again yesterday it was said that very often governing bodies of schools are packed with party hacks <e> <s> if biographies of candidates were to be handed to those who were to elect school governors such hacks would be brought to light <e> <s> i have sat on governing bodies and have been quite unaware sometimes although i have been suspicious of the political leanings of some of the governorsthey hide it very successfully on occasions and indeed there are more non-political conservatives on governing bodies on which i have sat than i thought there were in the whole of the country <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was absolutely right <e> <s> the ideal situation is for a local authority to have a high standard in all its schools but unfortunately that does not apply in many areas of the country and perhaps i may cite my own example <e> <s> until there were five schools in my area which did not have sixth forms so clearly there was tremendous interest within those catchment areas on the part of parents to get <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble baroness has not really addressed herself to the very serious problem that many local authorities will be facing on her own admission fairly shortly as a result of about one million fewer schoolchildren in our schools <e> <s> she also seemed to be assuming that education authorities are rational beings not persuaded by pressures and who always behave in a uniform manner <e> <s> they simply do not do so <e> <s> many local authoritities will need the protection of a limit on their entry in order that they will be able to retain some kind of rational system of education within their boundaries <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by offering an apology to your lordships for not attending the early part of this debate <e> <s> i arranged that i should speak rather late in the afternoon because i had to attend an important meeting which i could not possibly avoid <e> <s> i think it is inevitable that if i were to make a speech at length i should be repeating much of what has gone before <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord listowel for arranging this debate but i am most pleased that i was here to listen to my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> i have been listening to him and reading him for more than years and whenever i listen to him the words of conrad come to me <e> <s> he said that mankind was forever walking on a thin crust which was likely to open up and engulf him at any time <e> <s> i think the time is drawing near when something like the kind of proposals contained in the brandt report must be put into operation if our world is to survive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very puzzled by the series of answers that the noble lord has given <e> <s> indeed whenever the noble lord lord cockfield replies to questions i am never quite sure whether he is giving us good news or bad news <e> <s> which is it on this occasion <e>"]
