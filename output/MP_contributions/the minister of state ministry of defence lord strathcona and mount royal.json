["<cs> my lords i assume that <e>", "<cs> rose to move that this house welcomes the governments intention to accord a higher priority to defence and to strengthen our contribution to the north atlantic alliance <e> <s> the noble lord said my lords i should perhaps begin by explaining that we <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the arrangements for the assignment and targetting of our polaris force and elements of the united states strategic forces remain in accordance with the criteria laid down in the statement on nuclear defence systems of st december and subsequent statements such as that of st october <e>", "<cs> my lords her <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend has already announced in another place her majestys government are pursuing their objective of giving the public the chance to participate directly in bnocs oil-producing business <e> <s> a statement will be made in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the iranian order involved the supply of over shir tanks <e> <s> when the iranians repudiated their contract with us in february of this year it was necessary for us to bring the contracts with the royal ordnance factory leeds and its subcontractors to an end <e> <s> rof leeds were then left with a small number of partly <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are firmly committed to maintaining the effectiveness of the united kingdoms strategic deterrent both cruise and ballistic missiles are among the options being considered for any possible successor system <e> <s> we are satisfied that nothing in the salt ii agreement will prevent us from maintaining the strategic capability of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the homes insulation scheme provides for the payment of percentage grants subject to a maximum related to the cost of installing basic insulation in an average dwelling <e> <s> an equivalent scheme for factories is therefore not a real option in view of the great diversity of both size and construction among industrial buildings <e> <s> as i am sure the noble baroness knows grants for insulating industrial and commercial premises are already available under the energy conservation scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord peart for the very robust ending to his speech with which i heartily concur <e> <s> i also should like to congratulate my noble friend <e> <s> he must almost have achieved a record of packing in a number of technical questions in a short speech <e> <s> i can assure him that i am adequately briefed but like the noble lord lord peart i do not want to trespass too far on the patience of the house by going too deeply into all the questions he has asked even supposing i knew all the answers or was at liberty to give them even if i knew them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have already taken a major step towards improving the capability of the territorial army by putting into effect the main recommendations of the shapland report <e> <s> these include the increase in bounties which we are confident will significantly cut down the losses in trained manpower which the ta has experienced in recent years as well as providing an attractive incentive to potential recruits and a number of further measures to improve training standards <e> <s> in addition we have set in hand an examination of all ta equipment scales with a view to establishing the feasibility of making further improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps if the noble lord lord peart could change the nature of his politics he might yet find himself in a very exciting job which i can assure him this one is <e> <s> i should like to start by echoing his remarks in congratulating the noble lord lord glenarthur not only on the concept of having initiated this debate but on the manner in which he did it <e> <s> i think we might say that he reflects credit on his army training for the way in which he marshalled his facts and for the clarity of his exposition <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord kimberley alluded to the delicate position in which i find myself owing to the timing of this debate when the prime minister is discussing this among other subjects during her visit to washington <e> <s> but the noble earl can be proud that at the very least we have had this evening a series of well-informed and cogently argued speeches which have focused the arguments and have demonstrated that nuclear strategy is not only a very complex matter but a contentious area of policy involving a number of theoretical as well as practical considerations <e> <s> almost the only thing we can agree about is that there is no consensus on this matter as yet <e>", "<cs> my lords recent improvements have included the formation of a rapier squadron for low level air defence at raf lossiemouth the introduction of the new skyflash air-to-air missile system and the formation of three royal auxiliary air force regiment squadrons for the ground defence of royal air force airfields <e> <s> a programme of hardened aircraft shelter construction and other passive defences is now under way or in preparation at several major airfields in the united kingdom <e> <s> further substantial improvements are planned for the s including the introduction of the tornado f and the nimrod airborne early warning aircraft and the comprehensive modernisation of the ground radar chain and the command and control system <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords no decision has yet been taken <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence said in another place on th january we are still examining the options for replacing the current polaris force when it reaches the end of its useful life in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords the royal navy has no requirement at present for a new type of frigate although we are exploring with the dutch and other nato allies the longer term possibilities <e> <s> i have myself had discussions with my dutch counterpart on the possibilities for collaboration <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no formal machinery for this purpose but the united kingdom takes into account a wide range of interests including the security interests of the alliance in reaching decisions on any arms sales <e>", "<cs> my lords since the inception of the scheme in a total of girls have completed training as apprentices in the royal dockyards and a further girls are under training at present <e>", "<cs> my lords about service married quarters are vacant in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords government departments are under standing instructions to settle bills promptly and we were not aware that large public companies were seeking to justify such extended credit <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with other noble lords that we must be grateful to the noble earl lord kinnoull for initiating this small debate <e> <s> it is very much easier to handle these matters in a more or less single-issue debate because defence debates tend to be very rambling <e> <s> i can assure the noble earl that as one who has to try to wind them up it is very welcome if we can slough off a few specific points earlier on <e>", "<cs> my lords per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively in real terms <e> <s> this is on the basis of the provisional forecast of outturn for and other figures published last week in the public expenditure white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his personal comments <e> <s> the answer to his question is that my right honourable friend had talks on a wide range of matters with senior chinese ministers including premier hua <e> <s> in shanghai he represented her majestys government at the opening of the british aviation equipment exhibition <e> <s> my right honourable friend found a considerable degree of common understanding on world issues and a common recognition that instability in one region such as in afghanistan can affect global stability <e>", "<cs> my lords i like all other noble lords am grateful to the noble lord lord newall for the fact that he initiated this debate and for the manner in which he did it <e> <s> may i start by telling him that as i hope i shall establish we certainly are not complacent on this question of defence sales <e> <s> indeed i am not even sure that it is true to say that we are wholly pleased <e> <s> nevertheless they are an important and not totally unsatisfactory part of the defence scene <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are considering is the soviet chemical warfare threat and our ability to meet it <e> <s> the united kingdom already occupies a leading position in the field of defensive equipment designed to withstand a chemical warfare attack <e> <s> we have no plans for acquiring an offensive capability but it would be wrong for the west to ignore the massive soviet stocks of chemical weapons and the issues these raise <e>", "<cs> my lords as the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the possibility of an <e>", "<cs> my lords the royal observer corps is a field force of the united kingdom warning and monitoring organisation which is part of the review presently being undertaken by the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time when they cease active duty the retirement remuneration received by five-star officers calculated and known as half-pay exceeds that of any officer junior to them retiring during the same year <e> <s> half-pay is increased in line with full pay and full pay has not in recent years kept pace with inflation <e> <s> on the other hand service pensions in general have been increased in line with price inflation and thus four-star officers out of some who retired in the years at present receive retired pay greater than the five-star half-pay <e> <s> a similar phenomenon of overtaking has occurred throughout the public service and at all levels <e> <s> since it is impossible to foresee at any given moment what will be the relative movement of salaries and prices in the future no specific warning can be given <e>", "<cs> my lords the oto melara / mm gun system was selected for the hong kong patrol craft as the only gun available in the required time-scale which could meet the performance requirement agreed with the hong kong government <e> <s> it is a standard nato mounting already in service with seven nato countries is of proven reliability <e>", "<cs> my lords the size of this years apprentice entry into the royal dockyards has not yet been decided <e> <s> in recent years the dockyards and indeed the ministry of defence as a whole have entered more apprentices than they need strictly for their own purposes <e> <s> this is to help ease the problem of unemployment among school leavers <e> <s> pressure on civil service numbers now makes it much more difficult to continue providing this kind of help <e> <s> some reductions in the numbers entered are therefore likely <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence about ground launched cruise missiles <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft army air force and naval discipline acts continuation order laid before the house on rd june be approved <e> <s> in the past the moving of these renewal orders has sometimes been the opportunity for a general debate on defence matters and in particular for questions concerning the conditions of service in the forces <e> <s> however it is only recently that we had a general debate on defence and i think it is therefore appropriate that i should confine myself to personnel matters today <e> <s> but i will endeavour to answer any relevant questions which crop up during the course of any further debate which may rise <e>", "<cs> my lords we are completely satisfied with the reliability of the ballistic missile early warning station at fylingdales in north yorkshire <e> <s> we are also satisfied that the recent false alarms which occurred at the north american air defence command hq do not in any way undermine the effectiveness of the ballistic missile early warning system as a whole in detecting and reporting a real threat <e> <s> the measures taken following an alert by this system are of a precautionary nature and nuclear weapons could not be released in response to an automatic false alarm <e>", "<cs> my lords redundancy notices have been issued to cleaning staff at bath including two full-time supervisory grades <e> <s> on the second point contract cleaning companies generally organise matters so that their work forces are employed for a limited number of hours which ensures that the lower earnings limit for national insurance purposes is not normally exceeded <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have already made clear a decision will be announced just as soon as it is possible to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence on the eventual replacement of the polaris force which now provides britains strategic nuclear deterrent capability <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made very good progress in recruiting for all the volunteer reserves particularly since the announcement last august of increased rates of bounty and other measures recommended in the shapland report <e> <s> in the case of the territorial army almost recruits joined between july and april of this year the latest date for which figures are available <e> <s> recruitment to the other volunteer reserves including the three new regiment squadrons of the royal auxiliary air force and the new royal naval reserve air branch is also going well <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements which will apply for control over the us ground-launched cruise missiles to be based in this country have operated satisfactorily for over years <e> <s> a dual-key system would entail the united kingdom purchasing the cruise missile systems except the war-heads and providing the manpower to operate and maintain them <e> <s> the government do not believe that this would be a sensible use of defence resources <e>", "<cs> my lords under the terms of the geneva convention officer prisoners of war in germany and italy were entitled to receive regular payments from their captors <e> <s> deductions were made from the pay accounts of officers held prisoner to take account of such payments <e> <s> our records show that at the end of the war arrangements were made across the three services for any such payments which had not been received to <e>", "<cs> my lords the first tenders for this important programme have already been let <e> <s> further tenders will be let progressively over the next few years <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is a very flexibly minded man but he is also clear that he has got to have the powers that the udcs require and i have to say that this amendment is seen by the government as being effectively a wrecking amendment <e> <s> this would subtract from the udcs certain powers which they must have <e> <s> it would mean that the local authority would have the ability totally to frustrate the udcs should they so wish <e> <s> it has been said time and time again and i fear it will be said many more times this evening that it is hoped that the udcs will co-operate with the local authorities but one cannot hand over to the local authorities the power to wreck the purpose of the udcs and this amendment would do that <e> <s> i hope the committee will not accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to express a slight regret that the noble lord who has just sat down chose to go off into a general attack on government policy when up until then i thought we had had rather a restrained and well-informed debate on the subject which the noble lord lord irving of dartford introduced so efficiently <e> <s> may i just begin by dealing with some of the general matters <e> <s> i too regret that i am not speaking as a minister in the department <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have told the house before the government view with increasing

<e> <s> the international commission on radiological protection was not involved <e> <s> the secretary-generals report noted that estimates of the effects on health of radiation from nuclear weapon tests were based on data which are themselves a matter of scientific controversy and that there was no way of identifying radiation-induced cases among the many millions of other cancer deaths during
