health service <e>", "<cs> i should like to say why i believe that psychiatrists are unhappy about the noble lords amendment <e> <s> it is because this phrase has been a valuable one which has allowed certain unusual conditions and some not so unusual such as disordered brain damage to be compulsorily admitted to hospital if necessary <e> <s> a young man who has brain damage as a result of a motor

suggest that amendment no <e> <s> should read and necessary treatment <e> <s> if we said this then we should make it clear that treatment could be given and that it should be limited to the treatment necessary to improve the patients mental state within the limited period <e>", "<cs> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that i missed the latter part of the debate during the second reading of this bill although i have of course studied <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to pay tribute to the noble lord lord wellspestell for his concern for the medical profession and also to pay tribute to what he has done for that profession in a number of ways in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords we owe a great debt to the noble lord lord rugby for having persisted in his concern about these matters <e> <s> i am told that some per cent <e> <s> of opticians premises now display the prices of lenses and frames <e> <s> this is substantially due to his efforts in the past <e> <s> the fact that the government have thought fit to refer certain aspects of this matter to the office of fair trading is also a result of public concern <e> <s> the case for what appears to he an unnecessary restriction on purchasing has been made and the amending bill before the house proposes quite simply that clause be struck from the act <e> <s> nothing else <e> <s> the question is what is the effect of this bill and what consequences will ensue <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble baroness because i believe that after-care services are absolutely necessary not just desirable <e> <s> the government have spent million on secure units <e> <s> the house has spent many hours upon considering those people who find themselves in secure units <e> <s> not to complete the job by securing after-care for them when they leave this very strange environment of the secure unit would mean that we had failed in our duty <e>", "<cs> my lords all that remains for me to do is to congratulate all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and particularly the noble lord lord elton for rounding it off in his usual fashion <e> <s> i was glad that the noble lord lord porritt finished his speech in hope because he has given me and a great many others hope and encouragement for the past years <e> <s> i suspect that he was one of the people who persuaded the medical profession to go along with the national health service at its very beginning although i suspect also that he would deny this <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what is the present situation regarding the office of fair trading to which the government have made a reference <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper

authorities <e> <s> also perhaps one would like to know whether the reorganisation of the administration of the national health service will improve the situation in london particularly in view of the written answer given in another place by the minister of state for health and social security on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for his short reply may i ask what the governments view is about the future of the university grants committee <e> <s> will it he academic advisory or executive <e> <s> if executive will that have any effect on the freedom and autonomy of the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords now that we have a triennium can the minister say whether local authority rates pay settlements and matters of that kind which under a quinquennial system were subject to an additional grant will be the subject of additional grants in the new triennial system

nearly an emergency from the point of view of long delays in operations and consultations does the minister not feel that other developments should be deferred <e> <s> the government have recently declared their policy that additional resources should be used to improve the treatment of the confused elderly and return mentally subnormal to the community <e> <s> do they still think that these should be the priorities under this exceptional situation <e> <s> secondly may i ask whether the government have had discussions with the medical profession on these matters and have taken advice from the royal colleges about medical priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my congratulations to the minister and also to congratulate him on the delicate degree of unanimity which he attached to several of the proposals <e> <s> the reorganisation of the health service and rhetoric about the optimum mix of the public and private sectors has diverted attention from the fundamental problem of finding ways in which to control or moderate costs and services and make the optimum use of resources <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my thanks to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for introducing this debate <e> <s> as has been said in the last decade the number of infants vaccinated against whooping cough has dropped <e> <s> in percent <e> <s> of children were vaccinated <e> <s> in that had fallen to per cent <e> <s> however the evidence published by the department of health and social security in may showed that benefits far outweighed the risks of damage caused by

unfortunates who suffer from the adverse effects of innoculation and treatment be compensated in this way <e> <s> that is something as has already been said that will have to be reviewed <e>", "<cs> we discussed this matter at considerable length on second reading <e> <s> i consider that there are probably three very important functions which the family doctor has under the circumstances existing today <e> <s> the first of course is his daily work in which capacity he is as the minister said an independent contractor doing the ordinary day-to-day work with his patients <e> <s> but secondly in the present climate which has been clearly stated by the government the whole question of accountability in the national health service is paramount and one thing that is not clear is how family doctors will be accountable in future <e> <s> we have heard of important meetings between ministers and regional health authorities and those authorities are required to have similar consultations with the district authorities <e> <s> on that aspect therefore we require an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my thanks to the noble lord lord molloy for giving us the opportunity to debate this important matter and for expressing the great concern which i know he feels and which many of us feel about many aspects of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to those already expressed to the noble baroness for initiating the debate <e> <s> fatal cases of industrial lead poisoning have now been almost completely eliminated but fatalities still occur from time to time among young children who eat items containing lead <e> <s> i had only one case during my active professional career in medicine <e> <s> it involved a baker who drunk warm water out of a lead pipe tap in his bakery <e> <s> but to confuse things he made his morning tea in lead-lined tins in which had been delivered apples for the making of apple charlotte <e> <s> we never discovered which of the two possible causes was the actual cause in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly about the university point of view and particularly the universities of the commonwealth <e> <s> one interesting thing is that for five or six years after things just drifted in the university world <e> <s> in retrospect it is difficult to see why not <e> <s> the reason i think was the romantic notion of universities that all students should be admitted for the same fee regardless of origin <e> <s> in fact as late as a joint committee of the university grants committee and the vice-chancellors committee recommended that differential fees should be abolished fees should be modest and overseas student numbers which had been escalating rapidly as has been said should be controlled by the universities themselves guided by the university grants committee the system which is used for home students <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister believe that the position could be improved by reintroducing the statutory medical officer of health which was abandoned in <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise first to thank all noble lords who have contributed to this debate <e> <s> i thank them for raising the standard of debate and i express the hope that if this topic arises outside the house as it surely will the standard of debate there too will be raised <e> <s> i thank the minister particularly for the clarity of his exposition but would also say to him that to my mind the house has clearly said we accept that there must be a mix find the right mix <e> <s> so the government are now fairly challenged by the situation as to what is the right mix and what role they themselves should play in this matter <e> <s> for example should they study the elderly and all the interconnections and give advice to local district hospitals or should they study hospital development and the share of private hospital development of the hospice kind which has been so clearly put to the house <e> <s> i would have thought that one would like to see more action more detail and more proposals for debate because there is a natural anxiety in many quarters that the

least of it meagre <e> <s> at that time the doctor was a sympathetic attendant at the bedside of the sick <e> <s> a bottle of medicine was the usual prescription <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that answer may i further ask him whether a report published by the royal college of general practitioners entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister tell us how long this practice has existed in hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose my qualification to speak in this debate is that for five years i was a member of a grants committee and chairman of its medical sub-committee <e> <s> i joined the ugc just at the time it was becoming the responsibility of the department of education and science and no longer that of the treasury <e> <s> this was celebrated by a modest party in the basement of the treasury at which the guest of honour was the noble and learned lord lord

accepted the ugcs estimate of university needs and had argued and cut the submissions <e> <s> a few years later the ugc sent the first list of guidelines to the universities and a whole range of sub-committees was formed to bring in expert knowledge in various disciplines <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that brief reply <e> <s> does he realise that those who lead the family doctors at the present time are highly responsible and very much concerned about costs <e> <s> they believe that the legislation making the family practitioner committees directly responsible to the secretary of state sets the stage for future relations <e> <s> does the minister realise that the opportunity is slipping away and with it good will <e> <s> the pharmacists are also anxiously awaiting the report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government reconsider their decision about delaying publication <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped at the start of this debate that most of the principal issues that will have to be looked at squarely would be looked at <e> <s> i must congratulate all the speakers for contributing in the way that they have <e> <s> most of the main problems have been looked at sometimes from widely differing points of view but i hope the opportunity now exists elsewhere for this debate to be studied and for due weight to be given to the views that have been expressed by the experienced members of your lordships house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confine my remarks to two aspects of this large and important subject one is the post-experience training of adults and the other concerns the activities of the open university <e> <s> post-experience training means what it says <e> <s> after people have had practical experience they return to some suitable centre to refresh themselves and to up-date their knowledge <e> <s> these centres may be run by industry the government by universities or polytechnics but all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether this legislation will simply confirm the present practice of the pesticides safety precautions scheme and whether he feels that additional safeguards are perhaps necessary in this area <e> <s> may i also ask the minister whether this legislation will control the methods of spraying to ensure minimal effective growth and whether the widespread use of antibiotics as feeding additives will be controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am a member of the committee of the noble lord lord adrian <e> <s> i also start from a keen interest in the quality of the scientific endeavour behind the activities we are discussing and also of course in the research scientists responsible <e> <s> i visited the rothamsted experimental station and there i was greatly impressed by the quality of the people concerned and the wide vision that many of them have including a very acute appreciation of many of the environmental problems concerned <e> <s> i did not visit any nerc institutes so i am unable to comment on them <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that a further consequence is that the medical research council will have to notify the universities that support for some of their outstanding work will have to cease and that therefore some of this work will have to be abandoned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> is he aware that there is grave concern about the recruitment of doctors of quality to the service and also that there is a particular problem concerning specialist training within the services <e> <s> how is it considered that these matters will be dealt with in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the interest in this house on this important matter does the minister accept that it should not be dealt with merely by a written answer to the noble lord lord smith <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said we are much indebted to the noble lord lord gregson for chairing the committee so ably and presenting its findings so clearly to your lordships <e> <s> of the many aspects of this important matter he has referred to i should like to mention briefly the changes of a fundamental nature made possible by the health and safety at work act and consider some of the challenges facing employers and those concerned with occupational health in the future with particular reference to the employment medical advisory service and future research <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware of the great deal of concern there has been over the fact that during this last period the chairman of the management board in the department of health and social security has not been in post <e> <s> is the minister also aware that the districts are concerned about the future and their reorganising <e> <s> they have no real guidance about the general management <e> <s> particularly concerned in these matters are the clinical managers who have run their own department since the initiation of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to add my tribute to the noble lord lord sherfield for a most brilliant introduction to this debate <e> <s> at this late hour i wish to make only one or two points <e> <s> all the main points have been made some <e>", "<cs> my lords legislation for the protection of animals in britain predates that of any modern state and i for one have tended to think that we have nothing to learn from others who are attempting to catch up <e> <s> the essential framework of our legislation has not changed though experience over the years has led to many improvements <e> <s> in recent years the anti-vivisection lobby has become more demanding and militant <e> <s> now that the legislation is being reviewed it behoves us to consider whether the legislation is still on the right lines and to cast a glance or two at what others are doing <e> <s> we are very grateful to the noble lord lord somers for raising the matter at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please tell us whether in future all drugs prescribed in the national health service will have to be approved by ministers or is it the intention that a final list be arrived at by consultation with the professional people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply brief though it is <e> <s> i ask him two supplementary questions <e> <s> first recognising that per cent <e> <s> of general practitioner costs are for pharmaceuticals does he consider that the binder hamlyn report should have been published and why is there this indecent haste about a drug list <e> <s> secondly does he believe that it will be possible for the industry to advertise unlisted drugs to national health service doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether the government are publishing a list of drugs which may be used in the national health service or whether they are publishing a list as has been reported in the newspapers of drugs which may not be used in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords one is tempted to ask one or two supplementary questions of the minister but i think that we have had a reasonably well-balanced debate <e> <s> i congratulate him on his spirited defence although i think that many of us feel that this problem is by no means finally solved <e> <s> we are still worrying about the distinction which i tried to make in my speech between the limited list and the recommended list <e> <s> it seems to me that many people might come round to the limited list particularly if it is obviously something that can be limited <e> <s> but to do that on the negative side without taking the opportunity of producing guidance for the medical profession by the experts such as the cmos experts seems to some of us to be a great tragedy <e> <s> i hope the minister will take that thought away with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> does the minister agree that family practitioner committees do not have control of many of the factors concerned with family practitioner expenditure <e> <s> how is it proposed to monitor this in the future <e> <s> secondly will this new authority have responsibility for the recommended drug list and if so how <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whereabouts he says the government are envisaging an expansion of general practice in the future with an increase in the variety of services offered as is hoped for by the general practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords with all the discussion that there has been in your lordships house about the drugs lists and the debate on the pharmaceutical industry one would have thought that there could not possibly be any new factor to consider in this situation <e> <s> however there is an important new factor <e> <s> it arises because on the day following our debate on the pharmaceutical industry the secretary of state for health made an announcement in another place about the long list of drugs which could not be prescribed in the health service and about a recommended list of drugs which contained at least three times more drugs than the original published list in fact as against <e> <s> there are also other very important categories of drugs which have not been mentioned here such as antibiotics which of course remain unrestricted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add my tribute to the noble lord lord gregson <e> <s> in recent years there have been a number of gregson reports <e> <s> i should be surprised if he does not as many of us do consider this report to be among the best and the most important <e> <s> may i also add my congratulations to the right reverend prelate on his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say a little more about doctors and dentists from europe <e> <s> he told us that of course they have free access but my information which is out of date is that there has been very little movement of doctors from europe to this country <e> <s> however perhaps spain and portugal will be in the community one of these days <e> <s> will the noble earl please tell us how many doctors have come from europe in the last year <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that in fact there were large numbers of doctors coming from ireland before we entered europe <e> <s> there has been a very small flow of doctors coming from the main european countries since we joined <e> <s> i think one should note that for some reason doctors have not come in large numbers to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> are the government aware of the fact that there is grave concern within this service which has been excellent in the past which is unique in the world and which to many people does not seem to have any indications of need for change <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> does he realise that the medical profession believes that strong purpose-built bridges are necessary and that they have proved vital in the department of health and social security <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about management in the health service but first let me congratulate the government on their wisdom in not tampering with the public health laboratory service <e> <s> to have done so might well have put the health of everyone in this country at risk <e> <s> the public health laboratory service is a vital part of the nervous system of the national health service and is a highly sensitive screen for the protection of everyone <e> <s> organisms are no respecters of the boundaries of man-made administrations <e>", "<cs> the starting point of this saga was the noble lord lord melchett reading a report from the department of health about drugs that had been used over a -year period <e> <s> that was a retrospective study <e> <s> the report said that a lot of these drugs were me too drugs <e> <s> i do not believe that the people who started out to do the research work research work tends to be into unknown terrorities were trying to get me too drugs <e> <s> a large number of generic companies in the world make drugs that they can make <e> <s> the point being missed here is that people are seriously endeavouring for very good reasons as well as commercial ones to get new products <e> <s> for example the original valium was introduced by the drug company and some of its cousins were introduced widely in the first years of its life <e> <s> now these drugs are being replaced by new drugs with a different kind of action and a shorter action <e> <s> if this kind of thing cannot go on there will not be progress <e>", "<cs> the phrase in this amendment is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for that reply which is hopeful <e> <s> as the unit managers have now been appointed may i ask the minister whether she is aware of the concern in the nursing profession about who the unit managers in the wards will be <e> <s> does she think there is a possibility that the ward sister might be in charge of her ward as she used to be before other activities were taken over by cleaning services and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble earl lord cranbrook for the manner in which he presented the case to the house <e> <s> the select committee recommended as already stated that all local authorities should set up a science and technology sub-committee and each association of authorities also a science and technology committee with functions related to the information of elected members the identification of research needs and application and the improvement of scientific and technical performances <e> <s> the dilemma of many of the very good scientific and technological services of the metropolitan counties and the glc is that they have not been the focus of anyones serious attention <e> <s> the select committees work has shown this to be evident <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper

arrangements for the review of the drug list <e> <s> secondly does an appeal mechanism exist <e>", "<cs> does an appeal procedure exist my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however recognising the inadequacy of the inoculation programme particularly against measles and whooping cough and the deep public concern about communicable disease do the government not agree that there should be a standing public health committee in each district of which the community medicine specialist the environmental health officer and the chairman of the public health laboratory are members and that they should be responsible not only for public health but for the education of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords in there was an important event very relevant to tonights debate <e> <s> the advisory board of the research councils and the university grants committee set up a joint working party to survey for the very first time i believe the support of civil science by the department of education and science through the ugc and the research councils focusing specifically on university scientific research <e> <s> the report is of the greatest importance because it portrays the situation after the first round of university cuts and inevitably therefore cuts in research support threatening the well-founded department provided by the ugc so much the pride of successive governments and creating the environment for specific staff and equipment grants from the research councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> do the government not accept

evidence <e> <s> do the government not accept also that there is a delay before the damage that is being caused will be evident <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the basic research funding of universities over the past five years has been steadily reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl one simple question <e> <s> it is whether the government and the university grants committee are going to ensure the grant block principle in the universities <e> <s> that means that the university grants committee is not going to take over the detailed running of the university programme <e> <s> will he please answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we shall all want to thank the noble baroness for her vigorous reply and in spite of many cautions the

add my congratulations to those expressed to the noble lord lord prys-davies for a quite magnificent introduction to this debate <e> <s> i should like briefly to consider how long it took to create

advisers <e> <s> as a medical man that is a great comfort <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make only a few points as much of the ground has already been covered <e> <s> first i add my tribute to the noble lord lord bottomley for the way that he introduced the subject <e> <s> he got the debate off to a flying start and we have covered a great deal of ground <e> <s> may i also say that the noble lord lord smith was unduly modest for he was one of the people who gave the national health service its flying start that lasted for almost years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what part is played in a matter such as this by the health and safety executive <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to appear ungrateful in speaking but i wish to draw your lordships attention to something that i think is vitally important <e>", "<cs> my lords the day that i became a member of the ugc was the first day of the new regime <e> <s> no longer was the ugc to be responsible to a treasury minister

changes following the robbins report and later the todd report on medical education meant that the sums of public money spent were so large that any responsible government had to produce changes in financial control <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first add my congratulations to the noble lord lord peston on his maiden speech <e> <s> preventive medicine which has been coming to the fore in this debate if successful saves lives and prevents ill-health <e> <s> it also saves resources but what is distinctive about it is that in order to be successful it requires the co-operation of individuals and often requires the support of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i also add my thanks to the noble lord lord lovell-davis for initiating this interesting debate <e> <s> the th century public health movement in this country depended for its success in coping with infectious and deficiency diseases upon a range of local government activities beyond medical ones <e> <s> some were legislative and some were regulatory for example with regard to housing and the workplace <e> <s> many of their activities were involved with the care of children in school <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but do the government have plans for the elimination of the annual epidemic of measles <e>

was as stimulating today as he was when he chaired the select committee <e> <s> the house owes him a considerable debt <e> <s> as has been said two of the substantial successes of your lordships

response and the question of the science base which is substantially in the universities and in the research council institutes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will consider in the future when giving information about the national health service to the house the practicability of giving three figures <e> <s> the first is the figure for administration and whether it is increasing or decreasing <e> <s> the second figure is that for public health and preventive medicine on which substantial resources have been spent in recent years <e> <s> thirdly we need the figure for diagnostic and treatment services <e> <s> that may not be practical <e> <s> however i think that those three figures are keys to the delivery of medical care <e> <s> the third matter is the most important one for the ordinary person <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to make funds available so that people who except for financial reasons could go to another area would be able to have their operation there <e>", "<cs> my lords for a moment i should like to stand back a little from our <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government any confidence in the management of the health service in the west midlands in the light of what the minister himself has said <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government every confidence in the management in the west midlands in the light of what the minister himself said about the importance of management in planning to meet the kind of staffing problem with which it is faced <e>", "<cs> my lords thinking back to when i joined the national health service i remember that there was a general air of optimism in the medical profession and in parliament as well as in government <e> <s> why <e> <s> there was a belief that by producing a national health service and attempting to make diagnosis and treatment available to all one would substantially improve the health of the nation and it was hoped that demands on the nhs would fall as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay a tribute to the noble earl lord longford for his gifts as a historian <e> <s> i have recently read his book about abraham lincoln which i enjoyed enormously and i took the trouble to say so <e> <s> i do not know whether i should congratulate him but he has given me the impression that he has taken rather lightly a great many of the serious well thought out recommendations contained in the report because he has made no reference to them <e> <s> it should be a technicality because i know nothing about the relationship between second reading in another place and what has happened in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to that i am guided by the opinion of the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good debate <e> <s> i wish to thank all noble lords who have taken part in it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also add my thanks to the noble lord lord molloy for giving us the opportunity to debate this important topic <e> <s> i have a vivid memory of the nursing situation years ago when i was a house physician <e> <s> for the visit of the consultant in charge the patients were all in bed with the bedclothes neatly folded and the wards were inspected by sister before the consultants arrival <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please tell the house whether the government still have every confidence in the management of the west midlands health authority and in the central district authority <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the optimum number of units required reasonably to cover the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to apologise to the house since i may have to leave before the minister replies to the debate <e> <s> unfortunately i have an important engagement in birmingham which i feel i must not miss <e> <s> i should like first to congratulate the minister and the noble lord lord ennals who i see is fast disappearing from the chamber as well as the noble lord lord winstanley for what has been a very comprehensive review of this subject <e> <s> the question that arises in my mind is whether there is anything left to talk about <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my tribute to the noble lord lord nelson the chairman of our committee <e> <s> noble lords will not be surprised that having barely taken a deep breath he is now studying outer space <e> <s> it is a measure of his versatility in these matters <e> <s> we were all sad when our committee completed its work <e> <s> we learned so much from the witnesses and from one another <e> <s> i should like to say if it is appropriate that i learnt a great deal from the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby when we sat together on the infant life preservation bill <e> <s> i look forward to discussing the matters that he raised at a more appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been trying during this debate to recognise the homogeneous english universities which have been lumped together <e> <s> as the person who had some responsibility for the founding of the universities of nottingham leicester and southampton and who spent a little time in the universities of birmingham and liverpool i wonder what are the similarities and not the proud differences that they have with oxford and cambridge and not st andrews which certainly believes rightly or wrongly that although it may have a scottish flavour and a french connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak strongly in support of what the noble lord lord allen has said from a great depth of experience <e> <s> however i should like to approach this from the point of view of the governments amendment no <e> <s> paragraph c and also from the point of view of the family <e> <s> first heading c in the amendment states <e>", "<cs> the minister said on second reading that after a careful examination of priorities the government had concluded that it was reasonable to find some of the savings from within the general ophthalmic and general dental services <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government think that the risks in regard to these two things are broadly similar <e> <s> if one is to assume that savings have to be made somewhere it would be helpful to have an indication of the governments view about the relative dangers of doing either of these things <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstanley and others have argued eloquently that there should be unrestricted sale without prescription of ready-made spectacles <e> <s> there was a time when had a good deal of sympathy with the proposal but i have changed my views <e> <s> i should explain why <e> <s> i do not think there is much in this from the point of view of cost <e> <s> i am assured that properly prescribed spectacles made to the appropriate british standards are available at prices in the same range as or below those governing ready-made spectacles <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a difficulty here about which i am sure the minister does not need to be reminded it is that the science and technology committee has recently reported to the house on the whole question of medical research including that within the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot but wonder whether this means perhaps the minister will tell us that the government have also accepted the other recommendation concerning eye-testing <e> <s> i should have thought that much of what has been said is true but if one takes the per cent <e> <s> and breaks it into specific age groups one begins to obtain a different answer <e> <s> i do not know whether it is fair to ask at this time but can the minister say what the governments reaction is likely to be to the eye-testing recommendation which was strongly supported in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords as the leader of the house has said in november of last year the government published their white paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has led us through somewhat difficult pastures with his usual skill and charm and i pay tribute to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am sure that she is aware that the retailer/producer does not have to be licensed at present <e> <s> i believe that that is in line with common market legislation so that people with a few hens producing a few eggs are not involved <e> <s> there is substantial activity in this country under that heading with such people producing perhaps turkeys for christmas dinner or eggs a day <e> <s> what do the government propose to do about the unlicensed retailers/producers <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first instance it is a great pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord butterfield on his maiden speech which i enjoyed enormously <e> <s> that is not unexpected <e> <s> having known him for some years i am sure that it is exactly the sort of speech which the house will enjoy from him on many occasions to come <e> <s> it has been said that one should sit through a debate and make up ones mind listening to it <e> <s> almost every conceivable aspect of this topic has been dealt with except for one question which arose in my mind when i read some of the recommendations of the social services select committee <e> <s> one recommendation was <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady cox on two counts <e> <s> she spent this morning dealing with social services in europe and then she introduced this debate for which i thank her <e> <s> i apologise to the house for being absent at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to speak in this very short debate about visual display units and to give support to the chairman of sub-committee c the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> i must explain that i have only recently become a member of the european select committee but i wish to make a few comments about our experiences and perhaps make one or two suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords the house would wish me to thank the noble lord the leader of the house for opening the debate in the persuasive way that he did and to thank the noble lord lord hesketh for the vigorous statement that he has made <e> <s> in many ways i think that the house is reassured by what we have been told <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house what is the difference between the roles of the universities funding council and the university grants committee <e> <s> he said a moment ago that the university grants committee was to make the decision <e> <s> if it is to make the decision it will have to do so on th march when it holds its last meeting <e> <s> what is the role of the new funding council in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that it might not be inappropriate in the debate to say something about the university grants committee as i knew it <e> <s> it finished its duties in higher education at the end of march to be succeeded by the universities funding council on the most appropriate date of st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can the government assure the house that research interests will be properly represented on whatever policy and executive bodies may be established to administer the health service under the proposed reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government accept that the majority of general practitioners are really concerned about the welfare of their patients <e> <s> that is why they are asking for additional evidence to support the proposed changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the general practitioners are asking for evidence to support the proposed changes <e>", "<cs> my lords one reads in the newspapers that the chief medical officer is in attendance at the policy board by personal invitation <e> <s> will the minister tell us whether he represents the interests of the nurses or the medical staff <e> <s> or would the policy board prefer not to have him there at all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that following the report of the croham committee and the setting up of the universities funding council it was realised that the important area in the clinical medical schools was that grey area with the knock-for-knock principle operated between two departments of government <e> <s> that was nearly two years ago <e> <s> can he confirm what we understand from the newspapers that there has been no report from the senior civil servants about how the matter is to be resolved between the two departments of government <e> <s> it is a matter of the greatest importance to clinical research in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the national health service policy board and the national health service management executive have started work can the minister tell the house whether the government envisage any change in the role and position of the regional health authorities and the committee that is between them and the secretary of state who have in the past advised him on policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lords lord allen and <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that your lordships would wish me to thank the minister warmly for her magnificent effort tonight <e> <s> she has done a great deal to improve our understanding of and confidence in how the future may evolve and help us to get rid of some of the anxieties which are very real <e> <s> i also thank noble lords from all sides of the house who collaborated in this matter <e> <s> perhaps we are beginning to achieve a basis upon which we can go forward <e> <s> i thank everyone who has taken part in the debate for their contribution <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords before this debate i thought i should talk about the argument to keep the embryo bill and the abortion bill separate <e> <s> i shall do that very briefly because so much has been said <e> <s> i am very surprised that a number of people seem not to have read the report by the noble and learned lord lord brightman <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does she believe as i do that every senior citizen should be offered an audiogram at suitable intervals <e> <s> there is a growing practice for the machines to be available in general practice and one hopes that in future large general practices will have that facility <e> <s> does the minister agree that the ideal person to operate the machine would be the practice nurse <e> <s> does she further agree that the overcrowding of ear nose and throat departments with so many additional patients is burdensome <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a very brief point <e> <s> the world health organisation regards illness due to contaminated food as one of the most widespread health problems in the contemporary world <e> <s> it positively encourages member governments to consider introducing irradiation because of the public health benefits that it brings <e> <s> the world health organisation has issued golden rules for safe food preparation <e> <s> rule on choosing food processed for safety includes the words <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether the recent campaign to recruit more nurses has been successful <e>", "<cs> my lords this situation is reminiscent of an earlier stage when the noble and learned lord spoke as he has just spoken <e> <s> i found myself left with one paragraph <e> <s> in that paragraph i stated that we had been studying this matter for years <e> <s> we had been asked by the world health organisation to implement some provisions urgently in relation to the care of chickens <e> <s> the decision of the council of ministers does not guarantee anything in relation to food safety <e> <s> i suggest that the government get a move on <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage in the debate one asks oneself what one can contribute to it that has not been discussed before a good many times <e> <s> i shall be very brief <e> <s> what i can contribute stems from the fact that because i wanted to clear my own mind on these issues and study the experience of others with long-term loans systems i got in touch with the swedish embassy which was good enough to let me have a great deal of information <e> <s> in fact there had been a seminar on the th february about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord annan for his stimulating introduction to this debate <e> <s> i wish to make reference to one aspect of higher education in medicine <e> <s> i refer to the provision of funding for clinical teaching and research centres the facilities of which are funded by the national health service and the department of education and science through the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i understand why the noble lord lord walton has gone into explicit detail in his amendment <e> <s> however listening to the discussions i do not see anything wrong with paragraph f of schedule as drafted by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords my first and most pleasant duty is to pay tribute to the noble earl lord clanwilliam on his speech <e> <s> he showed charm and courage courage not in the face of the occasional turbulence of this chamber but because at least half a dozen orthodox practitioners are sitting on this side of the house <e> <s> further in the spirit of maiden speeches he spoke about complementary medicine and not alternative medicine and in that we support him <e>", "<cs> that invitation comes from a retired professor of materia medica <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that brief reply <e> <s> however if we accept that the disease is due to feeding from contaminated <e>", "<cs> my lords given the fact that it takes four or five years for this disease to develop in affected cows what happens to the animals in the interval <e> <s> are they used for ordinary beef purposes <e>", "<cs> one is tempted to refer to a report one made in to a conservative government recommending medical managers <e> <s> the consequence at that time was consensus management <e> <s> i do not know how much coffee and tea was consumed during that period though i think the amount was substantial <e>", "<cs> we are now talking about the new public health proposals which are to a substantial degree based on the chief medical officers report to the department on the future of preventive medicine and public health <e> <s> that report included a recommendation that the faculty should rename itself reorientate itself and retrain itself for a vital new purpose which i understand the government approve <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister a question is the national reflection of the policy that she has outlined the fact that the chief medical officer attends the national health service policy board not by right but by personal invitation <e>", "<cs> i have one point to make in the light of the ministers remarks <e> <s> a number of professional bodies mentioned in the amendment are on the way up <e> <s> to be named as important professional bodies which should be consulted among others is an important fillip for nurses midwives pharmacists opticians and others <e> <s> that is why we shall bring the amendment back in this amount of detail <e> <s> we shall do so not to exclude other people the secretary of state may consult whom he wishes but to make it clear that these important professions on which the national health service depends so strongly and on which in future it will depend in order to save money by not sending patients to hospital should be named <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> a great deal of time has been spent recently considering membership of committees at various levels and whether professional members should be representatives or not <e> <s> whatever the arguments there are no doubts that the key relationship vital to the future of the service is between doctors the spenders and management <e> <s> that has to occur at all levels in the national health service <e>", "<cs> something which the minister said seemed to me to be a brief glimpse of light in the darkness and perhaps she will confirm that she said it <e> <s> she conveyed to me that there <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> there is one point about which everyone wishes to know and which in my view has not quite been answered <e> <s> it is whether there will be a substantial examination of the hospital and general practice experiments which the noble baroness told us this afternoon would be limited <e> <s> will there be substantial examination of them before further developments are initiated <e>", "<cs> how does one provide a good service for patients <e> <s> what are the vital and important ingredients for the future <e> <s> we are talking about the future <e> <s> some of these should be provided in the enlarged general practice the secondary care centre recommended so long ago by lord dawson of penn in the first interim report of the emerging service in <e> <s> if one therefore is to expand what patients do their treatment investigation and management in general practice obviously the dividing line between general practitioner services and district authority services begins to change <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also add my thanks to the noble lord lord hacking for giving us this opportunity <e> <s> i will be brief because there seems to be unanimity in the house and i do not disagree with that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that the noble lord lord mccoll has only confirmed my view that the situation is as i described it <e> <s> in other words it does not require a self-governing hospital to achieve his objects because a good number of years ago one hospital which i served did just that without having been made into a self-governing hospital trust <e>", "<cs> i still find myself confused <e> <s> i feel that the matter is so critical that i must determine the views of the house on it <e>", "<cs> in view of the ministers very helpful reply and the great deal of information which she has supplied on what is going on in the management field which has not been available to all members of the committee at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied that access for the disabled to richmond house is satisfactory <e>", "<cs> in the white paper and in the introduction to the bill the government made great play of the fact that patients will be free and able to choose and change their doctors <e> <s> one does not disagree with that <e> <s> however people are responsible irresponsible or compulsive <e> <s> for that reason alone it is necessary to write the first part of the amendment into the bill <e>", "<cs> during the discussion on the part of the bill dealing with the health service many anxieties were expressed <e> <s> on one or two occasions the government narrowly defeated amendments based on these anxieties <e> <s> the vote was sufficiently close to convey the real concern felt by doctors and others <e>", "<cs> my lords once again my noble friend lord baldwin has not disappointed us <e> <s> he gave a brilliant introduction <e> <s> i do not know whether i agree entirely with everything he said <e> <s> however he was at his best this evening <e>", "<cs> little remains to be said but the challenge is there <e> <s> how does a local authority that does not have specialist knowledge obtain an accurate assessment of a person who is suffering from a rare disability <e> <s> that is the key to the matter <e> <s> we are talking about a rare and difficult disability <e> <s> when it occurs in children the matter may become urgent as new treatments and new possibilities arise <e> <s> i suggest to the minister that what is required here for a quality service is a special contract between a local authority and a hospital or a specialised unit within the health service that knows about this disability <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can she say whether french veterinary experts visited this country recently and whether the disease occurs in france <e> <s> can she also say whether substantial numbers of cattle have been exported from this country to france <e> <s> is it correct that feedstuff which is suspected of causing this condition has also been exported to france <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which is very clear <e> <s> it has clarified one or two points in my own mind <e> <s> particularly as this is a new venture the views and advice of the new director should rightly be sought about future planning <e> <s> he is already encouraged by the instruction about which the minister told us regarding his future contacts and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i support these amendments as probing amendments in the confident hope that the minister can satisfy the anxieties expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what the noble lord lord ennals said <e>", "<cs> my lords in the recent cross-bench debate which explored complementary medicine and to which the noble lord referred the government made a very valuable statement <e> <s> i believe it became clear that it is not possible to admit to the health service all that which is classified as complementary medicine <e> <s> each therapy must be examined <e> <s> for example i refer to the recent examination by the medical research council and the success of chiropractic treatment for back conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support what has been said and wish to make two points <e> <s> first can the minister say how the government see the role of the prescribing medical adviser to the family practitioner committee <e> <s> this is a key person <e> <s> we need an agreed normal procedure agreed clear rules about the exceptions but freedom in any place to prescribe in a certain situation <e> <s> any examination is to be carried out if i understand it correctly by the doctors peers on behalf of the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned the amendment that i put down for last week with the noble lord lord carr <e> <s> for the reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given a clear and broad account of the activities of the management board and its connections with the kings fund as well as of many other matters <e> <s> if one looks closely at the matter the same kinds of contacts existed previously in the medical world <e> <s> i feel sad that the noble baroness has drawn a distinction because one could argue although i do not do so that there is no need for the clinical advisory group <e> <s> that seems to me a disastrous conclusion arising from what the minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clarify the other part of the question about future membership <e> <s> he made some oblique reference to it <e> <s> however if the government consider it an important body i should have thought that its membership is of vital importance <e>"]
