["<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale for the quite undeserved flattering remarks with which he was kind enough to commend me to your lordships <e> <s> my only fear is that after such a glowing commercial you will be sadly disappointed in the product <e> <s> i understand of course that as a maiden speaker i am not expected to be controversial <e> <s> that i find rather daunting because my experience in life has been that i can hardly ever say anything without being liable to provoke somebody to disagree with me so if i transgress in that respect i crave your lordships forgiveness in advance <e> <s> at all events i shall start by sitting decorously on the fence and saying of the proposals so brilliantly expounded by my noble and learned friend for the simplification of the english language that i see that they could yield enormous advantages but at the same time i see them confronted by formidable obstacles and i hope nothing could be less controversial than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i enthusiastically welcome the initiative of my noble friend lord allen of abbeydale in introducing this very important debate <e> <s> i concur in what has been said by him and other noble lords in support of the general proposition that the criminal injuries compensation scheme should now be put on a statutory basis without further delay <e> <s> in particular i agree that all that is required is an enabling act and the scheme itself can safely be left to delegated legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the case of <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i simply do not understand <e> <s> are we going to be asked to say this afternoon that clause as it stands in its present nakedness should stand part of the bill or are we not <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my voice to those of the noble lords lord nugent of guildford and lord beswick in offering congratulations to the noble lord lord chapple on a truly sparkling maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the report and i have not discovered that any party <e>", "<cs> my lords i apprehend that it is open to the attorney-general to refer before he advises the crown any petition for a peerage in abeyance to this house if on any ground he feels that such a reference is called for <e> <s> this house would then refer the matter to the committee for privileges <e> <s> it is in the first instance for the attorney-general to investigate every issue which arises on a petition to call a peerage out of abeyance <e> <s> in due course the question of the establishment of the necessary pedigree and the propriety of the petitioner are examined before the crown is advised <e> <s> but i do not apprehend that there would be any bar to a reference to this house on any ground which the attorney-general felt was appropriate as a matter to be examined by the committee for privileges <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord henderson of brompton i do not regard myself as an interested party <e> <s> unless the retirement age for the judiciary is unexpectedly raised in favour of increased geriatric productivity i am near enough to reaching it to have no personal interest whatever in the outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords if the law leads to results that the intelligent layman would regard as ridiculous or anomalous it is time that the law <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> are we not making too much of this <e> <s> is it yet observed that what subsection provides is for orders to be made or for provisions to be included in an order under subsection consequential upon subsection <e> <s> if the lord chancellor is to be given power under subsection to confer jurisdiction on the high court in relation to proceedings in which the county court has jurisdiction and to confer jurisdiction on the county court in matters in which it does not now have jurisdiction surely it is obviously sensible that he should have power to make consequential provisions to avoid conflict with other statutory enactments <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with what has just fallen from my noble and learned friend lord griffiths subject to the fact that i am not wholly happy with the drafting of the clause <e>", "<cs> i see no sinister bureaucratic attempt in clause to invade the independence of the judges <e> <s> since provision is made in clause to protect the advisory committee from liability in damages in my submission it would be worth having this amendment in if only to negative the argument <e> <s> parliament expressly provided that the advisory committee should not be <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will forgive me for introducing a lighter note provoked by the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> if the lay client wants to learn whether he has an arguable case for appeal against sentence far and away the cheapest opinion he can obtain is by making an application in person for leave to appeal to the court of appeal <e> <s> it will cost him infinitely more to get an opinion from leading counsel <e>", "<cs> purely as a matter of drafting it seems to me that the apprehension underlying the feelings of the movers of this amendment is quite unfounded <e> <s> a court called upon to construe a definition section looks not only at the defining words but at the phrase to be defined <e> <s> if a person who engaged in the kind of research which is thought to be offensive and at which in certain respects this bill is directed sought to defend himself by saying oh i have only been engaged in providing treatment services provided to the public or a section of the public he would never succeed <e>", "<cs> i enter the debate with diffidence <e> <s> i speak simply as a layman who has listened attentively to the arguments in this long-running controversy and tried to evaluate them as best i could <e> <s> at this stage it would be quite inappropriate for me to rehearse the arguments afresh <e> <s> they have all been thoroughly canvassed <e> <s> however i hope that it is not inappropriate to try to isolate and define three quite separate issues and assess their importance in relation to the decision which the committee will make <e>", "<cs> to return to the subject matter of amendment no <e> <s> the principle of embryo research has been accepted by the committee <e> <s> if there is a possibility of research developing a technique which can give to a mother or a would-be mother the option of bearing an unhandicapped as opposed to a handicapped child surely there is no conceivable rational ground for saying that research for that technique should not be an appropriate objective <e>", "<cs> my lords sitting next to him i feel almost churlish in being unable to accept the gracious invitation issued by my noble friend lord jakobovits to join in the consensus <e> <s> i do not believe that the subject is capable of consensus and i feel obliged to oppose his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may well ask especially after the speech we have just heard what can possibly be left for another lawyer at number in the batting list to say <e> <s> but they will rightly predict that being yet another lawyer he is going to say it <e>"]
