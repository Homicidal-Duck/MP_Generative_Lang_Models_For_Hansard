provision does not relate to giving guidelines about standards for or monitoring of sssis <e> <s> it relates to providing common standards for sssis which apply throughout great britain <e> <s> it is the responsibility of the joint nature conservancy committee to monitor the implementation of those standards throughout great britain <e> <s> the wording used fudges the issue <e> <s> i would prefer it to be taken away and strengthened in the way that we have suggested <e>", "<cs> of course the courts interpret the law but the law is what the bill says <e> <s> we want to avoid bringing in the courts to decide these matters <e> <s> i accept that the changes to the voting pattern in the joint committee have made this less important than it was when we felt so strongly about in the select committee <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will think again about the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> should not amendment no <e> <s> zb come before the end of clause <e>", "<cs> as i understand it and i am not an expert on the matter as is the noble earl the situation with which this amendment is meant to deal is where a great deal of the detailed work has been done and yet agreement has not been reached that the site should be notified as an sssi <e>", "<cs> if this amendment is not accepted and i realise that the government are reluctant to accept it the procedure that would have to be followed in the case that i suggested is that the joint committee would then have to turn to the secretary of state and get him to issue directions <e> <s> that can happen and this amendment would have been a way of avoiding that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the matter has been raised by my noble friend lord monson although i do not think it is relevant to the amendment i should like to raise the question of those who served in the british forces in the second world war and who are residents of hong kong <e> <s> i hope the government would be prepared to give an assurance that they and any of their immediate dependants would have the right to reside in this country even though they might not be included under the

lords in speaking to the noble earls amendments i shall also speak to the amendment in my name and that of my noble friend lord chorley amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to support the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord norrie because they are in line with the recommendations of the select committee <e> <s> i prefer the amendment tabled by myself the noble lord lord chorley and the noble baroness lady nicol because we accept the fact that the idea of giving the joint committee responsibilities for countryside affairs was rejected at an earlier stage in our proceedings <e> <s> however we said in our report and we stick by it that it is totally illogical to amalgamate nature conservation and countryside conservation in scotland and wales and to perpetuate the divide in england <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is quite right in saying that amendments nos <e> <s> and za derive from the recommendations of the select committees
