["<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in view of the commitments of the present government it is extremely important that they realise all national assets in order to pay for them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl convey to her majestys government the deep concern that many of us have over this question of indiscriminate whaling and the fact that many of us would wish to support the noble lord lord gridley in pressing that this be taken as a matter of extreme urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord pay attention to the fact that although he is quite right in saying that expert opinion has been consulted and indeed a lot of trouble has been taken there is still a good deal of disquiet about this matter <e> <s> if the consequences are as serious as has been suggested by several people they can affect mankind quite considerably <e> <s> therefore it is not good enough simply to say that expert advice has been taken <e> <s> i speak as one who in some respects is sometimes regarded as an expert and therefore i know only too well how dangerous it is to rely simply on such expert advice <e> <s> therefore will the noble lord press the government to pay the closest possible attention to this matter and to look into all the ramifications <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not wish to exacerbate the noble lords laryngitis may i ask him whether british rail have considered an electro-chemical solution to their problem <e> <s> namely the introduction of battery operated trains which years ago in ireland were run with great success <e> <s> battery operated trains are particularly suitable for running short distances and for this type of service <e> <s> would the noble lord suggest to british rail that the introduction of battery operated trains which would not involve the use of diesel or indeed any hydro-carbon fuel might be the ideal solution to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that his earlier remark that all such cases would be looked into carefully is not very <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble lord agree that throughout italy and other countries there are many murals outside buildings on walls which are preserved <e>", "<cs> my lords although i congratulate the noble earl on occupying his present position and on speaking for the government on energy perhaps i may express my regret and that of others that the prime minister did not see fit to appoint a minister for energy from this house <e> <s> does the noble earl consider that the fall-off in the ratio of wildcats to actual discoveries has not been the main reason for the decrease in interest shown by companies in exploration <e> <s> can he confirm that in there <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl mean that on no account is he prepared to take expert advice <e> <s> is that the general policy of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall repeat the question <e> <s> does the noble earl mean that it is not the intention of the present government to take any expert advice <e> <s> does he mean that it is far better to rely upon the strange whimsies which occur to noble lords opposite rather than to take any expert advice <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that as i suggested to him yesterday the number of discoveries per wildcat well actually drilled is decreasing <e> <s> is he aware that in wildcat wells per discovery were drilled in and for the bigger wells of over million barrels there were wildcat wells per discovery <e> <s> would he not agree that this indicates quite clearly that to extend the number of wildcat wells is not likely to produce a vastly increased number of discoveries <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider it appropriate to congratulate the government upon for the first time since coming into office ceasing to be revolutionary and being conservative instead <e> <s> it is agreeable to find that for once the government are prepared to accept that what has been done in the past might be continued in the future especially when it comes to research work in industry <e> <s> the order laid before us deals with a problem involving the cast iron research association which is one of the most important associations in this country in terms of our future and it is vital that we realise that unless the research is carried on effectively the cast iron industry will suffer enormously <e>", "<cs> i mean the conservative part of the conservative governments policies <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which has been raised by the noble earl lord kimberley is one which i am sure will be recognised by the government and particularly by the noble lord lord tregfarne who will be replying as one of considerable importance <e> <s> it is important because we are talking about the whole problem of the future of an industry <e> <s> the aircraft industry in this country has a notable past <e> <s> it has done remarkable things <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne knows better than i a mere amateur in these matters how well the industry has performed in the past <e> <s> however it has to be realised that the industry had reached the point where it was incapable without co-ordination i am not talking necessarily about nationalisation and without being brought together into one unit to continue to compete effectively on a world scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure there must be a market and i am sure that rolls-royce would like to hear from the noble earl with a guarantee of this market <e> <s> i think they would then go ahead and produce it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the point i was pressing was not so much the carrying of the hydrogen in the aircraft as the storage on the ground at the airport where considerable facilities would have to be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a pleasure this afternoon to listen to the noble lord lord armstrong making a maiden speech in this house <e> <s> to anyone coming from the north-east and there are some of us in this house it is a particular delight to welcome him as a speaker here <e> <s> perhaps i may refer to the fact that it was his ancestor who built rothbury and who equipped it with the first electric light system in the country using the lamp invented on tyneside by swan <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the first lord armstrong installed a water-powered electrical generator there in order to light the house <e> <s> so it is peculiarly appropriate that the noble lord made his maiden speech on this subject and we shall look forward to hearing from him frequently <e>", "<cs> then my lords all i can say is that if it was not said the right honourable lady was singularly badly reported <e> <s> it was certainly said in the press that that was the policy <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> i know it is nonsense <e> <s> i agree it is utter nonsense and it is exactly what is being said by the government at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords my lip-reading was bad i beg the noble earls pardon <e> <s> but it is important to realise that we shall only be able to solve the energy problem if we understand that energy is not one single thing <e> <s> it is like talking about food you might say we produce enough rice in all the world to feed everyone <e> <s> but man does not live by rice alone it is important to have a balanced diet <e> <s> if one is dealing with energy there has to be a balanced diet of energy <e> <s> one needs petroleum of course one does <e> <s> the chemical industry could not run on nuclear power at the present time the chemical industry needs petroleum <e> <s> it could run on coal but it is more difficult <e> <s> it is also important to realise that you cannot run motor cars at the present time except with petroleum <e> <s> it is important to realise that there are a lot of purposes such as heating where you may use petroleum <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is perfectly correct <e> <s> dounreay is a prototype fast breeder reactor <e> <s> there are fast breeder reactors also in france the united states and germany <e> <s> the point is that the dounreay reactor is too small to give a full-scale test of its commercial feasibility <e> <s> we know that it is technically feasible we do not know its commercial feasibility <e> <s> the proposal is that there should be built a full-scale reactor in order to test commercial viability <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the particular equipment which is said to have been supplied to pakistan is the centrifugal enrichment equipment <e> <s> if it is would he not agree that this is a very grave matter <e> <s> would he not also agree that this country like the whole of western europe is in fact very much dependent upon american good will with regard to uranium enrichment and that if we do not obey the rules which are generally laid down we really make it almost impossible for the americans to agree to supply us with any enriched uranium or any of the various facilities required for the fast breeder reactor for instance <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl confirm that our production of north sea gas has continued to increase and that there is no need for alarm except at the astonishing wastage which is encouraged by the oil companies in flaring off gas because they have not taken the trouble to develop the proper methods of separating gas from oil <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not agree that what is done with our oil depends entirely upon <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that we are really being saved entirely by the intervention of our own innovation bnoc not international innovation <e> <s> is it not true that if we did not have bnoc we should be entirely at the mercy of international combines <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a comment <e> <s> i was asking for information and i continue to ask for information <e> <s> the information for which i am asking is whether the noble earl is in a position to tell the house what is decided by the department of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to hold your lordships attention for a few minutes on a subject which is of very great importance namely the question of the production of chemicals <e> <s> i know that to most people organic chemistry is extremely complicated and difficult <e> <s> in fact it is quite as easy as the pools i think that most people if they put their minds to it could win just as easily as they could on the pools <e> <s> of course i admit that normally one loses on the pools but still there is a chance of winning <e>", "<cs> my lords we want it for the country <e>", "<cs> is that per cent <e> <s> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord sherfield for having introduced this debate and also the noble lord lord lovell-davis for having made a most impressive contribution <e> <s> as everyone has pointed out we are faced with the problem which confronts the whole of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to detain your lordships for any length of time but your lordships may recollect that about three or four years ago we had before us a felixstowe dock and railway bill <e> <s> it was a private bill brought by the british docks board in order to take over the felixstowe docks <e> <s> the bill received a second reading and went through a committee stage in this house but your lordships may recollect that it was rejected on third reading <e> <s> therefore the bill lapsed and the purchase of the felixstowe dock by european ferries then took place <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount not agree that if a sufficient amount of inaccurate statistical information is collected the mean of it has a certain probability of being approximately right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend lord paget will be delighted that his bill has caused quite lively interest <e> <s> noble lords have spoken against the bill and in favour of it and there were those who were half-way between <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley will recollect that he introduced a bill for the preservation of certain botanical species and that at about the same time i introduced into your lordships house a bill for the preservation of animal species <e> <s> in both cases the bills took up a lot of time <e> <s> i recollect that i made three second reading speeches with regard to my <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very much indebted to the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham for introducing this debate <e> <s> he has done something which i should have thought was almost impossible namely started in your lordships house a debate on energy on an entirely new level doing it in a way which i think your lordships will appreciate because many of the debates we have had have necessarily been technical <e> <s> they have dealt with the details of what sort of reactor we might consider suitable with questions of whether solar energy or wave energy is the right source to use or whether we should have coal oil or whatever it may be <e> <s> but the right reverend prelate has rightly and wisely placed the emphasis upon the decision-making process on how we look at these problems and anyone who has been at all concerned with energy over the last few years and in one way or another we all have has i am sure been struck by the fact that we have as many different views as we have advocates of the different forms of energy <e> <s> we can have all kinds of different ways of dealing with the matter but when one listens to the arguments that are put forward one finds that almost invariably they are put forward on a technical plane which is very difficult for the ordinary person to follow and understand <e> <s> consequently all of us tend to take a point of view and say ah <e> <s> nuclear energy is bad or the fast-breeder is the only conceivable solution or let us rely upon solar energy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl forgive me for intervening <e> <s> does that mean that he is likely to be able to do it before the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl in giving us the governments statement about their reactor policy has answered only one question and that is whether the government have made up their mind <e> <s> with regard to the rest the whole position is left in very grave doubt <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl one or two questions on this matter <e> <s> first what is going to be the impact of the proposals of the government upon the coal industry <e> <s> it was previously stated that we would have a substantial need for coal throughout the s <e> <s> but the statement of the government implies that in effect there is to be a replacement of coal stations by nuclear stations because there is no necessity for -gigawatt stations in addition to what is already being produced and therefore some of these must be replacing coal stations <e> <s> what will happen to declared government policy on the coal industry <e> <s> does the noble earl mean that in effect there will be a reduction in the development of the coal mining industry which will have grave repercussions <e>", "<cs> my lords in the statement which the noble earl gave us from the government he said that it was hoped that gas would be made available by this policy for many generations to come <e> <s> but it is well-known that the total supply of gas from the north sea so far as we are aware of it <e> <s> is not likely to last for more than to years which is not many generations <e> <s> therefore there is no great advantage in conserving this gas especially as one is given to understand that the producers from the north sea will find it extremely un-remunerative if they have to cut back the supply <e> <s> is it not therefore a poor policy to adopt now to try to conserve the gas in that particular way <e> <s> is it not also true that to raise the cost of gas with some quaint theory of thermal egalitarianism in which they would want to make the price of all fuels the same is really ludicrous <e> <s> the cost of electricity in real terms is necessarily not less than three times the cost of the fuel used whereas the cost of gas as used is virtually the same as the cost of production <e> <s> is it not therefore quite foolish to try to have this quaint egalitarianism <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that years ago just after the last war the famous scientist who was then a member of her majestys government the late lord cherwell made the statement that whereas there was no defence against the destruction and shock so far as the direct radiation was concerned a sheet of brown paper was all that was needed <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that in the united states some years back there was appointed a special minister to look into the whole question of civil defence and his view was that if there was an all out attack whatever defence there was half the population of the united states would be destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be the first person to speak in this debate who knows nothing at all about beekeeping <e> <s> i have listened with fascination to those who do know about it and i shall go away a little instructed but i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl will agree that the point that my noble friend raises is an important one <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl allow me to make one comment on that <e> <s> i take his point that this is a bill which has been introduced because it was wanted by the beekeepers but it is not a private members bill it is a bill which has been introduced by the government <e> <s> therefore i feel that the government take full responsibility for the clauses in it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords answer or set of answers mean that the governments interest in conservation is minimal <e>", "<cs> like the noble earl lord ferrers i was delighted when i noticed that the noble lord lord hives had capped the bill in the appropriate way and it is pleasant to find further interest being taken in it <e> <s> it is common when the government are given powers to deal with a subject like this to ask that they should consult with certain authorities but usually i think i am right in saying this these authorities are established research authorities or authorities recognised as being the best people to advise in the matter this comes into a number of conservation measures for example <e> <s> from what the minister said i gather there is no such clearly defined person as a national beekeeping adviser and that the only other relevant body is the bee farmers association which seems to be more concerned with the actual marketing of products and with looking after bees than with being a scientific body <e> <s> if there is no such scientific body i would agree with the minister that it would be wiser not to have any further addition in the bill of the type suggested by the noble lord lord hives <e> <s> i do not know whether lord hives can help us in the matter and whether he has any specific scientific body in mind which could be brought in to advise <e>", "<cs> i feel a little less happy with the noble earls reply on this amendment than with his reply on the previous one <e> <s> i am not clear as to why he is not prepared to have the method inserted in the order because it seems to me that to leave the method entirely to the individual who goes round to deal with a particular case without there being any defined method will mean that the position will be vague and uncertain <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl for example how many inspectors his department has who would be competent to deal with this matter and who on their own initiative without any clear instructions laid down would be able to cope with every situation <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has put the case against the amendment on the grounds first of all that bees on destruction have never been protected in this way by any form of compensation and furthermore that plants are not protected <e> <s> but plants belong to an entirely different part of the whole of our life cycle and they are dealt with in quite a different way from animals <e> <s> the bee after all is an animal and consequently one must compare it with other animals and not with plants <e> <s> there may be an argument for looking at plants as well and i have no doubt that the noble lord lord skelmersdale would be able to give us some persuasive arguments about plants <e> <s> but we are not at the moment discussing plants we are discussing bees <e>", "<cs> i understand that in the case of foot and mouth disease compensation is always paid <e> <s> i think it is reasonable that it should be paid <e> <s> i should have thought there was little doubt that paying compensation helps to keep down foot and mouth disease to keep it under control and to prevent it from spreading throughout the country it is not endemic in this country as it is in many other parts of europe and in addition it is a just and fair thing to do <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble earl will be glad to know that in compensation i would not wish at all to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the bill which started as quite a good bill is now being made into an excellent bill <e> <s> therefore it would be quite wrong for me to remove the compensation which he would wish to have <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that it is i think the universal opinion of this house that such charges are undesirable and that they are very grateful for the statement made by the noble lord on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that her majestys government are thinking of adopting bimetallism <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that even if we find it difficult to wear suits in this house we shall still be expected to wear ties <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that although most of us would entirely agree with the remarks made by the noble lord lord todd it is nevertheless extremely important that scientific contacts should be maintained <e> <s> failure to maintain scientific contacts has never been of any benefit at all <e> <s> will the noble lord bear in mind that before there was a deep freeze in all our relations with the soviet union and as a consequence we were unaware of the scientific work that was being pursued there <e> <s> it came as a great shock to many people to realise that in certain fields of science not all the soviet union were extremely advanced <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that while retaining the right to express ourselves very forcefully about human rights it would be absolutely disastrous if we were to go back to a period in which we did not maintain scientific contacts <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that it is not the intention of his department to close down training centres but rather to extend and improve them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord forgive me for asking him whether he is aware of the fact that both pakistan and india can at the present time if they have not already done it make an atom bomb without having any fast breeder reactors <e>", "<cs> my lords the speeches of the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble viscount lord thurso have made it almost unnecessary for anyone else to speak except for the noble earl lord gowrie in reply <e> <s> i have little to add to the excellent remarks that both of them have made <e> <s> it is abundantly clear not that we must have a programme of breeder reactors but that we must go ahead to the next step of building a fully commercial breeder reactor <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord trefgarne introduced this bills second reading i was fascinated listening to him because it seemed to me that he did not produce any reason at all for introducing the bill <e> <s> on the one hand he explained how extremely well british aerospace have done their job <e> <s> he went out of his way to tell us how many different new aircraft they had <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but with not quite the same speech whereas the noble lord lord orr-ewing delivered almost the same speech on that occasion <e> <s> he has brought it up to date of course <e> <s> some of the figures are a bit different <e> <s> in the same way as on that occasion which was th september he has not paid any attention at all to the purpose of this bill <e> <s> he scarcely mentioned in his speech today the british aerospace industry he told us about british steel he told us about all the other nationalised industries but not a word about british aerospace <e> <s> i looked down and i wondered what bill we were indeed discussing <e> <s> it clearly was not the bill that was printed <e> <s> we were discussing something quite different <e> <s> we were discussing apparently his views and observations on nationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what are the vapour pressures of avgas l and of ordinary four-star fuel <e> <s> can he also tell us what are their relative octane numbers <e> <s> these are both important parts in fact they seem to me to be vital parts of his answer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that when he talks about vapour lock in the system it depends entirely upon the relative vapour pressures of the two and therefore his answer is if he will forgive me for saying so unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton has been acting as a very competent pinch hitter for the noble lord lord trefgarne in attempting to deal with this problem but would he not care to go back to his earlier work with regard to conservation and realise that this is a most important international matter <e> <s> would he not agree therefore that it is quite urgent that the govern-ment should use all their influence in order to have the matter dealt with properly <e> <s> would he not also agree that it would be quite disastrous if as a result of deforestation another part of the world had to demand aid and help <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that his own answers and the comments of the noble viscount lord eccles both suggest that the real cause of the difficulty is the operation of the market rather than any form of government interference <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> i did not say that there should be no limit i certainly did not mean that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin has attributed to me certain ideas and remarks <e> <s> i do not hold those ideas and i do not think that i made those remarks <e> <s> i certainly did not say in fact i deliberately said the opposite that no savings could be made <e> <s> i pointed out what savings could be made <e> <s> i pointed out that not all these savings could go on being made year after year <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks as someone who played an important part in a local authority that it is wise policy not to make repairs to buildings for a number of years if that is what he meant then it must have been a very strange local authority that was able to put up with that sort of thing for a period of years <e> <s> i said that a number of savings could not be made except on an emergency basis for one or at the most two years but that there were many areas where savings could be madeand that the purpose of setting up a body such as this advanced further education commission would be that it would look at the matter carefully and decide how any restriction should be carried out <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trefgarne has put the case for the government very clearly but he has suggested that the purpose of the amendment is to impose restrictions and to create a sort of straitjacket in which the company is to operate <e> <s> on the contrary the purpose of this amendment is really to ensure that the company will operate in a way which is clearly defined by national interests <e> <s> this is not an unimportant matter in an industry like the aerospace industry <e> <s> as the noble lord knows perfectly well having been associated with the industry the industry has played an extremely important part in the whole post-war development in this country <e> <s> in fact if one looks at this industry and compares it with certain other industries one is really amazed at the success that the industry has had <e> <s> and it has had this success because even when it was under private enterprise the industry was still under a considerable amount of govern <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne has put the governments case on this matter <e> <s> i must confess that i find it a little like asking for a bowl of water so that their hands can be washed and a towel so that they can be dried so that they may be able to say that their intentions are good <e> <s> but they do not take any steps themselves they leave it to the company that is formed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye has been trying to trail his coat and at the same time twist tails and undoubtedly he hopes that he will elicit some absolutely revealing remarks which he can quote on some other occasion <e> <s> the noble lord speaks with persuasion and interest <e> <s> he tries to tell us that because a particular speaker at a labour party conference who was not speaking officially for the labour party made statements which were well received by perhaps a number an unspecified number of delegates he is therefore able to use these as an absolute argument as to what is labour party policy <e> <s> but labour party policy has been stated again and again and not only has it been stated but it has been practised when nationalisation of industries has taken place <e> <s> the noble lord knows perfectly well that on no single occasion has there been confiscation on every occasion there has been compensation <e>", "<cs> of course i do not at all reply in a political spirit <e> <s> the fact that i happened to mention the labour party is irrelevant <e> <s> i am not quite certain whether this situation is like <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trefgarne has twice stated that it is the intention of the government not to allow their holding to drop below per cent <e> <s> such a statement as i pointed out on second reading is a statement which bears no permanent force at all <e> <s> the mere fact that the minister states in parliament that it is the intention of the government to do something does not commit that government and certainly does not commit any other government <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord is not prepared to write such a figure into the bill then his statement is worthless <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord saysthis government he is saying that the present ministers who make such a statement have a certain honourable obligation in the matter <e> <s> he does not mean and he knows he cannot mean that the government which may or may not be in office during the next few years will be bound by such a statement <e> <s> this has happened in the past <e> <s> one knows perfectly well of occasions when definite statements have been made by ministers <e> <s> there was one made some years ago on immigration <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord is not prepared to accept the amendment <e> <s> i realise of course that if the government consider that this is at variance with the purpose of the bill then the noble lord has the ability to carry that point of view <e> <s> i am sorry about that because i think that the government may regret that they do not have such a clause in the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the remarks made by my noble friend lord shinwell were fascinating <e> <s> everyone knows that the famous manny shinwell could have excelled in any field he wished without any specific training he obviously did

the slightest doubt that the noble lord makes the statement in good faith <e> <s> will he also tell us if he is certain that he will be equally responsible for dealing with this subject in one two

government also pay attention to the political performance of those who have been agitating for the abolition of the ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord consider that the language of the court as referred to in the question and as given in <e>", "<cs> my lords while i congratulate the noble lord on his assiduity and versatility of achievement in this house may i ask whether her majestys government consider it appropriate to expect the athletes to exercise sanctions which her majestys government are not themselves prepared to exercise <e> <s> is it not true that every country that has acted as host to the olympic games has used the olympic games for advertising itself <e> <s> has not this been done regularly <e> <s> is there anything wrong in what the olympic committee of the soviet union has done <e> <s> according to the international olympic committee they have carried out strictly all their obligations <e> <s> is it not therefore absurd to turn to the athletes and to ask them to do what her majestys government have not the courage to do themselves <e>", "<cs> i was very glad to hear the noble and learned lord the lord advocate give the government point of view in this matter <e> <s> i listened with great interest to my noble friend lord howie <e> <s> having been in a professional position where i was also a member of a trade union i appreciate that problems arise <e> <s> it seems to me that the proper way to deal with these problems is through a code of conduct and not through writing it into an act of parliament <e> <s> my reason for thinking that in part is that it is very undesirable to put professional people belonging to a particular professional association in a special legal position inside a trade union <e> <s> i think that causes real problems and it is therefore a very undesirable thing to do <e> <s> i would therefore hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate would maintain the position of the government in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware i know that he takes a great interest in these matters that the matter which has been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl in introducing this bill made it fairly clear that the bill is the consequence of bad housekeeping <e> <s> i am not blaming the present government for this at all because it is something for which all governments must take the blame and in particular i think the british gas corporation must take the blame because we are told that the storage facilities and the whole method of dealing with the distribution of gas may not be adequate to cope with the demand from industry <e> <s> the reason is that over the years whatever the british gas corporation may say the priority has been to take the cheap and easy way of getting rid of gas that is distributing it through the ordinary distribution system to the domestic consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble and learned lord agree that confusion of language usually arises from initial confusion of thought <e> <s> would he not also accept that if other ministers and draftsmen were to follow his own affection for the english language the drafting might be much better <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very much indebted to the noble earl lord grey for introducing this subject one which is of very considerable importance <e> <s> as he rightly pointed out it concerns the future of london and the future of london is something which matters not just to those who happen at the moment to live in london it matters to all people who come to london <e> <s> it matters to the inhabitants of this country it matters considerably to the inhabitants of other countries <e> <s> it is therefore something which is of international importance and not of parochial importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the noble viscount a particular question about this problem of the steel industry <e> <s> it is one which a vital to that part of the country in which i have been living <e> <s> i am referring to the town of consett <e> <s> as i understand it and i know the town fairly well consett is entirely dependent upon the steel industry <e> <s> i understand also perhaps the noble viscount can tell us about this that consett has been told that the steel industry there is to be closed down entirely at the beginning of september <e> <s> i understand further and again perhaps the noble viscount can confirm this that consett happens to be one of the areas of the british steel corporation which is productive and which has been producing a profit <e>", "<cs> i am asking a question <e> <s> if the chief whip of the government will forgive me a noble lord is entitled to ask a question in this house <e> <s> the question i am asking is whether it is intended to continue with the closure of the whole of this steel complex in consett which lies in a part of the country where unemployment is running at the rate of over per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish for one moment to oppose the third reading of this bill <e> <s> as i said on second reading this is a bill which has to go through although in my opinion it is a trivial bill which except for the fact that it is necessary to cope with the problems of the gas board does nothing for the gas industry <e> <s> my noble friend lord irving of dartford has made i think some extremely telling points both at the committee stage and now and i hope the government will not let the matter rest where it is but will in the near future come forward with more clear and positive proposals for the gas industry which is a very important industry in connection with some of the highly energy-intensive industries in this country <e> <s> this is going to be vital <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a pleasure to listen to the noble earl on this matter <e> <s> he explained it extremely clearly and told us exactly why the order is necessary <e> <s> from these benches we would not wish to oppose the order but on the contrary welcome it <e> <s> the noble earl made certain references to the potency of the velvet of which frankly i was not aware <e> <s> i am always interested when matters like this come before your lordships house because so much information is put at our disposal and we go away very much better educated than when we came in <e> <s> i remember that when we were discussing the endangered species act we learnt that the whiskers of tigers were considered to be of importance in parts of the world with regard to potency and i have no doubt there are many other things such as the horns of rhinoceros which are considered important <e>", "<cs> my lords as this order is entirely consequent on the other one we on this side of the house would agree with it entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount is serious in saying that the government intend to extend opportunities for the training of young people why is it that they have closed down two skill centres in county durham and over the whole of that region <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for having clarified some of the issues with regard to these regulations <e> <s> however there are i think one or two other points that still require clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> may i ask him whether the medical advice is that really would be harmless on the eyes <e> <s> because i am surprised if such medical advice has been given <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a brief comment about this bill <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord somers on having persisted in getting this bill through <e> <s> i think that no one in this house would be opposed to this bill <e> <s> i think we all feel that it is a bill that is desirable <e> <s> we were not always happy in the earlier stages with all the wording but i think that we should accept this bill and congratulate the noble lord lord somers <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a subject of fairly considerable interest and i would agree very largely with the remarks that have been made by my noble friend lord howie but i think there is a real problem which in my opinion cannot be resolved by inserting anything into an act of parliament essentially what we are dealing with here is the problem of an individual who is a member of a professional association and who is also a member of a trade union <e> <s> he joined the trade union deliberately with his eyes open and as one who could easily have been covered by this very matter which is raised by my noble friend i feel that if one joins a trade union then one is bound by the rules of the trade union because one did it deliberately <e> <s> i think that if one has some other obligation then this obligation clearly should be dealt with by means of a code of conduct and not by means of an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the real objection to the chemical weapon is not that it is effective but that it is indiscriminate <e> <s> therefore is it not vital that a general convention should be reached <e> <s> would not the reaching of such a convention accepted by a large body of states be a powerful influence on the two super-powers to bring them to an agreement <e> <s> will her majestys government bear this in mind and press as a matter of urgency the reaching of a general convention banning chemical and bacteriological weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been pointed out by several of your lordships the bill is a truncated version of the original bill that was brought forward <e> <s> we all warmly congratulate my noble friend lord northfield for the tenacity that he has shown in bringing this bill through three second readings <e> <s> we have no doubt at all that it is worth while because although the bill has been cut down although it is not the same bill as came forward originally it still achieves a very important purpose and it would be madness to risk the bill simply in order to reinsert any of the various points which many of us feel perhaps ought to be in a bill of this type <e> <s> but it is so important that the bill should go through that i am sure we shall all agree that the bill ought to be passed without modification <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been very interesting to hear the remarks made by my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> he takes such an interest in the animal kingdom that we all respect what he has to say and we realise that he speaks with a profundity of knowledge and a kindliness which are extremely important <e> <s> this bill which is a small bill is a bill to amend the act of an act which was entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> i wanted to ask him about the differentiation between the operating grant and the social grant <e> <s> is the operating grant purely for normal operations and the social grant for situations where there are special severe losses <e> <s> what is the meaning of the social grant as differentiated from the operating grant <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has produced some fascinating speeches <e> <s> it has produced a very human speech from my noble friend lord taylor of mansfield we all heard it with great interest and regard <e> <s> it has also been a debate which i think the noble earl lord gowrie will feel has been a very valuable one and one which perhaps i may say has been comforting to him because there has been such general agreement <e> <s> in particular i should like as my noble friend lord hale has done to say how much we all appreciate the way in which the noble earl lord lauderdale has shown over a number of years a clear determination to try to get every government to appreciate the need for a continuing long-term policy for the coal industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government pay attention to the fact that a transport service to and from heathrow is absolutely vital for people who are unable to pay the large taxi fares <e> <s> will the minister bear in mind that at present british airways runs the service whereas in other countries similar services are not run by single airlines <e> <s> why is this service not run by the airports authority <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that at present one can travel by british airways bus to only two of the three terminals <e> <s> one ought to be able to get to all three terminals <e>", "<cs> i am still asking a question my lords <e> <s> will the noble lord appreciate the absolute vital necessity of maintaining a proper bus service to and from heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the intention of the government if the present discussions are not successful to allow the matter to go to negotiation <e> <s> will the noble baroness also remember that on a previous occasion five years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill is a small <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is a small non-contentious one <e> <s> it was introduced into another place as a private members bill and i was asked to take it over in your lordships house by an honourable friend mr mckelvey member for kilmarnock who introduced it into the commons <e> <s> in introducing this bill i want to make it clear that it has a very simple purpose to put women in scotland on the particular issue of assurance policies in the same position as is applied by the law of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that today the cost of gas is not based on any economic standards at all but is based entirely upon the decision of the government to raise the price of gas <e> <s> would not the noble earl also agree that there are in the country many industries that suffer very gravely from this rise in the cost of gas <e> <s> these are the energy-intensive industries <e> <s> would the noble earl not agree that this has nothing to do with the question of equating the cost of energy throughout the whole sector <e> <s> because it is impossible to equate the cost of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving the third reading of this bill may i remind the house that its rapid and non-contentious progress through the house was made memorable by the remarks of the noble lord lord ross of marnock who quoting from robert burns said at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that his statements today have been the best justification for strict government control of the banking system <e>", "<cs> frequently i find myself having to rise in your lordships house to speak on something of which my ignorance is considerable <e> <s> i took part in the second reading debate on this bill and it seemed to me at the time that the bill was a perfectly reasonable one that it was not a bill which was advocating some major change in our whole system of licensing but rather it was a bill that was putting right an anomaly that had existed <e> <s> i said so at the time and i still feel especially after the very clear exposition which the noble viscount lord long has given us that the bill is a perfectly reasonable one <e> <s> i agree with a great deal of what my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby has said <e>", "<cs> to be perfectly frank i give the noble lord no support at all but that does not mean i do not sympathise with a lot of what he has said <e> <s> i think it might very well be desirable that there should be an absolute ban on shooting at night <e> <s> but what the noble lord proposes will not do this <e> <s> it will leave the law exactly as it is <e>", "<cs> i agree for years <e> <s> but i did not take part in politics in order to ensure that we never changed something which had been in existence for years <e> <s> on the contrary i have felt that our purpose certainly it is my attitude towards it is that we look towards continuous improvement and modification <e> <s> it seems to me that this anomaly is one that should be removed <e> <s> the proposal that the clause stand part is absolutely essential to the continuance of this bill <e> <s> if this clause does not stand part there is no bill <e> <s> it is unusual for us in this committee on the sort of evidence that has been put before us to vote down a bill which comes to us from the other house <e> <s> i do not say that we should not vote them down <e> <s> we have done so in the past but i think that we should do it on some much more clearly defined purpose than has been put before us tonight <e> <s> it seems to me that all we have had put before us tonight is from the noble viscount lord long a clear statement of the present position and from the noble lord lord houghton a very emphatic statement that he is opposed to all forms of shooting <e> <s> i sympathise with him but this is not the way of doing it <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble lord said but i must say that i <e>", "<cs> i accept absolutely what the noble lord says and i leave it to all of us to decide what his thoughts are <e> <s> i would put it in this way <e> <s> it is not by opposing a clause of this type in a bill which has passed through the other place which has passed second reading in this house which would kill the bill that one gets rid of night shooting <e> <s> night shooting will remain but for a privileged class <e> <s> the purpose of this bill is to remove the privilege and to make certain that the person who is really concerned with his property with his farm should be allowed to shoot <e> <s> therefore i can see no reason at all why we should not allow clause to stand part <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord irving and the other two noble lords who have spoken have both given clear examples of the problems raised in industry as a result of the high price of gas and of oil <e> <s> we have discussed this problem before in this house with various ministers not one of whom unfortunately has been attached to the department of energy <e> <s> consequently we keep on being faced with noble lords who make excellent speeches from their briefs but who unfortunately are unable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl referred to the long-range marginal cost but surely that cost is infinite <e> <s> the gas supply runs out there will not be any gas <e> <s> what is the range about which the noble earl is talking <e>", "<cs> my lords the point which i was trying to make had nothing to do with actual interference with pricing <e> <s> i think that the government have interfered but that is not the point that i was making <e> <s> i was making a rather wider point and if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so i first made it in your lordships house in in a debate in which i said before natural gas was being widely used that natural gas was such an important product that it ought to be used primarily in the chemical industry and in those places where there was no alternative <e> <s> i am not blaming the present government any more than i am blaming previous governments <e> <s> i am saying that it is the national policy which is wrong as regards this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the high quality of the electorate in newcastle-upon-tyne fully justified the preferential treatment given to the electors there <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening in the debate without having given notice but i should explain that it was not until today that i realised that i would be able to be present and so take part <e> <s> this is a very interesting and important bill and i welcome its presentation to your lordships house <e> <s> it has been particularly pleasant to find myself so frequently in accord with my noble socialist and interventionist friend and colleague the noble earl lord lauderdale <e> <s> clearly we think along very similar lines and i have no doubt at all that if governments of all types paid more attention to what the noble earl suggests and what perhaps i occasionally am able to back up as indeed is the noble lord lord tanlaw our progress with energy legislation and practice would be much more rapid and much better than it has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we have all been very grateful to the noble baroness for the care with which she has outlined this order <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord wells-pestell pointed out there is one gap and that refers to nurses <e> <s> having explained the rest of the order in detail the noble baroness pointed out that nurses were also included and indeed that is exactly how it is put down in the order <e> <s> there is no clear reference to nurses except that they are included in this abolition of the old form of testing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it might be a good compromise to have it on a fixed date every leap year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell us how much money the government are contributing towards the research associations <e> <s> i do not think he mentioned that in the list of government expenditure he read out <e>", "<cs> no my lords the research associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit that this bill is a much better bill than i thought at first sight <e> <s> in fact looking at it carefully i have to say that really it is a good bill <e> <s> it is quite a good bill because it sets out to do a number of things to separate telecommunications from the postal services and to liberalise the telecommunications industry <e> <s> all these are excellent things to do especially if one happens to be a big manufacturer of equipment they are excellent for every purpose for which the conservative party stands <e> <s> therefore it is a good bill for the conservative party to put forward it is an excellent bill because it shows quite clearly what the conservative party wants to do with all our national industry <e> <s> the conservative party has already started this with the aerospace industry <e> <s> now it moves on to telecommunications <e> <s> i do not disagree with what the conservative party is doing <e> <s> if i were of the conservative partys point of view and was concerned about large manufacturing countries particularly america and japan i should applaud this bill <e> <s> that is why i <e>", "<cs> yes says the noble lord on the front bench my lords <e> <s> no doubt it will be of considerable value to him in his horticultural interests to have some better means of communication and no doubt he would prefer to buy it from a cut-price firm rather than go to the post office <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that many people will find that there is a certain advantage to them but the question is is it of overall advantage to the people of the country <e> <s> that is what matters <e> <s> and clearly it is not in their interests <e> <s> it is not in their interests because it removes the common carrier responsibility which is that of the post office and it allows competition <e> <s> competition sounds a beautiful word <e> <s> we all like competition <e> <s> we agree with competition but if competition crushes the very thing one is aiming at then it does no good at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that i am anxious to stay <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord permit me to make one comment on that <e> <s> surely what he has just said shows that the more one tries to liberalise the more one has to regulate

lordships will be tolerant and will remember that i have not been actively working in a university for many years <e> <s> this debate has been one of very great fascination and significance <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness will agree that what has been said this afternoon and evening must be taken into very serious account by her department in looking at the whole picture of higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would forgive me for one moment he has raised an extremely important and interesting point but does he not think that in the field of natural science the rate of development of concepts has been so great that we are doing a disservice to a young man if we do not introduce him to the new concepts while he is still an undergraduate <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government bear in mind that there are available throughout the country facilities on quite an extensive scale in polytechnics and colleges of further education which could help in doing the kind of thing that the noble lord lord orr-ewing has suggested and which was earlier suggested i think by mr <e> <s> prior with regard to an open technical university <e> <s> would they bear in mind that this is a matter of urgency not something that should be left to the slow process of time with which we are only too familiar in this country <e> <s> it could mean that we wait for or years to do something which needs to be done today <e> <s> would they remember that it means setting up a really effective central organisation analogous to the present open university <e>", "<cs> my lords does the answer of the noble baroness mean that the government are indifferent to the consequences of their policy upon higher education or does it mean that they are deliberately trying to squeeze higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house accept that this is an amendment which does have some effect in improving the bill <e> <s> therefore we would not oppose it and would advise its acceptance <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are very glad that this amendment was passed by the commons and is being accepted by the government <e> <s> it is a very important matter that any obligation undertaken by the united kingdom with regard to deep sea mining should be in agreement with any international conference conclusion <e> <s>

extremely important that what we do in this country should be in agreement with international conventions <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment again is one with which we do not disagree at all <e> <s> i think it would be appropriate for me to say at this stage that we on this side of the house have been very appreciative of the trouble that the noble earl has taken in dealing with this bill all the way through <e> <s> we consider that although the bill is a trivial bill and is in fact an unnecessary bill nevertheless it is not if properly interpreted a thoroughly objectionable bill <e> <s> may we remind the government that this question of the bed of the deep sea the ocean bed is the common heritage of mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord confirm the statement of his noble friend that per cent <e> <s> of the forward troops of the soviet armies are armed with chemical weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the uses of the shuttle are very largely military and that indeed the funding of the shuttle has now been taken over to a very large extent by the defence budget of the united states and a guarantee has been given by nasa that at least half the number of shuttles built will be used purely for military purposes and not for civilian purposes <e> <s> does he not therefore think that despite the uncertainty of my noble friend lord shinwell as to the meaning of outer space it is actually pretty accurately defined and the fact that there is at the present time an agreement means that we ought to extend that agreement and make certain that

undergraduates <e> <s> will he in particular absolutely disown the nonsensical remarks just made about the polytechnics <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for what he has been saying

those results to industry <e> <s> are the government representatives of the department of industry in various parts of the country able to convey to firms in their regions the results of that work <e> <s> i am not referring to large firms i do not worry about them they have their own methods of getting the results but the small firms <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that these particular species are not included in the list of endangered species <e> <s> if this is so is it not undesirable to have unilateral action in such a case especially when the canadian government claim that they have investigated the matter and have approved of it because they consider it essential to cull the seals in the interest of preserving fish <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord beswick for having introduced this important debate because it gives us an opportunity to discuss what we frequently try to sweep under the carpet that is the whole question of how we are concerned with the economy and indeed the whole social character of our country <e> <s> my noble friend lord beswick has called attention to the consequences of the governments increasing policy of privatisation and the importance of concentrating on a positive policy to secure maximum efficiency within the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter considers that to be the opposite then i find his use of the english language somewhat strange <e> <s> i would have said that he was saying exactly what i said only slightly modifying the emphasis <e>", "<cs> well a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse <e> <s> my lords i am a socialist because i believe that we can only get liberty we can only get the full development of the personality under socialism <e> <s> i am convinced of that and it is why i am a socialist <e> <s> but that does not mean that i want to nationalise everything <e> <s> that is not what is meant by socialism <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl can help me a little <e> <s> i realise of course that like most people who have to speak from his bench on energy matters he is not himself specifically concerned with energy <e> <s> in other words it has to be taken up on the side and we have noticed frequently that because of this the government have been at a certain disadvantage in dealing with energy matters <e> <s> but a general problem arises here which is not just an energy problem <e> <s> the noble earl has been explaining that it is the intention of the government in this bill to make the actual working of the new company as private as possible exactly like that of any other company i think those are almost the words he used <e> <s> at the same time he is in a somewhat difficult position because he tries also to explain that the government will have complete control will be able to do everything they have done in the past and that consequently the company cannot be a completely free company <e> <s> in fact it would be a very dangerous thing for a government of this country to set up such an entirely free and independent company by devolving the rights of the government and of the country itself <e>", "<cs> we have here a fascinating example of the problems which arise when one tries to deal with private enterprise with a capitalist organisation and one tries to control it modify it and bring it under some sort of sensible control by the workers themselves <e> <s> the government keep on saying that they are trying to put the ownership of all these industries which have been in national control into the hands of the people <e> <s> but who are the people about whom they are talking <e> <s> it becomes perfectly clear that they do not mean the people working in the industry <e> <s> it becomes equally clear that they do not want to put the ownership in the hands of the people as a whole because it is the exact opposite at which they aim <e> <s> so when they talk about this they really want to be a little honest with us <e> <s> they want to tell us what they are really aiming at <e> <s> this of course they do not like to do <e> <s> it is very much better that they should keep their aims hidden and publish only the gloss which they like to put on them <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl recollect that when we were discussing the aircraft industry and the question of bringing it back into private ownership this same question was raised so it is not a new question at all <e> <s> if every time it is raised we are told it is not being done anywhere else we must reply that it is not being done anywhere else because the present government refuse to allow it to be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the position in regard to this convention resembles the position in regard to an earlier convention about endangered species <e> <s> was it not our failure to ratify that earlier convention that made it extremely difficult for this country to take action on endangered species <e> <s> this country should be taking a lead because the whole of the development of the oceans is something in which we are vitally interested <e> <s> would the minister agree that it should be done in fact it must be done under proper international control <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house which country tried to prevent participation in the moscow olympic games <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in your lordships house we have a great faculty for taking an extremely important subject and treating it in such a matter of fact way that it sounds as though it were not a very important subject <e> <s> i think we regularly seem to do this in the field of energy <e> <s> i myself have previously called attention in your lordships house to the fact that we do not have anyone of ministerial rank in your lordships house speaking for energy <e> <s> in fact this seems to be not peculiar to this government although i am rather surprised that this government who have been talking as though they wanted to do something about energy have fallen into the trap but quite common <e> <s> indeed it is a long time since we had someone of full ministerial rank speaking in your lordships house on the subject of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind that although we all recognise the great devotion and hard work put in by nurses for which we admire them there is a further point which is that they have a long period of training <e> <s> they train for three four or even five years and during that period they do not receive a training grant as a student would but only low pay for the hard work they put in <e> <s> will the government bear in mind that most of us in the community feel that we owe a very great debt to the nursing profession and that it is time we recognised that debt by making a substantial award to its members <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that members of this house and indeed of the public at large having seen the act passed by parliament are deeply concerned about the failure to implement it by bringing the regulations into force <e> <s> will he bring the strongest pressure to bear upon the department concerned to ensure that these regulations are brought into force as quickly as possible otherwise the purpose of the act is being defeated every day <e>", "<cs> like the noble earl lord halsbury i have been a member of the royal society of chemistry for many years <e> <s> i have received in the last few days a mass of information from them about this particular matter which we are discussing <e> <s> i have been through this with care and clearly there is a strong case <e> <s> before i heard what the noble viscount had to say which i found very convincing looking through the material from the royal society of chemistry some doubts came into my mind about this amendment <e> <s> indeed the doubts arose because of certain legal advice that was given to the royal society of chemistry by their solicitors <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords previous answer mean that her majestys government are worried only about those students who come on public funds and that they do not worry at all about <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl able to tell us whether the government are aware of the investigation carried out by the international institute of applied systems analysis which only last year after examining the position of fast breeders said that so far as region is concerned which is the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl suggest to his right honourable friend in the other place that it might be desirable to look at the present programme of ordinary thermal reactors <e> <s> will he pay attention to the report from the inspectorate today stating that they are not prepared to approve of immediate progress with the proposed pressurised water reactor and will he not therefore suggest that it would be better to scrap this ill-considered programme and rather go over to the fast breeder reactor which is known to be safe <e>", "<cs> my lords why not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather difficult to rise at the end of a debate like this where so many people have spoken so sensitively and with such care about the whole problem <e> <s> i particularly agreed with a lot of what the noble baroness lady airey has just said <e> <s> i think one has to think of this matter in terms of the whole of the development which takes place on the banks of the river thames <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his answer partial and unsatisfactory as it is <e> <s> can the noble earl say whether it is the intention of the government not separate individual local authorities to favour some overall plan which covers various local authorities and deals with the area mentioned in my question <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that a mere exercise in one-upmanship is not a substitute for a reasoned answer <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble lord reconcile his statements about the expansion of education in the further and higher education field with the cutting back of the numbers to be admitted to universities and polytechnics <e> <s> would he not agree that it is much more sensible to use the institutions which now exist for the purpose of giving education to that age rather than to create new methods of very doubtful significance <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an extremely important matter and one in which i find myself very much in sympathy with the basic idea of the amendment but i am not in the least satisfied that this is the right way of going about it <e> <s> i speak with perhaps a little personal knowledge because i have had three hips replaced and i am awaiting the replacement of a fourth hip <e> <s> perhaps i sound like a quadruped <e> <s> the replacement of these hips has been of immense importance to me in my life <e> <s> i certainly look forward to having the fourth hip replaced <e> <s> but i want to say and i think this bears out what the noble baroness lady seear was saying that in judging these matters one has to judge how significant and important they are <e> <s> it is all very well to say that a specialist an excellent person has judged that some operation ought to be carried out <e> <s> how really important is this <e> <s> it is not so easy to make this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness very well understands what i am saying <e> <s> there are inadequate facilities available throughout the whole country for the operation to be carried out <e> <s> this i know to be a fact <e> <s> i know it because i happen to know a little about this matter <e> <s> i had my two hips replaced in <e> <s> i had a third hip replaced if i may put it that way a year and a half ago <e> <s> i was told at the time that i ought to have my other hip replaced as well <e>", "<cs> i will give way to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i am speaking very clearly to the amendment my lords i did not make a second reading speech <e> <s> the amendment deals with industrial action resulting <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord the minister says that the government hope that girls will get equal opportunities does he not realise that in actual fact they never get equal opportunities on the science side <e> <s> is it not time that the government began to take some positive action in this matter rather than to leave it to the whims of private enterprise in the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether the committee formed any opinion about converting natural gas into methanol in order to transport it rather than to transport liquefied natural gas <e>"]
