["<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord trefgarne introduced this bills second reading i was fascinated listening to him because it seemed to me that he did not produce any reason at all for introducing the bill <e> <s> on the one hand he explained how extremely well british aerospace have done their job <e> <s> he went out of his way to tell us how many different new aircraft they had <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but with not quite the same speech whereas the noble lord lord orr-ewing delivered almost the same speech on that occasion <e> <s> he has brought it up to date of course <e> <s> some of the figures are a bit different <e> <s> in the same way as on that occasion which was th september he has not paid any attention at all to the purpose of this bill <e> <s> he scarcely mentioned in his speech today the british aerospace industry he told us about british steel he told us about all the other nationalised industries but not a word about british aerospace <e> <s> i looked down and i wondered what bill we were indeed discussing <e> <s> it clearly was not the bill that was printed <e> <s> we were discussing something quite different <e> <s> we were discussing apparently his views and observations on nationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what are the vapour pressures of avgas l and of ordinary four-star fuel <e> <s> can he also tell us what are their relative octane numbers <e> <s> these are both important parts in fact they seem to me to be vital parts of his answer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that when he talks about vapour lock in the system it depends entirely upon the relative vapour pressures of the two and therefore his answer is if he will forgive me for saying so unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton has been acting as a very competent pinch hitter for the noble lord lord trefgarne in attempting to deal with this problem but would he not care to go back to his earlier work with regard to conservation and realise that this is a most important international matter <e> <s> would he not agree therefore that it is quite urgent that the govern-ment should use all their influence in order to have the matter dealt with properly <e> <s> would he not also agree that it would be quite disastrous if as a result of deforestation another part of the world had to demand aid and help <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that his own answers and the comments of the noble viscount lord eccles both suggest that the real cause of the difficulty is the operation of the market rather than any form of government interference <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> i did not say that there should be no limit i certainly did not mean that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin has attributed to me certain ideas and remarks <e> <s> i do not hold those ideas and i do not think that i made those remarks <e> <s> i certainly did not say in fact i deliberately said the opposite that no savings could be made <e> <s> i pointed out what savings could be made <e> <s> i pointed out that not all these savings could go on being made year after year <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks as someone who played an important part in a local authority that it is wise policy not to make repairs to buildings for a number of years if that is what he meant then it must have been a very strange local authority that was able to put up with that sort of thing for a period of years <e> <s> i said that a number of savings could not be made except on an emergency basis for one or at the most two years but that there were many areas where savings could be madeand that the purpose of setting up a body such as this advanced further education commission would be that it would look at the matter carefully and decide how any restriction should be carried out <e>"]
