["<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that now that the area tier has gone from the national health service good monitoring should be undertaken of administration at regional level to see that there is a good balance kept at the district level <e>", "<cs> may i just ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> if a year-old boy can be given a custodial sentence what sort of institution would he go to <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> this is the whole point of a committee stage to sort out problems <e> <s> over this matter i think that there are problems <e> <s> it was the noble baroness lady trumpington and not i who said that magistrates were ogre-like creatures <e> <s> i certainly do not think that the boys who come up against our adjudicating body in borstal are particularly frightened <e> <s> it would be far more frightening for some of them and we are dealing with and year olds there as well if they went to a magistrates court and were faced with somebody like the noble baroness lady trumpington <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment <e> <s> anyone who works for the health service knows that one of the growing problems is the care of the elderly <e> <s> these people whom the noble baroness lady seear seeks to help do a tremendous service to their parents and to the community very often at a great sacrifice to themselves <e> <s> i strongly support the spirit of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the right reverend prelate especially for what he said about the dignity of man <e> <s> i welcome the fact that in this bill constables on reasonable suspicion will be able to search persons and vehicles for stolen or prohibited articles so long as it is done with politeness and tactfulness <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> to bring this discussion back go a more serious topic is the minister aware that in peterlee which is one of our new towns there is a splendid fisher price toy factory which is giving excellent employment facilities to many of our people and that the toys are of very good quality and very safe <e>", "<cs> if the right reverend prelate is not going to speak because i thought he wanted this opportunity but it may be that he has already said what he wanted to say about it i should like to say that cultural would not be acceptable because it is too wide <e> <s> i personally have sympathy for the word traditional and because i know the noble lord lord mcnair wants to do the very best for this bill and in no way does he want to damage it perhaps although i cannot promise anything and i believe the noble baroness lady trumpington would say the same this aspect could be taken back and looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the highest number of smokers seems to be in the young female group <e> <s> will she consider some initiatives being taken by the government for instance holding essay competitions in schools on the dangers of smoking with the winners perhaps having a holiday of their choice such as a ski-ing holiday <e> <s> would that not mean more to them than just reading in school an advertisement which they sometimes challenge <e> <s> they may challenge society such as parents and teachers and do the opposite <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that many children progress from smoking cigarettes to taking other drugs such as heroin and cocaine <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that some of the health districts without rheumatologists are those which cover rural areas <e> <s> it is impossible for patients to reach hospitals to obtain treatment <e> <s> will she therefore emphasise that districts should do more in the important field of rheumatology <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to support the amendment <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with drinking the danger is the alcohol which is a very dangerous drug <e> <s> therefore the noble lord lord lucas is trying to help promote non-alcoholic beers <e> <s> the government really want to be responsible but they are allowing pubs to open longer <e> <s> therefore there will be more drinking because people will not stand there without a glass in their hands <e> <s> if people can go on to a non-alcoholic beer and still enjoy it surely that must be encouraged <e> <s> i cannot see that the government could think otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully <e> <s> however i thought that if one takes away paragraph and leaves paragraph one will leave a greater muddle <e> <s> there will be even more problems because local authorities will jump at any chance to stop disabled people buying their houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that courteous and helpful answer <e> <s> is he aware that the depressing aspect of the matter is that the stolen goods are hardly ever recovered and that the criminals come out from the towns and target the rural areas <e> <s> they are mobile and motivated and get away with their crimes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that as the roads in the north of england have come to a standstill due to traffic hold-ups it might be a good idea if police forces had helicopters to help catch criminals <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware of the case in which petrol was poured on to a signal box in the doncaster area that that delayed many trains and must have cost a great deal of money and that the person was caught <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether therapists are classed as medical or non-medical staff <e> <s> i am referring to occupational and speech therapists and physiotherapists <e> <s> does the minister feel that there are enough of these therapists to carry out the rehabilitation needs of patients within the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords if people have the right to appeal they are much more likely to accept a decision made on their behalf <e> <s> alternatively it is to be hoped that they will have a say in the matter through the appeal procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords this is again a commonsense amendment <e> <s> the matter will be up to the local authorities <e> <s> if the scheme did not work they could stop direct payments <e> <s> as has been said by the noble lord lord swinfen the amendment would encourage responsibility and that surely should be the governments aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have supported me in speaking against the amendment <e> <s> to answer the noble lord lord gisborough the interpretation for the purposes of this bill is that <e>"]
