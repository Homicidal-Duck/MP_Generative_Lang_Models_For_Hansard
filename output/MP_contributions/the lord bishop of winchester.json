["<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to noble lords that my earlier intervention was premature <e> <s> however i felt that i needed to point out to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that the island of jersey is not only a deanery within the diocese of winchester but that it is within a most loyal bailiwick which lies inside and not outside the national boundaries <e> <s> if we continue in this vein jersey <e>", "<cs> my lords far be it from a prelate to impugn the good faith of any government or of those who in their name draft and redraft such a bill as this but there is a degree of double-talk concealed in this bill which must be brought to light and clarified at this all-important stage <e> <s> in short the bill claims to relax controls over local government and to encourage initiative at county level while what it actually ensures is the tightening of control from marsham street at point after point <e> <s> either this is totally uncharacteristic of the present governments philosophy or we have been gravely misled <e>", "<cs> i shall be very happy for it to be handled in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords to raise moral questions about the waging of war is to tread on very dubious ground at any time <e> <s> the anglo-saxons are both a practical and a sceptical people <e> <s> practical people suspect sentiments which ignore the art of the possible and sceptical people know only too well how easily the rhetoric of patriotism can sweep a nation into intense self-righteousness <e> <s> but you cannot fool all the people all the time and in a democratic society especially it is very risky to pursue a strategy that affronts the independent moral conviction of a large number of your citizens <e> <s> however odd and however out of date the arguments about a just war- may seem to be a people has to be convinced that its cause is just if it is to sustain the conflict and not only that its cause is just but that its methods of waging war are justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with a special consciousness of the housing associations with church affiliations in my own diocese <e> <s> for example the stoneham housing association in southampton has among many other tenants seven ex-offenders very carefully scattered among people who have not been inside in order that by mixing with a natural integrated community they can be better reinstated or the hyde and south bank housing association which has been in southampton for many years on the initiative of the southampton churches <e>", "<cs> my lords the worlds compassion for refugees is bedevilled by false assumptions <e> <s> this is why i so welcomed the remarkable maiden speech of the noble viscount lord brentford particularly for his lucid and informed account of the situation that helped us to see the human side behind the millions <e> <s> when we talk about people in millions or even in tens of thousands we inevitably generalise <e> <s> we reduce all of them to a stereotype a single image that stands for the lot and immediately we go wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support the amendment moved by the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham <e> <s> as he indicated in his speech it is common ground that there are outdated and inappropriate anomalies in the shops act <e> <s> there are real problems to be tackled <e> <s> i am sure the government were right to commission a committee of inquiry and in the auld report there was a long and careful study of the points at issue <e> <s> yet my misgivings about the report and the bill we now have before us which stems from that report lie in the basic premise of its argument <e> <s> the noble lord the minister said earlier that it was an unchallengeable premise but i found it a doubtful one <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene very briefly <e> <s> i rather regret that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has spoken to amendment no <e> <s> h <e> <s> i speak ex-officio as bishop of winchester visitor of five oxford colleges <e> <s> three of them were founded by my predecessors in office two of them by lay people who conferred the visitorial powers on the bishops of winchester <e>", "<cs> my lords i must disclose an interest though not pecuniary in the development of broadcasting <e> <s> i do not have the experience and i have never had the responsibility that many members of your lordships house have exercised in the bbc or independent companies <e> <s> i am a kind of invisible microbe in the bottomless pit <e> <s> however for some years i was a member of the bbcs religious broadcasting department <e> <s> for a time i served as a member latterly chairman of the central religious advisory committee for the bbc and the iba <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool will be speaking later in this debate about the place of religious programmes so i do not want to dwell <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> while i am disappointed that the government do not see the possibility of using the broadcasting standards council to provide a forum for a general and ongoing debate about the way the system develops and the quality of programmes in the coming year i realise that they have taken that view <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
