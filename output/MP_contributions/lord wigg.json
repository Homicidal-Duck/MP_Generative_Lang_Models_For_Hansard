sovereign <e> <s> it appears from the statement which has now been issued by buckingham palace that mrs thatcher did not consult the sovereign before she made that statement and it looks as though the

commonwealth <e> <s> therefore may i ask the noble lord whether before mrs thatcher made that statement which <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the leader of the house be good enough to

defence since the war and in real terms we could not knock the skin off a rice pudding <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to realise that so far as i am concerned i do not dissent for a

the moment this problem of how the governor is going to exercise his authority in both the civil and military field is being dealt with <e> <s> is the noble lord collaborating with the great fund of goodwill which exists not only in the commonwealth but throughout the whole civilised world to see how that can be harnessed to ensure that the new governor whoever he happens to be goes out there with an effective staff so that he can do the job and it is not just a face-saving operation in which he will be governor only in name <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to say whether the whole concept of armoured fighting vehicles is being studied in relation to the development of copperhead and if so what steps the government are taking about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i neither said it nor suggested it but i read the american secretary of states defence statement every year and the americans are obviously spending a considerable amount of money on the development of

patriotic front in carrying the war into zimbabwe-rhodesia so that it is now recognised by the rebels in that country that rebellion does not pay <e> <s> would the foreign secretary make quite sure

amount of money that could be won at the game of linked bingo and in future if the bill receives the royal assent that power would be vested in the home secretary who can make an order by regulation <e> <s> i supported the bill on second reading and i do not dissent from it now but of course it has an added importance in view of the debate in another place on the th of last month from which it seems that the report of the royal commission on gambling is to go the way of all the other reports of royal commissions since the end of the war <e> <s> in other words it is going to be swept under the carpet <e> <s> the little bits that peep out are those that are inescapable they just cannot be hidden <e> <s> this one is of some importance because linked bingo is tied up with a game which both

<e> <s> earlier he said that his government had been in office for only six months <e> <s> the conservative government were in office from to and from to and during neither of those periods did they give the slightest indication of what they wanted to do <e> <s> do they want to use the territorial army as a source of re-enforcement to the regular army or is it to be preserved in its entirety and

forces i am concerned with rhodesian forces which include the south african pumas the french alouettes and the israeli bells which have carried on a strategic plan of isolating zambia from both its line of communications to the indian ocean and to the atlantic and it has done it as part of an overall policy of destabilisation <e> <s> if the foreign secretary will face up to the problem of seeing that the concentration areas and the rhodesian areas are adequately monitored and that if in fact they have not got sufficient numbers they will bring in more and he will make absolutely sure that the south african regular personnel which have been serving in the zimbabwe-rhodesian forces and are actually fighting the helicopters are withdrawn and will give the governor adequate powers by sending a squadron of phantoms into rhodesia on to one of the airfields and will make it absolutely sure that the rhodesian air force is also monitored i think he will be rendering a great service to africa and

importance that this countrys word should be respected throughout the world <e> <s> so however objectionable and rough the going may become whatever we have entered into that we pay at twenty

ended up what we are today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the statement by sir harold wilson in another place couples my name with a responsibility and that although my knowledge may be out-of-date i personally have every confidence that what takes place takes place properly and is wholly concerned with the security of the state <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that

was associated with race relations <e> <s> in saying that is he not aware that when i was member of parliament for dudley in the early s we had the first real trouble in this country on a substantial

minister must be aware looking out for evasions of the law <e> <s> the responsibility was then moved from the police to the customs and excise and the number now engaged in this job right across the board is quite insufficient for the job in hand <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e> <s> if he is arguing the case for or or against dogmatism will he tell us the meaning of his previous words

party that ownership as such is not the dominant issue ownership can take varying forms <e> <s> so i am not going to battle with the noble viscount on that issue <e> <s> rather i want to make a point as follows <e> <s> he said that he is not dogmatic but when i intervened earlier it was in order to underline the fact that on the issue of the pricing system and the practicability of leaving everything to the market forces as the government are doing the noble viscount is dogmatic and in my view is per cent <e> <s> wrong <e> <s> i should go so far as to say to him that if he went to a place where the free market really operates for example epsom downs on derby day in view of the philosophy that he has expounded with an incompetence which passes belief the one thing i would

it was necessary some time in the future to look at the membership of the levy board and that it would also be necessary to look at the composition of the bookmakers committee <e> <s> but the main reason why i am disappointed that the noble lord lord belstead has not spoken is because i wanted to hear what the government had to say about a statement made by the noble lord lord sandys to whom i also wrote who argued that it was a very important point it may have influenced a number of noble lords in the way in which they voted that if the amendment of the noble lord lord peart had been carried it would have put members of the bookmakers committee who would have become members of the levy board in the position of hearing matters that would be regarded as confidential by bookmakers
