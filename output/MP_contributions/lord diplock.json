["<cs> my lords before i came into the chamber i took the opportunity of looking at the standard text book on this subject of which the first edition was published in <e> <s> the twelfth edition is now in force <e> <s> it has pages and cites about cases <e> <s> i suppose that two-thirds of the work of the appellate committee of this house involves disputed questions on the interpretation of statutes <e> <s> it is a subject with which i am familiar and which i am bound to say i dislike <e> <s> i am looking at what is proposed as a new statute now before this house <e> <s> in view of what my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones has said i think i can express my views upon it very briefly because he has made most of the points which have made him view the bill with what he calls a lack of enthusiasm but which in my case i can express as strong dislike <e>", "<cs> underlying this apparently simple amendment are matters which are fundamental to the structure of the legal profession and to the career structure of its two branches <e> <s> on the face of it this is a very innocuous suggestion <e> <s> what harm can be done by enlarging the catchment area from which the <e>", "<cs> so far as i can see what this clause does is to give the court a discretion to make an order which in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the constitution of trinidad and tobago there is written on fundamental rights a case exactly like this <e> <s> it came before the privy council from trinidad and tobago where exactly this happened <e> <s> a person had been punished by the court without being given an opportunity to speak in his defence <e> <s> we held in the privy council that that was a breach of a fundamental right and we held that he was entitled to redress from the state <e> <s> there is clearly in this case a lacuna in our law <e> <s> whether this particular amendment is the best way of curing it i do not know but it certainly ought to be cured <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has been good enough to let me take this occasion to apologise on my own behalf as well as on behalf of the general council of british shipping the p and i clubs that is the protection and indemnity clubs which take care of the liability insurance for shipping in the greater part of the world as well as in connection with british shipping and the british maritime law association of which at one time i was president and which represents all the maritime interests in this country shippers shipowners insurers and the like <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to be permitted to add to the welcome given to the amendment by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> he was much concerned about a possible loss of business to the city of london if clause went through in its original form <e> <s> i should like to add my welcome in the interest of consistency in this branch of the law of england <e> <s> we have been moving from being odd men out and accepting the absolute theory of state immunity first by the courts towards the restrictive theory and secondly by the state immunity act <e> <s> in its original form clause represented a step backwards from the orderly progress towards a coherent system of law with respect to state immunity <e> <s> in my view the present amendment cures that and gives us the kind of coherent law that we ought to have <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not my intention to make any comment on the merits of any of the provisions in the constitution act which is schedule b to the canada bill <e> <s> that is a matter exclusively for the canadian people expressed through their governmental institutions federal and provincial <e> <s> i propose to restrict myself to matters of constitutional law and i have three points to make <e>", "<cs> the abolition of this historical anachronism was i believe the least controversial of the proposals of the criminal law revision committee in <e> <s> indeed but for the fact that i understand that one member of your lordships committee is to oppose it i should have thought that it was devoid of any controversial content <e> <s> i do not know a single judge who approves of it <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the so-called right of silence <e> <s> what it has to do with is the right to lie to the court with impunity <e>", "<cs> i did not speak on it at all <e>", "<cs> my lords while associating myself with the comments which have been so kindly made about the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce and dissociating myself from those which have been made about me i hope that it will not be thought to be out of place if as the longest serving by many years of the current law lords i were to express my full support for the changes which my noble and learned friend upon the woolsack proposes to make with regard to the office of presiding over the appellate <e>", "<cs> my lords the increasing number of cases which are reaching the law lords in their judicial capacity has made me reluctantly impose upon myself a rigid restraint on speaking in the chamber even upon lawyers law where the long experience of law lords of the administration of justice may assist the house
