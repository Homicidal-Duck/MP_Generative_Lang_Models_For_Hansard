["<cs> my lords i should like to begin by offering your lordships house an apology as i may have to leave your lordships chamber before the end of the debate but no discourtesy is intended <e> <s> it is difficult to talk about eec farm prices for without making a brief comment on cap generally or at least referring to the food surpluses which its policies cause <e> <s> i hope that with the usual kindly tolerance of your lordships house that is permitted <e> <s> as is well known the bulk of those food surpluses have to be sold on world markets with the aid of subsidies paid for by the taxpayer <e> <s> i need hardly add that britain bears more than its fair share of that burden <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate what the government policy is with regard to sheepmeat other than free trade within the community <e> <s> am i right in assuming that they are not in favour of a full cap rgime including support buying intervention prices and export subsidies or the application of monetary compensatory amounts between countries <e> <s> would he further agree that if the full cap rgime was applied it could be very costly as regards the community budget <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i will not detain you for more than a minute <e> <s> first may i thank the noble baroness lady seear and the various members of your lordships house who have taken part in what i think has been a useful debate <e> <s> may i thank you for unmerited but very kind references to my own role <e> <s> i think that our debate tonight will have been really worth while if both the united kingdom government and the council working party take note not only of our report but of the speeches that have been delivered in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl can enlighten me about how many devaluations have taken place during the last months because i think that that would put the matter in much greater perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me very great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord mottistone as not unsurprisingly we are often allies <e> <s> we are considering today three separate reports <e> <s> obviously it would not be possible to cover all the issues raised in them without unduly taking up your lordships time <e> <s> it would also be impossible not to deal with the subjects and points in the report that have been made by other speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already given notice that i was going to ask for certain information <e> <s> i know nothing about furniture except that i sit on chairs and sofas but i am told that those in the industry do not consider at this stage that the order is in any way adequate <e> <s> they claim that it is the chemical which is sprayed over the foam which causes the dangerous fumes that this is the danger and not the flammability of the furniture itself <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord in his reply would deal with this <e>", "<cs> my lords like others before me i should like to thank my noble friend lord walston for his skilful chairmanship of our committee <e> <s> after his very clear and comprehensive introduction to this debate and the speeches of noble lords who have preceded me it will be difficult to say anything new <e> <s> there are however certain points that i should like to emphasise <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very complex subject for the layman <e> <s> i hesitate to intervene particularly after hearing the opening speech of the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton <e> <s> the draft directive is also of great concern to industry and we will be fortunate to hear the views of the noble lord lord plowden with his great industrial experience later in the debate <e> <s> i hope therefore that it will not be amiss if i state the views of the consumer as expressed by the consumers in the european community group an umbrella organisation without necessarily endorsing all that they say <e> <s> they believe that the draft directive should be supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating the noble lord lord mottistone on the report that we are considering today which owes so much to his chairmanship of sub-committee d which he took over owing to the regrettable absence through illness of the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> i also wish to express appreciation of the work of the specialist adviser and the clerk to the committee who were working to a very tight timetable <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must declare a familial interest in this bill for it was introduced in the other place as the noble lord lord nugent of guildford has so kindly indicated by a kinsman of mine <e> <s> however it is not for that reason that i support it as a useful bill <e> <s> although modest in scope it has a narrow but none the less important objective <e> <s> it is the latest of a long line of not less than six attempts in eight years to control indecent display by legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords sub-committee b under the very able and distinguished chairmanship of the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow are to be congratulated upon producing a most valuable report and affording us the opportunity for such an important and wide-ranging debate <e> <s> i should like to confine my remarks to food aid <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth has just said this is a subject which has strong emotive appeal one which many regard as a humanitarian and high-minded way of getting rid of surpluses <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships committee will reject this amendment <e> <s> this question of definition was debated at length in another place and i think there are at least four or five reasons why this phrase should remain in the bill <e> <s> first indecent has the advantage not only of being in common usage but also of being easily understood <e> <s> the dictionary definition of offensive is <e>", "<cs> my lords the eec fruit and vegetable policy has never been the subject of inquiry by the select committee as a separate issue <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this amendment to my honourable kinsmans bill is rejected <e> <s> this is another attempt to attach a definition to the word indecent <e> <s> i think that there are many advantages in keeping the simple word indecent in preference to any other word or phrase <e> <s> this has been discussed as your lordships know at great length in the other place <e> <s> it has been discussed at great length here at second reading and committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> i am told there is no precedent for introducing such a clause <e> <s> in other legislation of this nature the requirement is not made <e> <s> i am also informed that the law commission has this procedure on receipt under review and therefore surely it would be better to wait for the outcome of their deliberations if changes are thought necessary <e> <s> would it not be more effective to pass separate legislation rather than tinker with it in this bill <e> <s> i hope that the amendment will not be pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords as is his custom the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos has given a clear and thorough summary of the report <e> <s> it is a most wide-reaching subject but i must confine my brief remarks to two aspects of it <e> <s> first i should like to stress the importance of the cassava root which <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege and very great pleasure to be the first to congratulate the noble earl lord winchilsea on his maiden speech <e> <s> i do not agree and i do not expect he expected me to agree with all the contents but his manner and the way he presented his case i think we would all consider to be admirable <e> <s> what is more i know it is always said but it is really meant on this occasion i hope the house will have the opportunity to hear him many times in the future <e>", "<cs> although i am very sympathetic to this amendment i am a little concerned about its effect on smaller shops where no alternative labour is easily available <e> <s> it is doubtful whether it would prevent dismissal or the threat of dismissal from being imposed <e> <s> perhaps the minister would give us some guidance as to whether these workers would be protected under the existing law <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt <e> <s> does it logically and completely cover the garden centre when garden tools and accessories are not mentioned <e> <s> this illustrates that it is almost impossible to produce a schedule which does not draw arbitrary lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unable to take part in the second reading debate on this private members bill as i was abroad at the time <e> <s> therefore i should like to make a brief statement but i shall not detain your lordships long <e> <s> the subject of trading hours affects so many people shopworkers consumers and those who live in the neighbourhood of high streets and shopping centres <e> <s> for example in the light of the changed social circumstances over the last years since the passing of the shops act i feel that the subject calls for a proper independent inquiry where evidence can be taken from all those interested and affected parties <e> <s> after this inquiry the government should in my opinion cease their benevolent neutrality and introduce the necessary bill <e> <s> therefore i cannot support the present bill <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are indebted to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for his chairmanship of sub-committee d and for his usual thorough summary of the report <e> <s> owing to the lateness of the hour i will cut my speech and confine my brief remarks to one form of state aid namely aid to marketing packing and processing which seem to be free of restriction save that the government concerned must submit product sector programmes to the commission <e> <s> sir richard butler president of the national farmers union in evidence to the sub-committee expressed the view that and i quote <e>", "<cs> i am no lawyer and i always listen with great attention to what lawyers have to say but from the point of view of a retailer of some long experience as your lordships know i think it would be wrong in the ultimate to do away with the defence of due diligence <e> <s> although the noble lord lord mottistone may have withdrawn his amendments for reasons that have already been stated i still think it is a very important thing that should be embodied in the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords committee b under the very able and distinguished chairmanship of the noble lord lord greenhill are to be congratulated on producing a most valuable report <e> <s> it is an extraordinary fact which the report brings out in its first paragraph that the eec treaty does not include provision for common agricultural trade policy in the way it does for common agricultural policy and common commercial policy <e> <s> in my view as i have said in previous speeches this is due to an obsession with production <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider it to be a privilege and a very great pleasure to be the first to congratulate the noble lord lord northbourne on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure i speak for all quarters of the house when i say that with his experience as a large producer and with his keen marketing sense we all look forward to his future contributions when he speaks on agriculture and allied problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to take part in this interesting and important debate because agriculture and food obviously play a part in the pattern of trade <e> <s> moreover they are subjects which have concerned me for many years as a member of subcommittee d the report points to the level of agricultural self-sufficiency in the united kingdom which has increased by a considerable amount during our membership of the community <e> <s> it is unfortunate that members of the community have interpreted in my view incorrectly one of the objectives of the common <e>", "<cs> my lords the three reports that are being debated are in my opinion a considerable achievement <e> <s> i am sure that all members of the committee would agree that tributes should be paid to the clerk to our specialist advisers and last but not least to our chairman who guided so wisely our many discussions <e> <s> it is inevitable in a debate of this kind when the majority of the speakers are members of the committee that produced the report that the tenth speaker on the list is faced with immediately sitting down or covering again in his own words all the points that have been covered by previous speakers <e> <s> i am sorry to say that i am going to make my speech in spite of the fact that nearly all of the points want to make have already been covered <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that with regard to misleading advertising the united kingdom system of having a self-regulatory body is preferable to having a directive <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i was chairman of the committee of inquiry into the relationship of the pharmaceutical industry and the national health service and one of its recommendations was that brand names should not be used in any new pharmaceutical product <e> <s> has the ministry considered that recommendation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are no fewer than bottle banks in the united kingdom and that if it was not for litter nuisance and vandalism there would be many more <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> may i first offer my congratulations to the committee and to its chairman for having compiled an excellent and comprehensive report on a subject that noble lords must admit is both extremely complex and politically sensitive <e> <s> statistically trade with the eec is vastly more important to the african caribbean and pacific states than community aid a fact to which many noble lords have already referred <e> <s> in fact the value of the acp countries annual exports to the community is well over twenty times that of the total aid available from the european development fund <e> <s> thus in preparing for the lom renegotiations in my opinion the eec has paid undue attention to aid policies in relation to the resources that they are willing to make available <e> <s> much as these policies may be commendable i am sure that noble lords will agree that there are already many organisations both governmental and non-governmental better qualified and more experienced than the eec in developing and administering aid programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question <e> <s> in view of the fact that the metropolitan police commissioner has indicated his willingness to take over prosecutions for shoplifting if he is given the resources so to do do the government have any intention of providing those resources <e> <s> secondly what are the governments intentions regarding the proposals for an independent prosecution service in the white paper cmnd <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that these draft directives have been under discussion since the mid-s <e> <s> does he feel that the time of civil servants and others spent on these directives has been justified <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that many of the smaller islands in the eastern caribbean welcomed the american action because they feared possible revolts against their own governments by extreme left-wing marxist groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> no one can have been taken by surprise by what has happened in the community to supplies of milk and milk products <e> <s> there have been countless warning signs that community production would reach unmanageable proportions and yet the council of ministers have refused to grasp the nettle and they have chosen to ignore these clear warnings in past farm price fixings <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether a draft directive on unfair advertising is under consideration and what the attitude of the government would be if that were so <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not answered my question <e> <s> i know all about the first directive on advertising and that it has now been <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he can give us any information about two draft directives of great concern to the consumer one on product liability and the other on doorstep selling which have been in the pipeline for years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister who was so helpful the last time i asked questions on the progress being made whether he can tell us anything about unit pricing for foodstuffs <e> <s> secondly is he aware that the report of the house of lords select committee on the european community on unit pricing is due i am informed on monday next <e> <s> will he take particular note of its last recommendation that until further research into possible costs has been carried out the extension of mandatory unit pricing should be abandoned <e>", "<cs> this side <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly in support of the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord drumalbyn <e> <s> the great variety of purposes that the enforcement of trading standards serves has already been shown <e> <s> the first is to protect the consumer by for example ensuring the accuracy of petrol pumps ensuring and this is coming near home that cooked meats and poultry do not contain excessive water and ensuring that the lead content of products does not exceed the safety limits <e> <s> the second is to promote fair competition for the retailers and the manufacturer <e> <s> it is necessary to prevent reputable businesses from being undercut by unscrupulous competitors <e> <s> the third is to interpret the law <e> <s> the law is broken more often by failure to understand than by evil intention <e> <s> trading standards authorities assist local industry by giving advice on legal matters and in product development as with for example the manufacture of weighing and measuring equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for explaining the order may i say that we on these benches do not welcome it as we do not think that a sufficient case has been made to justify weakening employees rights to go to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> as has already been said these rights were weakened in when the government extended the qualifying period from six months to a year <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely going to say that before i made my short speech i consulted a large employer of labour and also as it happens that same employer of labour has started a company with the sole aim of helping small employers starting off businesses <e> <s> i took care to look at it from both ends and regrettably i am not an academic with no qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return for a moment to the question of doorstep selling and ask the minister whether he recalls that the house of lords select committee on doorstep selling reported long ago in <e> <s> is not this progress very slow <e> <s> can he be more precise in indicating when there will be agreement on this draft directive <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that this is such a complex subject which we have debated in this house on several occasions that it is not really in the interests of clarity to try to discuss it by means of question and answer <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is not down to speak but all i want to say is that we on these benches support the bill and approve of its contents <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support these amendments <e> <s> but i shall not detain your lordships for very long <e> <s> i have a personal rule that the older you get the shorter your speeches should be <e> <s> in my opinion the case for these amendments has been so well made that repetition for repetitions sake is not worthwhile <e> <s> as i made clear when i spoke on this subject at committee stage i believe that enforcement of trading standards and i speak as a semi-retired or perhaps i would be better described as a fully-retired old retailer is of extreme importance to a large section of the population <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is aware retailers generally welcome this order <e> <s> so far as concerns fruit and vegetables when they are sold not prepacked which is very popular with consumers this order will bring the law into line with practice and is to be welcomed for that reason among others <e>", "<cs> my lords many years ago i was chairman of the employers side of a wages council <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether he will confirm that the low pay unit the tuc the cbi the institute of personnel management the co-op and the retail consortium which represent per cent <e> <s> of the retail trade in this country are all against the abolition of the wages councils <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene for a moment the list that i read out last week was of organisations which were against abolition <e> <s> they were not necessarily against reform <e> <s> that is the distinction that i should like to make clear <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not a fact that many of the people who have found jobs are women working part-time who were never on the unemployment register <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i join with others in praise and appreciation of the wise and firm chairmanship of the noble lord lord plowden during his three-year term as chairman of sub-committee d he will be greatly missed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not a fact that many wise british companies have already withdrawn their investments in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very reluctant to interrupt the speaker but i should like to correct a fact <e> <s> the retail consortium which is the biggest association of all types of retailers in the country could not come to a unanimous decision and has no representative view on changes in the shops act <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to make it clear that i am speaking in an individual capacity and not on behalf either of the sdp or the alliance <e> <s> we too have a free vote <e> <s> i should also like to make it clear as i have done on previous occasions that i am speaking in a personal capacity <e> <s> my views do not necessarily reflect those of the firm with which my name is associated <e>", "<cs> i rise with trepidation because following such learned lords and one who has particu <e>", "<cs> i shall detain members of the committee very briefly <e> <s> this amendment is a variant of amendment no <e> <s> which has been withdrawn with the addition as has already been said that essential goods and services can be provided later than pm on sundays as determined by government order <e> <s> the difficulty is fundamentally defining what are essential goods and services <e> <s> as the auld committee put it this would be at best tinkering with an unsatisfactory law and substituting one set of anomalies for another <e> <s> there will always be the difficulty of enforcement particularly when shops sell a wide range of goods <e> <s> i personally cannot support this amendment <e>", "<cs> as i understand it under the existing law a shopkeeper can employ staff to work on sunday for example in filling shelves so long as he does not open the shop to trade <e> <s> if that is so then i find it difficult to justify the existing law <e> <s> under clause of <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot support this amendment <e> <s> to the retailer the prospect of a review after one year when patterns of trade have already been established would create the opportunity for the whole divisive controversy to be started all over again <e> <s> the report suggested by the amendment would obviously require the setting up of another committee <e> <s> if the committee covered all the matters mentioned in this amendment the work might easily take two years to complete by which time the pattern of trade would be even more firmly established <e> <s> therefore i think that this amendment if pressed should be opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords does not beef once frozen almost automatically lose a large proportion of its value compared with the fresh product <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the minister aright when he said that per cent <e> <s> of workers in catering were getting below wages council rates <e> <s> if that is so why are there fewer trading officers to police wages council rates to see that they are observed <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support this amendment <e> <s> i do not see why protection against excessive unfair or unjustified deductions should be confined to the retail trade <e> <s> i shall be very brief because the noble lord lord wedderburn has explained the situation so clearly <e> <s> there are other examples such as a wholesale cash and carry warehouse or a trade counter which can also be subject to cash shortages and stock deficiencies <e> <s> therefore as i said we on these benches will support the amendment if it is put to a vote <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak very briefly in support of my noble friend <e> <s> as we all know one of the justifications for the bill is the claim made by the government that the existing wages councils have hindered job creation and caused unemployment <e> <s> i support amendment no <e> <s> because in my opinion there is no evidence that can be produced to support that claim <e> <s> however if minimum rates do not operate until the age of in some cases there will certainly be a substitution of younger workers in place of those aged or over especially if they have not worked for their employer for a period of two years and therefore are not covered by employment protection rights <e>", "<cs> i heard a different version <e> <s> i heard a version from the retail trade body that it wanted five because the existing three so often sided with the workers <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because i believe that workers who work unsocial hours on sunday which may keep them away from enjoying the company of their families are entitled to a special rate <e> <s> i understand that in scotland where as the committee know sunday trading is not against the law under existing wages council legislation retail employees who work on a sunday as an additional day are paid double time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i strongly support this amendment <e> <s> we all accept that deductions from wages must be fair and reasonable <e> <s> to help achieve this aim a code of practice will in my opinion be most useful and valuable as a guide to employers and particularly to the small employer for whom the government express such concern to trade unions acting on behalf of the employee and to the individual worker who has started and who should be able to obtain a copy from his employer or from acas <e> <s> i attach great importance to the fact that this amendment has the blessing of the noble and learned lord lord denning with his vast experience of the law and of its interpretation <e> <s> i also believe that this amendment should promote good industrial practices <e> <s> so i hope that your lordships in all parts of the house will support it in the division lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches support the amendment because we consider that it is much fairer than the provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches strongly support this amendment <e> <s> we were told in <e>", "<cs> my lords all the reports which we are considering today deal with the internal market but i should like to confine my remarks to the fifteenth report on consumer protection policy <e> <s> as has been said already the treaty of rome does not specifically provide for consumer protection although there are passing references to consumer interests in the agricultural policy <e> <s> nevertheless we must not lose sight of the fact that an essential objective of the community is the constant improvement of living and working conditions <e> <s> that there is still much to do in the specific matter of consumer protection must not allow us to overlook what has been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he has considered the extremely unfair position in which for example two do-it-yourself stores or garden centres are in competition when one is observing the law and the other is breaking it for its own personal advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords my maiden speech on the th november was on the subject of consumer protection <e> <s> i declared an interest then as i was chairman of the family firm bearing my name <e> <s> with the passage of time i am no longer chairman and the firm is no longer a family one but a plc but i still declare an interest though a rather more remote one <e> <s> on that occasion we were discussing the molony committee report <e> <s> a leading article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will read <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of noble lords on these benches welcome most strongly the ministers statement <e> <s> as i am sure he is well aware this tax would affect the lower income groups when one considers that the price of margarine which is dependent upon vegetable oils for its manufacture is one-quarter of the price of the cheapest butter <e> <s> the cheapest margarine is one-quarter of the price of the cheapest butter <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this amendment because it gives us an opportunity to discuss the status of the code of practice <e> <s> i was very interested in the debate at committee stage and regret not having been able to participate in it <e> <s> it reflected the tone of the comments i made on second reading to the effect that the code should be a practical guidance worked out in conjunction with retail organisations and other interested parties <e> <s> i am therefore delighted that in the interim it has been possible for a very significant measure of agreement to he achieved between the representative bodies of those who are going to be most intimately involved in putting the provisions of the bill into practice <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister report any progress on the unit pricing directive which to my knowledge has been in the pipeline for the best part of years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware as i am sure he is that very little of the food produced in our countryside reaches the consumer in the form in which it leaves the farms <e> <s> will the minister agree that there is a fine opportunity to locate the processing of food food that needs manufacture in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house how long the toy safety draft directive has been in the pipeline <e>", "<cs> my lords this may seem a small practical point but is the minister aware that one of the difficulties during the previous distribution of this ancient butter was that it came in bulk packs and not in domestic quantities <e> <s> this made practical and fair distribution more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied with the proposed timescale for implementation <e> <s> what reaction has he had from trade and consumer interests <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is a need for guidance to be given to the various charity organisations or local authorities on how they should distribute the surplus food fairly and sensibly <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that it is totally unfair to blame the supermarkets without blaming the many small corner shops which are equally in the wrong if anybody is to blame <e>", "<cs> it may not be altogether inappropriate if i follow my noble friend lord falkland <e> <s> first however obviously i have to declare an interest because the business which is associated with my name has licensed premises opens approximately new stores per annum and would be very affected by the proposed restrictions <e>", "<cs> my lords after declaring my usual interest i strongly support this amendment from the point of view of the consumer interest and common sense <e> <s> it is becoming increasingly the practice for shops to open at oclock am at busy periods for example on saturday morning <e> <s> without the amendment customers who are in the shop to purchase groceries and perishable goods will be unable to purchase alcoholic beverages at the same time <e> <s> instead shoppers are forced to wait around the premises until the off-licence of the shop is opened or are forced to make a second visit to the store <e> <s> this is an obvious inconvenience to the shopper who finds it difficult to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> however much some may regret it the fact is that for some time good friday which in the past was treated as a special day is now by public and trade alike no longer so treated <e> <s> therefore it is becoming increasingly anomalous that restricted hours for off-licences should be applied to this day <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment covering the transfer of a justices off-licence because it would be particularly helpful for multiple companies faced with changes of personnel from one store to another <e> <s> although in law the licence is held in the name of the individual it is run for the company and in accordance with the companys methods and instructions <e> <s> the inclusion of this amendment would considerably ease the administrative burden on the courts and the police <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this system is functioning in france but that retailers must pay a commission of between to per cent <e> <s> on sales and that the system is subject to public support by public money <e>"]
