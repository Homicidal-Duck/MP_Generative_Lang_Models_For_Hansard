["<cs> my lords because i am aware of the immense store of knowledge ability experience and expertise that resides in your noble house it is with some trepidation that i rise to make this my first speech <e> <s> however i have been encouraged and indeed reassured by my reception so far and i greatly appreciate the kindness already shown me by many noble lords and indeed by the ready assistance rendered by officers and staff of this noble house <e> <s> the welcome that i have received so far augers well for my future contentment and work in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how long the m is likely to be closed during the bridging operations at the m interchange and what arrangements will be made to deal with the resulting traffic chaos into and out of london as a result of the closure of the m <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that while i and certainly many other people will be grateful for the assistance which is to be given to private owners nevertheless we are considerably worried about the enormous burden that repairs will place on local authorities and indeed the tenants <e> <s> i have it in mind and the noble lord has much experience of this that many of these houses were built and purchased by local authorities at the behest of central government <e> <s> indeed central government actively campaigned for and actively promoted these houses <e> <s> i believe therefore that they have a duty to the local authorities to finance the whole of these repairs <e> <s> if they do not do so i fear that the local authorities themselves will be under great burden and great pressure and particularly of course their tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble earl the minister for this kind welcome to this front bench in this noble house <e> <s> i only wish that i could have made my front bench maiden speech on a non-controversial basis but i am afraid that this bill is one that positively invites controversy and is therefore a measure which my noble friends and i find quite disagreeable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> i trust he will accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the house will wish to thank the minister for the lucid manner in which he has described a very complicated bill and for the fact that he has done so in a very short time <e> <s> since north sea oil is so crucial to this countrys economy at present and will remain so for a long period ahead it is always tempting when the slightest opportunity arises to discuss the subject on the widest possible basis for example to discuss depletion policy the use to which oil revenues are put <e> <s> the effect on our total economy and the planning for the time when north sea oil runs out <e> <s> these are all interesting and important subjects which ought to exercise the minds of your lordships <e> <s> i shall however resist the temptation today because it would take a long time <e> <s> i feel sure that there will be another opportunity to discuss these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that although the noble minister has made a great <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow on his report and indeed on the concise way in which he presented it to the house <e> <s> i shall certainly deal in a moment with one or two points that he made but before doing so i should like with the greatest of pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord kaberry with whom i have i hardly like to use the word duelled had some discussions particularly when we both served on the select committee for nationalised industries in another place <e>", "<cs> then i misunderstood the noble lord and i hope he will forgive me <e> <s> his figures were correct for total manufactures but he has enabled me to emphasise those figures and i thank him for raising the point <e> <s> that therefore is the real situation which we face <e> <s> the export-import ratio for manufactures traded with the eec fell by per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> between and while the ratio in the case of other countries fell by only per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i too am very grateful to the noble baroness lady burton for raising this subject tonight which is of great concern to domestic industrial and commercial consumers of gas and electricity alike <e> <s> i think it is unfortunate that the preceding candyfloss debate which has just ended has overshadowed this debate which deals with the very real and acute problems that so many people have as a result of high <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is quite true <e> <s> the noble earl has just said that it was wrong to hold down prices artificially but was it not equally wrong to increase prices artificially in and by means of the gas levy <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i should like to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating this very important statement <e> <s> is it not the fact that the background against which this white paper must be set is the economic problem that we have faced since <e> <s> unemployment has more than doubled more than firms have gone into liquidation in england and wales alone and the equivalent of about one-fifth of our manufacturing industry has completely disappeared <e> <s> a number of our regions have been very badly hit over the last few years <e> <s> one of them the west midlands in particular formerly one of the most prosperous areas in britain has been appallingly badly hit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to learn that the noble earl deprecates this type of -yah boo advertising <e> <s> indeed i am glad that he has taken the boards gently by the shoulders and told them that it is not in the best interests of the public service and of the great public industries to descend to gutter advertising <e> <s> can the noble earl assure me that in his future discussions with these industries he will impress upon them the need for co-operation between the two industries and not competition so that we can get a proper rational integrated energy policy in this country in which the boards will not only co-operate in ensuring that the public know the best use of fuels but also co-operate in conservation combined heat and power and in all other measures which would produce a decent <e>", "<cs> it is not a speech my lords <e> <s> i was asking the minister whether he would impress upon the boards the desirability of these aspects in order that we may have a proper rational and integrated fuel policy in this country <e> <s> i should have thought that all noble lords would want that <e>", "<cs> my lords this has so far been a most interesting and informative debate <e> <s> i have listened with great fascination to both the noble viscount lord st davids and the noble earl <e> <s> lord attlee and have heard their explanation of these circuit breakers with the greatest of interest <e> <s> as i understand it the correct term for them is residual current operated circuit breakers and they are not in any sense electronic in operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about protecting the whole of the house circuit with a single circuit breaker <e> <s> if individual socket outlets were to be protected the cost would indeed be enormous <e> <s> at present house wiring for a power supply is carried out on a ring main basis <e> <s> if one tried to protect the ring main circuit with a residual circuit breaker the slightest leak on the total circuit would trip the whole of the ring main <e> <s> the ring main is designed to fuse when an appliance goes wrong <e> <s> that is the whole objective of having a fused plug <e> <s> if one now interposes one of these circuit breakers one may very well defeat the whole objective of the ring main circuit <e> <s> to get full protection one would have to have an individual supply from the supply source to the individual socket and that would be going into the realms of enormous cost <e> <s> so there are serious drawbacks in a general sense to the installation of these particular circuit breakers <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the last opportunity we shall have before the bill receives royal assent to state the oppositions fundamental opposition to the provisions of the bill which abolishes all royalties for new oilfields outside the southern basin <e> <s> this is a vital bill with sweeping powers and i wonder whether it has been appreciated in this house or in another place how important a bill it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank the noble earl for explaining the bill in detail and for doing it in a way that we could all very easily understand <e> <s> i have to say at the beginning that the labour party while it has worries about the bill great worries in fact recognises that it deals primarily with the borrowing powers of the board <e> <s> for that reason we shall not oppose the bill or seek to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for repeating this interim statement to the house this afternoon <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the statement adds little which is new to what we already know from the press and indeed from the companys own statement <e> <s> secondly does he realise that there is real public anger following this incident and that the incident itself calls into question the competence of the management at sellafield and has seriously damaged the image and the credibility of the whole nuclear industry <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for the answers he has given may i press him on two or three points <e> <s> first i asked whether the nii report would be published in full <e> <s> that is an important question which needs an answer <e> <s> is it to be abridged or will the report be published wholly and in full <e> <s> secondly will he say more about the possible prosecutions <e> <s> if he could give some more information about that subject i should be most obliged <e>", "<cs> it related to the publication of the nni report in full my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to inflict myself on the house yet again but i feel that i must press the minister further on the question of children because children seldom read press notices and secondly if children are allowed to roam anywhere it is probably on the beaches <e> <s> generally speaking except for the water and there is a risk of drowning of course children tend to wander far and wide on the beaches <e> <s> i hope the minister will give further consideration to that point in the light of what we have said this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount confirm that spending on new and renewable sources of energy has fallen by roughly one-third from a peak of million in to an expected million as he said in the current financial year <e> <s> does this mean that the government are giving a lower priority at present to renewable sources <e> <s> could he also say why britain spends so little on renewables in comparison with countries such as germany france and italy which spend respectively million million and million annually on renewable sources <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the noble lords reply to my previous supplementary question the reply that this country does not need to spend so much on renewables because of our indigenous sources of energy supply can he say why in those circumstances we spend million per annum on nuclear research <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that we on this side of the house very much welcome the establishment of the energy efficiency unit in his department and generally support the objectives set for that unit <e> <s> would the noble earl agree that money spent on energy conservation not only saves precious fuel reserves but is also highly cost-effective and has great employment potential particularly for the unskilled and semiskilled <e> <s> for those reasons would he agree that the cuts recently made in insulation grants last autumn were to say the least unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl can answer one or two questions <e> <s> first bearing in mind that there is a spare capacity in electricity supply in england of per cent <e> <s> and in the south of scotland of per cent <e> <s> is it really necessary to build a pwr and to have this inquiry at all <e> <s> can he say that the reports that it will cost the cegb million and more for the inquiry are correct <e> <s> thirdly could he comment on the <e>", "<cs> if i may reply and i shall certainly do so very briefly because many points that i would have made in reply have already been made by my noble friends the noble lord lord cockfield said that we had to decide whether this amendment would help or hinder us <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that it would help him <e> <s> one of the problems with the bill is that it has undermined public confidence <e> <s> therefore to have the candidate for the director general interviewed by a select committee of parliament would assist in rebuilding public confidence which has already been shattered by the publication of the bill <e> <s> if therefore the noble lord were to accept the amendment he would help the bill in its passage through the committee <e> <s> that may be against me <e> <s> nevertheless i happen to think that it would help the noble lord to reassure public opinion about the bad effects of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to say just a few words in reply to the debate although i think that the major points were made by my noble friend lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i have been accused of being political <e> <s> of course i am being political and the reason i am being political is that over a period of four to five years we have seen some highly political actions being taken on the other side <e> <s> since there has been a political revolution albeit a right-wing one and it has been carried out to some degree by appointments made in publicly-owned industries <e>", "<cs> the committee should seriously consider what the noble lord lord lloyd has said <e> <s> while i appreciate everything that the noble lord the minister has said and while i must say that after his years <e>", "<cs> he looks remarkably well on it and i congratulate him and i sincerely trust that he will have at least another years active life <e> <s> but we are not really discussing anything here that we already know about <e> <s> we are setting up a new organisation <e> <s> the director generals post is a new post <e> <s> what is more it is a post which is in an industry which if there is an industry of the future this is it <e> <s> communications is one of the industries that will thrive for ever and a day and over the next or years there will be enormous strides and great new technologies <e> <s> for that reason this post may very well be different from other posts and we may very well need younger people who are in touch with this white-hot technological new telecommunications system which we shall have <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> i am most obliged to the noble lord for putting me right on what he said <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> the staff of british telecom are first-class and have been maintaining old-fashioned equipment which i was working on in <e> <s> the exchanges should have been replaced a long time ago <e> <s> but of course it is not the fault of originally the post office nor indeed of british telecom that they have not been replaced <e> <s> it is largely due to the manufacturing industry which went along the wrong road of developing new equipment <e> <s> it has also had something to do <e>", "<cs> yes i thought that the noble lord might wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> the post office certainly laid down particular specifications and i am quite sure that private industry tried to live up to those expectations <e> <s> but at the same time i understand that at least the post office and subsequently british telecom found that the manufacturers were not as co-operative as they might have been because they had other fish to fry <e>", "<cs> i am most obliged and i am sure that the committee is most obliged for that explanation from the noble lord lord weinstock <e> <s> however i must tell him that it is not an explanation that would be universally accepted and i am sure that if he reads the minutes of the select committee on nationalised industries which investigated the matter he will find that there are two points of view on it <e> <s> i have put one point of view this evening he has put the other and perhaps we shall have a discussion about the matter at much greater length outside the chamber <e>", "<cs> we shall press this amendment but i should like to make this final point <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the minister and it seems to me that he has given the opposition the case <e> <s> the argument i made originally and the arguments made by my noble friends and other noble lords has been that the words not reasonably practicable are inappropriate <e> <s> what the government seem to be saying is that that is true and what they really mean is not that it shall be not reasonably practicable but that it should be not reasonably economic <e> <s> that is what the argument is all about <e> <s> indeed the noble lord mentioned and it was virtually his only justification for the words not reasonably practicable that it might impinge unreasonably on finance and manpower resources <e> <s> it therefore seems that the wording the government want is not reasonably economic and that is what we are quarrelling about <e>", "<cs> what about electricity <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the explanation given by the noble lord but we remain a little concerned about it <e> <s> our amendment seeks to add the words <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl the minister not agree that even though it is a reduced figure million cubic feet a day of gas flamed is indeed very wasteful <e> <s> would it not be as well if the government were now to revive the project for a gas gathering pipeline which seems to have foundered since it was left to private enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for repeating the statement in this house <e> <s> however will he confirm that both the reports of the department of the environment and the nuclear installations inspectorate were severely critical of operation and management systems and noted the absence of suitable alarms and safety mechanisms to monitor radioactive materials going to the discharge tanks <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that although we welcome the short-term measures including on-line monitors and automatic cut-offs for the pumps we are deeply concerned that the need for these precautions was not foreseen before the incidents actually occurred <e> <s> therefore can the noble lord say whether the nuclear installations inspectorate has sufficient staff and resources to monitor sellafield and other nuclear plants throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords might i just return to the question of the nuclear installations <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for his explanations and for the categorical assurances he has given <e> <s> we on this side of the committee were certainly very concerned with the employment aspects of blind people in particular <e> <s> i would really be carping if i did not accept the noble lords assurances his categorical assurances as being very welcome indeed <e>", "<cs> i shall wait with bated breath for amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said <e> <s> i must say however that i was not entirely convinced by his argument because as far as we are concerned subsection <e>", "<cs> before we vote on this amendment i must say a few words in reply to the disagreement voiced over my previous remarks <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is a great exponent <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for his explanation and reply <e> <s> but i do not think we can be satisfied with it in a moment i will say why <e>", "<cs> i find both interventions extremely helpful in particular that by the noble countess lady mar who as i understood it was telling the committee that under the present regime kiosks are almost never removed <e> <s> i think that that was what she said <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister is assuring me that that position will continue or even be improved <e> <s> if that is so i should be very happy to hear it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord weinstock will not support this amendment but will support amendment no <e> <s> as i believe the noble viscount lord trenchard said he would do <e> <s> but i would point out that amendment no <e> <s> will cost the exchequer money whereas our amendment will cost the exchequer nothing except good negotiation with other countries and with other suppliers <e> <s> in those circumstances i would have hoped that it would be their wish to save the taxpayer money and to achieve the same objective <e>", "<cs> may i reply to the noble lord that we did not impose import controls and that is perhaps why we did not succeed <e>", "<cs> this is a very complicated and a very important amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i think that the committee has not been done a service by having the amendment brought forward only this morning on todays marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am still not very satisfied with the reply which was given by the noble lord lord cockfield because if i consume units of telephonic time then i expect to be charged for those units and not or or what-have-you <e> <s> i must say that the word sufficiently still worries me <e> <s> it is a qualification which i think will probably worry many other people as well particularly bearing in mind that many people have expressed doubts about the present metering policies of british telecom <e> <s> however it is late and i may wish to come back to the matter on report but for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this has been a most interesting debate spirited at times <e> <s> i am not satisfied with the answer given by the noble lord lord cockfield <e> <s> it is a simple amendment <e> <s> we are merely asking that the successor company shall satisfy the secretary of state that it will do these things <e> <s> it is not a question of writing something further into the statute book <e> <s> it is merely asking the secretary of state to reassure himself that these things will be done <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord cockfield should have given such a cool reception to my amendment <e> <s> i had expected him to welcome it with open arms <e> <s> i am also sorry that he should have turned the issue into a party political dogfight which i had certainly not intended it to be <e> <s> for example the noble lord asked me to compare the economic state of the country in with that at the present time <e> <s> i am happy to do so <e> <s> in unemployment was one-third what it is today total industrial production was higher than it is today although that was eight years ago and investment in industry was one-third higher than it is today <e> <s> so the state of the economy in despite certain financial difficulties which we had was on a rising trend <e> <s> there was higher production every year more investment in industry every year one year taken with another and there were million more people at work producing something for the country <e> <s> that is the comparison and it favours a labour government <e>", "<cs> yes in the light of that very full explanation and bearing in mind that so small a number of local authorities have contributed in this way and that being the case the administrative cost of paying the per cent <e> <s> would probably exceed the per cent <e> <s> itself i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> yes in the light of what the noble lord has said and bearing in mind that i want to think about this amendment again i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i too would like to congratulate the noble earl lord lauderdale upon introducing this subject <e> <s> indeed i should like to congratulate him on the manner in which he moved his motion <e> <s> it showed an erudition and great knowledge of the subject <e> <s> i very much enjoyed his speech and i hope that the house will learn from it <e> <s> i was impressed also by the introduction to his report by the noble lord lord kearton <e> <s> again he showed not only a knowledge of the oil and coal industries indeed of all the fuel industries but also that he has an enormous grasp of the economic problems and industrial policies which face us at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i think that i should say that i was in error in quoting from a report which has not been published <e> <s> i had understood that it was to be published today but i now understand that it is to be published next wednesday <e> <s> let me take this opportunity to apologise to your lordships for quoting a document which is clearly confidential and to apologise to the select committee on energy and indeed to the speaker of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> is it possible at all to give any indication as to when a decision about margam is likely to be made <e> <s> there is a great deal of anxiety in the area and it would be helpful if those anxieties could be allayed at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for his reply may i ask him to confirm that it is now months since the atkins report was published and many people are impatiently awaiting action on that report <e> <s> also while i acquit him personally of dragging his feet on this matter because <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl one short question <e> <s> he says that we should expect an announcement within a few weeks <e> <s> may i hope that it will be before the easter recess <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that between and some small businesses were either made bankrupt or went into liquidation and that many of those new businesses to which he referred were among those bankruptcies and liquidations <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord ensure bearing in mind that other suggestions have been made for a scheme upstream that the long-term benefit of a much greater generation capacity will not be sacrificed to any short-term expediency irrespective of the cost and irrespective of who might finance such a scheme <e>", "<cs> not everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not usually accused of looking at things through rose-coloured spectacles <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that my recollections of the post office are very good <e> <s> as he says the post office has made great progress over the years <e> <s> one has to say that that progress has been made without any privatisation bill from this government <e> <s> i am quite sure that without the bill british telecommunications released from the threat which hangs over them would be making even greater strides now than they have made in previous years <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been listening with great interest to what the noble lord has been saying <e> <s> he says that a monopoly is not appropriate in the field of telecommunications but does not the bill merely convert a public monopoly into a private monopoly and shall we not still have a monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not putting forward an argument <e> <s> i was merely trying to set on record the facts and to point out that although the noble lord said that a monopoly was not appropriate that is precisely what will prevail but it will be a private instead of a public monopoly <e> <s> we are basically and diametrically opposed to a private monopoly <e> <s> furthermore this bill was not necessary to provide competition in certain appliance fields <e> <s> that was done in the act and of course mercury was set up under that act as well <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord lloyd i do not particularly want to look a gift horse in the mouth and i certainly do not wish to be churlish about the olive branch that was held out by the noble lord lord lyell following the vote on the last amendment <e> <s> furthermore of course i cannot now pursue the argument about a free service since the house has just defeated that <e> <s> but i should like to say that we have not yet had and we did not receive one earlier on in our deliberations an explanation from the noble lord as to how we would define people who were disabled and what would be the administrative costs of so defining them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true and will the noble earl confirm that we shall in fact begin to lose self-sufficiency in oil towards the middle of the next decade <e> <s> under those circumstances would it not be as well if the government concentrated on energy saving on chp and above all on electric traction which of course is likely to save a good deal of the oil that is used <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to the dispatch box but the noble earl did not answer my question about the development of electric traction <e> <s> i should be most interested to learn his view on that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give some indication of the extent of the increased prices that consumers will be facing over the next few years <e> <s> i have heard estimates of an increase of up to per cent <e> <s> i believe that consumers would be interested to know what his estimate is <e> <s> can the minister also say whether there are any plans for extensive coal gasification <e> <s> is he able to comment on the question raised in another place that there is a possible market for million tonnes of coal for gasification in the future <e>", "<cs> since when has the noble lord been ordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> we understand of course that he has just said that the director general would resort to speedy action in order that there should not be great damages before that action was taken hut bearing in mind that the government have already assured the house that the number of staff will he kept to the bare minimum can he give us the assurance that the director general will have the facilities and the resources to react very quickly in order that people are not damaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am really quite surprised that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate feels unable to accept our amendment which in fact would clarify the situation beyond all shadow of doubt <e> <s> what we are seeking to achieve is that people working in the telecommunications industry should be equal with all other workers no more and no less <e> <s> i believe that as the bill is drafted and without the amendment we are proposing telecommunications workers will be in a worse case than any other group of employees throughout the country <e> <s> i cannot believe that that is what this house intends <e>", "<cs> very briefly i of course noted what the noble lord lord cockfield said <e> <s> we shall read what he said with the greatest of interest and so will other parties who are concerned about public telephone boxes throughout the country <e> <s> i recognise and on this side of the house we recognise that clause deals with public call boxes in a general sort of way and like him i would not want to see the statutes cluttered up with irrelevances <e> <s> but of course the fact of the matter is that when we looked at clause we did see that subsection a did refer in particular to matters affecting small businesses or persons who are disabled or of pensionable age <e> <s> it seems to me that there would have been no harm and there will still be no harm in including the wording of the amendment which i <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that the noble lord is not disposed to be kind to me tonight so i will be kind to him and the house and withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords since we have had a long debate on this amendment i will not seek to delay the house further by summing up <e> <s> i wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most unhappy that the noble lord lord cockfield should resist this amendment because i believe that it is a good amendment and indeed a forward-looking amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that explanation which i think makes the position clearer <e> <s> it certainly makes clear that occupiers are in fact on an equal footing and that they can recover the costs or that the work will be done by the operator himself <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has satisfied me completely on that point <e> <s> there is only one aspect which worries me <e> <s> let us consider an old person who suddenly has served on her a notice from an operator <e> <s> the notice might say nothing about the operator being liable for the costs <e> <s> therefore the old person may be extremely worried and concerned when she receives a notice from what she thinks is a statutory undertaking saying your trees are damaging our lines you must have then lopped <e> <s> being a good citizen she will not want to hurt anybody and so off she goes and gets somebody to lop the trees <e> <s> that will be the end of the matter but of course she will be put to expense because she does not know the law <e> <s> she will not have read schedule paragraph of the telecommunications act <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would go a little further in relation to the licence <e> <s> he said that he hoped that the licence would cover this situation <e> <s> can he go a little further and say that the licence will cover it not that he hopes it will cover it but that it actually will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i should like to reply briefly to one or two of the points that were made by the noble lord lord cockfield <e> <s> of course one understands that political parties put forward manifestos at a general election and one also understands that they may very well wish to put and indeed perhaps should put those manifesto commitments into operation <e> <s> but i am sure that the noble lord was not suggesting that the conservatives won the general election on the basis that they had gone to the country with the proposition to privatise bt and to sell per cent <e> <s> of the shares on the market <e> <s> i feel quite sure that had he put that proposition to the electorate and that was the only proposition the government would probably have lost and we should now be sitting on their side of the house <e> <s> the general election was fought on quite different matters and the electorate made their decision on quite different grounds from the privatisation or otherwise of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful and the house will be grateful to the noble earl the minister for repeating as a statement the answer to a private notice question which was asked in another place this afternoon <e> <s> but is he aware that there is growing concern about the escalating impact of the dispute in industry and employment not only in the steel industry but in other industries as well <e> <s> in those circumstances is not this dispute not a merely local dispute between the national coal board and the national union of mineworkers but a national issue since the effects on the total economy could be very grave indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may refer the noble earl to some of his previous answers can he confirm that the trade unions which are now taking action are all in fact doing so to preserve jobs <e> <s> that is one of the main problems which faces the unions particularly the num and the nur and the actions they are taking now are in support of jobs nearly million of which have been destroyed by the government over the last four or five years <e>", "<cs> my lords although i welcome what the noble earl has said about the cost of warmth index and the governments attitude towards it can i have his assurance now that there will not be a repeat performance next year of what happened this year when the fuel industries were forced to increase prices against their will <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful for those figures <e> <s> however the noble earl will be aware that there has been some concern lately about contracts which have been placed not in this country but abroad <e> <s> could he comment on the placing of a contract by sun oil for an oil rig in sweden rather than in this country and what effect that will have on jobs <e> <s> could he also comment on the cancellation of the oil pipeline by shell which in fact will cost jobs in hartlepool and bring about considerable distress in that particular area <e> <s> will he finally say whether the per cent <e> <s> british content is being upheld in every case and in the th round will the government be much firmer in enforcing the per cent <e> <s> british content because if not <e> <s> i rather fear that more work will go abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that we are extremely pleased that the answer to the private notice question has been reported in full by him this afternoon <e> <s> but is he also aware that the opposition believe that the real responsiblity for this dispute lies with the government <e>", "<cs> yes it lies with the government since it is about jobs about the survival of whole communities and about the future of a vitally important industry <e> <s> the government so far have not intervened or done anything else towards solving this dispute which has been going on for seven weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to the courteous answers given by the noble earl but there are one or two points which arise from those answers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that our effort on research into methods involving alternative and renewable energy is well below that of other countries <e> <s> for example is it not true that on this kind of research the federal republic of germany spends million a year and france spends million a year <e> <s> can he explain the discrep-ancy between the sums of million last year and million this year <e> <s> can he also say how much money the government have allocated to the development of refuse-derived fuel which is a very important new source which could help not only through supplementing and augmenting our fuel supplies but also in dealing with the problem of refuse disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not reprehensible that the noble lord lord orr-ewing should at this particularly sensitive time try to make the present dispute a party political issue <e> <s> i do not wish to do that but would the noble earl confirm that the closure programmes in the past whether under a labour or a conservative government have taken place against the background of full employment or near-full employment whereas the present closures are taking place against the background of mass unemployment and it is that which makes the closing of pits between and a difficult situation and which makes the present closures more difficult as well <e> <s> i have no wish and i am sure that most other noble lords have no wish to exacerbate the present situation but may i ask the noble earl whether he will comment and i understand he may be in some difficulty perhaps on the article on the front page of the <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord give me an assurance that as a result of our agreement with four other european countries there will be no delay in building a british commercial demonstration fast reactor <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble earl of the report on european community coal policy produced by your lordships select committee on the european communities and particularly the conclusion in paragraph r which recommends that <e>", "<cs> my lords because we had full employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl can answer two questions <e> <s> can he say what is the total cost to the british taxpayer of the project which incidentally i support bearing in mind the per cent <e> <s> direct cost that we pay and of course our contribution to the european community <e> <s> secondly may i ask whether there are <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl understand that this whole issue is about communities and about jobs which will be lost forever <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that it is no good the government imagining that the miners will be satisfied with redundancy payments however high because the loss of jobs will destroy their communities which is what the dispute is all about <e> <s> when will the government cease behaving like some corporate pontius pilate and stop washing their hands of the whole affair <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord ezra on introducing this short debate today <e> <s> i must confess that when i heard that he was to introduce this motion in a two and a half hour debate i wondered whether the house would have sufficient time to deal with this great subject but i have been very pleasantly surprised that we have had excellent contributions and the debate we have had has been very well balanced indeed <e> <s> it has been intriguing in many senses <e> <s> we almost reached a consensus about the need for a long-term strategy on energy <e> <s> that consensus i think was a little dented when the noble lord lord harris of high cross came in followed by the noble duke the duke of portland <e> <s> nevertheless we have reached a measure of consensus which is good and which bodes well i hope for the future of our energy industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble earl lord avon for giving way <e> <s> did i understand him correctly to say that the new figures produced in the brown book will give us a longer period of self-sufficiency <e> <s> that was not my understanding of it <e> <s> i read possible reserves to mean exactly what that is that they were possible reserves <e> <s> is the noble earl now saying that there is evidence that we shall have self-sufficiency beyond <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read that response to the select committees report but would the minister who is himself a reasonable and courteous man nevertheless not agree that the governments response to the select committee on energy on this issue is an impertinence and discourteous to the select committee itself <e> <s> furthermore does not that response mean that the nationalised industries will continue to suffer uncertainty and nagging interference from the treasury particularly in the matter of forcing up gas and electricity prices <e>", "<cs> my lords but is it really correct that todays consumers should be paying tomorrows prices <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble earls answer completely unsatisfactory <e> <s> is it not a fact that the government have been telling parliament for a long period of time that they are interested in conserving our energy resources which are in the long-term likely to be in short supply and that the building of new power stations and new installations is very expensive <e> <s> is it not a crazy policy that we should now be imposing a per cent <e> <s> tax on insulation measures which will save an enormous amount of energy <e> <s> will the noble earl make represent-ations to his colleagues particularly in the treasury in order that this tax can be repealed or at least not proceeded with <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not reprehensible especially bearing in mind the reports of manipulation of the social security system against the miners and their families that the miners should also not now be able to get a rebate of money which belongs to them not only for the current financial year but for the financial year <e> <s> should not the government at least pay the amount of money due to the miners for the financial year which would amount to about three or four weeks rebate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but this is a question of miners families now being not on the breadline but very much below the breadline <e> <s> would it not be in the governments own interest to try to assist in this matter <e> <s> otherwise the charge that they are trying to starve the miners back to work will stick <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the very fulsome and well justified praise that the noble lord the minister has just extended to british leyland can he give the house an assurance that this successfully publicly-owned company will not now be privatised either wholly or piecemeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl see that answer as being as unsatisfactory to himself as it is to me <e> <s> will he confirm that the main inquiry opened on th january i am sorry months ago and that its duration and the escalating cost of over million are giving grave cause for concern <e> <s> under these circumstances is it not desirable that if we are to have a continuing nuclear power programme we should in the countrys best interest go along the agr fast reactor road <e> <s> as was implicit in our own select committees report <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the costs of the inquiry is it not a fact that themillion mentioned by the noble earl relates to his department alone and not to the parties to the inquiry <e> <s> if all the costs including the costs incurred by the cegb are taken into account is it not a fact that they will exceed million <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place by his right honourable friend and i should like also to convey the congratulations of the opposition to british leyland on the success it has made in rebuilding a british car industry since it was nationalised by a labour government <e> <s> i think in <e> <s> had it not been for that act of a labour government it is doubtful whether the minister would have been repeating the statement in the house this afternoon because there would have been no bl of which to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord for answering some of the questions that i have put to him <e> <s> but i must confess that i am puzzled by one or two of the answers and perhaps he could further elaborate <e> <s> first of all the noble lord mentioned the export figures to nigeria and the middle east and the drop there seems quite enormous <e> <s> were there any particular internal reasons in those countries or was the fall in orders from those countries due to british policy of high interest rates and high exchange rates and perhaps of giving too little assistance to under-developed countries <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the enormous success story that has just been related to us by the noble lord the minister and also bearing in mind that public enterprise and public capital rescued british leyland and the british car industry from bankruptcy under private enterprise is it not an absurdity and is it not cheating the taxpayers of this country to suggest that all this has been done merely to return to private enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord criticised my noble friend for taking british leyland into public ownership <e> <s> but is he aware that in the house of commons of his honourable friends voted against taking british leyland into public ownership in which case it would have gone bust and we would have had no british car industry at all <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the new figures which have been issued is the noble earl able to tell us the date to which the government thinkthat we now have self-sufficiency in oil <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to belittle in any way the achievements of the british industry but will the noble earl confirm that over the next decade or so per cent <e> <s> of all oil discoveries are likely to be offshore and therefore the british industry should be in a very good position to take advantage of all the export trade that will flow from that billion worth of it <e> <s> is he aware that in our view the united kingdom industry will not be able to take advantage of it unless the government give a real lead and not mere exhortation <e> <s> can i have the noble earls assurance that the government will give that lead <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i have ever heard or had experience of a debate in which such praise has been heaped on an organisation that is later to be virtually decapitated <e> <s> today we have heard the noble lord the minister describe the rofs as factories and organisations which have done well <e> <s> he described the work force as loyal and devoted and said that we are rightly proud of their expertise and record <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond quoted at length from the comments of ministers in another place where again the praise heaped on the rofs their record and the work force was lavish indeed <e> <s> we have heard from the noble baroness who has had great experience of them how devoted and loyal the people working in them have been over a very long period of time <e> <s> she rightly asked the question why are we doing this now <e> <s> that is the question which the house is entitled to ask and which she has put so well <e> <s> it is a question that we shall expect to be answered by the minister when he winds up and indeed during the later stages of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can confirm that what the noble lord said is correct <e> <s> those items were indeed in the report <e> <s> i am not prepared to comment further on the noble lord lord strathconas speech but i hope he will now re-read his own report before the committee stage and i am quite sure he will be very helpful when we come to discuss the matter further on committee <e>", "<cs> as a matter of fact my lords i would feel much safer if they did but i have no knowledge of their particular arrangements at present <e> <s> what i do know is that so far as these factories are concerned they have been policed very efficiently <e> <s> with the growing incidence of terrorism i believe that the state should be very involved in the safety of establishments like this <e> <s> indeed i was going on to say that i find it strange and worrying that the prime minister was a signatory to the london economic summit declaration on international terrorism at the same time as this bill was before the house <e> <s> what did the declaration say <e> <s> the heads of state at the london economic summit said that they were disturbed to note the ease with which terrorists move across international boundaries and gain access to weapons explosives training and finance <e> <s> this is what the economic summit said and our prime minister was a signatory to that particular passage in that particular communiqu <e> <s> they recommended scrutiny by each country of gaps in its national legislation that might be exploited by terrorists <e> <s> yet here we have a bill before us that proposes to hand over the policing of rof establishments to private organisations <e> <s> i hope that in the light of the declaration of the economic summit this will be reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords are there not two additional means by which the government can help the least well off and indeed the rest of us in relation to fuel prices <e> <s> first of all can the noble lord give an assurance that the government will not intervene next year to artificially increase the price of electricity and perhaps gas <e> <s> secondly will he prevail upon her majestys government to settle the miners strike which is costing so much in the use of extra oil by setting up a court of inquiry to examine the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the action by the ncb literally a matter of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted <e> <s> would it not have been far better before the coal board announced their closure programme to have had consultations with the miners about bringing alternative employment to the area and agreeing not to go ahead with pit closures unless and until such employment had been brought forward <e> <s> also may i ask the minister to prevail upon the chairman of the national coal board and point out to him that instead of announcing as is apparent from the press this morning that he would prefer the dispute to go on apparently until it suits him he should get down to retaining and returning confidence among the miners that the coal board really are interested in the future of miners and mining areas <e>", "<cs> but my lords surely under present circumstances and indeed in terms of the foreseeable future it is not good enough for the government to say that this is a matter simply for the coal board since energy policy overall is clearly a matter for government <e> <s> is it not necessary to bear in mind these long lead times and the fact that we shall run out of oil and gas reserves in the fairly near future <e> <s> would it not be correct for the government to estimate and to identify the reserves that we have so that plans can be made and the reserves can be extracted not only for burning in power stations but also for coal gasification and liquefaction which we shall certainly need within the next years <e> <s> planning really is necessary at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to come back on this my lords but is it not a fact that to build a coal liquefaction or a coal gasification plant needs perhaps a -year lead time and such facilities and such programmes as this cannot be left to the forces of the market <e>", "<cs> but my lords are the government not being utterly complacent about this matter because in addition to the deficit on manufactured goods which we have with the federal republic of germany there is a further deficit with the rest of the eec which last year produced an overall adverse balance of million equivalent to jobs <e> <s> if the government allow this adverse balance to increase and continue then they will never get hold of the unemployment problem and reduce unemployment in this country <e> <s> will the government be less complacent and do something <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister can say that again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble earl for his answer to my question <e> <s> however would he agree that the increased costs would be quite serious not only for the domestic consumer but also for industrial consumers as well and would indeed put up our industrial costs and injure our competitive position <e> <s> would the noble earl also agree that although the large plants directive may he popular in certain quarters in a sloganish type of way it may nevertheless not be the correct and most effective route towards dealing with the effects of acid rain on the environment although it may prove to be the most expensive <e> <s> may i have the noble earls assurance that the government will resist any attempts to implement the large plants directive until proper and wide-ranging research has taken place into the reasons for acid rain and the best way of curing it <e> <s> and that would include afforestation policies which have been embarked upon by many countries throughout northern europe <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl take especial note of what his noble friend lord nugent has just said that we may in fact land up having more haste with less speed and that speed will not necessarily find the right solution indeed it might find the wrong solution to the wrong problem <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the minister has answered satisfactorily the points raised by my noble friend <e> <s> it is all very well to talk about protection under the act but the fact is that people now working at the royal ordnance factories have had conditions of service and ways and means of negotiating settlements and negotiating on grievances that will not be protected under the act <e> <s> we are talking here about the consultative arrangements that were available within the whitley council and indeed the generally good arrangements for civil servants to consult their employers and to settle internal differences <e> <s> i do not think frankly that the ministers reply to my noble friend in any way deals with the matter <e> <s> we believe that the amendment is a reasonable and a good one and indeed a very necessary one <e> <s> we shall therefore press it to a vote <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand why the minister and the government are so intransigent about amendments of this kind <e> <s> bearing in mind all that we have seen over the past few weeks with industrial misunderstanding occurring in many parts of industry i thought that the government would wish to take a new look at relationships between managements shareholders and employees <e> <s> the minister said that such appointments would be quite inappropriate and not in accordance with normal practice <e> <s> i submit that normal practice has not brought about the good labour relations which are desirable not only in the rofs but in many other organisations as well <e>", "<cs> well i think that we made his name for him earlier this afternoon though perhaps he wishes that we had not done so <e> <s> nevertheless the minister could make a name for himself by accepting this amendment and acknowledging that we need to find new ways of bringing cooperation and understanding to industry and new ways of enabling employees to make a real contribution <e> <s> that can be done on the board of directors and in every other part of the workplace as well <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am most surprised at what he is saying <e> <s> nobody is suggesting that people should be forced to serve <e> <s> we are suggesting that they shold be elected to serve in exactly the same way as the people in another place are elected to serve <e>", "<cs> i understand that there are still a few in stock <e> <s> i have no doubt that we can arrange for the government to have a regular supply if that is their wish <e> <s> but the fact is that on every count <e>", "<cs> i am extremely disappointed that the minister has not seen fit to accept this very simple and i should have thought very helpful amendment <e> <s> he tried to convince your lordships that the trade unions were if not happy nevertheless satisfied that discussions and consultations were to their liking and acceptable to them <e> <s> but my information is that the trade unions remain deeply apprehensive about the matters which i mentioned in regard to continuity of service pensions and redundancy payments <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord really ought to think about this again because the noble baroness lady vickers is on a very good point here <e> <s> this is rather different from other privatisation measures is it not <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord cockfield sitting here he will be interested in this because of the privatisation of british telecom <e> <s> he could claim and claim reasonably that the government wanted to sell british telecom because they would receive a windfall of between million to million <e> <s> in spite of our objections to that bill we could well understand the noble lords desire to acquire million to million for the government <e> <s> that commends itself to commercially-minded people <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether he disposed of that point to the satisfaction of his noble friends but the minister certainly did not dispose of it to my satisfaction <e> <s> the fact is and i do not think he is denying it that the government and the taxpayer when all is taken into account will not receive any gain from the sale of the rofs <e> <s> indeed they will incur a loss as a result <e> <s> therefore i believe this is a different <e>", "<cs> well by the governments own reckoning they are likely to sustain a loss <e>", "<cs> i do not know when the noble lord the minister explained that he is not going to incur a loss <e> <s> perhaps he will wait until i finish <e>", "<cs> i have not given way <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to keep myself in order and will keep her noble friend in order <e> <s> what i was going to say to the minister was that perhaps after i had finished what i was going to say and that will be very shortly he can make his own reply <e> <s> but in spite of what was said at second reading the fact is that it is my own view and that of many other noble lords that by the time the government come to sell off this enterprise the taxpayer will face a loss <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for his very full explanation and for the assurance which he gave me about perme employees <e> <s> this is an extremely complicated matter i recognise that <e> <s> i also recognise that negotiations are still continuing <e> <s> i think that under those circumstances and bearing in mind that we are unlikely to come back to the bill for report stage as i understand it until after the recess the best thing one can do is to read what the noble lord the minister has said and give time for further negotiations to take place and if necessary we can return to the matter at report stage <e> <s> under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to study what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> i certainly do not think that he has given me any reassurance about future new employees of the rofs <e> <s> but at this time of the night i should like to wait and study what he has said <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to follow on what the noble lord lord diamond has said and simply to emphasise what he has said <e> <s> despite what the noble minister says his experience has been the major bone of contention in the industrial scene is a disparity between peoples conditions of service <e> <s> if we are to make any progress at all in industrial relations in this country we shall have to standardise pensions and other conditions of service <e> <s> i beg the minister to take that very serious point because upon it hinges the future of the industrial relations not only in the rofs but in many other areas of employment as well <e> <s> i beg him to think about this during the recess <e> <s> we shall undoubtedly return to it after the recess but i beg him and the government to think about this point because the government will be perpetuating a system which has proved to be disastrous in industrial relations in so many firms up and down the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls reply to my noble friends original question was singularly and uncharacteristically unhelpful <e> <s> at the present time we need an emollient rather than the opposite <e> <s> is it not a fact that mr macgregor would be very happy indeed anxious to settle the present dispute but for the prime ministers insistence on having total victory over the national union of mineworkers and mr scargill in particular <e> <s> indeed her falklands mentality is unfortunately continuing to the detriment of the mining industry and of the country as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am prefacing my question with some apt remarks and it is useless asking questions which are not understandable to noble lords <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may return to the suggestion that i made a week or two ago and ask the noble earl the minister whether he would suggest to his right honourable friends that they should offer to both sides in the coal dispute the opportunity to have a court of inquiry which would be able quite impartially to examine the reasons for the dispute and the future of the coal mining industry <e> <s> would the noble earl listen to that suggestion and perhaps pass it on <e>", "<cs> it is relevant though <e>", "<cs> what about that manifesto commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be assured that the national coal board itself will keep this scheme very much under its own control <e> <s> may i also ask the noble earl whether the national coal board will encourage enterprises which will make many of the goods which the national coal board itself uses <e> <s> would that not be a good use of ex-miners expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for his reply may i also express my disappointment <e> <s> can he confirm whether the worlds first commercial wave power station is to be built in norway using research and development work undertaken in this country at a cost of million to the british taxpayer <e> <s> if this is so would he also say whether this is not yet another case of british brains and expertise being beneficially exploited by a foreign country and britain the pioneer failing to profit from its own genius <e>", "<cs> my lords may i urge the noble earl in the light of the norwegian experience and whether it expects to produce wave energy at less than p a unit not to write off wave energy as appears to be done but to keep in very close touch with developments and if applicable in this country to make sure that resources are available to develop <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> so far as we can see the orders are perfectly acceptable <e> <s> we have no objection to them and we are quite happy for them to pass without further discussion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think the regulations are eminently reasonable and sensible and the opposition in fact welcome them <e> <s> i think they provide proper safeguards for consumers and of course we are particularly pleased that they have been agreed with the trade <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that as a result of this particular strike the government and the nation have lost including the loss of coal mined some million and that is a great deal of money <e> <s> can the noble earl say whether the government will consider bearing in mind that by the end of the century we shall need per cent <e> <s> more coal <e> <s> will he say whether the government are prepared to make new approaches to the miners and to the national coal board with a view to keeping pits open on a care and maintenance basis <e> <s> will he also say exactly what the government are going to do while this house is in recess for the next or weeks <e>", "<cs> but my lords the situation may get infinitely worse during the recess both in social and political terms <e> <s> will the government give an assurance that if necessary parliament will be recalled <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer the question put by his noble friend what is the cost of british coal compared with the cost of coal mined in the common market <e> <s> if he cannot answer that question i will do it for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to echo the words of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that if there was a justification for pressing this amendment it was contained in the ministers own <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to that point myself <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that a future labour government may be hard pressed for parliamentary time <e> <s> bearing in mind the mess it would have to clear up after the present government and the previous government from they would have a lot on their plate <e> <s> it may be essential for a future government to take action immediately on matters of this sort but as a result of this bill which would then be an act there would be a delay and the parliamentary programme might be put in jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble minister for his assurances about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> of course i accept those assurances <e> <s> i also have to accept what the minister has said today and indeed what the government have said many times before that they intend that the rofs should be removed from government control <e> <s> there is undoubtedly a great gulf between us <e> <s> what i have tried to show the minister but apparently he has not been persuaded by the arguments is that what he is doing may hurt his own government at any given point in time <e> <s> bearing in mind the nature of the royal ordnance factories bearing in mind the defence and the security aspects it seems to us that the government are unduly and unnecessarily tying their own hands as well as the hands of any future government <e>", "<cs> my lords quite naturally i should prefer the amendment to be written into the bill <e> <s> but i must confess that i think that the minister has given a lot more information <e> <s> indeed as far as i could see he was giving the assurance that for mobile non-industrial staff the field of redundancy would not as i suggested in my opening remarks be limited to a single factory but must apply to the whole of the rof company <e> <s> that is what i understood him to say <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>

such employees may have a remedy at law <e> <s> under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am very encouraged by what the minister has said <e> <s> as i understand it what he was saying and let me repeat it was that there will be a legal obligation on the successor company to pay redundancy compensation on no less favourable terms than they would have received had they been still in the civil service <e> <s> under those circumstances i should like to consider again and indeed the trade unions would wish to consider again what the noble lord has said and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> he believes that there should be flexibility in relation to the royal ordnance factories <e> <s> i do not believe that there should be such flexilbility <e> <s> the royal ordnance factories which at present are quite rightly guarded by ministry of defence police will probably continue to make the same things as they do now and perhaps even more dangerous things <e> <s> if it is necessary and desirable for the ministry of defence police to be in post now guarding those factories i believe that when they change their status it will be not less necessary but more necessary for the ministry of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the

ministers reply <e> <s> it may very well be his own opinion that it is not necessary for all the matters mentioned by me and by other noble lords to be resolved by vesting day but i can assure him that there are many people including me who believe that these matters should be resolved before vesting day <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord should have referred to the fact that there had been already a two-month delay in vesting day <e> <s> he implied in fact that that was a concession to the opposition but i would remind him that that two months delay was at the behest of the government themselves and certainly not at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement made in another place but i have to say that so far as we are

appeared to show such complacency i am sure that he did not mean it but he showed it about security at armament factories <e> <s> the fact is that far from lowering our security profile we need to heighten it <e> <s> we should not only keep up our guard we should reinforce our guard in the face of a growing and more violent terrorist threat <e> <s> therefore the labour party believes that the ministry of defence police who have proved themselves over long years to be an efficient well-trained responsible and dedicated force should continue to be responsible for security at all rof establishments after privatisation <e> <s> nothing else will really do <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that there remains a gulf between us <e> <s> it is not a yawning gulf but nevertheless there is a gulf <e> <s> i appreciate and indeed it was quite fair that the minister should quote to us the house of commons defence committee and of course to some degree they supported his view though in many other parts of the paper the government are severely criticised as i said on report stage <e> <s> but things move on times change things happen which change peoples minds <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble viscount for raising this issue which has relevance in the present difficulties affecting the coal industry <e> <s> it is not my intention as indeed it was not the intention of the noble viscount to refer to the dispute in the coal industry except to say that we all hope that there will be an early and satisfactory settlement and a full resumption of work <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friends question not have added relevance in that he wants an independent body to study these matters bearing in mind the document marked secret which was issued by the north-east area today which is referred to in the national newspapers and which in fact projects a run-down of the coal industry in the north-east with a loss of jobs by and another by the s <e> <s> does that not show that while the nacods negotiations were going on there were already secret plans going ahead to close down or virtually to close down the north-east area and was that not really treachery <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one further supplementary question <e> <s> the house will have listened with interest to what the noble lord lord gray of contin has said but will he answer this question <e> <s> will he confirm that while negotiations were going on with nacods a secret document was in preparation and was about to be published which would reduce the number of men in the north-east coalfields by <e> <s> will he confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have offended against the procedures of this house then of course i unreservedly apologise to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are many people who are concerned that the consumer councils in fact have no power at all over prices and no say and indeed are not even being consulted <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that we were very concerned i was certainly very concerned that the announcement was contained in the newspapers that prices in the electricity industry would go up by per cent <e> <s> and in the gas industry by per cent <e> <s> before the chancellors statement last monday <e> <s> where does that leave the consultative councils <e> <s> indeed where does it leave the boards themselves if such announcements are to be made in advance of a statement <e> <s> do the consultative councils indeed do the boards themselves have any real power over prices in the light of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the governments policy from has been to make the rich richer in order that they would invest more in industry <e> <s> is it not also a fact that that simply has not come off and that investment in industry is still only about per cent <e> <s> of what it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl would reconsider his last but one answer is it not a fact that in the table that he quoted the figures show that between and the proportion of marketable wealth owned by the top per cent <e> <s> of the population moved downwards from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> first is it not a fact that the amount of money we spend on research into renewable energy is very small indeed in relation to that spent by other countries and is it not necessary in spite of our huge reserves of fossil fuels to have a balanced energy programme that includes a good portion of renewable energy <e> <s> secondly in relation to nuclear research is it the intention of the government to shift the burden of funding work on the fast breeder reactor and nuclear safety from the department of energy to the cegb <e> <s> if that is so would that not be loading the bulk of the cost of nuclear research on to electricity consumers through increased electricity prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not think that the noble lord answered the question <e> <s> is it the governments intention not to fund the nuclear research programme through his own department but to swing the expenditure on to the cegb <e> <s> is the cegb to carry a far greater proportion of the expenditure on research in the future than it has done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the select committee on their report <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord aberdare for the concise and understandable manner in which he presented that report <e> <s> there was one remark that he made that struck me particularly <e> <s> it was that the house of lords will be treated by the bbc as an outside broadcast <e> <s> that speaks volumes does it not <e> <s> the house of lords will be treated by the bbc as an outside broadcast on a par with the saturday morning dog show for example <e> <s> that is the measure of how the bbc sees this house <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be <e> <s> indeed i have to say that if i were proved wrong in my view on this matter i should not be at all unhappy <e> <s> if indeed the televising of parliament enhanced its reputation then i would be the first to be pleased <e> <s> but unfortunately at this particular time i take the view that it would do exactly the reverse <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will gladly speak for myself <e> <s> i feel quite sure as i was going to say that people when they see my face may very well be distracted from what i say and i happen to think that what i say is far more beautiful than my face <e> <s> i was going on to say that when i was a member <e>", "<cs> my lords if we had an experiment and if it is going to prove me right or wrong it will have to be a real experiment by televising both houses <e> <s> that is the only real way we can prove it one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that during the period to the total net united kingdom contributions to the eec amounted to no less than million an average of million a year <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that that is a far cry from the broad balance promised by the prime minster at the start of the negotiations <e> <s> furthermore does he not also consider that these payments for which we receive no tangible benefit are a bad bargain for britain especially at a time when the chancellor of the exchequer is slashing public expenditure in all directions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would answer one short question in relation to our future contributions which he mentioned which of course will be per cent <e> <s> of vat as opposed to per cent <e> <s> now <e> <s> has actual agreement been reached on future control of the communitys financial matters <e> <s> has that been finally agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for the clear and concise way in which he has explained the bill to the house <e> <s> there is very little i can say about the bill which as the noble earl said is in the main a technical measure except perhaps to say that we welcome it <e> <s> unfortunately there are few bills initiated by this government that we can welcome and support <e> <s> so perhaps we should rejoice this afternoon in being able to say that in respect of this bill we can be thankful and are thankful for small mercies <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord any evidence that funds allowed for mortgage repayments are being used for other purposes or is he merely relying upon hearsay evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord reconsider his earlier statement that all evidence including hearsay evidence will be taken into account <e> <s> would he agree that there is no substitute in matters of this sort for a full and proper investigation into all the circumstances of each individual case <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount the leader of the house can help me on one point which relates to the new measures for financial control <e> <s> can he say whether these measures will ensure that the community will continue to be in credit and will not in future need to call on member states to make special loans to the community as is the case this year and as in fact will be proposed in a measure which will be laid before this house next thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister not being rather shy about this matter <e> <s> we have heard and seen estimates of the costs at a figure of about million <e> <s> the running costs of the system have to be added to that figure <e> <s> surely that must detract from the conventional defence budget <e> <s> would it not be much more sensible for this country to concentrate its defence effort on the navy and the royal air force <e> <s> perhaps the noble minister would comment on newspaper reports this morning that due to lack of funds the air force is going to cut down on pilot training <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord for repeating to your lordships the statement which was made by the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> it seems to me that the most significant <e>", "<cs> i asked that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree that sir denis rooke is a fine and dedicated public servant and furthermore that the british gas corporation is one of the most successful nationalised industries that we have making great profits for the exchequer at the present time <e> <s> with regard to the sleipner field will the noble viscount agree that supplies to great britain will be no more than adequate even with supplies from sleipner <e> <s> if we do not get those supplies it may very well be that the british gas corporation will be unable to plan its long-term markets <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is the government who are responsible and it is them to blame in that they appointed mr macgregor a man who had little experience of the industry <e> <s> certainly he had no experience of people in our mining areas and what is more he issued a challenge to the coal miners and the coalmining union by setting aside established procedures that had gone on for many years <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that that was the cause of the strike <e> <s> furthermore would he not agree that even just lately when the tuc were meeting the secretary of state for energy mr macgregor undermined those negotiations on the day that they were taking place <e>", "<cs> he still is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for me i think on behalf of the opposition merely to thank the noble lord for the extremely concise manner in which he has explained these regulations which certainly are complex but which so far as we are concerned seem to be sensible in all the circumstances <e> <s> i have no questions to ask him and of course we shall support the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating that statement <e> <s> however bearing in mind the magnitude of the problem in the exchange markets the statement was a very short one and i shall therefore ask the noble lord a number of questions <e> <s> will the government now recognise the generally accepted fact that their economic policy is a shambles and that its inadequacy has been emphasised by the incompetence and vacillation of the past week <e> <s> indeed that vacillation and incompetence was compounded over the weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the replies which he has just given lead me to be very depressed indeed <e> <s> what he is in fact saying is that the government have no strategy at all about an issue which will affect the whole of our economy particularly unemployment <e> <s> bearing in mind his particular portfolio is he in fact saying that inflation is still to take priority over all else <e> <s> if that is so will he say to what level the government will allow unemployment to rise before they adopt some proper exchange rate policy <e> <s> alternatively are we to have a continuation of the policy that has operated since during which period unemployment has gone up by million <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord jenkins of putney would not expect me to follow him down the road of the hypothecation of revenues but would the minister not agree that the question that my noble friend has raised reflects the growing abhorrence of people against weapons of mass destruction and genocide such as trident <e> <s> in these circumstances would the government not be seen in a more favourable light if they abandoned this project which is now estimated to cost twice the million which the government put forward originally <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although he tried very well to explain these esoteric matters to his noble friend lord molson many people will still remain puzzled <e> <s> is it not a fact that since the broad money aggregates have been narrowed unemployment has risen almost in exact correlation <e> <s> is it also not a fact that the governments monetary policy far from assisting inflation and interest rates has done the reverse and that we are enjoying the highest interest rates now that we have had for a long time <e> <s> would it not be far better if the government abandoned their monetarist policy and ran the economy on a proper planned basis which would benefit the unemployed the rest of the economy and the rest of the community to a very great extent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that during the past five years billion from this country has been invested abroad to provide jobs in other countries while unemployment in this country has soared to million <e> <s> did he note on monday a report from the oecd showing that among the other industrialised countries this country had the lowest rate of investment not only in industry but in infrastructure as well <e> <s> when for the sake of the british people who seem to be the only ones not benefiting long-term from north sea oil are the government going to alter their policy and invest in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that i believe that the noble lord lord oneill has a very good point <e> <s> i hope he will consider further what the noble lord said <e> <s> further does the minister agree that it is not only the colour of the money that counts but its value <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord say exactly what the government are going to do about the catastrophic drop in the value of the pound abroad <e>", "<cs> and the savage increase of per cent <e> <s> in interest rates today <e>", "<cs> will he say what effect that per cent <e> <s> increase will have on our economy and on local government in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order i asked two questions <e> <s> even if the noble lord the deputy leader of the house feels that my second question was out of order my first certainly was not and i should be obliged to have a reply <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> i was saying that the noble lord lord oneill had a very good point and that i hoped that in view of what he said the minister would reconsider his answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement which was made by the chancellor of the exchequer in reply to a private notice question in the other place <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that the statement is not very forthcoming bearing in mind the seriousness of the position <e> <s> is he aware that the recent savage increases in the interest rate culminating in the per cent <e> <s> increase yesterday have sent shock waves throughout the city and the financial markets causing uncertainty and convulsions throughout all our national institutions <e> <s> that is the seriousness of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl castigated my noble friend lord dean of beswick for not understanding simple truths <e> <s> i thought that that was rather unkind <e> <s> is it not one of the simple truths at the moment that real interest rates after yesterdays rise are the highest they have been in the united kingdom for years <e> <s> is not that a simple truth that really ought to worry the government <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not mind being in conflict with the opposite side of the house but i do object to being in conflict with my own leader <e> <s> would the noble earl agree that the extension of value added tax in any sense and in respect of the bible would not only have a regressive effect on religion but also a regressive effect on taxation generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for his helpful reply but may i ask him two questions <e> <s> in regard to the application of the regulations is it not a fact that it can be found out that they have been breached only after the event when perhaps somebody has been killed <e> <s> is it still the governments intention as was made clear during the progress of the oil and gas enterprise bill through this house in to introduce a stringent and strict licensing scheme for gas installers as is the case in the united states canada and many of our european neighbours <e> <s> is it still the governments intention at some stage to bring in such a licensing system <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for repeating that statement in this house <e> <s> will he not agree that the statement begs as many questions as it answers <e> <s> above all does he realise that i find it astonishing that the secretary of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just two very short supplementaries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement that was made in another place <e> <s> is he aware that the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the government wish authorities to stand on their own feet <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the thames water authority is more profitable than either ici or marks and spencer and indeed has paid off all its past loans and is already able to contribute million a year to the government yet still needs to put up the cost by only per cent <e> <s> next year <e> <s> why are the government insisting that existing consumers pay for posterity and forcing the thames water authority to put up its charges by per cent <e> <s> next year <e>", "<cs> my lords since virtually everyone owns a television have the government considered whether it would not be in their interests and in the interests of everybody else to abolish the licence fee and pay the bbc from general taxation thus saving the considerable cost of collection of licence fees <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that his answers have been extremely helpful and sensitive to date <e> <s> however will he consider one particular aspect of the problem which militates against one-parent families particularly widows and women who have been deserted <e> <s> the difference between the threshold taxation allowance and the national insurance threshold is in that case <e> <s> it militates very hardly against widows and women who have been deserted by their husbands and who are trying to make ends meet <e> <s> will the noble earl ask the chancellor to give particular attention to that aspect of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in its evidence to the sizewell inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for his helpful reply <e> <s> will he confirm that incremental oil from a large existing oilfield could very well be equal to the total capacity of a new marginal field <e> <s> can he assure me that the government are keeping closely in touch with research and development into techniques to recover that substantial potential increment to our oil supplies and are addressing themselves to the problem of financial incentives to encourage the exploitation of incremental oil <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating in the form of a statement the answer given by his right honourable friend to the private notice question which was asked in another place <e> <s> i should also like to express appreciation of the tireless efforts of the tuc and in particular of norman willis to bring about an early settlement of this tragic and that is all that it can be called coal industry issue <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the option really now has been closed or would be closed if a pwr were constructed at sizewell <e> <s> has he noticed the fundamental disagreement between the sseb and the cegb over this issue <e> <s> the south of scotland electricity board maintains that if a pwr is built at sizewell that closes the option for agr with all that that means for our own industry <e> <s> did the noble lord also notice that over the weekend mr john baker on behalf of the cegb said that the cegb if granted permission to go ahead with pwrs was planning to build between three and five pwrs by the end of the century <e> <s> that would certainly close the option for the agr <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble viscount lord hanworth on asking this unstarred question tonight and for initiating the very well-informed debate that we have so far had on this important subject namely taxing pension schemes and contributions <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for his excellent explanation of the present position of pension schemes and his excellent exposition of the case against taxing them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for repeating the statement which was made in the other place <e> <s> while there will be a sense of relief that there is to be a return to work tomorrow does he not agree that a negotiated settlement would have been the best way to end this dispute both for the miners and for the industry <e> <s> if the noble earl does so agree why did the government not accept the proposal from the national union of mineworkers that it was prepared to sign and implement in full the nacods agreement when the secretary of state himself stated on th february that if the num wished to accept it it could have a settlement today or tomorrow <e> <s> is it not a fact that until the modified colliery review procedure is in operation all pits will remain open <e> <s> is he aware that only today the general secretary of nacods stated that the new procedure cannot be put in place until the num is party to the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for his full and clear explanation of the bill <e> <s> certainly the bill is designed to end a series of changes in the trustee savings bank movement changes which in fact began with the page report and which led to the act in which as the noble earl explained radically changed the operations of the tsbs <e> <s> these changes enabled the tsbs to expand their services and provide the conditions for a new dynamic in the movement which has been of great benefit to customers staff and the world of banking itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his reply but is it not possible for him now to confirm the press reports that up to the end of january the total additional cost of oil burning was million <e> <s> is it not possible by now to confirm that figure <e> <s> in the light of the chancellors statement on st july does the noble earl agree that the cost of the miners strike represented a worthwhile investment for the nation that the whole nation should bear the total cost of extra oil burnt and not just the electricity industry and electricity consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords would i be correct in thinking that on the trading account the national coal board does in fact break even but that it makes its losses through the enormous interest payments on capital account <e> <s> therefore is it not necessary and indeed overdue that there should be a capital reconstruction in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> may i say to him that i and indeed my colleagues are profoundly shocked by this utterly disgraceful statement <e> <s> on th december the minister spoke in the house of commons on the important and vital role of bnoc in securing and controlling the nations oil supplies yet a few weeks later the same minister comes forward in the house of commons and announces the abolition of the bnoc which he praised so highly in december <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to me the noble earl suggested that the report of the select committee went two-thirds of the way towards supporting the abolition of bnoc <e> <s> i really would ask him to reflect on that <e> <s> is it not a fact that the select committee did not consider abolition as an option <e> <s> from paragraphs and of the report it is quite clear that the select committee had no idea that bnoc should be abolished <e> <s> indeed the only criticism they make and they make no criticism as far as i can see of bnoc is criticism of the governments interference with bnoc which has made it difficult for it to carry out its task <e> <s> would the minister kindly comment on that <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what was said by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe when he moved the amendment <e> <s> i found his arguments very convincing and those arguments were expanded by my noble friend lord houghton of <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down there is one question which i should like to ask him arising from the noble earls statement about the position of the tsb scotland in relation to the sale of shares <e> <s> as i understood the minister he said that the tsb scotland would be able to sell shares to scottish shareholders <e> <s> perhaps he will correct me if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> the opposition do have a view on this <e> <s> i was about to put that view when the noble earl so stung by the remarks of my noble friend lord houghton bounded to his feet before i could get to mine <e> <s> now that i have the opportunity i would remind him that at second reading the view of the opposition was plainly put <e> <s> that view was that we preferred mutuality or would have preferred it had it been possible as a proper option <e> <s> that was what the opposition really wished to do and that was what the page committee recommended <e> <s> that is a real and preferred option of her majestys opposition <e>", "<cs> i was trying to follow the noble earls arithmetic and the discounting of hank shares <e> <s> surely the real position is this <e> <s> if after the flotation suddenly all the assets of the bank were sold would the shareholders not receive the value of those assets plus the money which they had invested through the shares and would they not therefore have the rather than the that the noble earl mentioned <e>", "<cs> that is right the minister did not refer it so there is no guarantee that he would refer it in the case of an attempt by foreigners to take over the tsb <e> <s> the minister could and in my own view should have referred this takeover to the monopolies and mergers commission but he did not do so <e> <s> the tsb plc is of course and i recognise this a kind of animal different from harrods but the only sure way of preventing it from being taken over by foreigners is to include a limiting provision in the bill and that is what i am seeking to do in this new clause <e> <s> time is getting on <e> <s> i commend the new clause to the committee and i shall certainly be very interested to learn what other noble lords have to say in particular the minister himself <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for dealing in detail with the proposed new clause <e> <s> it is a pity that he cannot provide more details about the priority that existing deposit holders will be offered by the board <e> <s> we believe as we argued at length this afternoon that they should be given substantial <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i say a few words <e> <s> i feel quite sure that my noble friend lord houghton will be most disappointed at the rejection of his amendment by the noble earl <e> <s> in my view it is an ingenious rational flexible wholly workable and desirable proposition for parliament to say to the tsb board that they ought to make some sort of provision for the deposit-holders and indeed for the staff to give them not only some priority but perhaps some little additional benefit <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will expect me to be very disappointed with his reaction to my new clause <e> <s> indeed i am very disappointed <e> <s> if we are to make progress in industrial democracy the lead has to be given from somewhere <e> <s> this appeared to me to be a great opportunity for parliament to say yes we do mean to go ahead with giving people a real say in the enterprise for which they work <e> <s> here was an enterprise as we have said <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absurd <e>", "<cs> tut tut <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> indeed i said at committee stage that i believed that the noble lord had put up a very convincing case <e> <s> he has elaborated on that case this afternoon and has made it in my view even stronger <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord will deal with some of the points that have been made notably by the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour and the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> there have been assertions from the noble baroness and the noble lord that people in scotland show no signs of wanting this amendment <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i recognise that point absolutely and in fact i think it probably is a case in favour of this amendment <e> <s> what the noble lord is in fact saying is that the scottish people are pretty canny financially that edinburgh is a great financial centre and that they are so canny that they can handle their business very well <e> <s> what the amendment seeks to do is to allow them to continue to do it independently <e> <s> the bill itself as i understand it will create the central board which will have its headquarters in london <e> <s> that board will not have its <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord jacques and indeed supported by other noble lords <e> <s> while i appreciate very well what the minister says that the trustees themselves will wish to decide where the charitable monies should go what my noble friend is seeking to do is to ensure that a given amount of money and a given number of shares are made available to the trustees in order that they will have a sure income from dividends paid on those shares which are to be paid to charities <e> <s> it seems to me that my noble friend is right to try to write this into the bill specifically because we have no way in spite of the assurances given by sir john read in his letter of knowing what level of support will be given by the new tsb plc to charitable organisations <e> <s> if it is written into the bill then of course we are laying down what will be a minimum to be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is very simple there is nothing like it and there never has been anything like it so we really cannot but put it in a different position from anything else because it is something entirely new something entirely unique <e> <s> we have no precedents to guide us no precedents to work to <e> <s> therefore i would have thought that we could introduce unique measures into this particular bill <e>", "<cs> until we pass the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i formally move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords is it now in order for me to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> it is i understand <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl go a little further and say that the question of british taxation is a matter for the british chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord boardman for introducing this debate which has been very wide-ranging and very interesting <e> <s> i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord vinson on a most excellent maiden speech <e> <s> his background and experience in commerce and industry are of course well known

sector and his recognition that service industries though important cannot substitute for manufacturing <e> <s> i enjoyed his speech which was an excellent one and i look forward to hearing more such speeches from him in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly they may give good services in many respects but all the evidence shows that it is necessary for investment to take place over a very much longer period that a much longer view should be taken of investment and that british financial institutions are not meeting that need at the present itme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i believe there have not been any consultations yet with the trade unions <e> <s> if that is so can i have the noble lords assurance that the trade unions will be included in the consultative process <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that he really does show a complete insensitivity in his replies <e> <s> is he further aware that on the same day as the chancellor of the exchequer announced that he was either to abolish or emasculate the wages councils which fix the pay of the lowest paid in our society ici announced on that same day that their chairman mr harvey-jones would have an increase in salary from to per annum a per cent <e> <s> increase or a per week increase <e> <s> is this not really offensive as my noble friend lord beswick has suggested especially when ordinary workers are being harangued by the government and the cbi to accept low wage increases to save jobs <e> <s> finally does it not apply similarly to those in high places that if they have large salaries their jobs might be in jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement which was made in another place <e> <s> first may i ask him this <e> <s> would it not be preferable in future if figures in statements relating to eec finance were given in pounds sterling which we all understand rather than in mecus which in fact we do not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for the pretty full way in which he has answered my question but there are a couple of points which i should like him to answer upon which he did not touch <e> <s> i asked him whether he could give the assurance that the euro assembly will not be allowed to determine how this million rebate will be spent <e> <s> i mean it in this sense <e> <s> i believe that rebate is the property of the british government and although i might not agree with the way they spend that money by god i uphold their right to spend it in accordance with our own constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the opposition understand the difficulties which the government have in this matter <e> <s> would he agree that in spite of what the noble lord lord ezra has said about sterling as a petro-currency the fact is that the world sees sterling as a petrocurrency and reacts accordingly <e> <s> is it not a fact that if we at this present time go into the ems the divergence limits will have to be very high indeed perhaps as high as per cent <e> <s> would he also say what he thinks the rate against the ecu would have to be if we entered the ems <e> <s> would it not have to be much lower than the present rate of ecus to the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl lord kinnoull for raising this very important and interesting question <e> <s> i must say having heard the debate so far that i feel a veritable daniel in a den of building society experts <e> <s> how i am going to deal with it i simply do not know <e> <s> nevertheless the discussion has certainly been a very learned one and we have all learnt from each other <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> it was not my intention to paint a black picture <e> <s> it was my intention to present the other side of the coin and i think it is right that it should be put <e> <s> of course i understand that initially only a small proportion of the total would be involved in unsecured finance <e> <s> but of course that proportion can and would be altered as suggested in the green paper by a simple statutory instrument and not by a bill <e> <s> therefore that proportion could easily be put up <e> <s> that is a danger which should be guarded against and about which we should have discussion when a bill comes forward <e> <s> but i understand the position as it is expressed in the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say on the question of underwriting that i do not think i referred specifically to the green paper but what the building societies themselves wanted <e> <s> indeed in the proposals from the building societies at i think <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all thank the noble lord for repeating in this house the statement that was made in another place <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that this statement has come as a very unwelcome surprise indeed shock to the opposition the gas industry and the general public <e> <s> it proves yet again that this government are prepared to squander the nations long-term assets for short-term political gain <e> <s> will not the governments proposals create a new private monopoly at the expense of the public <e> <s> can the noble lord say for what purpose and to what end it is being done <e> <s> will it introduce new competition into the gas industry <e> <s> what benefits will there be for consumers <e> <s> for example will gas prices be lower and will service to customers improve <e> <s> so far as i can see there is no evidence that customers will be better off indeed quite the reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that noble lords will forgive me if i ask a couple of short questions <e> <s> the noble lord has not told us from where in the absence of competition because this will be a private monopoly and bearing in mind that sir denis rooke has brought all the entrepreneurial drive and spirit that can be brought this is all coming under the new set-up <e> <s> as the noble lord has criticised the noble lord lord ezra as regards employee share ownership will he say how many employees of british telecom still hold shares in the undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what he has said makes the case for the continued public ownership of british gas <e> <s> is he not aware that the british gas corporation has been the most successful nationalised industry of all time and is making large profits part of which go to her majestys government <e> <s> is it not a fact that the only reason the government intend to privatise british gas is not to introduce competition but simply to get additional money about billion to finance their pre-election tax bonanza <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that his government increased the price of gas by per cent <e> <s> over three years above the retail price <e> <s> but is he now saying that the privatisation of gas will result in much cheaper prices for the gas consumer <e> <s> is he giving that promise now <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government give consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl mentioned that the government had received billion from the sale of assets but does he recall that british telecom was sold by the government for a total of billion <e> <s> the value of british telecom assets now on the stock exchange is billion <e> <s> the government have lost billion <e> <s> is that what they call good business <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i had the honour to represent swindon for a long period of time <e> <s> the news that swindon works is to close has come as a devastating blow to me as it has to the people of swindon <e> <s> is he further aware that this year the town will celebrate the th anniversary of the opening of swindon works <e> <s> tens of thousands of visitors from all over britain will go through the swindon works only to be told that there will be no st anniversary <e> <s> that is terribly sad and i hope the minister agrees <e> <s> that is another part of our heritage which has been destroyed by present policy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the same rules apply to the european community to protect the employment market <e> <s> does he not also believe bearing in mind the conflict there is over this problem that there should now be a new full-scale inquiry into the whole issue <e>", "<cs> tut tut my lords <e>", "<cs> and my lords on pubs and off-licences <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the amount of money in the economy that is cash in circulation and bank deposits is now expanding faster than the target rate of to per cent <e> <s> laid down in when the government in fact laid down their medium-term strategy <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that since then all sorts of things have been happening including mass unemployment and the highest rates of interest in any advanced country <e> <s> where in fact is the governments policy leading us and when can we expect a reduction in interest rates which would not only help home owners but also help our economy to expand as it should <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord for introducing the bill and for doing it so ably and succinctly <e> <s> of course even apart from the fact that this is a money bill the opposition would not dream of seeking to oppose it since without the financial provisions in the bill the coal industry would cease to operate <e> <s> the total amount estimated at over million is a large sum by any standards and represents just part of the enormous costs arising from the coal industry dispute which itself was a tragedy for the industry for the miners themselves and for the taxpayers as a whole who are now being called upon to foot the bill for a dispute that need never have happened and should not have been allowed to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i appreciate that things have small beginnings and certainly we do not want a waste of public money <e> <s> but it is the way the scheme is seen by the miners and people outside that is important <e> <s> if the government are seen to be looking at the thing as small scale then of course industry will look at it in that way <e> <s> what i and i think also the noble lord lord diamond were asking for was an absolute commitment by the government that if this scheme gets off the ground and if people are interested in going to and have been attracted to the coal industries it will not founder for lack of government support and government money <e> <s> that is what we were asking for <e> <s> i would hope the noble lord could give us that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i wonder whether he would in some way deal with the point i raised about the miners being dismissed and not reinstated <e> <s> that is an important matter and i think it requires some reply from him <e>", "<cs> it was sir winston churchill my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that lord mishcon cannot be here tonight since he has of course had a great deal to do with this bill and so far as concerns the opposition has piloted it through <e> <s> but he is engaged elsewhere and therefore i must do my humble best to deal with this very important amendment <e> <s> it is an important amendment there is no doubt about that <e> <s> i really wonder whether the amendment can in fact be supported because it seems to me that if we are not careful we will put voting of people abroad on a ratchet <e> <s> we agreed to an amendment at committee stage <e> <s> we now have another amendment and one wonders just how far we can take this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had very much to do with the bill until tonight but i know that my noble friend lord mishcon would wish me to say a few words at this stage and to agree with the noble lord that this is indeed an important measure which makes great improvements in our electoral arrangements <e> <s> many people will benefit from them <e> <s> i think that it is altogether good although perhaps there has been a little criticism tonight that when we propose to make changes in electoral law and arrangements they should as far as possible be on an agreed basis <e> <s> i think that any other way would make for conflict and unnecessary conflict <e> <s> it is the beauty of our constitution that we endeavour to get agreement about such arrangements <e> <s> i accept the criticism of the noble lord lord harris tonight of my position <e> <s> after all i am a newcomer to the bill <e>", "<cs> talking down british industry my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was careful in what he said about continued engine manufacturing by british leyland <e> <s> however am i correct in believing that what he is actually saying is that there will be no diminution of engine manufacture by british leyland <e> <s> can he also say whether local content means what he actually said that is that it will be british content and not ec content <e> <s> he will recall that the nissan deal was made for per cent <e> <s> local content but that meant ec and not british content <e> <s> does he really mean that there will be per cent <e> <s> or more british content and not ec content <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that point is clarified <e> <s> the noble lord interrupted me in mid-sentence but for his sake perhaps i may start again the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his reply to the amendment and for clarifying the position in relation to the secretary of state <e> <s> i understood that it would not be simply the secretary of state for the environment who would be imposing his will but that it would be a bunch of people <e> <s> but nevertheless they would be under the same instruction from the cabinet that they must in their various departments rigorously impose rate capping on the new authorities <e> <s> i think that we understood that but i am not at all sure whether it helps <e> <s> i do not know whether i should prefer to have one to deal with or a bunch of them <e> <s> i think the new authorities may well find that their difficulties will be very much compounded by having to deal with a succession of secretaries of state rather than with one <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness is one of the guardians of the purse in the glc she ought to be able to answer that question far better than i can <e> <s> but rates generally have gone up in this country and in the glc because the government have as i said reduced their grant from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> if the withdrawal to the tune of per cent <e> <s> about million in total has not affected the level of local rates what on earth has <e> <s> local government has been far more successful in containing its expenditure than central government as the noble lord knows to his cost <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that as usual my noble friend lord shinwell is on a good point and is very forward looking <e> <s> is not what he is saying that coal is not only for burning and that with our oil resources depleting at quite a sharp rate by now is the time to invest in research not only into liquefaction and gasification but also in respect of getting the by-products of coal which of course when oil runs out will be much more expensive and worthwhile producing from coal <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can say that in the legislation to be brought forward there will be protection especially in the matter of unsecured loans for people who actually want to borrow money <e> <s> can the noble lord also say whether there will be protection for small societies against takeover by large societies <e> <s> will he also say whether there will be provisions in the bill to provide for better democracy within the building society movement <e>", "<cs> my lords what do the scots have that the english do not <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that when the trustee savings bank bill originally came to this house there was little expectation that it would leave this house so amended <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for explaining the current position and i have to say from the point of view of the opposition that we are far more satisfied with the bill as it leaves this place than we were when it came here <e> <s> we explained our position from this bench particularly in relation to tsb scotland and i am now satisfied as is the noble lord lord taylor that the position in relation to scotland and the other tsb banks is much more secure and independent than it would have been under the original bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> obviously the noble lord has seen the remarks of sir walter marshall to whom we shall give a warm welcome to this house on th july <e> <s> does the minister not think it rather unwise if the government have had no discussions with the chairman of the industry for that chairman to advocate the privatisation of the electricity supply industry bearing in mind that this is a highly contentious political issue <e> <s> perhaps he would like to take the chairman gently by the arm and advise him of that fact <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to state once again categorically that there will be no legislation during the present parliament to privatise the whole of the electricity supply industry or any part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not a totally unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> bearing in mind the speculation which has been rife over the last two or three weeks about the nuclear power programme anything up to nuclear power stations have been envisaged by the turn of the century and figures given to the nuclear energy agency imply that per cent <e> <s> of electricity will be generated by nuclear power by the year <e> <s> those are the projections which have been given to the agency <e> <s> can the noble lord say why it is that parliament and the people cannot be given similar projections <e> <s> can i also ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is an important question <e> <s> i am usually very short in my questions but i have a further question to ask and i hope the chief whip will allow me to ask it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are aware that the government have not said that they are going to build nuclear power stations but that their projections have fuelled <e>", "<cs> there is my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that i am in great demand this evening <e> <s> that is something <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a very long intervention by the noble baroness and an interesting one <e> <s> the position of the british forces is surely that they are serving her majestys government and indeed they are serving her majesty <e> <s> they are not serving the community as such or any other body <e> <s> they are serving her majesty <e> <s> they are in quite a separate and different position <e> <s> in regard to the other officials they serve the community and they do so for their career purposes and prospects but nevertheless they have decided to take that career to earn their living in another country and have no intention of coming home to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the five-year limitation applies and they will be entitled to vote for five years <e> <s> i think i am right <e> <s> it is only if they decide to absent themselves from this country for a period of longer than five years that they would lose their vote <e> <s> i think that that is the true position <e> <s> i do not think that i have misunderstood it at all and i hope that the noble lord lord tordoff agrees <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not totally untrue <e> <s> if you read the record you will find that it shows that <e> <s> as i said at report stage in this house it is far better that alterations to electoral arrangements are made with a large measure of agreement and although your lordships may very well have been perfectly entitled to express a view as indeed you did over votes for british employees of the ec institutions it would in my view be unwise and perhaps improper to insist <e>", "<cs> yes perhaps improper to insist on that view in the face of the overwhelming opposition of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord wanted me to get up and to have my say <e> <s> now let me have my say <e> <s> how about that <e> <s> the noble lord will have his turn in a minute <e> <s> i have to say this <e> <s> i have to remind the sdp and the liberal benches that during the bills passage through the commons neither the liberal party nor the sdp proposed any amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it was responded to by my own party certainly but we are talking at the moment about the liberals and the sdp because the liberal party in the form of the noble lord lord tordoff has taken up the cudgels tonight and therefore we are entitled to examine their record on the issue we have examined just one part of it <e> <s> we know that in the house of commons they sat back and did nothing about this great cause they are espousing tonight <e> <s> i repeat neither the liberals nor the sdp did anything about it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it would be absurd for this house to press its point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in spite of his doubts about the norwegian figures they claim to be producing energy from wave power at less than p per unit <e> <s> is it not conceivable and is it not possible that in orkney shetland and the west of ireland we could be producing energy from wave power at less than p a unit <e> <s> will the noble lord look at this <e>", "<cs> i must say that until i heard the minister speaking i had absolutely no intention of saying anything at all on this clause or on any amendment <e> <s> but the fact is that having at one time been the chairman of a municipal passenger transport undertaking in reading i know that what the noble lord has said is simply not true and it is not true for this reason <e>", "<cs> if i have offended the minister i will of course apologise <e> <s> but let me say that i know from experience that what he is saying does not really apply <e> <s> the district council authorities which run bus undertakings are perfectly able with their present organisation and without being hived off into separate bodies to do the job that is required of them in this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord sandford has asked i hope that the minister and the government will look at this problem once again <e> <s> it is a serious matter <e> <s> i believe that the government are wrong <e> <s> there is time for <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be brief for two reasons <e> <s> first of all many of the points that are to be made have already been made and i do not want to bore your lordships with tedious repetition <e> <s> the other reason is that i intend to speak in the debate following this one and therefore the sooner we come on to it the better pleased i shall be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord gray of contin for explaining concisely and succinctly the bill which is now before us <e> <s> he did so very briefly indeed and i suppose that should commend itself to the house bearing in mind that the bill came before your lordships at five minutes past seven rather than at three oclock this afternoon <e> <s> quite clearly the house felt that a debate on the televising of the proceedings of the house was more important than a major bill of this sort <e> <s> that is something which i very much regret and i hope that the noble lord lord gray of contin will join me in that regret <e>", "<cs> that is right my lords the cameras are away <e> <s> we now know the degree of importance and the priorities which the television media give to the work of this house but that perhaps is something for another day <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the commons amendments in fact take care of the agreement which was set out in the written answer to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe on the th july and i think we can be satisfied that the assurances that were given have in fact been met <e> <s> but i am wondering whether it would be in order for me to raise with the noble lord a new factor which seems to have arisen since the matter was discussed in your lordships house and indeed was referred to during the commons debate on the lords amendments <e> <s> it arises from a letter which i have received and which no doubt other noble lords have received from mr mungo bovey <e> <s> perhaps i may quote some passages from his letter <e> <s> he writes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one further question <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble earl for that explanation which was most useful <e> <s> i know nothing at all about scottish law <e> <s> i do not know how long courts take to make decisions <e> <s> presumably no action would be taken to issue shares in advance of the courts decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i have left my contribution until rather late to hear what other people had to say particularly my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i am somewhat surprised that he is taking the line that he is <e> <s> if he will recall when he correctly stated that the bank belonged to its depositors he received a great deal of support <e> <s> he had support from me that is certain and from other quarters of the house as well certainly on this side <e> <s> to say that because he has not had representation from the depositors and perhaps the staff of the trustee savings bank does not necessarily mean that they are not particularly interested in what happens to them <e>", "<cs> my lords they did not seek to oppose it <e> <s> it may well have been that they thought they would lose but that is another matter <e> <s> the fact is that there was not a division <e> <s> the amendment sought i think quite rightly to give depositors and staff an interest a real interest in the new organisation <e> <s> i believe that was correct and indeed i have a particular interest in this amendment because as a result of its passing i did not move my amendment no <e> <s> at report stage which would have sought to have given representation to the workers on the central board and on each individual board of the trustee savings bank <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he expects soon that the growth in jobs will overtake the destruction of jobs <e> <s> in those circumstances will he tell us just exactly when there will be a significant reduction in the unemployed total <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i was in swindon last friday and that what i found in swindon was bitter anger at the ministers decision to veto a properly-constituted appointment <e> <s> is she further aware that as a result of the veto the morale of the staff has been very badly <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make too much of this but i hope the minister will take on board what i have said about the need to ensure that this new agency is held in proper public esteem and that it also has the confidence of the staff <e> <s> certainly no criticism is implied of mr dunkerley <e> <s> we are aware that he is a man of very high calibre and i have no doubt that he will perform the functions well <e> <s> nevertheless in an agency of this sort which has an important role to play now and perhaps it will be even more important in the future we believe it would have been wise to have appointed a full-time chairman <e> <s> however in the light of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps i have been guilty of misleading the committee to some degree because what i should have said at the beginning was that perhaps it would be convenient to take amendments nos <e> <s> and together indeed that may very well be so <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure that mr dunkerley will be very pleased to be told that he is heading a quango <e> <s> quangos have a very bad name <e> <s> i thought that the agency was something other than a quango <e> <s> let me say to the noble earl lord lauderdale that we in the labour party do not agree and indeed the noble lord lord lloyd concurs that there should be more quangos than necessary <e> <s> the government and the noble lord lord gray say that this government have been trying to get rid of quangos <e> <s> but i have to remind the noble lord that we have only just passed a bill which is now the local government act and which will set up a whole new range of real quangos <e> <s> so please do not let the noble earl lord lauderdale preach to me about quangos when he went through the lobbies in this house voting for them right and left during the whole of the summer <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment but i have to say that i do not think we have been unreasonable in proposing that the agency should consist of a maximum number of five members <e> <s> there are a lot of interests and specialities in oil and in the north sea in particular and it was our view which is why we moved the amendment that we should have an agency with sufficiently wide expertise to be able to look after the needs of the agency the interests of the government and indeed the interests of this nation <e> <s> however the noble lord together with several other noble lords has taken a different view <e> <s> i think that on balance and it is only on balance we are right but in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will agree that it might be convenient to take his amendment together with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am most obliged to the noble lord for the way in which he has dealt with this amendment <e> <s> he has dealt with it in a reasonable and sensitive manner <e> <s> i am also grateful for the information which he has given to the house about the developments over the past two months of which i have to confess i was unaware <e> <s> i should very much like to look at what he has said because i think it was very important indeed and i should therefore like to withdraw the amendment so that i can consider what he has said in the light of cold print and in the light of the time which we shall now have available between this and the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will agree that it will be convenient to take my amendment no <e> <s> with his amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak only briefly to amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am still not clear what sort of

<e>", "<cs> my amendments nos <e> <s> and cover a similar point <e> <s> the amendment no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure whether the minister was giving me assurances or whether he was not <e> <s> as i understand it despite clause <e>", "<cs> frankly that is what worries me <e> <s> the noble lord talks about the agency making losses on trading on its own account <e> <s> on the other hand of course it could make profits on trading on its own account <e> <s> it is not the law of the medes and persians that the agency would make losses <e> <s> it may well be that bnoc made a few losses at the behest of the government over the past months but the fact is and i am sure that the minister must agree that to make the agency really viable it needs to have some opportunity to trade in order that it can make up these cargoes <e>", "<cs> obviously the noble earl does not <e> <s> he likes it here so much that he is prepared to stay throughout the recess but i have some things to do at home <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to study closely what the minister has said <e> <s> i remain unhappy about this probe and so does the opposition <e> <s> i shall need to consider this matter

the noble lord has said <e> <s> this is a complicated issue and i accept that it is a complicated issue <e> <s> on the other hand it is in the interests of the united kingdom to have a refining capacity as high as possible on many counts not only from the point of view of the security of the united kingdom but because of the issue of jobs <e> <s> it is all very well to talk about the premium on north sea oil and the premium we get when we sell it abroad but if by doing so we kill more and more jobs in britain then part of that benefit is not available <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord said and i understand some of the difficulties <e> <s> however i should like to reconsider this matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is at least one matter on which the noble lord and i can agree this afternoon and that concerns the notable contributions which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has made to our deliberations <e> <s> they have been excellent and helpful and the committee is very grateful to him for his participation <e>", "<cs> my lords i find what the noble lord has said very interesting <e> <s> is he really telling us that once this bill is passed the secretary of state will set down the framework in which the agency operates in respect of buying this type of oil to make up cargoes <e> <s> is he saying that the secretary of state will set the framework once and for all and thereafter the agency will be free on a day to day month to month and year by year basis to operate as it thinks fits <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is telling us <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that the noble lord has clarified it <e> <s> in fact what he has done is to confirm that the best way to act would be by accepting the amendment which is before the house <e> <s> that in fact would achieve in a very easy and understandable way the objectives which apparently he seeks to achieve <e> <s> but as i understand it as the bill reads at the present time there will always be the power of the secretary of state indeed the necessity for the secretary of state to have his finger in every relevant pie

minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am concerned that reply is completely unsatisfactory <e> <s> there is a deep division between the noble lord and myself on this matter <e> <s> it is quite clear that he is prepared to rely entirely on the commercial operations of the oil companies to safeguard our oil supplies <e> <s> we believe that the government need an arm with which to ensure security of supplies <e> <s> because we believe that this is absolutely vital to the nations economic survival even and to the interests of our people i feel obliged to press this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for the further information which he has given to us i think that we shall find it most useful when we read it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord for that information and his reassurance <e> <s> in the light of those assurances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will withdraw the amendment but i must say that i still remain a little unhappy <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord has been able to completely reassure me on the point and i am not at all sure that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will be reassured when he reads the noble lords remarks in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank the noble earl lord bessborough for raising such an important subject at the present time and also for his kindness of giving me an indication of his direction and thinking on the questions before us tonight <e> <s> he has had this item on the agenda for as long as i have been a member of this house and i think that we should commend his persistence and his patience and i sincerely hope that he feels that his persistence and patience have been well rewarded by the excellent debate of such super quality that we have had tonight <e> <s> i should like also to thank dr pease director for fusion at culham laboratory for his unstinting assistance and i can assure your lordships that without that assistance i would have been quaking in my shoes rather more than i am at the moment bearing in mind the subject in hand and bearing in mind that quite obviously i am a layman in a den of scientific lions <e>", "<cs> my lords press it and give us a chance to test the mood of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree with his right honourable friends remark in relation to the coal conversion industry that what we and the government are in support of at the moment is in his words todays coal for tommorrows industry <e> <s> in those circumstances is the investment in the coal industry not very well spent and therefore should not be criticised by his noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words before we actually pass this dreadful bill <e> <s> first however i should like to thank the noble lord lord gray for his courtesy during all stages of the bill <e> <s> that is probably the last nice thing i shall say about him <e> <s> nevertheless he has been courteous and all those who have taken part will i am sure wish to thank him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken part in many debates on ec matters in another place but i think that this is probably the first time i have taken part in such a debate in this house <e> <s> i must say that in another place the interest in the subject appears to be very low <e> <s> why that is i really do not know <e> <s> perhaps it is because the problems which we face in relation to the ec particularly in relation to finance are such that the honourable members in another place cannot grasp the detail and become rather bored but the attendance in your lordships house today is rather better than i had expected <e> <s> i think that is altogether good because the more people who know about the ec and the implications of the ec not only for finance and not only in relation to our own budget but in relation to the sovereignty of this nation the better it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just finish this point <e> <s> not only have we seen that but the british government when negotiating this agreement threw away a very good negotiating position by failing to tie the agreement on own resources with proper financial control and reform of the cap <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard my noble friend agree with all the reservations in the report which is a very good one of our own committee but nevertheless he paid tribute to the report and said that he thought generally the fontainebleau agreement was a reasonable one <e> <s> i happen in the most kindly and friendly way to disagree with my noble friends view on that for the reasons that i have just given <e>", "<cs> my lords spain and portugal are now exactly where they always have been <e> <s> in my opinion we would have been in a much better position to help those two countries which i agree were new young democracies if we were not within the straitjacket of the ec and in particular the cap <e> <s> but as i have already said we are disappointed with this agreement <e> <s> we do not believe that it solves any of the problems which face the community <e> <s> it does not in any way solve the problem of the runaway inflation of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> it is not permanent <e> <s> the government will be back again asking for more money very shortly <e> <s> i sincerely hope that when they come back as they surely will unless the noble lord can give the assurance which i ask for this house will then remember this debate and parliament will say so much no more <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord in danger of being fooled by his own propaganda <e> <s> is it not a fact that the reason for the sharp rise in this large pool of unemployment since is that the government themselves by imposing swingeing increases in taxes increasing health charges and other charges and cutting down on public expenditure have deliberately created it <e> <s> is not that the real reason <e> <s> will not the noble lord accept what my noble friend lord stallard said namely that the way in which to cure unemployment the way in which to get unemployment down below million and my noble friend lord shinwell is absolutely right in saying that any unemployment is unacceptable is to increase expenditure on infrastructure housing roads and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all thank the noble lord for making his statement to the house today <e> <s> i suppose he should really be congratulated on making two very long and major statements in quick succession <e> <s> in actual fact the government are making him do two jobs instead of one <e> <s> they are not helping the unemployment position very much by that and i hope that the noble lord is not becoming a jack-of-all-trades <e> <s> we had expected him to bring forth a lion in his statement but in fact he has produced a mouse <e> <s> i have to say that the opposition is very disappointed and indeed very worried about some of the measures which he has proposed today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back on this matter but i shall be very brief <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what has happened in british telecom where the domestic consumers are being asked to pay much more can we expect the same kind ofthing to happen in the gas industry when the gas industry is privatised <e> <s> are the domestic consumers to be expected to suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement made in another place but it sounds to me as though there is a great rustling of chickens coming home to roost <e> <s> in this house i and other noble lords raised the question of legality at various stages of the bill <e> <s> indeed right at the last when the commons amendments were being considered by this house i and other noble lords again raised the whole question as to whether the bill was really legal <e> <s> we argued all the way through that the trustee savings banks belonged to the depositors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back again <e> <s> i understand appreciate and accept that the government will want time to think about this but would the noble lord assure me that when <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank the noble lord lord gray of contin for explaining the bill for doing it so well and indeed for explaining the background of the nuclear industry itself <e> <s> i am sure the house will have found that most helpful i certainly did <e> <s> but i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i say that the opposition is rather suspicious of this bill <e> <s> it is quite true that it is a small bill but it is a very important one as the noble lord said <e> <s> the bill itself seems innocent and innocuous enough yet so far as the opposition is concerned behind its seemingly mundane provisions there could lurk serious problems and dangers for the continued existence of the aea as an independent body advising the government on a wide range of nuclear matters ensuring safety in nuclear matters and keeping britain in the forefront of underlying research <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that i asked the noble lord to give an assurance that the aea would never be privatised <e> <s> however i asked whether he would give the assurance specifically that it would not be privatised during the lifetime of this parliament or for the foreseeable future <e> <s> can the noble lord give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way again and i am sorry to have to pursue this <e> <s> nevertheless as far as i can see at a quick glance the present assets amount to about million <e> <s> is that the kind of figure that is to be used or is it to be higher or lower <e> <s> indeed if that is the figure that is to be used does it not mean on a per cent <e> <s> return that the authority will virtually have a surcharge of million from the outset <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the government and the minister being completely complacent in this matter <e> <s> is it not a fact that their so-called regional policy helps absolutely nobody <e> <s> it does not help those in the north where unemployment is high <e> <s> neither does it help those in the south where infrastructure arrangements are breaking down and housing costs are going through the roof <e> <s> would it not be as well if the government had a regional plan and devoted sufficient resources to creating real jobs where those jobs are needed <e>", "<cs> the minister need not feel sorry for me my lords <e>", "<cs> they are absolutely true my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate that there is some confusion now as to what is voluntary and what is not voluntary <e> <s> is it not a fact that between april and april claims were disallowed due to young people not accepting a place on the youth training scheme <e> <s> we are talking about that scheme <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord if that is the case whether the same rules will apply to the new job counselling scheme <e> <s> if people refuse to be counselled under this new scheme are they too going to lose benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to the dispatch box but can the noble lord answer my second question about the job counselling scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords surely my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> is it not a fact that the government are removing urban aid assistance from a great part of the country parts which have very serious problems though perhaps not on the scale of those suffered by the well-known inner city areas <e> <s> is there not a danger that by such assistance being removed people living in those particular inner city areas up and down the country will become alienated <e> <s> will there not be a risk of further troubles across a wider area of our nation <e> <s> if i am not mistaken t hat is the point which my noble friend was making <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house what the total installed capacity of oil-fired power stations is at present and what proportion of that capacity is used at any given period throughout the year <e> <s> i hope that he will check his figures of million for conversion from oil to coal <e> <s> but does he agree that in any event it is far better to have the stations converted instead of standing idle so that they may at least partly earn their keep <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not answer my question about the installed capacity of oil-fired stations <e>", "<cs> my lords the easiest and most pleasant duty i have to perform tonight is to congratulate the noble lord lord clitheroe on his excellent and apposite maiden speech today <e> <s> we were interested to learn of the experience he had in his early days <e> <s> he will know that had he lived in japan his tutors there would have described him because he wanted to go into industry as a first-class and honoured student <e> <s> perhaps that is the reason why japan is doing so well and we are doing to badly in manufacturing terms <e> <s> the speech was excellent and i sincerely hope we shall hear from the noble lord on many occasions in this house not only on this subject but on many others as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to that point in a moment <e> <s> of course there has to be balance although as it happens and indeed this has been mentioned the japanese appear to be able to run a trading surplus of about million a year and it does not hurt them at all <e> <s> it does not hurt them first because they have invested heavily in their own industry and are therefore able to export goods and capital as well <e> <s> they are able in fact to do both <e> <s> we are doing only one <e> <s> we have exported some million worth of capital but unfortunately we have not ploughed the capital into our manufacturing industry which gives us the other side of the equation in other words a strong manufacturing industry as well <e> <s> but as i say i shall deal with that point in a moment <e>", "<cs> it is per cent <e> <s> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord young of graffham for explaining the order so succinctly <e> <s> i have to say that the labour party has no reason to oppose this order <e> <s> indeed we welcome it since it continues in operation an industrial training board which as the noble lord has said is essential to the continued training of good craftsmen in the building and construction industry <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble viscount lord thurso and the noble lord lord ezra for their support on this group of amendments <e> <s> it is quite clear that the idea of public dividend capital has many friends <e> <s> i think we must listen very closely to the noble lord lord ezra because he has been the head of a very large nationalised industry and has experienced first-hand the difficulties which arise under existing arrangements and the type of arrangements under which the aea will be expected to work in the future <e> <s> since the noble lord lord ezra is supporting them these ideas have to be taken seriously <e>", "<cs> i also have two amendments in this group but as i explained they relate to my previous group of amendments on public dividend capital <e> <s> i think that the noble viscount lord thurso has a point and i must say that i remain puzzled as to exactly what burden will be placed upon the authority <e>", "<cs> not quite <e> <s> may i ask one question so that i am absolutely clear in my mind <e> <s> the authority will be required to pay per cent <e> <s> on the million which is approximately million a year and then at shall we say per cent <e> <s> which i believe is the going rate on the national loans fund it would pay that per cent <e> <s> on million <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> in other words it would be about million in addition to the million <e>", "<cs> we must get this straight otherwise the authority will find itself paying enormous sums <e> <s> will the authority be required to pay interest on the million as well as on the million or is it million in total or does it have to earn a return of per cent on million and pay the going rate on million of that <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i rather think that it is <e> <s> if only he would say it we should understand <e> <s> we simple mortals understand only arithmetic and not mathematics <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> that is the answer i was looking for <e> <s> i now assume that if that target rate is met it will be possible for the authority to plough the money back into its own operations <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> good <e> <s> that is what we wanted to know <e>", "<cs> it would not work <e>", "<cs> i think that the best plan is not to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied with that reply and i am not inclined to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> it is quite true that employees at aea are not opposed to the trading fund concept <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have had such a negative response from the noble lord <e> <s> i always try to be helpful to the government <e> <s> i note that mynoble friend is not here <e> <s> i was told off by him for saying that i always try to be helpful to the government and here i am again trying to be helpful to the government <e> <s> all that we really want is to lay as much information before parliament as we can <e> <s> i said at the outset that some of us are concerned that people misunderstand the nuclear industry what nuclear energy does the dangers from it and what-have-you <e> <s> i should have thought that it could have been just a little gesture to the public for the government to say we want to be as open as possible <e> <s> i am sure that the aea does <e> <s> so why not lay this plan before parliament so that people can examine it <e> <s> after all if they want to answer a question or two why should they not <e> <s> that is what parliament is about <e>", "<cs> what can i do except express surprise that the noble lord is not prepared to <e>", "<cs> naturally i am disappointed <e> <s> noble lords will understand that but in the light of the noble lords assurance i take it as an assurance that really the government would wish to have somebody with a possible interest only in the most exceptional circumstances i think the best thing i can do is not to proceed with the amendment <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord ezra and the noble viscount lord thurso for their support for this amendment <e> <s> i do not intend to press it i will say that because i think it would be unwise to press it at this stage <e> <s> nevertheless it is true and the noble lord lord ezra in particular knows this because we had the pleasure and the work incidentally of serving together on the select committee for overseas trade which i have already mentioned once <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> we shall need to study what has been said by the noble lord lord gray this afternoon <e> <s> i believe the noble lord went a little further than he did at second reading <e> <s> i do not know for certain because it is difficult by just listening to what someone is saying to gather everything that they mean <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord means well <e> <s> nevertheless i shall want to read what he said because i believe that he has gone further with his assurances than he did at second reading <e> <s> so as to enable me and other noble lords to read <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for that very full answer to the question <e> <s> would he agree that these sums of money are quite enormous <e> <s> is he aware that a great deal of concern is being expressed that the cegb is anticipating the result of the inquiry which i understand is likely to be delayed <e> <s> can he further explain to me and to the house just exactly what would happen in relation to these hundreds of millions of pounds if by chance the inquiry came down against the project <e> <s> would that money be written off or what would happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back on this but can the minister confirm that the amount of money which will be expended and written off will amount to about per cent <e> <s> of the total estimated cost of the construction of the whole power station <e> <s> can he say whether if that money has to be written off the electricity consumers or the government will pay <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who at the present time lives in the area under discussion i ask the noble lord to reconsider his attitude <e> <s> there is a good deal of disquiet in both burghfield and aldermaston at the present time to the extent even that property values are being affected <e> <s> will the minister also say because there is worry about this too whether there is any problem in reading <e> <s> reading is the first point of extraction of water from the river thames and million gallons a day are taken <e> <s> therefore public concern goes wider than burghfield and aldermaston <e> <s> i urge the minister to allay the fears of those living in those areas by holding some kind of inquiry if not a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to speak for very long at this stage of the bill but i should like to say that during the second reading and committee stage we were able to probe the governments thinking particularly in regard to their future intentions relating to privatisation and we were very glad to receive some of the assurances which the noble lord lord gray gave us <e> <s> indeed i feel that we have now firmly established that the government are in complete agreement with the opposition that the aea by the nature of its operations is quite unsuitable for privatisation and therefore in the foreseeable future there is no intention to privatise the authority in whole or in part <e> <s> i would certainly welcome confirmation of this from the noble lord lord gray when he winds up the debate this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister received any indication that there will be any further slippage from the date of early spring which he gave me on th december <e> <s> secondly if there is a delay will there be any further expenditure on the pwr over and above the million that has already been committed by the cegb to this project in advance of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that there is a danger that certain large users will take their manufacturing capacity out of the country and move to where they can get cheaper electricity unless there is some arrangement in this country <e> <s> can he also confirm that if there is an agreement between the ncb and the cegb the government will put no obstruction in the way <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend was not giving it a welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this debate and should like to thank the noble lord lord ezra for raising this important issue at this time <e> <s> i have to say to him that i agree entirely with what he said <e> <s> i shall say some of the same things in my own way during the course of my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that it was not a question of political knock-about <e> <s> the financing of r d programmes is a political matter and i approached it in that manner <e> <s> the reason the research and development programme is not satisfactory so

should feel that it is political knock-about <e> <s> he should not be so sensitive <e> <s> perhaps he is smarting from last night and his bout with <e>", "<cs> my lords the other place is of course different from this house and there are all sorts of opportunities there by means of points of order by means of questions to the prime minister by means of questions on next weeks business and by means of standing order no <e> <s> to raise the issue <e> <s> in this house no such opportunities are available <e> <s> nevertheless the secretary of state is the boss of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just finish this point <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this is a really serious and difficult problem in that peoples heating needs in fact differ and the ideal is that heating arrangements should be adequate comfortable and indeed controlled <e> <s> i very much agree with what the noble lord said in his reply to his noble friend lord campbell of croy but can he say whether the government policy of restricting local government expenditure and indeed central government expenditure is preventing the installation of modern heating systems with up-to-date efficient control systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> will he pay some attention to the fact that many local authorities seem to be under the impression that if they use capital resources in improving heating they will have to reduce capital expenditure on other services <e> <s> there seems to be that point of view in local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> may i ask whether the noble lord does not believe that in fact we are now on a long-term decline in oil prices <e> <s> may i ask also whether he recalls the statement to the house of commons by the right honourable david howell on th january when he announced that domestic gas prices would be increased by per cent <e> <s> per annum over and above the rate of inflation over three years on the basis that the policy of the british gas corporation endorsed by the government was to sell gas at a price broadly related to that of the competing oil product <e> <s> further since in the price of oil was between and dollars a barrel but is now only to dollars a barrel should not the price of gas be reduced by per cent <e> <s> similarly should not the price of coal be cut to keep it competitive with oil for the generation of electricity and other steam-raising activities <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord reply briefly to this <e> <s> i think he just did not get the point i was making which was that when oil prices went up to dollars a barrel the government forced up the price of gas i want to know whether the government will force down the price of gas since oil prices have halved <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for making his statement this afternoon <e> <s> however the measures contained in it do not in any way meet the urgent need to tackle the desperate and growing problem of unemployment particularly in respect of those who have been out of work for over a year <e> <s> it is surprising that the response to last months shocking unemployment figures should be that statement

manufacturing and sourcing intentions of gm <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned twice in his answers that gm already had per cent <e> <s> united kingdom content <e> <s> is that what the government are thinking about <e> <s> i would remind him that nissan has given an undertaking of per cent <e> <s> united kingdom content <e> <s> does united kingdom content mean united kingdom content or ec content

<s> is he now sorry that bnoc was disbanded <e> <s> if bnoc was still available at least the government would have some input in relation to talks with opec <e> <s> does the noble lord think that it is a profligate waste of this countrys resources that we should be selling oil now at dollars a barrel and over-producing it when in the s oil will probably be double that price <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to the dispatch box but the noble lord has not yet explained why he thinks that it is good policy to maximise the output of north sea oil at a time when the price is at its lowest rather than to conserve the north sea oil over a much longer period of time when the price is likely to be very much higher in the long term <e> <s> that is the question we asked and we have not yet had the answer <e> <s> can the noble lord give that to us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i and the opposition front bench also welcome the improvement in productivity to tonnes per man shift <e> <s> but is he aware that mr macgregor has now upped the target figure to five tonnes per man shift and is threatening if that figure is not reached to close more collieries

structured and on training in modern skills leading to qualifications and permanent employment <e> <s> now will he <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but this is a question which is important and which i feel sure the noble lord lord young <e>", "<cs> will wish to answer <e> <s> therefore i hope i shall be allowed to ask it without interruption <e> <s> will the noble lord consider whether there is some difficulty about the attitude of young black people to the scheme <e> <s> this is important <e> <s> will he also ensure that they too feel that they are part of the scheme and can take advantage of it <e>", "<cs> or march hares <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his statement although i must note that this had to be forced from him by my honourable friend john

not be made and the reply was given that they could not be made because it would not be fair <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord of course respects the cbi but is he aware that the cbi has also suggested to the government that in the forthcoming budget they should make more money available directly for creating new jobs rather than for funding tax cuts <e> <s> are the government going to take that into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that outside italy the unemployment rate in this country is the highest in the western industrial world <e> <s> is it not also a fact that since the last general election jobs have been lost <e> <s> in other words there are fewer people at work than there were in <e> <s> may i once again ask the noble lord to ensure that he puts the point of view to the government before the budget that what we want is not individual tax cuts but action on unemployment direct action <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we are concerned

the pumps <e>", "<cs> my lords but does not the noble lord agree that this is an important aspect of energy policy <e> <s> is it not a fact that the french are using this country to dump some of their over-capacity <e> <s> does not he also agree that it would be most unfortunate for security of supply if we made too many of these arrangements <e> <s> it would be bad not only for our own electricity industry but also for the construction and engineering industries in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will surely agree that it would be unrealistic to see this as a two-year agreement

was made by the noble lord against the labour party and a labour government whom he accused of dragging their feet on the installation of nuclear power <e> <s> may i remind the noble lord that it was the select committee on science and technology of the house of commons which recommended against the pwr and it was a labour government who planned the two nuclear power stations that are being constructed at heysham and torness <e> <s> we are concerned that we should have the correct form of nuclear power in this country and that has not yet been decided and will not be decided until

lord say that the industry has had to queue to get money from the public investment programme <e> <s> he will be aware that not only is the gas industry self-financing in respect of capital expenditure but also that it has been lending money to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening but in the light of what the noble lord said about government interference

the telecommunications bill we had the self-same assurance that domestic consumers would be protected by the rpi minus x formula <e> <s> the noble lord is giving us the same assurance tonight but so

some confusion in my mind about the amount which has been spent and the amount which is yet to be spent <e> <s> i understood the minister to say that up to the end of march a total of million had been spent <e> <s> was i correct in the figures that i gave to the house of an ongoing expenditure of million per month or million between now and march next year <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord

asking for an appointment board but for consultation <e> <s> therefore because what we are asking for is so small i feel that probably in most cases one meeting of the select committee a days meeting

the removal of a person from office the secretary of state would have to answer to parliament <e> <s> undoubtedly this matter would be raised <e> <s> i remember the case of lord hall who was dismissed

of course we are not talking about the gas industry we are talking about a regulator here <e> <s> i think the noble lord would agree and i hope the noble lord lord somers would agree that it is a different matter <e> <s> the gas industry will be controlled by a board which would be quite separate from the regulatory body <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he referred to the philosophy of this side of the committee <e> <s> does he not accept that the philosophy that we are expressing from this side is of greater involvement of parliament <e> <s> does he not agree with that <e>",

clauses and nine schedules <e> <s> throughout this debate all parties on this side have expressed their concern first at the weakness of the regulatory system and secondly at the manner of appointment to the organisation over which the director general will preside <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on this amendment <e> <s> i have to tell the noble lord lord diamond that i am in some difficulty with his amendment <e> <s> the reason is because when i asked the noble lord lord belstead for certain information last thursday evening he was either unable or unwilling to let me have it

to tell us the proposed salary of the chairman of the board <e> <s> but does he think that by the time we reach clause he will be able to tell us what the salary of the chairman of british gas plc is

the old soviet communist view that if you did not work you did not eat <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree that we need a much better approach and that the real answer is for the country to co-ordinate the opportunities and its resources to get the million unemployed back to work and into real jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i agree absolutely with him that it is deplorable that the russian government have not made available to the rest of the world the full extent of the catastrophe that occurred the reasons for it and what is being done to control it <e>

their nuclear policy <e> <s> if they are so doing they will have the support of the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the labour government did indeed have a long-term energy strategy and that that strategy made use of all the elements of fuel coal oil gas and indeed nuclear generation <e> <s> it is because the government have thrown everything to the winds and left it to market forces that their energy policy is now in a mess <e> <s> is he absolutely sure about the assurances which he has given regarding nuclear safety and that such an occurrence could not happen here <e> <s> is he aware as regards three mile island that the residents of harrisburg were assured that the accident which occurred could not happen and that in russia the residents were given the same assurances <e> <s> i hope that the noble lords assurances are not the same as theirs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this matter of the ems is rather esoteric so far as most of us are concerned <e> <s> since he will not give the reasons why we should not join will he give the reasons why he thinks or why the government believe that it has been in our favour not to have joined up to the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord he really did not answer my question and i am sorry he did not <e> <s> i asked him why it had been to our advantage to remain outside the exchange rate mechanism up to date <e> <s> he should surely be able to tell us that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i revert to the question asked by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran about the sizewell inquiry <e> <s> i do so particularly in relation to the unusually complacent attitude taken by the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> can the minister confirm that the sizewell inquiry is due to report in september but would it not be right and can we not have the assurance that the inspector will now be asked to take into account what happened at chernobyl <e> <s> we must particularly bear in mind that the sizewell reactor although not of an identical or even perhaps similar type is nevertheless a lightwater reactor as opposed to a gas-cooled reactor <e> <s> that is an important point and i hope the noble lord will take it on board <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i feel sorry that he should use irony against my noble friend lord glenamara since he asked a very relevant question <e> <s> can the noble lord give the assurance that if and when british gas is sold off is floated there will be very widespread share ownership and that institutions in the city and people abroad will not be able to make millions and millions of pounds overnight through being allocated huge batches of those shares <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not yet gone through this house <e>", "<cs> this is a very relevant amendment which has been well moved by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> he is right to be concerned about this matter <e> <s> so far as i can see there is nothing specific in the bill about the adequacy of staffing for ofgas and the gas users council but the memorandum on the effects of the bill on public service manpower anticipates that the director general and the gas users council will between them have to staff <e> <s> that is the anticipation but frankly that is absurd and almost insulting to both organisations <e> <s> i would be obliged and i am sure the committee would be obliged if the noble lord opposite can explain just how ofgas and the gas users council are expected to carry out even the limited functions that they have under the bill with such a small body of staff <e>", "<cs> the south-east <e>", "<cs> i shall not keep the committee very long <e> <s> i have listened very intently to the arguments <e> <s> indeed i listened

third time lucky so to speak <e> <s> but the noble lord has been accommodating <e> <s> i understand the difficulty which he has outlined and the tie-up with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think it would be sensible in fact if he were to look at it <e> <s> he has given that <e>", "<cs> indeed that is right and it is necessary for business people to take an interest in these organisations <e> <s> in actual fact i wish that more business people would take an interest in local authority work for example <e> <s> i think that there are too few such people in local authorities up and down the country <e> <s> this is an attempt to involve people in the business of the nation and it is an opportunity for them to be so <e>", "<cs> yes and the noble earl lord ferrers is absolutely right <e>

noble earl and indeed perhaps to myself <e>", "<cs> although i did not add my name and neither did any of my colleagues to the amendment of the noble baroness we were in fact sorely tempted <e> <s> as a matter of fact at report stage in the house of commons the labour party moved a new clause in practically identical terms to this <e> <s> it was new clause <e> <s> therefore as i said when i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> i consider this amendment to be complementary or it would have been complementary to my amendment no <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that information <e> <s> clearly this is a complicated matter and i shall want to read what the minister has said <e> <s> he did not answer this question but i take it that discussions are continuing with the trade unions about <e>", "<cs> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether or not my noble friend and i shall agree to withdraw the amendment because frankly the speech of the noble lord which we have just heard shows a degree of complacency which the noble lord does not usually reveal <e>", "<cs> come off it <e>", "<cs> i must say that i was surprised that the noble lord should say what he did and in the tone that he used <e> <s> he does not usually speak with asperity and i am surprised that he should have chosen this particular amendment on which to use asperity because this is virtually a non-political amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall withdraw it but not because the noble lord has given me a satisfactory answer i assure him <e> <s> the noble lord says that the real world is not like the sort of world that we propose in the amendment <e> <s> but in fact a satisfactory energy world is the sort that i have described <e> <s> i had hoped that the noble lord would deal specifically with the point that i raised about power stations <e> <s> does he agree especially in energy efficiency year that it is right that gas a premium fuel should be burnt in a way that

power station <e> <s> i shall tell the noble lord why it would suit it provided that the price of gas was right <e> <s> the capital cost would be considerably reduced because it would not have to build storage capacity for coal <e> <s> nor would it have to build a coal-handling plant <e> <s> therefore straightaway it would be able to build a coal-fired <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was well trained in another place in stone-walling and he has stone-walled very well tonight i will give him credit for that <e> <s> however he has a bit of a cheek to talk to me <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to this group of amendments and support very much what the noble lord lord ezra has just said about least cost resource <e> <s> we do not actually have to go over to the united states because we have a select committee on energy in the other place and the noble lord lord ezra will remember that they carried out an investigation and made a report on conservation <e> <s> this was just one of the problems which they investigated and what they found was that the country could save money through not having to build a power station by embarking upon an energy conservation programme <e>", "<cs> in relation to the noble lords reply on amendment no <e> <s> i have no doubt that the present british gas corporation are co-operating with his department to a certain degree <e> <s> i do not

thank the noble lord for the information that he has just given <e> <s> i accept that regulations exist which deal with the subjects that i have mentioned but there are two points which i should like to put to the minister <e> <s> certainly one of them was raised in another place during the committee stage of the bill and it concerns the adequacy of the staff of the health and safety executive to deal with these problems particularly when british gas is privatised <e> <s> whether we like it or not a publicly-owned industry is more responsive because it is under public control and subject to public <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most surprised that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has not asked a

earlier that a million jobs had been created <e> <s> would he not agree that per cent <e> <s> of those jobs were part-time low-paid and mainly for women and that jobs for men for if you like the main

will the removal of protection from workers in respect of unfair dismissal help unless it is to give more power to employers to sack workers unfairly <e> <s> i think that these are questions which should be answered because this statement and the white paper are quite irrelevant to the real needs of creating proper jobs and getting rid of unemployed in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may let me say to the noble lord that we are not looking backwards <e> <s> we are looking forward to the day when the number of people unemployed in this country three and a quarter million is reduced

day of the recess i was perturbed to read from the press association tapes a statement which quite clearly emanated from the government and which threw doubt on the oppositions role in assessing the gas bill during its committee stage in this house <e> <s> if i may quote from the press association release it said <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support the amendment although noble lords will note that there is a further amendment amendment no <e> <s> a in my name and that of my noble friend lord bruce of donington under clause which mentions that a gas supplier may make a standing charge

code not about the content of the code <e> <s> as i understand the amendment of the noble baroness lady macleod that would have the effect of giving them the right to be consulted about the content of the codes of practice <e> <s> therefore there is a distinct difference <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that i have the right authorisation <e> <s> perhaps i have one that is out of date <e> <s> has it been altered without my knowledge <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness speaks i think this will be helpful to her may i say as a signatory to the amendment that what the noble lord has said is very valuable indeed not only in respect of the promise he has given on the wording of the authorisation but very significantly i think his promise to come forward with an amendment to clause to make the position absolutely clear in respect of the infirm the elderly and the disabled <e> <s> that is a very valuable point and we shall obviously be interested to see what happens in the future but if the noble baroness wishes not to proceed with her amendment i should be quite happy <e>", "<cs> i support these two amendments <e> <s> they are very important amendments indeed <e> <s> we should remind ourselves that the house of commons select committee on energy paid great attention to energy efficiency and it is worth reading out what was said in paragraphs and of its first report <e> <s> paragraph stated <e>", "<cs> the amendment does not make mention of a cheaper rate <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his generous remarks about my initial contribution <e> <s> i am afraid that he misunderstands the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord said that the bill deals with the supply of gas <e> <s> it of course deals with the supply of gas and of ensuring the maintenance of a supply of gas <e> <s> but one cannot maintain a supply of gas if one has bad labour relations <e> <s> if one has bad labour relations people might take industrial action and that might affect the supply of gas <e> <s> therefore good labour relations and proper arrangements for good labour relations are essential <e> <s> we are therefore at one with him and all we are trying to do by this amendment is to help the noble lord and the government to achieve their aim of getting a secure supply of gas <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment which is very important indeed <e> <s> the amendment makes reference to <e>", "<cs> may i say how delightful it was to hear the noble viscount lord trenchard enter into this debate and indeed the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard and the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden <e>", "<cs> oh yes <e> <s> all one has to do is read the ryder report to see what happens in a private industry which does not invest <e>", "<cs> i thought i heard the noble viscount speak not only about the position of british gas but also about his own experience in industry which i do not think is actually in british gas <e> <s> what i said about the motor industry which is big business by any standards and has been better business in the past is absolutely true <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond is only seeking through this amendment to ensure that british gas when it is privatised continues to do its duty in the public interest <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ezra pointed out because british gas has a private monopoly it also has obligations <e> <s> we are seeking to see that it carries out those obligations <e>", "<cs> under public ownership <e>", "<cs> then i am glad that i did not move it <e>", "<cs> i would have considered withdrawing the amendment if the noble lord had not mixed up thermal efficiency with doctrine <e> <s> overall thermal efficiency has nothing to do with doctrine <e> <s> i am concerned that gas supplies should not be wasted <e> <s> but gas supplies will be wasted make no mistake about that if we burn gas which is a premium fuel in power station boilers to raise steam which will then be converted by a generator into electrical power <e>", "<cs> i really cannot understand the noble lord <e> <s> he mixes up doctrine with <e>", "<cs> that may be but we will not go into that subject at the moment <e> <s> we are trying to convince the noble lord but he will not be convinced and i rather fear that it is he who is being doctrinal about market forces <e> <s> it is the government who are being doctrinal in believing that our energy problems can be solved by handing the control of all energy sources and future energy policy over to private enterprise and market forces <e> <s> that is doctrine <e> <s> energy efficiency is common sense <e>", "<cs> yes i think i can be satisfied <e> <s> clearly i shall want to read what the noble lord has said and it may well be that if i am not entirely satisfied having read those words i shall wish to return with an amendment at report stage <e> <s> for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find that most interesting because when i was arguing earlier that to protect the interests of employees we should listen to the act i was told that this was not relevant because the government believed in the market economy and that private enterprise should be free <e> <s> now we find that privatised british gas needs the protection of the statutes in respect of providing a supply of gas <e> <s> in other words as i read it what the act is seeking to do is to ensure that irrespective of whatever else may be done the privatised british gas makes a profit <e> <s> in other words it has nothing to do with market forces at all <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the noble lord has said and it is quite clear that we are not going to convince one another this evening anyway <e> <s> i maintain that in spite of the fact that british gas is to be privatised it is necessary in the interests of our energy sources and their conservation that some control and some obligations are placed upon the privatised british gas <e> <s> however as i have said i do not think that we are going to agree on this and certainly at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what has been a very interesting and wide-ranging debate and i am particularly grateful to my noble friends for taking part and for shedding new light on this very important matter <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord was referring to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i now understand that he was referring to amendments nos <e> <s> and which are of course similar <e> <s> i misheard the noble lord <e>

at this stage <e> <s> we will of course have the opportunity of seeing what words are used in the amendment to the authorisation <e>", "<cs> that is a kind invitation which i accept <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made a very reasonable suggestion <e> <s> i shall certainly study closely what he has said <e> <s> is he repeating that under clause the director has adequate powers <e> <s> is it also right to believe from my leading of clause that the procedure could be quite long winded and that the customer may very well be injured <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord can comment on those queries <e>", "<cs> we had better have a look at the discussion <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for the detailed way in which he has dealt with the amendment <e> <s> we shall look at what he has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> a pre-payment meter <e>", "<cs> i am quite surprised that i should have received such an unsympathetic response to what are four very reasonable amendments <e> <s> of course i accept that the method used is preferable to the making of a statutory instrument <e> <s> that i accept <e> <s> what i do not accept is that the provision as regards interest is tight enough to protect the person who is depositing the money <e>", "<cs> i really am amazed that the noble lord cannot see that although he has said he wants balance and he thinks that the balance is kept within the bill between the supplier and the consumer the balance of advantage under the provisions of the bill must be with the supplier <e> <s> if money is deposited with the gas corporation for months at say per cent <e> <s> of the that will amount to nearly <e> <s> under the bill the gas corporation or british gas plc will benefit to the tune of and the consumer will have lost <e> <s> how can that be a proper balance <e> <s> the balance is weighted against the consumer <e> <s> what i am trying to do is to make it rather fairer understanding that it would be difficult to pay consumers interest on money deposited for a week <e> <s> i am trying to be fair to both the consumer and the supplier <e> <s> but it seems to me that the noble lord is being most unfair to the consumer and very generous to the supplier <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes has given more helpful information than the minister did <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely <e> <s> the noble lord has said in a different way what i was saying <e> <s> but in the light of what has been said and certainly in the light of what the noble baroness has said i shall consider the position between now and report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find that a very disappointing reply <e> <s> the noble lord must not try to catch me out on electricity prices because he is talking about something which is quite different <e> <s> the area boards in england are separate boards <e> <s> they are not one monopoly as indeed are the south of scotland board and the north of scotland board they are separate entities <e> <s> the price of electricity charged by the cegb to the area boards is a standard price and any variations which occur are because of different costs within the area boards <e> <s> that is the position with relation to electricity <e> <s> but with relation to gas it will be a monopoly <e> <s> there will be no separate area boards there will be no separate distribution areas or separate companies <e> <s> the position here is quite different <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not mean it in the sense that the noble lord lord campbell of croy has taken it <e> <s> it is a remote region from london let me put it that way but there are other regions as well <e> <s> had they been able to see the noble lords reply i feel sure that noble lords from scotland and particularly from wales and perhaps cornwall as well would have been here in the committee to vote and not to vote for the government but for the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless i feel it only right that i should test the feeling of the committee <e>", "<cs> answer yes or no <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am now more confused after that reply than when i started <e> <s> as my noble friend lord bruce of donington has just pointed out the noble lord lord gray seems to be saying one thing one moment and something different the next <e> <s> he seemed on the one hand to be saying that the director would be able to intervene and could alter the method of control <e> <s> yet in the next breath he says that he cannot alter the method of control because that is sacrosanct within the authorisation <e> <s> the noble lord cannot blame noble lords for being confused when he makes such conflicting statements <e> <s> but i realise that we are dealing with standing charges <e> <s> that is our concern in this amendment <e> <s> that is what we are worried about at the moment <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i shall need to read and read very closely what has been said during this debate and previous debates on the matter of standing charges because i am still not satisfied <e> <s> however it may very well be that i am not satisfied because i am not clear as to exactly how the t ling works and how the director will have control over the standing charges <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be as well to withdraw the amendment but i reserve the right if i remain dissatisfied with the position to bring it forward again at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> he is getting more sense from there <e>", "<cs> we now see the difficulty of making progress with the bill <e> <s> the debate which we have just had shows quie clearly that noble lords are concerned about very relevant matters <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has not been able to satisfy the very relevant and real questions which have been put <e> <s> the noble lord tried very hard i appreciate that to satisfy this side of the committee and perhaps his own side as well but he has not satisfied them <e> <s> there is no question about that he has not satisfied them <e>", "<cs> that is a very useful suggestion and i appreciate it coming from where it does <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord whether he is prepared to respond now to the reasonable suggestion of the noble baroness <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord wishes to say something before i press the matter to a division <e>", "<cs> frankly i really do not think that that is good enough <e> <s> the noble lord has made no concession to the arguments that have been put from this side of the committee no concession whatsoever <e> <s> if he had done so then it would have been right to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however the noble lord made no concession to us at all <e> <s> he said that his undertaking was totally without commitment <e> <s> perhaps he should have committed himself rather further than that to examining the matter seriously <e> <s> perhaps he should have said that he would at least try to do something with the authorisation if not make an amendment to the bill <e> <s> i fear therefore that i shall have to press this matter to a division <e>", "<cs> i do not really know why the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne intervened <e> <s> bearing in mind the felling of the tree across high tension lines his act could in fact have resulted in a charge of criminal negligence <e> <s> however let us not go into his private business although he told us about it <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord should feel that his offer to consider the last amendment without commitment was thrown back in his face <e> <s> it most certainly was not <e> <s> i had to make a quick decision and i hope that i rejected if that is the right word his offer courteously and explained the reasons why i felt that it did not go far enough and that i had to press the matter to the vote <e> <s> i hope that he is not using and will not use that to refuse to accede to the reasonable request of the noble lord lord diamond to have another look at the matter <e> <s> it was not my intention and it was not in my manner to throw his offer back in his face <e>", "<cs> i do not know that i can withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord was very reasonable in his reply <e> <s> but we have to remember that some of the new gas suppliers may have an odd installation here and there <e> <s> one may have shell uk ltd for example or the small oil company supplying over million therms of gas to a specific firm factory or installation <e> <s> it may well be therefore that they will not have the facilities on hand to deal with such a leak <e> <s> under the existing schedule paragraph all that british gas has to do is to tell them <e> <s> it may take the company quite a long time to get to the installation <e> <s> while they are getting there a dangerous situation may be arising <e> <s> it would clearly be sensible for british gas if it received that report and there was to be a delay to have the power and authority to repair that gas leak in the interests of public safety and then charge the other firm an appropriate charge for making the equipment safe <e>", "<cs> i think so too <e> <s> i am obliged to my noble friend for drawing our attention to this important matter <e> <s> it is quite true that the retail price index does not necessarily reflect the costs of re-laying pipes <e> <s> those costs and costs related to them may go up far more steeply than the elements in the retail price index which include items such as tobacco and house mortgages which at the moment are coming down <e> <s> i appreciate that point and it is one which should have consideration <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend lord howie of troon <e> <s> i think he has raised a relevant point <e> <s> it is one which perhaps we ought to consider between now and report stage <e> <s> also i listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord gray of contin said in relation to this amendment <e> <s> i shall probably need to read what he said and particularly so in relation to the existing regulations requiring people who undertake gas installations to be competent <e> <s> competent to do so is rather different from being qualified to do so <e>", "<cs> that is absolutely right <e> <s> i am exactly in tune with my noble friend <e> <s> as i say we shall have the opportunity to come back to this matter at report stage but before pressing the matter further i should like to read what the minister has said <e> <s> that i shall do and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like first to thank the noble lord lord howie of troon for his interesting intervention in this part of the bill and also for acting as a surrogate for my demolition <e> <s> in fact the intervention had the effect of doing a counter-demolition job on the minister so we are both demolished now <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble lord lord gray of contin has said but i do not really know that i am satisfied <e> <s> i am not at all sure that i agree with the arguments he used with regard to competence and qualification <e>", "<cs> that has been a most interesting side debate and i suppose most of us would have preferred to be in the ark rather than the titanic <e> <s> that was a very well-made point if i may say so <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that <e> <s> he shall read and consider and we shall read and consider and we shall have the opportunity to come back at report stage <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> if of course annex a is used merely to define how the accounts can or may be prepared and what is shown in the accounts and how those accounts may be divided then that is one thing <e> <s> but is there not a danger that annex a could be used for the breakup of british gas <e> <s> would it not be possible to say that it was implicit in the authorisation that british gas should split itself up into various component parts and therefore into separate businesses <e> <s> that is what we are afraid of and is it not implicit in this annex <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to know quite what to make of that but there was a categorical assurance <e> <s> i shall want to read very carefuly what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it may be that this is something to which we shall want to return if we are still not satisfied with the very positive statement that he has made <e> <s> therefore in the interests of making progress i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate very much what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i even appreciate the difficulty of writing it into statute because it may be difficult to amend when it is out of date <e> <s> there is certainly the difficulty that it has not yet been agreed <e> <s> i had not realised that it was still out for consultation and that the consultation procedure would not be complete until august <e> <s> that is an added difficulty <e> <s> therefore i say now that i shall withdraw this amendment but i wonder whether the noble lord can help a little more <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that assurance and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can only thank the noble lord for his generous response to the amendment <e> <s> i look forward to hearing from him <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he has studied the question that is before him <e> <s> it asks the government <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just reply to that particular point because it is an important one <e> <s> indeed it is well understood <e> <s> of course tenants too have a responsibility for their own lives <e> <s> that is accepted <e> <s> i thought we had covered that in fact by the second section of the new clause which reads <e>", "<cs> those are two perfectly reasonable questions <e> <s> the reason i referred to unscrupulous private landlords is that of course generally speaking local authority dwellings are unfurnished and the appliances will be provided by the tenant therefore the appliance belongs to him and he is responsible for its maintenance <e> <s> usually these appliances are installed in private furnished places although i do accept the stricture of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that there are certain local authority and private housing associations which do furnish completely and install a cooker or some other appliance which may belong to them <e> <s> in that sense the noble lord is probably right i should not have referred only to private landlords <e> <s> there are other <e>", "<cs> if that were so if the criminal law were no deterrent why are we sitting here at all <e> <s> why do we pass laws making certain things a criminal offence if we do not think they will deter people from committing offences <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for what he has said but i am not sure that what he has told me satisfies me that the position is covered <e> <s> as i understand it the regulations under the health and safety at work act do not cover people who resell gas they cover the people who install appliances <e> <s> therefore the person who is liable is the installer <e> <s> that is my impression of it but does the noble lord wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> in the light of that explanation i shall certainly have to look at what the noble lord has said <e> <s> if the regulation has the meaning that the noble lord says then it may very well cover the position i have in mind <e> <s> we all agree that it is right that the position should be covered <e> <s> the best thing i can do with this is to take it back have another look at it and particularly regulation under the health and safety at work act and if i find that the position has not been covered then we reserve the right to come back to this at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to get up and support the noble lord lord diamond <e>", "<cs> i am glad that it is not a surprise to the noble lord particularly since he was speculating about the motive behind the amendment <e> <s> the motive behind the amendment is quite clear <e> <s> in fact the noble lord lord diamond spelled it out and there is no reason to disbelieve him when he says that the motive behind this amendment is to protect the taxpayer to protect the owners of the existing organisation which it seems to me is an entirely laudable thing to do <e> <s> bearing in mind the experience with british telecom where millionaires were made overnight at the expense of the taxpayer it seems to me that the noble lord lord diamond should be commended for his efforts to ensure that we do not have another british telecom situation thrust upon us because of the oil price <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene so soon but i could not help hearing what the noble lord said <e> <s> the government expect to get a good price <e> <s> what i expected the noble lord to say is that the government will get the best price <e> <s> that is what it is all about <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has put me in a terrible difficulty <e> <s> i do not quite understand what we are doing now <e> <s> what the noble lord seems to be saying is that the government will go ahead and dispose of the assets at the best price they can get bearing in mind the market conditions as they stand at the point of sale <e> <s> i am right <e> <s> that is what he is saying is it not <e> <s> but where does the value of the asset come in <e> <s> the value of british gas must be so many thousands of millions of pounds <e> <s> i believe it is about billion <e> <s> at what point do they say thus far and no farther down <e>", "<cs> i will not pursue that point because we would be here all night <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am now more puzzled at this stage of the debate than i was at the beginning <e> <s> i am certainly much more puzzled now than i was when the bill started its passage through the house of commons and indeed through the house of lords <e>", "<cs> did i understand the noble lord to say that it is now the government view that replacement cost is not a good basis for valuing companies <e> <s> i find that very surprising because gas consumers have been paying prices based on replacement cost over a long period of time <e> <s> the gas consumers who have had their gas prices raised in order that they can suit the balance sheet which is related to replacement cost having paid extra prices now find that the government have changed their minds <e> <s> as taxpayers they will get only half the value upon which they have been paying increased prices <e> <s> i find that amazing and scandalous <e>", "<cs> may i just ask the noble lord a question because he mentioned british telecom <e> <s> this issue is of a much greater order than british telecom <e> <s> we were talking i think about billion in the case of british telecom <e> <s> here we are talking about billion to billion and the situation is surely very much different <e>", "<cs> neither was british telecom <e> <s> it was issued in three tranches <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord diamond decides what to do about his amendment i should like to say to the noble lord lord gray that he was being most unfair to the noble lord lord diamond and indeed to the last labour government <e> <s> we all appreciate indeed we have come to appreciate it very much during the debates on this bill that the noble lord lord diamond is a ex-chief secretary to the treasury <e> <s> indeed his interventions in the debates have been most valuable not only because of his personal qualities and expertise in accountancy but also because of the experience he had as chief secretary <e>", "<cs> the committee will note that we gave notice of our intention to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> we put down no amendments to the clause but it is an important clause and we had intended to have a debate <e>", "<cs> i agree with the sentiments of the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i agree with him very much in thanking noble lords opposite for their attendance and for the courteous way in which they have replied to the many debates on the bill <e> <s> but like the noble lord i have to express my complete dissatisfaction with the replies and the attention given to our arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that we really cannot be complacent about this and that eight kilogrammes of plutonium was an enormous amount of plutonium to lose bearing in mind that it is measured and accounted for in grammes <e> <s> has not the impression been given that there is slackness and bad management at sellafield that really must be put right and furthermore a lack of confidence between dounreay and sellafield <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord and the government will take steps to ensure that nothing of this sort happens again and that all operations other than military operations at sellafield and indeed other nuclear establishments are open to scrutiny by the public and that the public are given all possible information about leaks and what goes on at these establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord has not taken seriously the question of nicotine comparison <e> <s> it will lead us into all sorts of difficulties <e> <s> there will be crossing the road comparisons and what have you <e> <s> this is a serious matter not concerned with the approval or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord can tell the house how the wages council bill now before the house will help the catering trade and restaurateurs <e> <s> will he not also agree that because we have the bill before the house at the moment this is a golden opportunity to do something within that bill about gratuities and the per cent <e> <s> or whatever it is surcharge to bills <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that research in germany at the present time appears to show that high levels of ozone produced as a result of nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons which come mainly from fuel exhausts are causing the damage there <e> <s> can we be assured that the cegb will continue to spend its million on research into sulphur dioxide emissions and indeed the causes of acid rain and the damage to forests and lakes in scandinavia and germany <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel bound to ask this question although perhaps it is a little wide of the statement <e> <s> the government have made their statement this morning and from that statement it is quite clear that we are still suffering the effects of a nuclear accident that took place months ago miles away <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is generally agreed that this is a very important project <e> <s> does he recall that in another place on th april his honourable friend in answer to a question from mr david mudd said that the report would be published shortly <e> <s> it is now th june nine weeks later <e> <s> can the noble lord say when we are likely to see the publication of the report and will a copy be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> it has been an interesting short debate <e> <s> i think i can understand the reservations of the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> i understand their preference for the insertion of what is fair and reasonable and a code of practice <e> <s> we had the opportunity to vote for just those things but

question of bias i think that it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black <e> <s> the noble lord is very well known for his bias in many respects and for his forthright speaking in the house of lords which is particularly what we want <e> <s> i understood perfectly what he said about the contract of employment but i thought i explained earlier the difficulties that a worker may very well be in when he signs that contract of employment <e> <s> he is at that moment perhaps starting a job without knowing what it entails or he may be applying for a job but before he can get it he will have to sign the contract <e> <s> therefore he is in a weak position at that point in time in relation to his employer <e> <s> that is what i was getting at and in those circumstances it is wrong <e> <s> it militates against the interests of the employee and in favour of the employer if he is under that contract subject to being fined for defalcations and shortages which may not be his own fault <e>",

attack <e> <s> no one has come to his rescue because i suppose no one agrees with him <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington is sitting there looking very beautiful but she has not come to his assistance in any sense at all <e> <s> the fact is that the noble lord whether he understands this or not is in charge of the bill <e> <s> he has been handling it tonight <e> <s> it is a bill that inevitably is going to drive down wage rates <e> <s> the noble lord believes that by driving down wage rates people will be placed in employment <e> <s> if that were true germany which is a high wage rate economy would have twice the unemployment that we have instead of having an unemployment rate of per cent <e> <s> whereas ours is per cent <e> <s> bombay instead of having mass unemployment would

reporters imagination <e> <s> i had noticed as other <e>", "<cs> a firm my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gray said that the amendment was not necessary because there were provisions in the bill for strong and effective regulation <e> <s> that of course is the point <e> <s> it is the whole point made by the noble lords lord ezra lord diamond and lord grimond <e> <s> we do not believe and no other commentator so far as i can see believes that there are within the bill arrangements for strong and effective regulation <e> <s> that is why we are so concerned about the appointment and the personality of the appointee to the post of director general <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> i suggested an amendment of my own which has been rejected by the house <e> <s> this amendment is even weaker <e> <s> it has been proposed by the noble lord lord diamond and provides another opportunity to the noble lord lord gray to respond in any way that he likes <e> <s> to give the house his own ideas as to how parliament should be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct the noble lord <e> <s> he said that we had seven days debate on the committee stage of this bill but he will recollect that it was not seven full days <e> <s> we were interrupted on several occasions and were not able to reach the bill until late in the afternoon on a number of days <e> <s> on two occasions because the government could not maintain a quorum we were unable to reach the stage we had hoped <e> <s> therefore it is not true to say that we have had seven full days on this bill <e> <s> we have not had enough time on the bill <e> <s> only this afternoon we lost at least an hour because of other business <e> <s> i accept that that must happen <e> <s> nevertheless the minister is slightly misleading the house in saying that we have had seven days when really we have had only six <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite all right <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a brief word <e> <s> i had hoped to intervene before the noble lord got to his feet <e> <s> i wish to say that the opposition support the amendment <e> <s> it is we believe a modest amendment <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord has not accepted it <e> <s> the noble lord says that the director would be a strong figure and would not want to be messed around by commissioners <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree absolutely with the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> it is impossible to get somebody of the calibre we need for the price that the government are prepared to pay <e> <s> if i may say so there is only one man in this country who could do this job adequately but he would not do it for a year <e> <s> i refer to sir denis rooke <e> <s> he is the chappie who knows the industry inside out <e> <s> nobody could fool him but he is not available <e> <s> he would <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that the director general is going to be the poor relation <e> <s> there is no question about that <e> <s> in those circumstances i can do no more than to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble lord lord belstead should have been so dismissive of this amendment <e> <s> i think i gave good reasons why the government should think again and i prefer to believe that the noble lord himself was not being dismissive because that is not his style <e> <s> the noble lord is much nicer than that <e> <s> he does his best to consider things reasonably and rationally and i prefer to think that his reply to my amendment was so dismissive because he has had his orders from the secretary of state and not because he listened to the argument and decided himself with that good mind of his that this was not a good amendment <e> <s> the secretary of state knows his own mind but we do not agree with his mind and i feel obliged particularly in view of the cavalier manner in which this amendment was treated to pursue the matter and press the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course i am tempted to support it but i happen to think that my amendment no <e> <s> is better than amendment no <e> <s> of the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> in effect my amendment would read that he would resign by reasonable notice in writing <e> <s> but the amendment of the noble lord lord belstead would merely allow him to resign with reasonable notice <e> <s> there is a difference and i think it is an important difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment which is really very mild and one that the noble lord would do well to consider <e> <s> it asks that the director be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue it any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather puzzled by the noble lords reply <e> <s> i thought that the case put forward by my noble friend lord gallacher was very reasonable <e> <s> the case which he is putting is rather different from the case which was put forward in committee because it seeks to continue consultation with the treasury and i feel quite sure that that would be sufficient bearing in mind new condition of the authorisation <e> <s> i may be misreading it but new condition concerning the payment of fees appears <e>", "<cs> my lord before the noble lord withdraws his amendment perhaps i may say that i am becoming just a little confused <e> <s> i have listened to what the noble lord has said but i have also read condition of the revised authorisation <e> <s> condition states <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is clear <e> <s> i am wondering what the treasury will get up to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i am just as puzzled as he is about this staff of <e> <s> although a figure of million has been mentioned in relation to condition for the fiscal year beginning st april the figure shall not exceed million and after st april it shall not exceed million so that there is built in here additional costs <e> <s> i am wondering what is happening to that additional money if we are talking about staff <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i was looking at and thinking about the noble baroness <e> <s> i appreciate the enormous effort that she puts in in particular in respect of matters relating to gas and energy <e> <s> we have consideration for her <e> <s> i have therefore moved the amendment very briefly <e> <s> i hope that noble lords having listened to the arguments will accept them and will support the amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord taylor for his support <e> <s> he has experience of the difficulties which may be caused when there is no local organisation to deal with local problems <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour that the problems that will arise when the gas industry is privatised will be different <e> <s> however they will be no less acute and they will certainly not concern local customers any less than they do now <e> <s> indeed the problem consumers will find is that whereas previously they used to be able to go to the regional council or to their local representative and of course to their member of parliament there were three avenues of approach under the bill they will have nowhere to go other than to the gas consumers council <e> <s> the local customers are being robbed in three ways of their representative rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for making the statement which we <e>", "<cs> my lords were we not assured by the secretary of state that the additional costs borne by the electricity board during the coal strike would not be passed on to the consumer and so surely that is not relevant <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that the point of issue is that electricity prices have been increased at a time when primary energy costs are falling <e> <s> in april in the netherlands there was a per cent <e> <s> cut in electricity charges and in italy it was per cent <e> <s> british consumers are being taken for a ride <e> <s> have not the government put pressure on the electricity boards not to increase prices further because that will put pressure on gas prices and that is the last thing that they want in advance of the flotation of that industry in the autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will not accept what i said will he explain to the house why british gas is holding its price at p per therm when the price of oil has fallen to p <e> <s> could we not expect that the gas price would follow the oil price since it is related <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord brabazon will not be surprised to learn that i fundamentally disagree with what he has said <e> <s> of course british gas plc will raise money on the market but the whole issue at stake is how much money will be raised on the market and the amount of money which is raised on the market may very well be dependent upon the time when the flotation is made <e> <s> it may very well be that there could be a conflict of interest between the secretary of state and the chancellor of the exchequer the latter being desperate for money by the budget of next year because the chancellor being desperate for money may very well try to force the flotation at a time which is not in the national interest and not in the interests of the taxpayer <e> <s> therefore we have tabled this amendment in order to give the secretary of state for energy some standing and some extra force when he is arguing the point with his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> that is why we have put down this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak but following the ministers reply to the noble lord lord grimond it seems that the government are being particularly obdurate over this matter <e> <s> all the noble lord lord diamond is suggesting as i understand it is that there should be provision within the bill in case the government at some future time decide that the director needs some assistance by way of assistant directors <e>", "<cs> my lords this has certainly been a most interesting debate <e> <s> i am grateful to all those who have taken part although i do not necessarily agree with all the points of view put forward <e> <s> however the fact that so many noble lords have spoken shows the importance of the amendment <e> <s> i shall try in as short a period as i can to deal with some of the points raised because they are important <e>", "<cs> my lords it was never tried <e> <s> it did not have sufficient time to get established <e> <s> the fact is that it collapsed because the treasury was against it and was going to make sure that it did not have any rivals over the control of our economic policy <e> <s> but we should have had a national plan then <e> <s> had we had a national plan at that point in time perhaps our manufacturing industry would not have collapsed as it has and we would still be competing well not only in the home market but also the overseas market <e> <s> the noble lord lord elliott may be completely wrong about the national plan <e> <s> had it continued had it been given a chance this country might very well have been far better off than it is at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this amendment and my amendment amendment no <e> <s> are grouped together and although i entirely agree with what the noble lord lord ezra has said i have put down a possible alternative <e> <s> the problem with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say a few brief words in support of this amendment the new condition no <e> <s> of the proposed authorisation so far <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i had better say a few words about amendment no <e> <s> b which stands in my name on the marshalled list <e> <s> may i say first of all to the noble lord lord belstead that we had down an amendment to clause amendment no <e> <s> which we withdrew in order to save time because the noble lord had placed his own amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was being unfair to the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> he knows well what the noble viscount was getting at <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> may i say to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes that there is a distinct difference between the electricity supply industry and the gas industry <e> <s> one industry is not constrained or restrained by yards from the main <e> <s> the electricity industry has a statutory duty to provide electricity wherever it is demanded <e> <s> that is one of the constraints under which it operates <e> <s> the problem is that when british gas is privatised the electricity industry will be under a constraint of government <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will no doubt come back and say that is simple <e> <s> let us denationalise the electricity industry as well <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is what i said that the noble would say <e> <s> i was not saying it <e> <s> it will not be so easy to privatise the electricity supply industry as it is to privatise the gas industry <e> <s> that being so the electricity industry knows that it will be some while before the government can privatise it if at all <e> <s> we are opposed to the privatisation of gas electricity or coal <e> <s> we believe that oil should have remained under some form of state control through bnoc <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not mind if i ask him a point of information <e> <s> he was talking about predatory pricing <e> <s> one understands that the office of fair trading would be able to do something about that <e> <s> but there is a real difficulty because at least as i understand it and the noble lord will correct me if i am wrong the contract price for gas is fixed to the prevailing oil price <e> <s> am i right on that <e> <s> the noble lord will tell me <e> <s> if that is so willy-nilly by the reduction in oil prices the price of gas will reduce <e> <s> but there is no compensating link between coal and oil prices <e> <s> therefore without predatory pricing it could very well be that gas not because it is privatised but simply because of the way it has been organised over a long period of time would be competing unfairly with the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> my lords there is clearly a yawning gulf between the two sides of the house and certainly between the minister and this side of the house <e> <s> the minister says that parliament has been able to discuss the authorisation <e> <s> the quarrel is that we have only been able to comment on the authorisation and not properly to discuss it and certainly not to amend it <e>", "<cs> my lords it would perhaps be as well before the noble lord replies if i were to speak to amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name and that of my noble friend lord bruce of donington <e> <s> the noble lord has gone a little way to meet some of our objections <e> <s> he has amended the authorisation and has removed the offending words best endeavours <e> <s> the new condition in the authorisation as i understand it will not be a question of using best endeavours <e> <s> british gas plc will be required to ensure that standing charges do not go up in any relevant year by more than the retail price index <e> <s> if that is not correct the noble lord will put me right when he replies <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to query that because the position seemed much worse than i thought it was <e> <s> the fact is that we do not really agree with the noble lord <e> <s> we think that years is quite adequate but we have aired the matter and the minister now knows our point of view <e> <s> i should have said that it might be convenient if with this amendment the house discussed amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that will save us time later <e> <s> in view of the time of night i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i really should have spoken to amendment no <e> <s> before the noble lord replied but my noble friend lord ponsonby was so concerned about the progress we were making that i was discussing that with him and i could not turn my attention to the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of that explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords under those circumstances perhaps it would be as well if i asked the noble lord lord belstead the same question <e> <s> i have a copy of the revised authorisation and it is difficult to make the comparison but probably the matters in amendment no <e> <s> are covered in condition codes of practice for tariff gas supplies and payment of bills <e> <s> but the noble lord lord diamond can hardly be expected to take it from me that condition covers his amendment <e> <s> he needs to have that assurance from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for accepting the amendment and considering what we said in committee <e> <s> i must now press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord is making but i remain rather unhappy about it because it seems that there is a loophole here whereby the privatised gas corporation could make additional charges to those in remote parts of the country <e> <s> however i have taken note that the present british gas corporation has said that it will not seek to alter its present arrangements <e> <s> this debate is on record and can be referred to <e> <s> i sincerely trust that it will hold to this arrangement and its assurances <e> <s> in the light of that and in the hope and expectation that it will i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to what the noble lord has said and i have to tell him that over a very long period of time i have argued and discussed this matter at great length with all sorts of people <e> <s> at the end of the day they still come to the conclusion that they would prefer standing charges not to be levied particularly at the present level and that they would prefer to pay per therm for their gas through either a credit meter or a slot meter <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved the amendment and i am replying to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness knows a lot more than i do about what is going on in the gas industry <e> <s> i understand the system that she described is a long way off <e> <s> it certainly will not be <e>", "<cs> my lords the denationalised world <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the assurances that he has given but i am afraid that we remain divided about this <e> <s> i am sorry that he has not been able to come some way towards meeting what i asked for <e> <s> he said that the chairman of british gas has been in touch with the secretary of state and has assured him that this service will be continued that is as long as he is the chairman <e> <s> his assurance can last for only three years since he will be the chairman for only three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the honour of the chairman of british gas but as i said he will be there for only a limited period of time <e> <s> i do not know that i am allowed to speak any further on this <e> <s> i must i am afraid regretfully as a matter of fact press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am my lords but a very brief one and i thank the noble lord for giving me a chance to do so <e> <s> i come to the dispatch box merely to support the remarks of the noble lord lord diamond about lack of information and to emphasise to noble lords opposite that all the opposition parties in this house and in another place must work on their own account <e> <s> they do not have the research assistance and the secretarial assistance that is available to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in practically his opening sentence the minister said that about people die from asbestos-related diseases every year <e> <s> many of them are dying because for years asbestos installation was not under a compulsory licensing scheme <e> <s> when in the s and s asbestos lagging in power stations was removed it was slapped around with a hammer <e> <s> dust was created all over the place and asbestos was lying everywhere <e> <s> it is because people inhaled the dust and had that contact with asbestos that we now have that death rate <e> <s> when it was discovered that asbestos caused asbestosis lung cancer and other diseases a compulsory registration scheme was introduced and asbestos had to be treated with the respect that it deserves <e> <s> i know that because i was associated with the electricity supply industry and worked in a power station <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his consideration of the amendment which i moved at the committee stage which if i am not mistaken would have made the scale <e> <s> this is about times better than was proposed originally and of course i am very pleased that the noble lord has moved this amendment <e> <s> i welcome it and thank him for putting it down <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say this <e> <s> we consider this an important amendment <e> <s> i follow what he says about veto but nevertheless i should have thought that he might perhaps have come forward with an alternative suggestion <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord diamond and i are open to reason <e> <s> we believe that the secretary of state has a role here <e> <s> i had hoped that the noble lord could say to us that even though he did not agree that there should be a direct veto he accepted that the secretary of state should be consulted <e> <s> what is the noble lords view of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord belstead certainly drew yet another red herring across the trail of this amendment <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that the reason different arguments have to be adduced on different parts of the bill is that the government simply have no rational approach towards energy policy <e> <s> that is the reason <e> <s> i am not going to rehearse yet again the arguments as to why there should be an energy policy <e> <s> we have had those arguments <e> <s> i do not want to go into them again though i could do so at very great length and i feel confident that i would be able to convince the noble lord that my case is right and that his case is wrong that is the noble lord not the noble lords government <e> <s> he is a rational person and amenable in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> we have similar amendments down <e> <s> as the noble lord said the government should not spurn the advice of parliament <e> <s> it could do no harm and indeed it might do a lot of good if more consultation took place between parliament and the government <e> <s> i feel quite sure that the debates we have had in the chamber on this bill so far have been most helpful to the government <e> <s> indeed they have been so helpful to the government that they have come forward with at least one or two amendments which will improve the bill and some amendments to the authorisation which improve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord would not wish to give the wrong impression <e> <s> the trade union ballot which was undertaken by i think nalgo did not ask whether the employees were in favour of nationalisation or not they were asked whether they were in favour of taking industrial action over nationalisation <e> <s> that is quite a different thing <e>", "<cs> my lords who shall we have for wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather surprised to hear what the noble lord has said about replacement cost <e> <s> i shall be very brief about this <e> <s> over the past few years we have been charging prices for gas on the replacement cost of assets <e> <s> we have done so for electricity <e> <s> if it is right to price gas on the basis of replacement cost why on earth is it wrong to sell those assets at replacement cost <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been doing it in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what we have been telling the government for years <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that that really confirms what i have said that the government wish to bind their successors <e> <s> in effect a future labour government would take british gas back into public ownership <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that it would be far preferable if they did so by the purchase of shares or does he think that a future labour government or perhaps even a future conservative government should renationalise the gas industry by setting up a new nationalised corporation <e> <s> i should have thought that there could be something between the sides of the house in saying that any future public ownership should be achieved through the buying of shares rather than by the wholesale nationalisation of an industry under a corporation such as we have at the moment on the old morrisonian principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must intervene to put the noble baroness right <e> <s> current cost accounting was not and never has been adopted generally by private business <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been adopted in the nationalised industries <e> <s> as i tried to explain before the prices that have been charged and will continue to be charged are assessed on the basis of current cost accounting <e> <s> but when the industry is privatised apparently there will be a change to historic cost accounting <e> <s> therefore that will increase the profits which will then be distributed to the shareholders <e> <s> our objection is that prices to the consumer have been artificially increased <e> <s> the consumer who has paid those prices and who would continue to pay them will be contributing to larger distributions to the new shareholders <e> <s> that is our objection <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am most obliged to the noble lord for explaining to us just exactly what gas is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we find a strange contrast between the governments approach to government expenditure in this country and public expenditure within the ec <e> <s> in relation to public expenditure in this country they are very stringent but so far as the ec is concerned it seems that the sky is the limit <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> we had many attempts both in committee and on report at dealing with this problem of the disabled and elderly <e> <s> i think the minister has now probably got it as right as he can <e> <s> we are indeed grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for his persistence and for his drafting skills which i think helped the minister along the road to accepting what has now been put into the bill and into the authorisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord will not accept this amendment <e> <s> what the amendment seeks to do is to place a duty on the director to report on his staffing requirements what staff he has what staff he may need in the future and any representations he may have made to the secretary of state <e> <s> it seems to me bearing in mind the fact that parliament is losing control of this industry and indeed handling over the regulatory authority to what i suppose is an independent body that they are entitled to know whether ofgas is properly staffed and whether the director believes that it is properly staffed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am most obliged <e> <s> that is obviously one that i missed <e> <s> it got away and i am most obliged to the noble lord for picking it up <e> <s> i thank him for this amendment which i shall certainly support <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the director of the national gas consumers council has already been made redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords said a plethora <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very statisfactory discussion so far as i am concerned and i should like to thank my noble friend lord graham of edmonton for his support and for the information he gave the house because he was involved with the noble and learned lord lord denning in that important amendment which was carried to the dockyard services bill <e> <s> i am most obliged for his assistance and support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall not take quite so short a time for my remarks on this bill as has the noble lord <e> <s> i agree with him that the bill is slightly better now than it was when it first reached this house <e> <s> it leaves this house a better bill than when it came <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord belstead has said the bill is now near the end of its passage through this house and although in accordance with convention we shall not seek to divide on the motion we remain as opposed to the bill now as we were on second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord young of graffham for making the statement to the house and i welcome in principle the idea of extending the concept of the open university which has worked so well and which of course was the creation of a labour government and the apple of the eye of my noble friend lord wilson of rievaulx <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord could not accept the amendments <e> <s> that would probably have been the safest and most satisfactory way out <e> <s> the industries that i have mentioned and others would then have had statutory force

clothing industry in particu <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i wonder whether he can help me <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to what he has said which was most interesting and very much to the point but we are dealing here with the dockyard services bill <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord rightly said tupe is in place <e> <s> am i correct in thinking that these regulations apply not only in the case of the dockyard services bill but also in the case of any other transfer or any other undertaking which may take place <e>", "<cs> thank you my lords <e>", "<cs> what about the welsh my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is quite right it does <e>", "<cs> i wish we could all have that <e>", "<cs> there are one or two points to which i should like to reply <e> <s> first the noble lord lord reay referred to direct elections and his view is that if you directly elect an assembly then you should give them power <e> <s> that is exactly the view which i expressed in and in another place when we discussed this matter <e> <s> that is precisely what i predicted and indeed what many other illustrious members of that place predicted that there would be additional powers demanded and given to a directly elected parliament <e>", "<cs> i understand precisely what the noble baroness is getting at <e> <s> she believes that within the community the european assembly or parliament call it what you will should have the power of democratic control <e> <s> i understand that argument perfectly but it is an argument which i have not accepted in the past and which i do not accept now <e> <s> i believe that the proper democratic control of community institutions should be through the national parliaments and i have always taken the view that ministers should act in council only with the consent of the national parliaments <e>", "<cs> i understand exactly what the noble lord is saying and i appreciate that certain powers have gone into orbit <e> <s> his choice is to bring them back down to earth in the european parliament <e> <s> i happen to think that the british parliament and perhaps other parliaments of the european community have lost too much of their <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness is worried only about the word filching i do not think we need worry too much <e> <s> the fact is that we have had a good discussion today and i welcome it <e> <s> i am glad that we have had this discussion <e> <s> though i have to say that earlier on when i listened to some of the remarks made during the speech of the noble and learned lord lord denning and my noble friend lord bruce of donington i wondered whether the discussion was being wholly welcomed on all sides of the committee <e> <s> i welcomed too the remarks made by the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> we have had a good discussion and i am glad about that <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble baroness said as indeed i listened carefully to what my noble friend lord bruce of donington said <e> <s> i must confess that listening to the noble baroness i had the feeling that i had been there before for i heard all these arguments in about what britain needed to revive her industrial potential to sell more cars and to sell all sorts of other goods was the chill wind of competition from the ec <e> <s> if only we would

already made <e> <s> we were told originally before we went in that joining this large market was to be our salvation <e> <s> that has not proved to be the case <e> <s> far from our industrial base expanding far from being on the winning side in relation to trade we find that in manufacturing trade our deficit has now reached the sum of billion <e>", "<cs> far from not helping our manufacturing industry the labour party arrested the decline in our manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> but since the labour government left office in our manufacturing base has gone headlong

has declined but i must go back to my original point <e> <s> we were assured that the decline would be arrested by joining the ec <e> <s> however instead of the decline being arrested the decline has

statement in the house today though i have to say that we are rather disappointed that he has not given details of the expanded questionnaire <e> <s> we must therefore rely on press reports in this mornings newspapers <e> <s> indeed it seems that the government had to be pressurised into revealing their intentions through the disclosure of documents and press reports today <e> <s> can the noble

question asked by my noble friend lord mishcon regarding foreign nuclear power stations <e> <s> he will be aware that only miles away in france and in gravelines in particular there is a huge body of nuclear energy in nuclear power stations <e> <s> are there arrangements with france in particular that british authorities should be informed of any accident to those power stations which may affect

million since <e> <s> also is the noble viscount aware that under a labour government additional new jobs will be created and that we shall reduce unemployment by million in two years <e> <s> is the noble viscount further aware that labour party policy on nuclear power reflects a growing public concern about the safety of nuclear energy following the chernobyl accident <e> <s> is not our cautious approach far better than the governments gadarene gallop to introducing into this country the pressurised water reactor which has never been built here has never operated here and is inherently less safe than the agr <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall tell the noble viscount in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount asked a question and i shall do my best to answer it <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that the united states has not built a nuclear power station for the past ten years <e> <s> is he also aware that the labour party policy would involve building new coal-fired stations it would involve combined heat and power it would involve better insulation of homes it would involve more research on renewable sources of energy and that indeed all those together would create far more than the jobs which he mentioned in his opening answer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> can the noble lord explain why any government should put forward a bill to be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the cost of equalising the retirement age which i take it would be at would be exorbitant and he mentioned a figure of million which seems a very high figure <e> <s> perhaps he would look at this because while i was in the other place i was given an answer to a question which i asked on this subject which told me then i believe in that the net cost after taking into account people who are unemployed and so on would be million for each year that the retirement age for men was reduced <e> <s> i make that figure to be million which is quite different from the million which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> i do not expect him to answer that at this moment <e> <s> but can he take on board and perhaps investigate write to me and put the reply in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a further question to the noble viscount because his earlier reply was not quite clear <e> <s> do the government now accept that it is the emission of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides from british power stations that is causing deforestation and barren lakes in scandinavia <e> <s> i should very much like to know that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back but the noble viscount did not answer my first question <e> <s> have we now accepted that it is emissions from british power stations which are causing deforestation and barren lakes in scandinavia <e> <s> have we now accepted that argument or is there further research to he done <e>", "<cs> my lords it has indeed been a very long debate and certainly an interesting one <e> <s> i should like first to join others in congratulating and thanking the committee for its report and the hard work that it put into the gathering of evidence into interviewing witnesses and into presenting the report <e> <s> i think that thanks are also due to the officials who assisted with the report and the inquiry and indeed to the witnesses who were good enough to give evidence to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble earl for drawing that to my attention <e> <s> the noble lord lord marshall and i have known each other over a long period of time <e>

similar accident occurring in any british nuclear power station present or future by reason of human error <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> that is a most interesting point <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the chancellor taxed that new smoking material at the same rate as tobacco and therefore discouraged people from using the new smoking material thus injuring the health lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords only nuclear bases <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord mountevans for raising this most important question and indeed for the manner and the concise way in which he has explained the problem to the house this evening <e> <s> it is clear that he needs little help from me in making his case which i support but the opposition feels that it should say a few words <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be excused for asking a third question from a member of the front bench on this important item <e> <s> in paragraph of the statement the last part of the penultimate sentence reads <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount arrange for a message to be sent to mr chirac informing him that in this country housewife is a term of respect and not one of abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble earl lord lauderdale on raising this most important issue <e> <s> the fact that we have had such a good debate justifies his tabling of the motion <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i was just going to mention that australian coal was of course subsidised very heavily by the government there and i am sure the noble earl would not <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but it is helped by the government in various ways i think the noble earl will find <e> <s> however we shall argue that out some other time <e> <s> nevertheless it is no way to treat our coal industry to threaten the miners with large-scale imports largely from south africa as i say <e> <s> it is an insult to the miners and to the rest of us that this should be so <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would give way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that we believe that he has set a desirable precedent today in answering and apparently taking ministerial responsibility for a private industry <e> <s> can he also say whether the reduction of per cent <e> <s> in gas tariffs is not rather mean bearing in mind that oil prices have fallen by p over the last couple of years <e> <s> is british gas not giving more attention to shareholders interests than consumers interests <e>", "<cs> i thought we had made some progress since then <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement although i imagine that he would rather not have done so <e> <s> indeed it is unfortunate that such an important statement had to be forced out of the secretary of state by my honourable friend the member for kingston upon hull east although having heard the statement one can now understand the governments reluctance to tell the electricity consumers that they had decided to force and i use the word force advisedly an increase in the price of electricity at twice the level of inflation <e> <s> this has nullified all the good work that the cegb and british coal have done over the past weeks and months in negotiating a reasonable and new coal price regime <e> <s> it has nullified that and the electricity consumers are to suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that full reply <e> <s> does he agree that it was the dedication of the staff and the integration of the system that saved the country particularly the south of england from absolute catastrophe on the night of the great hurricane on th october <e> <s> does he also agree that the south of england is under great threat because of a shortage of generating capacity and a lack of transmission capacity to transfer electricity from the north to the south of the country <e> <s> are the government urging along the two new power stations in the south of england and making it possible for them to be completed at the earliest moment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that i am not quite certain whether his answer no was to the first or the second part of the question or both <e> <s> is he aware that the government probably do have power to give a general direction if they so desire but they may not wish to <e> <s> does he accept that it could be more environmentally damaging as well as a lot more expensive to put cables underground <e> <s> does he agree that probably the correct answer is not to put underground all the cables that were brought down on that awful night of th october but for all the electricity boards to review their policies with regard to electricity cables which habitually fall during normal winter gales <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that underground lines also generate heat <e> <s> they have to be cooled and damage to the environment occurs because they have to have cooling stations above the ground <e> <s> that can be more harmful than overhead lines <e>", "<cs> including the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak as a former representative of swindon <e> <s> does the noble viscount agree that brunel might have taken issue with his statement that engineering has no place in running a railway <e> <s> that is what the noble viscount said <e> <s> will he inform the house how the british rail board will be able to have the engineering capacity to ensure that its locomotives and rolling stock are satisfactory for its operations <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that in fact there may very well be environmental gains in the severn estuary in that a tidal barrage could encourage a greater diversity of flora and fauna in the area <e> <s> will he confirm that the creation of a tidal renewable energy source will bring environmental gain in that fewer coal-fired and nuclear generating plants will be required thus reducing any increase in the amount of carbon dioxide nitrous oxide sulphur dioxide nuclear wastes and radiation released into the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while people may very well accept that there is a need for a nuclear power programme they are nevertheless for obvious safety reasons very conerned about the nuclear industry and nuclear power stations being under the control of private industry <e> <s> i think that is probably the object of the question <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will pay attention to that as well as of course to the unknown cost factors related to the pwr since we have never had a pwr operating in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that following the bbc programme this week next week over the weekend people are really very confused <e> <s> on the one hand the secretary of state appeared to say that no decisions have yet been taken about the form that privatisation will take on the other hand he was saying that consumers would be given more protection <e> <s> can we be given more information as to exactly what stage the government have reached <e> <s> in addition before we have a white paper on the subject can we have a green paper so that not only this house and another place but consumers generally can have a say about the electricity industry and whether or not they want it privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances and bearing in mind that there are adequate supplies of uranium from australia and canada both civil and weapons grade can the noble viscount assure the house that we shall not import further supplies from namibia in defiance of the united nations ban on such imported uranium <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether the noble viscount could give an assurance that we would not do so in the future <e> <s> can he give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that while accepting the need for some new power stations in the south of england for load-balancing reasons we do not necessarily need one megawatt power station at fawley <e> <s> would it not be in the interests of energy conservation if we had three or four smaller power stations on inland sites with combined heat and power thus getting an overall thermal efficiency of between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> rather than the per cent <e> <s> from the electricity generating stations only <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the point made by the noble earl lord lauderdale is not necessarily correct <e> <s> does not the minister agree that it would still be possible to import coal if that were the policy of the government even if the power stations were built inland <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the integrated electricity supply industry in this country is the envy of the world <e> <s> since it was formed in it has ensured that virtually everyone in this country enjoys a mains electricity supply <e> <s> what is more the electricity supply industry has given the country security of supply at when the government do not interfere very reasonable prices <e> <s> why is it that the government feel obliged for philosophical reasons and no doubt because they want to add to the already brimful overflowing treasury to upset the industry in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not answered the question that his noble friend asked him <e> <s> the government have been quite prepared to discuss at great length with the moguls of the electricity industry how it will be privatised <e> <s> why do they not consult the owners of the industry that is us <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will indeed seriously consider these two amendments <e> <s> i express that hope because when i served on a local authority one of the actions we took was to set up a direct labour building department <e> <s> we also had a printing department <e> <s> so successful was the building department that on its first tender in for the building of houses to sell not to rent it was able to tender for a contract at less than the nearest private tenderer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> i understand the point that he has made <e> <s> however one of the benefits of creating the direct labour organisation was that a local authority would be able to compete with the private sector and put in realistic tenders <e> <s> as a result not only did a local authority obtain cheaper work from its direct labour department but the price of private sector building in the whole area came down <e> <s> that really was competition <e> <s> what the minister is suggesting would not be competition at all because one way or another the private sector could set up its own cartel as it has in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted that the noble lord said that it was desirable that the rover group should remain in british ownership and we would all say amen to that <e> <s> but if the company is acquired by british aerospace what is there to prevent them from then negotiating with ford or some other foreign company and for such other company to acquire the whole of that british asset <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give the assurance that he will ensure that that proviso is in the agreement that is made <e>", "<cs> my lords had the government in and decided that it would be more cost-effective to buy tanks in germany or france where would that have left us in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord beloff for introducing this debate and for introducing it in so philosophical a way <e> <s> he has certainly given us all food for thought and indeed the debate so far has taken up a number of the points that he raised <e>", "<cs> my noble friend must surely be right on this point for two very good reasons <e> <s> the noble earl said that these matters can be dealt with when we have the bill <e> <s> we passed a gas bill and we tried to set out these matters correctly in the gas act <e> <s> we failed miserably in spite of seven long-drawn-out days and nights when we tried to persuade the government that they should ensure that the taxpayer received a fair and proper price for the assets transferred by the gas act <e> <s> in spite of all our efforts we made no impression <e> <s> that is why my noble friend is trying to have an instruction put into this bill in order that the draftsmen of the next bill will know exactly what they have to do <e> <s> that is why my noble friend with great foresight is trying to write this provision into this bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is absolutely right in relation to the electricity supply industry <e> <s> by the year or before it will be <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one short point <e> <s> the long-term interests of the coal industry are of course very much bound up with the security of supply in the electricity industry <e> <s> one has to have an assured supply of fuel in the electricity industry and that as the government recognise is going to be coal in the foreseeable future <e> <s> as i have understood it throughout my lifetime an assured supply of electricity in this country is dependent upon an equally assured supply of coal <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount noted the remarks made by his right honourable friend mr michael heseltine over redevelopment in the south-east <e> <s> he has changed his mind since he was secretary of state <e> <s> would it not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is two front bench spokesmen <e> <s> i ceased to be a front bench spokesman a fortnight ago when i resigned my duties <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us are becoming bewildered <e> <s> we have all believed that it is our duty as citizens to assist the police in the apprehension of people engaged in criminal behaviour <e> <s> from what the minister has said it seems that the department of transport officials do not feel so obliged <e> <s> can the noble lord clarify the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the noble lords discourteous answer to my noble friend is the minister aware that the unemployment figure in when labour left office was <e> <s> that is less than half the cooked figures which the government now produce <e>", "<cs> my lords is there a net benefit or a net detriment to the british taxpayer overall <e> <s> i do not believe the noble lord has answered that question in terms in which i at least can understand <e> <s> perhaps he will do so <e> <s> my other question relates to the european commission <e> <s> if after it has made an investigation the commission decides that this deal is against the rules of competition what will the government do then <e> <s> will they drop this proposal <e> <s> if it is declared illegal will they pursue the proposal irrespective of its legality under european law <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the theory of free markets only operates when it is allowed to prevail <e> <s> will he say by how much the unemployment figure will rise in the next year if the exchange rate is not allowed to react to market forces <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in our overall deficit on manufacturing trade with the ec was some billion <e> <s> would he care to predict that after that deficit will reduce or increase <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one of the reasons for homelessness especially in london and other parts of the south-east is that people are travelling from the regions scotland wales and the north of england to london and the south-east to obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord young would like to answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating my noble friend lord underhill for raising the matter today and in the terms in which he has done so <e> <s> as was said by the noble lord lord broadbridge one will not solve the problem of congestion unless one deals with public transport <e> <s> the two issues are inextricably bound together <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble baroness must be aware that this is an important question and the information called for is relevant <e> <s> does she not have computers in her department and is not the necessary information on those computers <e> <s> could not the information be kept secret by the need-to-know key being used <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether it is the governments view that the deal done by the french for the release of their three hostages will increase or diminish the likelihood of further hostage-taking in the future whether it is by air or any other method <e> <s> each is as bad as the other <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord ferrers is so courteous and charming and indeed disarming that he almost had me believing him when he said that this was an uncontroversial measure <e> <s> i think he has probably already discovered that there can be a good deal of controversy about it <e> <s> but as it stands i agree that the little order we have before us is quite innocuous although the implications are indeed very wide and serious <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i believe that the noble lord lord vinson asked whether we could have a debate on this subject <e> <s> did the noble earl answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> the first has already been asked but not answered <e> <s> what is meant by a limited service <e>

"<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that it may be difficult to intervene but is the noble lord aware that my noble friend lord mason is absolutely right <e> <s> is he aware that sometimes half a pint of lemonade in a pub can cost as much as half a pint of bitter <e> <s> in a supermarket one can buy lemonade at pence for two litres landlords are charging pence for half a pint <e> <s> surely we must be able to do something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords following the points just raised by the noble lord lord mellish do not the noble earl and the government realise that restricting the number of houses that local authorities can build merely puts pressure on the housing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount denies having plans to privatise the coal industry but he spoke of ambitions <e> <s> is he aware that the coal industry was nationalised because of the enormous chaos that was caused by the private ownership of the coal industry pre-war <e> <s> in his ambitions does he advocate a return to that chaos and the closing of mines before their economic reserves are used up <e> <s> is that not against the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of a debate it is very difficult to say anything which has not already been said before <e> <s> however i shall certainly try <e> <s> i have been impressed so far by the speeches that i have heard certainly with the very eloquent speech of my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> he put the whole matter in perspective and told the house that the government were operating not on the basis of making the industry more efficient but simply because the conservative party was very doctrinaire and needed to do this it needed to privatise to get money to bribe the electorate at the next general election <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that they will be fully safeguarded in relation to future increases <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> one of the problems when one changes one set of taxes for another is that one changes one set of anomalies for another <e> <s> it seems to me that that is precisely what we are doing in changing from rates to the community charge <e> <s> we can see by the amendments that the system will be riddled with anomalies <e> <s> this amendment seeks to correct only one of them <e> <s> it is almost inconceivable that the minister will not go to that dispatch box and say that he accepts this amendment <e> <s> if he does not accept it then he will look very mean indeed <e>", "<cs> there is just one small point that i want to make in reply to the speech of the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> he said that because people in residential care homes are being charged the business rate in their fees then this amendment should not apply <e> <s> however i point out that there are also people who have a long-term stay in hotels <e> <s> they wish to stay in a hotel and they pay high fees for staying in a hotel <e> <s> those high fees are reflected in the amount that they pay to the hotel for staying there but they will still have to pay the community charge <e> <s> it seems to me that on those grounds and under those circumstances the argument which the noble lord lord jenkin used falls to the ground <e> <s> therefore there is merit in what my noble friend is suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the evangelical sortie of the prime minister north of the border was intended to convince the natives or to bring more employment to scotland <e>",

children <e> <s> yet here we have the government rejecting the opportunity to write in an amendment which would improve the bill in a way which the prime minister herself is bound to agree with <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl does that does he not realise that to have to enter the membership scheme at a cost of perhaps or for each member of the family is a discouragement <e> <s> what is more the bureaucracy of joining the scheme is also a discouragement to the family and to the family unit <e> <s> that is why the government should give serious consideration to the amendment <e>", "<cs> it

football and football hooligans <e> <s> we seem to be treating them entirely differently from any other section of society <e> <s> i think for example of a person who goes into marks and spencer steals a jacket goes to make off with it but is stopped by a shop assistant whom he then beats up in a most violent way <e> <s> that person goes to court and he is sentenced to two years imprisonment

it is not a question of the punishment fitting the crime it is what punishments are available to the court <e> <s> i was saying that in these circumstances and for this offence the punishment available to the court will be excessive <e>", "<cs> my lords i support most of the recommendations in the north report and join other noble lords in the hope that we shall have early legislation but

object to the lack of consultation with all the parties concerned <e> <s> it is simply not good enough for the employers the government and perhaps others to say that the scheme is not working arid then bring forward legislation based simply on those statements <e> <s> what we need surely will the minister say why this is not happening <e> <s> is a proper in-depth investigation of the scheme as it is presently operating to see whether there is a future for it or not <e> <s> that is what is needed <e> <s> i hope that the government might even at this stage reconsider their position <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord and the government now accept that the warning given by the houses select committee on overseas trade three years ago was timely and correct <e> <s> would it not

get into a football match that he can be fined on level which i believe is and secondly in other circumstances or perhaps under the same circumstances he can be sent to prison <e> <s> we are reaching the stage where there may be some dubiety about whether this is a truly free country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has great confidence in our courts as i believe we all have <e> <s> but when we are discussing a bill we ought to be precise <e> <s> i have been told on several occasions that we must be precise in legislation <e> <s> the bill does not say that the magistrates as a reserve power

lords let me finish my point <e> <s> the courts already have the power to send people to prison if they do not pay their fines <e> <s> therefore as i said that is a plain red herring <e> <s> it is not necessary to have in the bill the penalty of one months imprisonment just in case somebody does <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i attributed a statement to him that he did not make but i understood the noble lord to say that <e> <s> i shall certainly read <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the views of the noble lord lord mountevans <e> <s> the situation is now becoming completely

amendment of the noble lord lord harris is not wide enough <e> <s> if we are to have an amendment of this kind it ought to embrace everybody other than the english and the welsh unfortunately <e> <s> then the english and the welsh can hate the rest of the world because they will be the only people who will not be able to get into a football match on the production of a passport <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> he has misrepresented me <e> <s> i said that we would be prepared to support the most oppressive measures against football hooliganism <e> <s> what this bill does is to impose oppressive measures against ordinary innocent citizens who may just wish to go to a football match as spectators <e> <s> that does not make them football hooligans <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly consider that while i am speaking <e> <s> first i <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken to this amendment <e> <s> if i had done so i should not be speaking now i know that

asking people voluntarily to fill in a form <e> <s> we are saying to them if you wish to attend a football match by law by statute you must fill in this form <e> <s> therefore the giving of that information is not a voluntary act <e> <s> it is an act of compulsion <e> <s> when we ask people to fill in social security forms or tax forms we give them an absolute guarantee that that information will be private and it will be an offence for it to be disclosed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will deal with that in his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed yes i think that that is so <e> <s> it is one of the problems that we find in the bill <e> <s> i hope that the government will consider part ii as well as this part in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that when his answer appears in <e>", "<cs> my lords does the tax perhaps constitute part of her majestys governments policy on roads in that instead of building decent roads and new motorways they are simply discouraging the extended ownership of cars <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not ironic that million germans and italians will shortly be able to come to this country without let or hindrance yet we refuse to grant that right to million hong kong citizens who have always been loyal and have never fought against this country <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady hooper on the manner in which she presented the bill <e> <s> however the attractive wrapping concealed a nasty doctrinaire bill which will do nothing to deal with the desperate financial and economic problems that the government face at the present time <e> <s> in my view the bill is an insult to the people working in the industry past and present who

clause of the bill since i am a member of the electricity supply industry superannuation fund <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that any increase in the weight limit of lorries to tonnes or beyond would depend upon the decision of this parliament <e> <s> but is it not the case that under the single european act if a majority of ministers voted in favour of higher limits on lorries those higher limits would be imposed upon this country whether or not parliament agreed <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that there should be such opposition to this small mild amendment <e> <s> one would imagine to hear the opponents of the amendment that local authorities had never been involved in river conservation or indeed judging by the second reading debate that local authorities had never been involved in the supply and distribution of water <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that while public debt has been reduced private debt has increased very considerably indeed with detriment to the economy and in particular the balance of payments <e> <s> does the minister agree that it would be preferable for the government to ensure that their debt was kept under proper control indeed that they should not pay off the national debt so quickly but rather encourage private saving which would help the general economic situation and the balance of payments situation in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that housing and house ownership was not a key element <e> <s> is he aware that some of us disagree with him <e> <s> he must be aware that in the next few years when there will be enormous competition for young people the question of house purchase and future housing will concern officers and men and their wives very much indeed and may well become a key element <e>", "<cs> if i were merely concerned about the hard-nosed party political aspects of this bill i would advise that this amendment be rejected because undoubtedly this bill is the most unpopular measure that the government have ever brought forward <e> <s> if this bill is passed in its present form it will do the government considerable damage at the next election <e> <s> therefore it would be as well from the labour partys point of view if the bill went forward unamended <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that applications had been received for self-governing status from every region in the country <e> <s> i understood that the oxford region had not put in applications <e> <s> is my understanding wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister appears confident that the pressurised water reactor is preferable to our own agr <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that in the united states the home of that type of reactor no pwr has been constructed for the past years and nor is there one planned <e> <s> is she also aware that in this country the advanced gas-cooled reactor has achieved load factors the key to the future of reactors particularly in scotland that are far in advance of the world power factor of pwrs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the protection of privacy no <e> <s> bill <e> <s> perhaps by way of explanation i should say that noble lords will be well aware that mr renton announced in another place on st april that the government have decided that there should be a review of the general issue of privacy and related matters and that the review is to

discussion of the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness will listen to what the noble lord lord peyton has said <e> <s> it is quite true that over the last few years since oil prices have been reduced and there has been something of a glut of oil which is coming to an end we have become less conservation conscious <e> <s> nevertheless this is probably one of the most important amendments that will be moved <e>", "<cs> i believe that we are all grateful to the noble baroness for the very full reply that she has given <e> <s> however she has not really dealt with some of the salient points <e> <s> i do not believe that she has dealt with the point that i made that one of the most inefficient organisations in electricity supply is the suppliers themselves <e> <s> the noble baroness quoted clause a which says <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord howie of troon took me up on my previous remarks <e> <s> i obviously did not explain them properly <e> <s> i said that because of the duty on the electricity industry to provide electricity as cheaply and as efficiently as possible the industry instead of supplying both electricity and heat had gone in for these huge -megawatt power stations and -megawatt sets so that it could produce electricity more cheaply <e> <s> had it been required to make the most efficient use of the total input of energy it would not have built the -megawatt power stations <e> <s> it would probably have built -megawatt power stations near towns and factory complexes to supply both heat and power efficiently <e>", "<cs> yes but one would in fact achieve an overall thermal efficiency of between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> instead of per cent <e> <s> which is the maximum one achieves from a -megawatt set <e>", "<cs> surely the conditions must inhibit the choice <e> <s> after all the level of salary and the level of conditions of service which are offered must have something to do with the choice <e> <s> if the salary and conditions of service are set at a given level they may preclude a particular person at any given time <e> <s> surely the point was aptly made by the noble baroness lady oppenheim-barnes that the industry itself will pay the remuneration and expenses <e> <s> i should have thought that the remuneration and the expenses should not be related to the civil service <e> <s> in order to get the calibre of staff required this is no reflection on the civil service but on the relationship of salaries and conditions of service in the industry the salaries and conditions of the director and his staff should be related to salaries within the industry itself <e> <s> otherwise the calibre and type of staff that are needed will not be attracted to the regulating authority <e> <s> if the regulating authority is to be efficient and if it is to do the job we need that type of staff <e> <s> that is what this argument is all about <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand why this provision is included in the bill <e> <s> i understood that one of the reasons for the privatisation of the electricity supply industry was to remove the dead hand of the treasury <e> <s> i understood that it was the dead hand of the treasury which was making the industry inefficient <e> <s> therefore one of the reasons for the bill is to remove the dead hand of the treasury so that the industry will be more efficient <e> <s> but there we find that the dead hand of the treasury is to be placed on the regulator <e> <s> that is the last place where we want the dead hand of the treasury to be <e>", "<cs> in her reply the noble baroness said that the director will be given all the resources needed to do the job <e> <s> does that mean that if the director says to the treasury youre giving me <e>", "<cs> is that an absolute assurance that the director general will get all the resources that he or she needs that is in the view of the director general not in the view of the treasury <e> <s> will he get everything that he wants <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trafford will know that members of parliament in either house are always looking for good precedents <e> <s> perhaps we could have some clarification about who is to decide this point <e> <s> we need to have this on the record <e> <s> who will decide what those needs are <e> <s> is it to be the director general or ultimately the treasury <e>", "<cs> what about the local authorities <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord peston i am a little worried about this amendment <e> <s> i do not know whether the secretary of state would be a better person than the director to appoint these members of the committee <e> <s> secretaries of state are by nature political animals <e> <s> they are members of political parties <e> <s> they

says it happens <e> <s> it has happened before and no doubt will happen in the future <e> <s> someone who is doing the job well might be considered a nuisance by one of the new companies and perhaps dropped from the local committee <e> <s> on the other hand the director is likely to replace someone who is being ineffective <e> <s> he would want the local committees to be effective <e> <s> therefore he would remove people who were ineffective since their ineffectiveness would reflect upon him because he had appointed them <e>", "<cs> i understand the point that the noble baroness is making <e>", "<cs> naturally i accept what the noble baroness has said but i am sure she will agree that particularly during the lifetime of the present government there have often been considerable arguments about appointments to various public bodies for example the health authorities <e> <s> there has been some worry among members of the public that perhaps appointments are being made on political grounds <e> <s> but as i said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of the most serious problems at present is the emission of co gas from power stations and elsewhere which causes global warming <e> <s> is he also aware that many people including myself believe that the government are doing practically nothing to solve the problem by means of energy conservation measures

the statement that he has made some of us feel that the reply given to my noble friend lord hatch of lusby was perhaps a little short <e> <s> the point that my noble friend made was this <e> <s> had there not been a bevy of well known public figures actors and the like the bulldozers would have moved on to the site at six oclock this morning <e> <s> what will happen on other sites they may not be the sites of former theatres but are just as important from many other aspects if one does not have that bevy of public figures <e> <s> that is what we are concerned about <e> <s> the government were not prepared to act it required action by these public figures to bring about the very desirable result that the noble lord has announced today <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that this is yet another example of the european community interfering in matters over which it should have no competence <e> <s> will the minister assure the house that on this occasion anyway even one vote will be able to prevent that legislation being brought into this country against the will apparently not only of her majestys government but just about everyone else here <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances would the minister think it right that the government should consider repealing the single european act <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will listen very carefully to the words of the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> i believe that the proposition to cut off a persons supply of water in the event of non-payment is one of the most uncivilised proposals that i have ever heard <e>

and cooking was dire <e> <s> but what on earth will be their condition if they have no water either <e> <s> frankly it is difficult for me to find words to describe the disgusting squalor in which such a family would have to live <e>", "<cs> it has been very interesting to hear the argument put forward by the noble lord lord jenkin that metering would be good for conservation <e> <s> in fact i wondered why the minister had not raised that argument <e> <s> perhaps the reason was that he saw the report that i did a week or two ago which said that the amount of water used now per head is very little different from what it was years ago <e> <s> although generally speaking we have had a flat rate water charge over the last years the actual amount of water used per person has hardly increased at all <e> <s> i think the argument on conservation grounds is perhaps weakened by that item of news <e>", "<cs> i am still rather puzzled as to what this really means <e> <s> we hear about connection charges then we hear about infrastructure charges <e> <s> exactly what is meant by that <e> <s> how are the charges to be levied and assessed <e> <s> i understand that when new development takes place in an area it may well be that it is not just a question of connecting up to the existing mains it may be that new sources of water have to be developed and new storage capacity and new treatment works provided <e> <s> is it the case that under those circumstances if they have to be provided the developer will be required to make a contribution through a connection charge or whatever other means to those works <e> <s> is that what this is all about <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl can enlighten me <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend lady phillips has raised a most important point <e> <s> it could very well be that a block of offices rises from five storeys to or storeys in which case considerably more water will be used <e> <s> that will involve infrastructure costs not necessarily at that site or even in the vicinity <e> <s> it could happen at the kennet valley for example where additional pumping may have to be installed to pump even more of our sweet water out of the green sand and chalk of that beautiful valley into the river thames drying up all our rivers and otherwise hurting the environment and the wildlife merely to supply those <e>", "<cs> my lords is

aside and ignored <e> <s> the thing they expect not only from government but also from employers is respect and consultation <e> <s> on this bill i am making my first contribution that is just what

that if future government action and policies match the rhetoric of this statement many of us on this side will be quite happy <e> <s> if the prime minister really believes that stages and involve a massive transfer of sovereignty leading eventually to a federal europe and will oppose that kind of move she will have a lot of support from all sides of the house and indeed throughout the country

lord lord stanley and i hope many other people wish <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> is she saying that the industry is so concerned about possible competition that it must have a reserve power to give detrimental treatment to rural areas to be able to meet that competition <e> <s> that is what it sounds like <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the argument quite incredible <e> <s> if the noble baroness is correct in her argument that a new firm can come in and be competitive to the extent that it will take away all the urban business from the established business then there is something radically wrong with the established business or we should not go ahead with this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware of the sharp reaction from this side of the house when he mentioned that the industry should not be subjected to undue turbulence <e> <s> in fact our view is that the present government has so far subjected to turbulence virtually the whole of our national life throughout their term of office <e> <s> in particular that has been achieved by the prime minister and her style of government <e>", "<cs> my lords while the technical arguments that we have heard about money supply are very interesting is it not a fact that government policy of controlling money supply in the economy has gone completely awry in that despite high interest rates credit expansion has gone on apace <e> <s> will the minister ask his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to get rid of that moribund policy

about this fraud <e> <s> it amounts to at least million a year a sum that would be sufficient if it occurred in this country to bring down the government <e> <s> will he urge upon his right honourable friends and indeed on the commission that this is a matter which has to be cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that naturally i welcome the fact that honda has decided to invest more in swindon a constituency which i represented and in which i am still most interested <e> <s> can he give the net total of new jobs and say whether what was called the pressed steel fisher plant will

past few years <e> <s> is he also aware that not only do they constitute a danger by the accidents they have but that they are also pushing up speed generally as other traffic strives to pass the convoys of lorries hogging our motorways <e> <s> will he take this matter seriously and impose the speed limiters which have been a great success on coaches <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his statement that the number of convictions for speeding by heavy lorries has gone down will be greeted by many of us with some astonishment <e> <s> is it not a fact that the reason for this drop in convictions is that the police are very concerned about the danger of lorries being parked on the hard shoulder with consequent danger to other traffic and that lorries are therefore allowed to get away with speeding when perhaps they ought not to be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his orginal answer smacks of complacency <e> <s> some of us believe that a deficit of billion does matter <e> <s> is it not a fact that the deficit although financed from abroad depends upon borrowing and that therefore interest rates here must be high which undermines investment in our manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that i understand perfectly the difficulties of enforcement <e> <s> however is he also aware that some of our three-lane motorways have become two-lane motorways because of the failure and refusal of motorists and indeed lorry drivers to use the inside lane except when overtaking <e> <s> would it be possible to put messages on bridges or signposts at the side of motorways reminding motorists and lorry drivers that they should use the inside lane except when overtaking <e> <s> is it the governments policy to introduce into the driving test a test of motoring skills on motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his sympathetic response to my question <e> <s> will he reconsider the idea of notices at the sides of motorways <e> <s> these need not clutter up the motorway more than it is already cluttered <e> <s> all that need be done is to attach signs to existing signs and to bridges <e>

suspicions as to whether the government are serious about their new green image <e> <s> one way they could expel those doubts would be to accept this amendment which is extremely important in the

country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in case it should be thought that my noble friend lord houghton was alone in the views he expressed about this particular matter i must tell him that he has considerable support <e> <s> in spite of what the noble lord lord elton said in defence of the system it is a fact that when anything fundamental needs to be decided

had anything to do with the electricity supply industry and nuclear power over a period of time <e> <s> the minister will know that on many occasions figures supplied by the cegb to the sizewell inquiry and to the energy select committee in another place gave the impression that the magnox stations were efficient and that they produced electricity at lower cost than coal-fired stations <e>

the blue <e> <s> the house was shocked by the announcement bearing in mind that the opportunity had been given some time before that announcement for the government to give a proper reply to amendments that were moved from this side of the house by the noble earl lord halsbury which would have sought to put the nuclear matter right <e> <s> but no such arguments were then adduced <e> <s> yesterday we were faced with the proposition that because of the huge costs associated with the magnox power stations which were apparently not known before they should be excluded from the sale <e> <s> we must consider whether that information has been available over a long period of time and has been concealed from parliament and the public <e> <s> that must be the case because over a long period of time arguments have been adduced in favour of nuclear power which show that the magnox stations were viable and in relation to the cost of electricity produced were competitive by comparison with coal-fired stations <e> <s> it now appears that that was never so <e>", "<cs> my lords it may very well be that the order will be an affirmative order <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord renton knows whether it is an affirmative or a negative order it is unamendable <e> <s> no order is amendable <e> <s> therefore this house will not be able to have any influence at all <e> <s> it is in the

perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to intervene <e> <s> the point that i was making was that over a very long period of time various authorities including the select committee on energy of the other place of which i was a member repeatedly asked for correct information <e> <s> reference was repeatedly made to decommissioning costs <e> <s> despite that we were repeatedly told that the magnox power stations and indeed the agrs at a later stage were very competitive with coal <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that when the minister studies <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be assured that in relation to the provision of additional facilities and additional runway capacity in the south-east the environment of the people living around airports and under flight paths will be given equal consideration with the interests of people flying above them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the chancellor and his estimates have become a laughing stock throughout the world <e> <s> is it not also a fact that great damage is being caused to sterling and to this countrys economy by the continuing disagreement between the prime minister who is also first lord of the treasury and the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> when can we expect the government to act in unity <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has just told us that privatisation brings prices down <e> <s> is it not a fact that already as a result of privatisation electricity prices have gone up by per cent <e> <s> is it not a fact that the new arrangements which have been made with the industry are designed to accomodate its fears of competition and also to accommodate those in the city who fear particularly with nuclear generation that electricity will be a bad buy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the government have broken faith with their own savers <e> <s> is it not a fact that the government are not only discouraging people from saving but because of their monopoly in respect of the payment of interest gross rather than net they are cheating some of the people who most need money namely the poor <e> <s> an example is national savings income bonds which are on three months notice and which pay net only per cent <e> <s> anybody going to a building society can obtain more than that also paid net <e> <s> it seems to me that the government who i hope will take this into account have recognised their monopoly position and in fact are defrauding their savers <e>", "<cs> my lords many people in this country wonder what on earth the quality of our water and of our beaches has to do

listening tory government will be grand to perceive <e> <s> however is he aware that we would have wished that the government had listened during the passage of the bill through this house and another place and had not merely responded to tory members of parliament who were in danger of losing their seats if nothing had been done <e> <s> that is what listening really means <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord can assure us that in future they will listen while issues are being debated in this house and in another place <e> <s> will he also tell the house what steps are being taken to remove the bewilderment among ordinary ratepayers and potential poll tax payers who quite frankly do not understand what this is all about <e> <s> they have no idea what they will be called upon to pay <e> <s>

requirements i feel also for all those millions of people up and down the country who were previously bewildered and have now had their bewilderment even more confounded <e>", "<cs> in spite of the admirable and sensitive way in which my noble friend introduced the amendment i feel that i cannot support what is proposed largely for the reasons which were outlined by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> moreover if the amendment were passed it would be misunderstood <e> <s> it would be misunderstood by employers and it would certainly be misunderstood by employees on the shop floor <e> <s> i say that because it would be taken to mean that the only protection which is to be given to people with a disease applies to a particular disease which in the view of most people is personally avoidable <e> <s> we know that that is not so <e> <s> we know that aids can be contracted by haemophiliacs by people who work in hospitals and by other means but it is perceived by the employee and employer as a disease which in the main is avoidable <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment not only for the reasons given by my noble friend but also because i happen to believe no doubt i shall be called a male chauvinist pig that working in mines is undesirable for women and indeed for anybody <e> <s> when i was a young man living in bromley and engaged in local politics i used to attend meetings which were held regularly by harold macmillan <e> <s> at every meeting there was a little old lady sitting on one of the front seats <e> <s> she used to say weve heard everything you had to say mr macmillan but what are you going to do about the pit ponies <e> <s> mr macmillan used to reply sympathetically as he replied sympathetically to everyone <e> <s> this went on and on because the lady was concerned that ponies should not work in pits <e> <s> eventually she was successful <e> <s> it is now illegal for ponies to be employed in the pits <e>", "<cs> i am obliged for my noble friends intervention <e> <s> the ponies were eventually brought up from the pits and put out to graze <e> <s> now in we are being asked to pass not legislation to allow ponies to be re-employed in the pits but legislation to allow women to be employed in the pits <e> <s> we have not made much progress if we say that it is okay for women to be employed in the pits but not for ponies <e>", "<cs> that is an excellent point which i shall take into consideration <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble baroness appears to be quite content that women should work down the mines <e> <s> there are areas where we should not endeavour to extend the employment of women and young persons <e> <s> the pits are one of those areas <e> <s> although i appreciate all the arguments about equality and agree with equality of opportunity there comes a point when we ought to make a stand so that it is not necessary for men or women to work underground to win the coal and all that goes with it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord specifically mentioned a woman with mining engineering qualifications <e> <s> it seems to me that he was saying although perhaps i misunderstood him that in certain circumstances because the woman had trained for that job and had such a <e>", "<cs> the amendment certainly is not acceptable to me <e> <s> it may very well be acceptable to my front bench but in my view in proposing such an amendment and such legislation we simply get ourselves into an awful mess <e> <s> what is it that is proposed <e> <s> first et is proposed to exempt people who are of the sikh religion from wearing something for their own safety and indeed the safety of their whole operation <e> <s> that is discrimination <e> <s> one cannot get away from it <e> <s> it is discrimination in favour of one particular religion <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not accept that that is an absurd state of affairs and that before long he will have representations from sikhs working in situations other than construction sites <e> <s> that is why my colleagues and i believe that this needs further thought <e> <s> otherwise we shall find the government coming forward again <e> <s> they will have representations because a given number of orthodox sikhs want exemption for sites other than construction sites <e> <s> i urge him to think about it <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i have stayed to do so because i received a letter only last week from a former constituent <e> <s> he applied for a job as a warden of a complex housing people of an older generation although not an old peoples home <e> <s> all the experience necessary was available <e> <s> the application was sent and the person concerned was refused only because he was years of age <e> <s> there was no other reason

will receive permission and ordering goods worth hundreds of millions of pounds of public money <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that there are many people who are sick and tired of having to move their clocks forward in the spring and back in the autumn <e> <s> they see it as a ridiculous system and would like to go back to the period between and when we experimented with british standard time <e> <s> in the light of present evidence that there are more accidents in the evening that was one of the arguments which at that time was not properly researched would it not now be sensible to have a standard time throughout the country so that everyone knows where they are all the way through and does not lose or gain any sleep miss appointments or god knows what <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the minister and the government understand the fact that while coal imports may now be cheaper than home-produced coal it may well be that at a later stage when perfectly satisfactory british coal mines have been closed down and there is a shortage of home-produced coal we shall be under price pressure from those importing and wishing to import more coal <e> <s> coal is a strategic industry and we allow it to decline at the countrys peril <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the government will not put the countrys fuel supplies in peril <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble

order which has serious implications next wednesday <e> <s> however does not the noble viscount agree that it is intolerable that a court sitting in a foreign land can instruct the british parliament

subordinate to the european commission and the european court and is no longer able to pass legislation unhampered and unhindered to protect the interests of british workers <e>", "<cs> my lords is

possible this kind of thing happening <e>", "<cs> my lords will the judicial inquiry take into account the conduct of the case itself <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl dispel the idea that joining the erm is a panacea for all our economic ills <e> <s> because it is not <e> <s> moreover will he agree that over the past few months and indeed years we have been shadowing the deutschemark

the past <e> <s> further would not the right course for the prime minister to take be to sack nigel lawson <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord underhill i cannot see why there is such urgency about bringing forward the order <e> <s> it appears that other people in another place are of the same opinion because this afternoon the question of whether the order should be proceeded with was raised by mr taylor the honourable member for southend east <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am surprised by that answer <e> <s> i recently had personal experience of a local authority which has decided to protect a line along private properties without consulting or informing the owners involved <e> <s> is it not unacceptable that people should suddenly find when they want to sell their houses that the search shows that their houses are blighted <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the noble lord will have another look at the problem because i rather think that he is misinformed about the whole matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if a private developer has designs on the property of a private individual or a corporate owner of the property not only has he but the local authority also has to inform the owner of that land <e> <s> the same is not true in the case of local authorities <e> <s> since we have a government which believes in individual freedom and a property-owning democracy ought we not to have equity between the public and the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord appears to be saying that in relation to

practice for men which expressly tells them that they should be protective of women and should <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness lady seear has answered the question posed by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter namely that my noble friend proposes the amendment in this form because he is desperately anxious to achieve something as regards this problem

the sikhs will be exempted from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord for giving way but can he say whether in the regulations there will be an exemption from wearing safety helmets on health grounds <e> <s> if there is no exemption will those employees not be discriminated against in the matter of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all obliged to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> however perhaps he would go a little further and say what would be the position of an employer who did not go as far as dismissing a sikh because he refused to wear a safety helmet but who for example said to a sikh who refused to wear a safety helmet when he was working with other people that he may not work on that project and in that situation <e> <s>

discrimination <e> <s> perhaps we can hear the answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords detriment is very hard to define <e> <s> for example suppose the job involved overtime and the man had lost overtime because he would not wear a safety helmet <e> <s> is that the kind of detriment about which we are talking <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us whether a discussion between the

united nations by saying that nuclear energy was the way to solve the energy crisis and global warming <e> <s> is it not now clear that central to a policy on global warming and on energy efficiency

am coming to a conclusion <e> <s> but i urge the government in the interests of good government and of democracy to take on board the points that have been made this afternoon <e> <s> i hope that they will arrange for a public inquiry to be held <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord clear up one matter <e> <s> it arose from an answer to my noble friend <e> <s> he appeared to suggest that the only reason why the scottish nuclear industry was being hived off into a separate publicly-owned company was because the english nuclear power industry was being hived off <e> <s> he appeared to be saying that it was all right in scotland they were making a profit there and everything was hunky-dory and that the only reason for hiving off the industry in scotland was because it had to be done in england <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that with the appointment of a new chancellor many of us expected to see a change from the policies which have so patently failed up to now <e> <s> are the government not aware that the continuing problem is the growth of credit <e> <s> will they now take some direct action on credit and require the banks and financial institutions to make special deposits with the bank of england <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many people are extremely concerned about the length of time this matter is taking <e> <s> they believe that

head in this country <e> <s> i hope therefore that the government will stamp on the matter quickly and firmly <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the leader of the house not agree that it was extreme moderation between the years and which allowed hitler to gain ascendancy <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of the statement the noble earl said that the government must stick to the policies

way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is raising great doubts in the minds of members opposite i do not know about his noble friends <e> <s> surely the whole objective of the government in privatising the industry was to induce competition and to reduce costs <e> <s> i thought that that was what it was all about <e> <s> now he is telling us that that is not so certainly in relation to

a fact that people who drink and drive who are breath tested and who then have further blood or urine tests may well be allowed to continue to drive on the roads for weeks and months after detection

seear says the figures for christmas drinking and driving are quite appalling <e> <s> does he agree that one of the reasons why the figures are so appalling is the enormous cost of non-alcoholic and

non-alcoholic drinks at considerably reduced prices <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that only a short time ago senor marin the <e>", "<cs> my lords in her reply to my noble friend about the

government and their handling of the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that in this country we suffer from a torrent of regulations and directives which constitute an onerous burden on the british public and british business <e> <s> does she agree that it is about time that we had a close season on these regulations and directives <e>", "<cs> my lords following on the question asked by my noble friend lord callaghan has the minister seen reports that it is estimated that iraq will be able to withstand sanctions for as long as months <e> <s> has he also seen other reports that iraq is now capable of producing not only chemical weapons but also biological ones <e> <s> in addition iraq may well have the ability to deliver such weapons <e> <s> is it not a fact that as well as causing strains within the alliance the longer the crisis continues the greaten the length of time that will be given to saddam hussein and the iraqis further to develop biological and chemical weapons to the detriment of the alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the order <e> <s> i heard the ministers explanation of the order but nevertheless i am no convinced that british nationals or for that matter other nationals should be exempt from tax because they are employed by an international organisation <e> <s> after all they are citizens of one country or another and they presumably enjoy all the benefits that flow from the taxation of the citizens of that country <e> <s> as they will live in the country of their nationality most of the time the benefits gained from the taxpayers of that country will flow to them <e> <s> i cannot understand why those people should be exempt from taxation in this way <e> <s> i appreciate that this is a matter of international protocol but nevertheless i should like to discover whether the level of remuneration or the retainer as opposed to the allowances is adjusted because no tax is paid <e> <s> if that is not the case why should these people enjoy a privilege that no other citizen except perhaps the queen <e> <s> enjoys <e>", "<cs> my lords i first congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and his colleagues on tackling a problem which is a legal and social minefield <e> <s> we have not yet had the opportunity to see the white paper but presumably there will be equality in treatment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord used the masculine gender but will he confirm that the mother and father will be equally responsible particularly bearing in mind that quite rightly women have careers and are just as capable of leaving their families as men <e>", "<cs> my lords i also thank the noble lord the leader of the house for the statement which he repeated <e> <s> does he on behalf of the government agree with the canadians when they say that if the uruguay round collapses it will result in a trade war and slump <e> <s> if that happens will it not be as a result of the isolationism of france and germany and their narrow fortress europe attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may bring the noble lord back to the government rather than to the opposition <e> <s> i should like to ask him a short question <e> <s> bearing in mind that the statement made many other forecasts can he give any estimate of the trend of interest rates over the next months and the next year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as a former employee of the electricity supply industry and having had quite a lot to do with the negotiating process in that industry in my view wages and salaries in that industry and i hope the noble lord will agree with this are certainly a matter for discussion and decision between the trade unions and the management of that industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the noble lord lord brougham in the problems that he had last friday on the m <e> <s> i believe the delay was due to a lorry crashing and burning out on a contraflow section <e> <s> it will give the noble lord no pleasure to learn that that same accident not only caused a -mile tailback on the m but completely seized up the traffic in reading and newbury for the whole of friday evening indeed until very late in the evening <e> <s> therefore it is clear that measures must be taken to avoid such accidents occurring and during the course of my speech i shall put forward some suggestions which i hope will achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl referred to the fact that there is only one smoking compartment on his train <e> <s> i sympathise with him <e> <s> i believe that there ought to be far more smoking carriages as smokers represent per cent <e> <s> of the population <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the present recession is as a result of the crass incompetence of the previous chancellor of the exchequer in unleashing an unprecedented consumer and credit boom <e> <s> will the noble lord tell the house whether he believes that our entry into the erm will or will not cause a much deeper and longer recession with more unemployment than would have been the case had we not joined <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that it is rather worrying that the number of people employed in manufacturing is only about one-third of those in other work <e> <s> does he further agree that the figures published yesterday show an overall reduction in gdp <e> <s> does he accept that the reduction in manufacturing capacity has been quite enormous which augurs ill for the future economy of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords although i commend its diligence and congratulate the select committee on a well written report nevertheless i cannot welcome it <e> <s> in my view its recommendations compromise the remaining freedom and independence of the united kingdom <e> <s> too much power has already been ceded to institutions outside this country and not under the control of the british people <e> <s> too many decisions are being taken which are not in british interests but in favour of countries whose interests are inimical to ours <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not rubbish <e> <s> it is far too easy to say there is europe there is your little market <e> <s> concentrate on that <e> <s> dont worry about anyone else <e> <s> the wide world consists of million people not million people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there was a general impression that saudi arabia and the kuwait government in exile would make contributions to the cost of the deployment of british and american troops <e> <s> can the minister say whether negotiations have taken place and how near to completion they are <e>", "<cs> my lords the review does not seem to have been very well received by all members of the conservative party or of the government <e> <s> bearing in mind the revelation by mr lawson that he had reported his view that the poll tax was both unworkable and electorally disastrous will the noble baroness say what alterations are likely to be made by the candidates for prime minister <e> <s> will she also say whether we are now to be faced with the ultimate paradox that having got rid of the thatcher the government might now introduce a roof tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise a point about privileges <e> <s> it is no privilege to sit on this particular bench because there is a roaring cold draught <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the fact that many complaints have been made nothing has been done <e> <s> in order that we may become a little more privileged will the chairman of committees make representations to the authorities to ensure that the problem is dealt with and that we may have a little warmth <e>"]
