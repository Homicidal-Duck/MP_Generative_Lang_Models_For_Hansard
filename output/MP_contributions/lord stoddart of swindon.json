["<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i should like to reply briefly to one or two of the points that were made by the noble lord lord cockfield <e> <s> of course one understands that political parties put forward manifestos at a general election and one also understands that they may very well wish to put and indeed perhaps should put those manifesto commitments into operation <e> <s> but i am sure that the noble lord was not suggesting that the conservatives won the general election on the basis that they had gone to the country with the proposition to privatise bt and to sell per cent <e> <s> of the shares on the market <e> <s> i feel quite sure that had he put that proposition to the electorate and that was the only proposition the government would probably have lost and we should now be sitting on their side of the house <e> <s> the general election was fought on quite different matters and the electorate made their decision on quite different grounds from the privatisation or otherwise of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful and the house will be grateful to the noble earl the minister for repeating as a statement the answer to a private notice question which was asked in another place this afternoon <e> <s> but is he aware that there is growing concern about the escalating impact of the dispute in industry and employment not only in the steel industry but in other industries as well <e> <s> in those circumstances is not this dispute not a merely local dispute between the national coal board and the national union of mineworkers but a national issue since the effects on the total economy could be very grave indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may refer the noble earl to some of his previous answers can he confirm that the trade unions which are now taking action are all in fact doing so to preserve jobs <e> <s> that is one of the main problems which faces the unions particularly the num and the nur and the actions they are taking now are in support of jobs nearly million of which have been destroyed by the government over the last four or five years <e>", "<cs> my lords although i welcome what the noble earl has said about the cost of warmth index and the governments attitude towards it can i have his assurance now that there will not be a repeat performance next year of what happened this year when the fuel industries were forced to increase prices against their will <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful for those figures <e> <s> however the noble earl will be aware that there has been some concern lately about contracts which have been placed not in this country but abroad <e> <s> could he comment on the placing of a contract by sun oil for an oil rig in sweden rather than in this country and what effect that will have on jobs <e> <s> could he also comment on the cancellation of the oil pipeline by shell which in fact will cost jobs in hartlepool and bring about considerable distress in that particular area <e> <s> will he finally say whether the per cent <e> <s> british content is being upheld in every case and in the th round will the government be much firmer in enforcing the per cent <e> <s> british content because if not <e> <s> i rather fear that more work will go abroad <e>"]
