["<cs> my lords i think that it would be unwise of me to try to give an <e>", "<cs> my lords there is at least one matter on which i agreed with the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> it was probably the only thing i agreed with him about namely that it was a great pity that this debate was not spread over two days and that the two aspects of it which we have been trying to cover were not dealt with on separate days <e> <s> i cannot possibly attempt to do justice in trying to wind up a debate which involved speakers including at least six ex-senior figures from the foreign office and seven ex-senior figures from the ministry of defence including the most notable one in the shape of an ex-chief of the defence staff <e> <s> he gave us predictably a brilliantly well-informed and brilliantly well-argued speech even if i did not altogether like some of the content <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord and i hope that in the future some of the things that he has to say will be slightly more acceptable to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should begin by thanking the noble lord lord winterbottom for adding his personal good wishes to those of the noble lords lord shinwell and lord lloyd of kilgerran although in the latter two cases of course one has to understand that they were engaged in the very proper purpose of claiming for the all-party defence group such modest education in defence as i have been able to acquire over the last year or two <e> <s> as we might have expected we have had a very well-informed and wide-ranging debate which i think proves that we were right to find time for it <e> <s> from my point of view at any rate it has been very valuable to hear the opinions and suggestions of many noble lords even if it is a little premature for me to answer all the points in the way that i would wish and of course the added education and information which has been provided by lord shinwells group does very little to simplify the problem of producing adequate answers for a winding-up speech <e>", "<cs> successive british governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i ought to have a proper brief before i answer that question because either i must answer it authoritatively or i am liable to make a mistake <e> <s> so i will write to the noble lord if i may and if he wishes we will have the answer put in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept the noble lords statement that they are in an advanced stage of obsolescence <e> <s> it is recognised that they will have to be replaced in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not contest with the noble lord that the united states nuclear forces are more modern and no doubt more dangerous than our own <e> <s> but i would still like to point out to the noble lord that i think it would be exceedingly unpleasant to be on the receiving end of our polaris <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not been turned down <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised a fair number of questions which we have dealt with to some extent during the defence debates <e> <s> i would say this that we believe that our polaris force as modernised remains a weapon capable of inflicting damage on a potential adversary and they would not lightly put themselves in a position where that could happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to my previous reply i can only repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall get into some difficulties if i try to elaborate on exactly what is meant by modernising the polaris missile <e> <s> i can only repeat that the government are satisfied that the polaris missile will remain a deterrent into the s and we shall then have to look at what is to replace it <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is the philo <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked a fair number of questions in that one supplementary my lords and i shall do my best to reply <e> <s> taking the question of service pay which i think gives the lie to the general trend of his question the increase required for the increases in service pay which i think he will agree were not part of the last governments policy is million <e> <s> on top of that there is million extra for equipment <e> <s> i am only too painfully aware of certain inadequacies of equipment <e> <s> however i must point out to the noble lord that we have a more serious shortfall in manpower today than we have in equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the ministry of defence is concerned there would be no money for civil defence if there were i think it would come under another department <e>", "<cs> i have argued before with the noble lord about the effectiveness of our forces my lords but i am answering questions for this government not for three or four governments ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am hoping there will be an announcement concerning the territorial army quite shortly <e>", "<cs> i would not disagree with that at all my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am endeavouring to answer a question about spending more money on defence <e> <s> i hardly think the noble lords question has anything to do with that <e> <s> in so far as it would apply it would be directly to the contrary <e>", "<cs> that is a rather complicated question my lords <e> <s> it is true that local overseas allowances have been re-examined and restructured some have gone up and some have come down <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not disagree with the general sentiment that we have no wish to indulge in an arms race but i am addressing myself to the question whether this government are going to spend more money on defence and if so how and i would suggest that the question of the broad spectrum of disarmament is not relevant to that question at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord is correct in saying that there is a monopoly in gasoline production and distribution <e> <s> so far as the second part of his question is concerned certainly we would not wish to create a monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think a decision has been taken on the first part of the noble lords question <e> <s> but the intention would certainly be not to see control pass to foreign companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> that is what we would have expected <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall ignore the middle part of the noble lords question with which we would not necessarily agree <e> <s> i think that the question of the timing and the judgment of how to issue these shares is one of the things that still has to be decided <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which i asked when i was getting briefed for this question <e> <s> the short answer is that i think you have to distinguish between ownership by the government and ownership by individuals or institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not think i quite understood the drift of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this government would believe in wider share ownership <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would certainly agree with my noble friend if he is suggesting that my noble friend opposite is peddling a rather outdated philosophy <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am not entirely clear about the drift of the noble lords question <e> <s> the intention is not to realise the assets but to ensure a wider ownership of the assets which bnoc have acquired <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not read the report of the monopolies commission to which the noble lord refers but i just wonder whether he is getting muddled up between gas and petroleum <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady vickers is quite right <e> <s> the implications of the repudiation of the iranian contract upon the british army are being studied and certainly one option includes the possible purchase of additional tanks to strengthen our existing armoured capability in the light of the growing threat from the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an extremely relevant question <e> <s> this is one of the most important considerations <e> <s> the british army is extremely anxious that the introduction of what is known as mbt should not be delayed should it be decided to take some of these other tanks into service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that the day of the tank is over because if he is that is not the current perception as far as i am aware certainly of the british army or indeed almost any other army <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is inviting me to indulge in a philosophical discussion about the whole nature of tank warfare in the future which goes a little wider than the question <e> <s> what i am saying to him is that although anti-tank weapons are increasing in their lethality so is the defensive capability of tanks increasing and the current thinking is that you still need tanks and will need tanks right up to the turn of the century <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a simple <e>", "<cs> my lords this country certainly has no desire to indulge in an arms race he it conventional or be it nuclear <e> <s> the whole thrust of our policy and our intentions is to try to limit the arms race <e> <s> the fact remains that our potential adversaries are accelerating their rearmament programme if that is the right expression and they are rapidly overhauling us and mr brezhnevs offer frankly is not a very significant element in that equation <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly think it is necessary to keep all our options <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has had a long time in which to learn a great deal of wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords we have strayed a long way from the original question but i would not disagree with anything that the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords total grants of the order of million have been made under this scheme and the estimated savings run at about million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first remind my noble friend that a study group is in existence under the chairmanship of the minister for the navy and the question of delegated powers will undoubtedly be a matter which the study group will be investigating <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that the delegation of powers is a desirable objective but for example in respect of pay it is very far from simple when the present system which is not easy to alter involves another civil service department in pay negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure my noble friend that we shall be doing our best in the next few months and hope to report in the spring <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not so much a question of recruitment into the territorial army as one of allowing time for people to take up their training obligations <e> <s> however there are some major employers of whom the civil service is one who give special leave for territorial army members and that is something that we hope will commend itself to more employers <e> <s> we are looking at what steps we can take to encourage employers to support the territorial army in this way but we agree with the shapland report that it would be a mistake to introduce legislation on these lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord although naturally i am sorry that he does not find my first answer satisfactory <e> <s> we have had a comparatively short time in which to do anything about what we have found but we have acknowledged that there are some shortcomings in the territorial army equipment <e> <s> last june in this house i announced that we had begun to make enhancements in weapons at a cost of million <e> <s> we have set in hand a review of all territorial army equipment to see in what way it might be most cost-effectively enhanced <e>", "<cs> my lords the simplest answer that i can give the noble lord is that wireless equipment is one of the areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that suggestion i was not aware of that fact <e> <s> if he has a case about which he would care to let me know i shall be glad to look into it <e> <s> i suspect that it is more a question of money than of oil but i should like to learn <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord is being unduly gloomy <e> <s> i suggest that he will have an opportunity to address this question in the debate that my noble friend has tabled for next week <e> <s> we see two roles for the territorial army <e> <s> one is home defence and the other is in support of our forces overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords the second half of the noble lords question is rather easier to answer than the first <e> <s> i do not think that information on his first question is in my brief and i shall have to write to him on the question of numbers <e> <s> on training we are satisfied that it is possible and we are addressing ourselves to the problem of training the territorial army in the use of the equivalent weapons which are issued to the regular army <e> <s> that is the basic policy <e> <s> it is sometimes suggested that the territorial army should use inferior weapons on a sort of second-class basis <e> <s> that is not currently the policy which the ministry of defence would wish to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot imagine a better protagonist than the noble lord to do exactly what he is suggesting and i think it is an excellent idea <e>", "<cs> too little and too late <e> <s> but even if the regular forces were per cent <e> <s> manned we should still need the reserve forces to bring the regulars up to war strength in periods of tension <e> <s> this is their primary job and i have to say to the noble lord lord wigg that we simply do not agree that these reservists cannot be adequately trained to make a contribution in this way <e> <s> the government fully recognise the need to ensure that the reserve forces are capable of fulfilling this their first and vital role <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am in some difficulty <e> <s> this is a question which the government recognise they have to study <e> <s> it is quite a complicated issue as the noble lord knows very well and the noble lord lord peart mentioned <e> <s> for example the police are a matter for the home office and not the ministry of defence <e> <s> criticisms have been made in the past that overall responsibility needs to reside in one department or another and the noble lord himself has had experience of knowing that anything that involves more than one department is never a simple matter to resolve <e>", "<cs> my lords may i respond to those two comments first <e> <s> my right honourable friend has on a number of occasions in the last six weeks said that he would welcome a debate and i think we can take some credit in this house for having discussed this matter indeed we are going to have a further opportunity of discussing it next week <e> <s> i admit that it is not a major debate such as we would wish <e> <s> so far as the white paper is concerned i will draw the noble lords comments to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know it is sites in this country which are being discussed at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord and i are likely to agree about the military assessment so i will not attempt to convince him on that point <e> <s> we believe that this agreement asserts the solidarity and the unity of nato and that is really the easiest way to answer his misgivings about the increased risk to this country <e> <s> so far as a debate is concerned this is something which i think we should best take up through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it is of course the importance of the reiteration of the american identification with the defence of europe which pleases us in this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i have quite a number of questions from the noble lord lord shinwell which i will endeavour to deal with <e> <s> naturally we regret the situation which has grown up over the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that american internal politics have had anything to do with this <e> <s> this has been a european matter largely led by this country <e>", "<cs> my lords by next summer we shall have fighter aircraft available in a period of tension and a further will be added to that number in <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the last half of the noble lords question but is he suggesting that this is an inadequate number of aircraft to defend this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we should be satisfied but we are hopeful that we would get by <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is referring to an extremely important matter <e> <s> the improvement programme for the united kingdom air defence ground environment is a comprehensive modernisation plan for the ground radar chain for the control centres and for the communications links to support our aircraft <e> <s> this is a major programme which will be introduced over the next few years but because of its scope and size it is not easy to speed up this programme significantly <e> <s> however we are looking at every possible device which we might use to achieve that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said on a previous occasion that it is impossible to be satisfied or to be smug about this situation <e> <s> but we are doing our best and we think that we are making some improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking from memory but i believe that these were vcs which the air force department acquired and which they are converting to a tanker role <e> <s> they were previously passenger aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking about the air defence of this country and the principal problem that constrains us in adding rapidly to that capability is our ability to acquire aircraft to arrange for the support of the aircraft and to train the pilots to fly them <e> <s> in the short term it is very difficult to do anything which yields a rapid return <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting suggestion which the noble earl makes <e> <s> but my guess is that it would prove to be difficult to follow in the sense that nowadays the requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not communicated with the supreme allied commander europe on this issue but i very much doubt whether he is any happier than i am <e> <s> all i can say is that it is the best we can do at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is rather wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the noble lords sentiments <e> <s> they will be read with interest and acclaim in the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only go so far as to confirm that the use of trident missiles in a new class of submarine is one of the possible options being explored at the present time <e> <s> the question of expense is difficult to quantify for the very reason that it has not yet been established exactly what would be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to remind the house and the noble earl should not need reminding that we had an unstarred question from none other than himself on th december <e> <s> but i do agree that a full-dress debate at an early stage would be desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that this government would not be party to spending large sums of money on anything that was a complete waste of money <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is displaying his great command of the english language to lead us into a full-dress debate on the validity of the argument for having an independent nuclear deterrent and i do not think that i should repeat that again this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said plainly to the noble lord before that i do not agree with him on this issue <e> <s> the polaris is not out of date now <e> <s> it is being modernised to keep it credible and to keep it up to date for the s <e> <s> the trident missile system certainly would not be out of date in the s if we decided to go for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself unable to agree with the last part of what the noble lord said <e> <s> mind you i am not in the crystal ball business <e> <s> the last government found themselves frankly too embarrased to take a decision one way or the other on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> of course one did hear stories of i believe it was a danish minister of defence who said he had a record attached to his telephone which said i surrender i surrender <e> <s> we do not and i go along with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spent quite a <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not disagree with the noble lord on those aspirations i would go along with them completely <e>", "<cs> my lords to do justice to those questions i should need to give a sort of wind-up answer to a defence debate <e> <s> however i will do my best <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the soviet union has built up a massive superiority in conventional weapons <e> <s> that we are regarding it with stagnant wonder i would have to dispute with him and deny most hotly <e> <s> we believe that unquestionably conscription would offer good training <e> <s> the difficulty is that in a highly technical age such as the armed forces are in today we believe that professional training is required to exploit the sophisticated equipment which they are using and we believe further that the concept of having large numbers of conscripts standing around with nothing to do which basically would be the posture we should be in today would be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the first thing i should say to the noble lord is that we must understand clearly that the united states have not introduced the draft <e> <s> they have introduced a register in case they need the draft <e> <s> they have a problem of recruitment far greater than ours and i am happy to say that ours is smaller <e> <s> there is no need to be smug about it <e> <s> we are better placed than they are <e> <s> so far as balance is concerned while we are far from satisfied with the overall size and the equipment of our forces their balance is satisfactory at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree that this is a debatable question <e> <s> i have already explained that we believe that because of the sophisticated equipment which the forces use a longer-term technical training is the best use of our resources <e> <s> it is tempting to say that a register would be a useful hedge but one has to recognise that that would cost money and would require a large amount of manpower at a time when we are trying to reduce the number of government employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering this question i am talking about conscription so far as the ministry of defence is concerned <e> <s> i think the issue of employment is a completely separate one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly ready to believe and concede that there are advantages in conscription <e> <s> but so far as we are concerned we are totally convinced that the professional forces we have today are the right and appropriate forces for the equipment and the people that we have in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the empire may be decadent but it certainly has a will to defend itself and it has a very considerable capacity so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords among other things we are committed to providing i think it is soldiers to the central front of nato <e> <s> this we do <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer what i hope will be the last supplementary question <e> <s> we did have a debate as the noble lord will recall because i believe he participated in it about the reserve forces <e> <s> we do believe in building up the reserve forces <e> <s> we believe we are having some success in that direction and we are in the process of implementing the recommendations of the shapland report <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult for me to add much to the initial reply that i gave <e> <s> the fact is that there is no formal machinery <e> <s> obviously a great deal of informal consultation takes place between members of the nato alliance but the noble lord has to remember that nato is an alliance designed to protect western europe and it is a matter of some discussion whether we should have some other kind of alliance to deal with the areas outside western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering a question concerning natobut i quite agree with the noble lord that the track record of some of the alliances outside nato has not been wholly encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the dockyards do run recruitment campagins in close co-operation with the local schools and with the youth employment services <e> <s> all are fully aware that girls are accepted for training on an equal footing with men <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords a letter sent today to the general synod refers to the governments view that there are substantial benefits to be derived from defence sales but that this does not mean that the government consider that the united kingdom should export arms indiscriminately <e> <s> we follow a policy of responsible restraint and examine each case on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that the way in which a potential client <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be proper for me to go into individual cases <e> <s> there has recently been a case where arms sales to argentina have not been sanctioned <e> <s> as regards the general point about disclosure of arms sales the position is that it is extremely difficult to do a commercial deal if the customer is anxious that it should not be disclosed <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that one has to try to hold a balance between ones desire to conclude the deal and the desire to justify ones moral conscience <e> <s> on the whole at present we do our best to vet most carefully any deals which are proposed while at the same time doing what we believe is in the commercial and industrial interests of this country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords first i was not aware that we had supplied arms to the plo <e> <s> as regards the general point that the noble lord has made i should point out that in many cases even if we do not supply arms other people will do so <e> <s> we must use our judgment as to what is the balance of advantage for this country <e> <s> i believe that we do so reasonably well <e> <s> i may add that we try not to supply arms to people who we think potentially will use them against us <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot be responsible for another nations policy <e> <s> our policy is to pursue the arms sales which we believe to be in the interests of this country and we believe that those interests would be damaged if we had to disclose every sale in great detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is necessarily true at all <e> <s> we would not sell arms to what we would regard as repressive rgimes that is quite clear policy <e> <s> i do not say that we always get it right and rgimes change as indeed the nature of the amin rgime changed <e> <s> however we must bear in mind that in many cases arms sales open a door to commercial deals and ultimately exercise political influence which is beneficial to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can go all the way with the right reverend prelate <e> <s> we have diplomatic relations with countries but that does not necessarily imply that we approve of their regimes <e> <s> on arms our attitude is that unless there is a pressing reason and there is clear evidence of a repressive regime we arc inclined to pursue the sale of arms to them <e> <s> incidentally we believe that there is no reason to assume that another country does not have the right to buy arms to protect itself which is a point which is made in this pamphlet which gives rise to the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for what happens in another place <e> <s> i believe that there is no evidence that we sell arms to repressive rgimes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think if i may say so that the question of what athletes do or do not do has a great deal to do with the selling of arms <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult for me to answer for the party opposite <e> <s> indeed i doubt whether they would agree with me if i answered for them <e> <s> the noble earl is perfectly right that the proposed arms sales to iran would have offered a great deal of employment in this country most particularly in the royal ordnance factories which are now in serious difficulties as a result of the default on those contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could accept either of those propositions <e> <s> i do not accept that those are all repressive regimes and i am not at all sure that we arc in fact selling arms to all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord requests me to do i shall certainly study the american regulations <e> <s> i do not think that i could necessarily agree with the noble lord about the status of the plo and i am perfectly certain that we would not involve ourselves in supplying arms to terrorists of any complexion <e>", "<cs> my lords the potential value on the open market of our total stock of married quarters is of the order of million <e> <s> the value of the empty quarters is of the order of million and each empty quarter costs around per year in maintenance <e> <s> if i have done my arithmetic right i think maintenance of the empty quarters must therefore be costing us about million in addition to the disposal value which has been forgone <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is a lawyer so i have to be careful in answering his question <e> <s> they certainly do lease these houses for a limited period and therefore i would imagine they have the authority to do so <e> <s> the doubt in my mind is as to whether it is done through the psa or direct through the ministry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am enormously careful at all times and particularly about money <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no satisfactory explanation nor is there a brief one <e> <s> it is an accumulation of a number of factors <e> <s> the principal trouble at the present time is that increasingly members of the forces feel impelled to get into the property market at an early stage in their service careers because of the escalation in price which they see running away from them if they do not do so <e> <s> there are a number of contributory factors as to why the ministry has not reacted as fast as it might have wished on finding itself with this large number of empty married quarters on its hands <e>", "<cs> my lords this is something

original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm what the noble lord is saying from personal experience of some years ago but that is a slightly different matter from the particular question to

protracted procedures before bills become liable for payment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with what the noble lord has said and i can well believe that there are cases where contractors feel that argument over the details of a bill is used as an excuse for not paying any part of it <e> <s> i can only say that this is not done on instructions <e> <s> it is not a government policy <e>

instances i am sure that these will be followed up <e>", "<cs> i do not think i have any news for my noble friend my lords and if i do have any news i am certainly not in a position to give him any <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some temerity that i become involved in the metaphysics of public finance with an ex-treasury minister <e> <s> nevertheless i think that i can confirm the comment which my noble friend made but i should like to add that there was an overspend in the previous year which anticipated some of the expenditure that belonged to last year arid that is why there has been an adjustment <e>", "<cs> my lords to the extent that there has been a per cent <e> <s> rather than a per cent <e> <s> increase i must agree with my noble friend <e> <s> but i hope that we shall not become too deeply in argument about million on million <e>", "<cs> my lords there will have been a little bit of both <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to argue with my noble friend on the need to increase defence expenditure <e> <s> i have reiterated that many times <e> <s> my right honourable friend has on a number of occasions as indeed has the prime minister also reiterated our commitment to the per cent <e> <s> increase in real terms in the years ahead <e> <s> i daresay we ought to add in the best governmental tradition that that would be taking one year with another but next year it is intended to be per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords that question sounds deceptively simple but it is not <e> <s> if the noble lord is talking in terms of the actual figures of money spent i am sorry to say that i do not have them with me <e> <s> however i recall that if we make the comparisons on the basis of the two commonly used measures then the first is the question of the percentage of gnp and here again i speak from memory and my recollection is that this country is the highest <e> <s> if however we look at our contribution on a <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord paget of northampton for giving the house another opportunity to debate a defence topic <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord peart has kindly answered the first minutes of lord pagets speech for me so perhaps i may address myself to the question that he put on the order paper <e> <s> i have to confess some disappointment at the choice of national service <e> <s> i believe that those who are advocating the return of conscription while they do so with the best of intentions are sadly misguided <e> <s> i dare say that it will be a disappointment but possibly no surprise to the noble lord if i say that it is the governments view that it simply would not make sense for us to reintroduce national service <e> <s> i shall attempt to explain why we believe this <e>", "<cs> that is one thing at least upon which we agree my lords <e> <s> but i believe that some of these points are overlooked by those who argue that national service would bring social benefits <e> <s> i do not think the issues are very clear-cut <e> <s> of course school leavers would be employed for a year or two but the resulting increases <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that expectations and possibly expectations outside the government were exaggerated <e> <s> chinese trade negotiations are notorious for taking time to come to maturity <e> <s> prices are principally the concern of the companies themselves but i should add <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of establishing the existence of torture and the definition of torture is inevitably a very difficult and an emotional one <e> <s> after all it is worth reminding the noble lord that this country has been found guilty of practising torture <e> <s> i think that we would be rather keen to deny that but the fact is that we have been accused and indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord is referring to the countries involved in the defence sales of million or to the other countries that i was talking about <e> <s> i would hope and believe that the general answer to the question is yes but i have no doubt that the countries are not all perfect in this respect and here i can think of one country in particular <e> <s> however generally speaking the answer is yes and again generally speaking fairly specific arrangements are made to ensure that the money is successfully collected <e> <s> it is true that many of the iranian contracts were paid for ahead but perhaps we should not draw too many deductions from why that was done <e> <s> the fact is that it was done <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell the noble baroness that i was not saying we had torture in this country <e> <s> i was saying that other people have said that we have torture in this country and i was saying that to indicate to her that assertions about the existence of torture are extremely difficult to establish and it depends on who you are listening to <e> <s> very few people would agree on exactly what constitutes torture in the sense that the noble lord lord avebury used the expression <e> <s> that was my point <e>", "<cs> my lords to use the noble lords word i do not think that it is a little precipitate <e> <s> we continue to believe that with chemical weapons the proper thing to do is to outlaw them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the exact formal position relating to the second part of the noble lords question but certainly negotiations are taking place <e> <s> however i think that i had better write to him because he asked a very specific question which requires a fully accurate answer <e> <s> i am not sure whether it is nato as nato which is carrying out the negotiations <e> <s> unquestionably negotiations are underway <e> <s> dealing with the first part of his question i am grateful for it because of its implications <e> <s> the plain fact is that we do not have this capability and the soviet union has it and has shown no signs whatever of giving it up <e> <s> if anything if i may say so i think that it has shown the reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not wholly clear what question the noble lord is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the fact is that among nato forces the british forces probably have the best defensive equipment of all our allies <e> <s> but equally the fact remains that given a battlefield situation if we are threatened by an enemy who has a chemical-warfare attack capability and we have to take precautions such as shutting down all our vehicles or wearing what are affectionately known as noddy suits then we are operating at a disadvantage from there on in if the enemy does not feel so threatened and does not have to dress up and shutdown in a similar manner <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i have seen those reports but i cannot make any comment upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords we should certainly wish to consult our allies before we proceeded in any very positive manner on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously we shall be cautious in assessing any reports which appear in the press or elsewhere <e> <s> i have already said that i cannot comment in an authoritative manner on the reports that there have been so far <e> <s> but the fact is that at the present time soviet russia possesses this capability in considerable detail and down to quite a low level in its forces <e> <s> there is no dispute about this question <e> <s> it is manifestly a very unsatisfactory situation for the west to find itself in when a potential enemy possesses a capability in which we are totally lacking <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that naturally we would wish them to give it up but we have not in any way threatened them <e> <s> all we have done is to take defensive measures against a capability which the soviet union possesses and it has shown no signs whatever of wishing to do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful for that further information but again i cannot comment upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will of course remember the situation which took place when the last government were in office <e> <s> in the united kingdom tabled a draft text in the committee on disarmament which was intended to assist in negotiations to proscribe not just the use in war of chemical weapons but also their very possession <e> <s> we have supported the bilateral negotiations between the soviet union and the united states and we shall be playing an active part in discussions in a working group on chemical warfare which is currently being formed in the geneva committee on disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not proved possible to collaborate with any of our nato allies on the design of a complete tank <e> <s> we are however keeping in close touch with their plans and we shall take these fully into account when making decisions on future main battle tanks <e>", "<cs> my lords those two propositions are not necessarily one and the same <e> <s> the possibility of introducing a new tank has of course arisen as a result of the cancellation of the persian order for the tanks which were specially designed for use by the persians <e> <s> in the light of the growing threat from the warsaw pact countries we are considering the possibility of strengthening our existing armoured capability and the purchase of additional and replacement tanks is under consideration at the present time <e> <s> these might well be and indeed probably will be modified versions of the so-called shir ii tank <e> <s> the prospect of having a quarter fleet or a half fleet is one of the issues currently being discussed and the noble lord is perfectly right there are attractions in going for the half fleet replacement policy <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly true my lords and i very much wish to do more than pay lip service to that we have tried very hard <e> <s> with regard to the particular issue of tanks it has perhaps the worst track record of any attempt at collaboration among any that i can think of in that we spent seven years trying to work out a collaborative venture with the result that our new replacement main battle tank is now too far ahead in front of us for comfort <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to my noble friend i rather doubt it <e> <s> the technology involved in armoured fighting vehicles and in armoured personnel carriers is of a very different level from that in main battle tanks <e> <s> the package idea of one nation concentrating on a particular area is being explored for guided missiles for example <e> <s> but so far as main battle tanks are concerned i think that probably the best prospect for collaboration is to try to pick out various parts of the tanks such as the gun or the turret or the engine or the transmission or the suspension unit <e> <s> this is the line which looks most promising at present <e>", "<cs> my lords that co-operation has been sought and is actively being sought <e> <s> it has been sought for seven years but so far not successfully <e> <s> however we like many of our allies remain undeterred by this lack of success so far and we are at present continuing with our allies a very active exploration of the possibilities despite the disappointments in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the political will exists to achieve that aim and i dare say that i am not the first minister to have arrived in the department and said that it appears to be an affront that we have had so little success <e> <s> the fact remains that the political will is strong but some of the industrial lobbies so far have proved stronger <e>", "<cs> my one regret my lords is that the effectiveness of that body depends so heavily upon secrecy and surprise so that the best contribution we can make to their continuing effectiveness is to <e>", "<cs> my lords the degree of detailed knowledge and interest displayed by your lordships house in defence matters represents a rather daunting challenge for a minister attempting to answer a debate at this hour of the night <e> <s> without in any way committing my noble friends the leader of the house or the chief whip i must say that i certainly take the point about seeking a more manageable format for these debates because we are definitely trying to squeeze a gallon into a pint pot <e> <s> that is by way of warning your lordships that you had better make yourselves comfortable because i am not going to be brief <e>", "<cs> by implication my lords i hoped i had answered that question <e> <s> we intend to finance it as part of the defence budget <e> <s> however i have to go on to say that we do not yet have firm figures for the defence budget in the late eighties but if we take into account our announced plans for a per cent <e> <s> growth over the next few years we believe that these capital costs will be maintainable without a dramatic impact on the rest of the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i cannot comment on press reports about russian dismantling of part of their anti-ballistic missile systems <e> <s> secondly i would agree with the noble lord that if indeed those reports were true there is a degree of uncertainty as to what the reason might be but i have to say that it would be uncharacteristic of the russians unilaterally to undertake a permanent reduction in their military capability in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no intention of being negative about this <e> <s> we have always supported the united states and we have always supported the wish to see salt ratified <e> <s> but the noble lord knows as well as anyone else that recent events have made that a little more difficult than it was <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting into a difficult area <e> <s> i can only say that my brief says some hundreds of miles around moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords as those questions come from the noble lord and incidentally i am glad to see that he has survived a unilateral assault without any apparent damage of course we must treat them as a very interesting statement <e> <s> i have said i cannot comment on press statements but if the noble lord is right i think my answer gains some force <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware whether indeed the russians did announce it <e> <s> all that i have been aware of have been press reports on which i have said i cannot comment <e> <s> i can only repeat that we wish for disarmament but we wish for disarmament on a stable verifiable wholly credible basis and only on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords in the presence of the leader of the house i am of course happy to confirm what my noble friend has said <e> <s> one cannot pay too high an honour to both the leader and to the force which backed him up <e> <s> however lest it be thought that the government are taking refuge in some kind of bureaucratic bumbledom in delaying this matter i point out to my noble friend that it is a little more complicated than it first sounds <e> <s> in the first place it is not solely a matter for the ministry of defence <e> <s> for example the question arises as to whether civilians and i can think of one civilian in particular who might be eligible should be eligible and whether members of the commonwealth should be eligible and if they were of course the consultations would have to go quite wide <e>", "<cs> my lords i can agree with the last part of the noble lords question and i am distressed to hear that the royal observer corps feel that they are not properly recognised <e> <s> this is something which we shall be seeking to rectify in the course of this review <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the review of course is to examine the whole field of civil defence both from the home office point of view and from the ministry of defence point of view and to co-ordinate their two interests <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord that the intention would certainly not be in any way to diminish the activities of an organisation like the royal observer corps whose importance is readily recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question there is no particular date in mind at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the last part of the noble lords question but i shall write to him on the matter <e> <s> as regards the general principle it is of course true that the system of linking the retirement remuneration of five-star officers to half-pay rather than a pension arrangement is an added complication <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i should add very much to the letter the noble lord received from the prime minister back in may <e> <s> that was a private exchange <e> <s> but perhaps i can do my best <e> <s> first it would be anomalous to single out a small group even of the most senior officers and dare i say it <e> <s> the most highly respected officers <e> <s> anomalies if indeed they are anomalies and i accept that many people perceive that they are are regrettably exceedingly widespread <e> <s> it is estimated that it would cost something of the order of million a year to rectify them all <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write <e>", "<cs> my lords the country would perhaps have been deprived of the services of a very distinguished ex-minister had this particular development taken place <e> <s> i think that i should make the point that field marshals and five-star officers are to some extent in the forecasting business and part of the original question was whether they needed to be warned of the consequences of their promotion and i should not have thought that they did <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course unfortunate when any foreign manufacturer proves to be better able to meet a british requirement than a british manufacturer <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that we carried out an extremely careful examination of all the possible british equipments before going for this one <e> <s> as i have already pointed out to her the fire control system and the radar are made in this country <e> <s> on cost the total system is of the order of million for each complete equipment of which the gun accounts for about <e> <s> the first vessel is intended to be built in this country and so presumably the gun will be carried out on it <e> <s> i do not know where the other ships will be built <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm both aspects about which the noble lord has asked me <e> <s> it has to be said that the choice of the type of weapon is not without <e>", "<cs> my lords the immediate requirement is of course concentrated on the illegal immigrant problem <e> <s> the ships being used there at the present time are mostly very old they are the old ton-class minesweepers which are or years old and one rather unreliable high-speed vessel <e> <s> the equipment is required partly to enhance and replace the existing ageing vessels <e> <s> it is also judged that it is necessary in any potential confrontation to be able to give a good account of yourself in any vessel you might need in those waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is a little premature in assuming that these are necessarily going to be the figures for these dockyards <e> <s> the figures have yet to be submitted to my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place but when they are finally agreed upon then of course the contribution of devonport will be considered <e> <s> i should be the last person to underrate the importance of the devonport dockyard <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord on the value which is attached to the apprentice training scheme not only in the dockyards but in the engineering industry as a whole <e> <s> although it has nothing to do with the question may i say that i believe that engineers have been consistently underrated in this country and that something should be done about it <e> <s> the dockyards recognise this and as i said in my original answer they have consistently taken on more apprentices than they would normally require strictly for their own purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i said and would be rather surprised if i did that the dockyards study was to be published on st april <e> <s> it was not pub <e>", "<cs> my lords the two false strategic alerts last week were caused by errors in a computer in the north american air defence command <e> <s> as part of the rigorous verification and checking procedures the united kingdom ballistic missile early warning station at fylingdales was on each occasion contacted at once by the united states authorities <e> <s> fylingdales were able to confirm that they had no indication of a possible attack <e> <s> military action taken by the united states as a result of the alerts was entirely defensive and designed to safeguard their strategic forces <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the electoral campaigning of president carter is concerned that is somewhat wide of the original question <e> <s> i do not accept that our contribution to nato is overwhelming and out of proportion <e> <s> we believe that we pay our fair share <e> <s> we like to think that we show a lead to our allies but i do not think we would claim that our contribution was overwhelming <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that an alert can arise from a computer error <e> <s> this is what has happened <e> <s> i personally find it reassuring and i hope that this is the point that the noble lord is getting at that the checking procedures which took place in this case indicated that the alert was a false alarm <e> <s> therefore the whole system operated correctly <e> <s> i have no doubt that a few people missed a few heartbeats but i do not think that we should have any fear that aeroplanes took off with aggressive intent as a result of a false alarm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will share with the noble lord the sympathy that he extends towards the americans <e> <s> i recently saw the cloud that arose from the first eruption of this volcano <e> <s> however it is a dangerous over-simplification on the part of the noble lord to say that the united states is under a greater threat from this volcano than potentially from soviet missiles <e> <s> as of today i would agree with him <e> <s> in the longer term i fear that the soviet missile threat to the united states is a very real one <e>", "<cs> my lords when you are dealing with a total of something like minutes it is inevitable if you are going to have any effective retaliatory or warning system that if the warning comes up time is going to be very short <e> <s> the noble lord is trying to frighten us by talking about three minutes to nuclear war <e> <s> in a sense that is true but we were three minutes into the checking procedure and the checking procedure said relax this is a false alarm <e> <s> i find that basically quite reassuring <e> <s> nobody can say that it is impossible to get a whole series of errors compounded including human errors but any statistician would tell you that the checks and balances built into something of this kind are enormously extensive <e> <s> i do not know what the odds against a mistake must be but they must be very very large indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords our information is that computers in the soviet union are as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords and i am particularly grateful for the attention they direct to the question of peace negotiations because that is fundamental to our position in this decision <e> <s> we have said on many occasions that the alliance offer to negotiate is serious and remains open and it is up to the soviet union to respond <e> <s> these missiles will not be deployed until and we believe that this if anything will increase the possibility and will increase the pressure on the other side to enter into meaningful negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and i have engaged in what i can only describe as a dialogue of the deaf on this issue <e> <s> i do not wish to be discourteous to him because he is always extraordinarily courteous to me but the answer to his questions is no and i do not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords this is quite distinct from the decision on the polaris replacement <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that the decision to station the missiles was a unanimous decision of nato as a whole but certain countries have not yet agreed to the details of the stationing within their territories <e> <s> denmark and belgium are the most notable examples in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the intent is not an aggressive one <e> <s> we believe that the nato alliance as a whole had fallen seriously behind in regard to theatre nuclear weapons <e> <s> we believe that this decision to modernise these theatre nuclear weapons however regrettable it may be is necessary in order to redress the balance and to reduce the risk <e> <s> it in no way prejudicies our abiding wish to continue towards the ultimate goal of peace negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and gallant lord <e> <s> that question coming from so authoritative a source certainly reinforces the governments view and i agree in particular with the last part of what the noble and gallant lord said <e> <s> we believe that if anything the enhancement of the theatre nuclear weapon capability of nato as a whole and of this country in particular diminishes the chance of a nuclear attack upon this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> what he has said exactly reflects the view of the government that when it comes to a question of negotiating with the russians it is a regrettable fact that it is impossible to negotiate if one is in a position of weakness <e> <s> we believe that the best chance we have of bringing off successful negotiations which continues to be our primary aim is through demonstrating that we are willing to maintain our credibility if that is what it costs us to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for the robust words at the end of his remarks <e> <s> i did attempt to answer the noble lord lord gladwyn <e> <s> it is difficult to postulate exactly the situation under which any nuclear missiles would be used but of course we and the americans too have always said that it is not our intention to indulge in a first strike <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord was referring to salt <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot exactly tell the noble lord that because apart from anything else i am not wholly certain as to what he means by his question <e> <s> one of the sites is near newbury <e> <s> the other site is near huntingdon in cambridge <e> <s> i suppose that the noble lord would regard those as well-populated towns <e> <s> i think that the sites are in the order of about miles distant from the respective towns mentioned <e> <s> perhaps it would be opportune for me to say that the intention would be in moments of crisis to deploy the missiles out from these bases for quite a considerable distance of the order of miles rather than one or two miles <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> it is described as a theatre nuclear weapon which means to say that it is being used in a battlefield sense <e> <s> that postulates that some kind of hostilities have surely started already <e> <s> i do not know whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the last part of the noble lords question is somewhat removed from the statement but i would not dissent from what he has said <e> <s> as far as the ground launched cruise missiles themselves are concerned they are intended to be in response to an enhanced threat from the other side <e> <s> we believe that it would he unwise and indeed dangerous not to counter an enhancement of the threat from the other side and this is the intention in the stationing of the ground launched cruise missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the last part of that question is concerned there is no question of the british being in a position to take a unilateral decision to fire the weapons if that is what i understood my noble friend to ask me <e> <s> this arrangement has obtained ever since at the time of the government under mr attlee and the arrangement has not been altered although the weapons themselves have been altered <e> <s> the actual firing of the missiles could not take place without the necessary political authority under the same arrangement as has obtained ever since <e> <s> as i have said before the question of the use of these bases is a matter of joint decision between the united states and the united kingdom authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not follow the noble lord lord leonard if he will forgive me into the politics of northern ireland <e> <s> i am wholly in sympathy with him in saying that this appears to be nugatory expenditure on a large scale and we regret it and there are many better things we could use it for <e> <s> of course we have said many times that the activities that are demanded of the services in northern ireland do represent a very severe drain and put the services under great stress <e> <s> while i speak for the government i speak particularly for the ministry of defence and i do assure the noble lord that while i try and look sometimes for small benefits that the ministry of defence can derive from their activities in northern ireland we would wholeheartedly go along with him in wishing that the conflict could soon be brought to an end for all sorts of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords any mechanical system however carefully maintained can develop a fault <e> <s> any human system is of course subject to error <e> <s> first of all the people who man these systems are very highly trained and are very high grade people <e> <s> secondly there are many crosschecks between the mechanical and the human part of the system and we are satisfied that these cross-checks are reliable <e> <s> indeed i really believe that we should be reassured by what has happened rather than be unduly alarmed <e> <s> there were errors and those errors were picked up and i derived some reassurance from that <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that presidential hair appointments are very likely to be relevant to the fylingdales system although i completely accept the analogy that the noble lord was trying to draw <e> <s> we believe that these systems are as idiot-proof and as mechanically non-functional proof as they can be made <e> <s> they are duplicated and they are very carefully cross-checked <e> <s> i do not recall the particular failure that the noble lord has referred to but even if we had a failure of that kind we believe this system would remain safe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> there is no doubt that authority at the highest political level would be required for any offensive action to be initiated <e> <s> the very first thing that happens is a series of defensive actions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elwyn-jones has i believe before now cited another version of murphys law which says that if something can go wrong it will go wrong <e> <s> that is totally relevant to this question because these systems are planned on the basis of murphys law that something can go wrong and will go wrong <e> <s> we assume that that will happen and take the appropriate safeguards <e>", "<cs> my lords these are single key systems and this is a point that has been made before <e> <s> the united states like the united kingdom have committed themselves to consult with their allies time and circumstances permitting before releasing their weapons for use <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speak for the united states services but the point we are addressing ourselves to here is the possibility of computer errors at the centre and it is there that the highly trained staff are concentrated <e>", "<cs> my lords in my answer i did not in fact say that this was a cost-effective operation but we believe it is so i am grateful to the noble lord for his question on that point <e> <s> secondly i do not think there is any reason to believe that standards have deteriorated or will deteriorate as a result of this kind of operation <e> <s> thirdly i cannot see anything immoral or improper about an employer so organising his affairs that he makes a minimum contribution in the way that those who employ part-timers do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the situation is about pensions for people working for private contractors as part-time employees <e> <s> the noble lord was of course quite right in saying that redundancy payments will be made to these people and we expect to recover this redundancy expenditure over a period of about three years <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> clearly this was one of the considerations that had to be borne in mind in this approach <e> <s> there will be other establishments where a similar approach will be employed and security will be one of the things to be carefully safeguarded <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps the house is capable of judging better than i am how united the opposition is on this issue <e> <s> as to the care with which this decision is being taken i can assure the noble lord that it is being studied with the greatest possible care because i would not demur from the facts that he adduces regarding the magnitude of the decision that we face <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend in another place has said many times that he intends to publish a comprehensive document as soon as the governments decision is announced <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of a debate would be a subject to be discussed with the usual channels <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i would welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter once the decision has been announced <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the announcement of a decision does not in any way preclude the possibilities of continuing to discuss <e> <s> of course one of the difficulties about this type of decision is that the whole thing takes such a long time between the moment of decision and the moment of arrival of the hardware <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the two noble lords <e> <s> may i start by saying that the document which was produced today will answer much more specifically and clearly than any words of mine nearly all the points that have been raised and i daresay most of the points that will be raised during comments on this statement <e> <s> so far as the relative costs are concerned we have said before and we reiterate again that we do not expect the cost of this weapon system to exceed per cent <e> <s> of the defence budget in any year and in very many years it will be substantially less <e> <s> the operating cost is similar to the polaris cost and that is of the order of l per cent <e> <s> of the defence budget at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to take the noble lords points in reverse order because that makes it easier for my memory <e> <s> the chevaline programme will be relevant until the polaris is phased out in the early nineties as the trident comes in <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed true <e> <s> seventy per cent <e> <s> of the cost of this system is absorbed by the submarines and the warheads and that is the british part of the cost of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish in any way to minimise the importance of this decision or the scale and the cost of the buy and indeed the statement does quite the reverse but i think it is necessary to get it in proportion <e> <s> this equipment buy is in fact less than the cost of the tornado programme and it is relatively less than the cost of the v-bombers in their day <e> <s> so it should not be regarded as so overwhelming as some noble lords are inclined to make it out to be <e> <s> as yet no contract exists for the purchase it will he some time before the contractual details are settled <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord that i would be delighted and i am sure many other noble lords would be delighted if indeed there really were negotiations which made it possible to contemplate giving up a capability of this kind <e> <s> the fact is that there are no such negotiations and there is even very little prospect of any such negotiations and we believe that if we go soft on this particular option the chances of any successful negotiations will be greatly diminished <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not wholly certain what the noble lord means by that <e> <s> we intend to accommodate the purchase of trident within the expanded and expanding defence budget <e> <s> does that answer the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for a predictably robust comment if i may say so <e> <s> i do <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that if i were to go through <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend in another place has explained on a number of occasions that when the arguments had been assembled and assessed he would then make a statement and i believe he referred to a full comprehensive document <e> <s> it may be slim but i do assure the house that it is a full and comprehensive document <e> <s> however it is not one that one can very well read out in a statement <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we certainly are <e> <s> there is no question of the cancellation of the tornado programme <e> <s> all i am trying to indicate is that the tornado programme was a big and important programme and this is another big and important programme though not actually as big <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> those are exactly the sentiments of the government <e>", "<cs> yes i am my lords <e> <s> this again is something that is addressed in the document <e> <s> may summarise it simply by saying that we believe there is a real importance as seen from the other side and this is the important point in the existence of a second centre of decision-making <e> <s> this increases the chances of coming to a workable agreement with the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have announced that they have come to a decision <e> <s> i do not really believe that the contractual details are anything like as important as the main issue of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord poses the question whether we are satisfied <e> <s> the answer as i have said before in this house is that we are never satisfied <e> <s> we continue to do our best <e> <s> we believe that the equipment becoming available to the territorial army represents an improvement <e> <s> we do our best to keep the equipment for the territorials analogous to the equipment that they would be using serving alongside their fellows in the event of a conflict but we have to accept that any equipment allocated to the territorial army is inevitably equipment which is denied to the regular services so there are limitations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i agree with him entirely <e> <s> but we must be a little careful about going too far down this road <e> <s> we must not start using the auxiliary forces as some direct means of alleviating unemployment which is not their purpose although it is a useful side effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that unremitting effort will be required <e> <s> i can only say we have not done badly in our first year of office and that we intend to keep up the pace <e>", "<cs> my lords the b vehicle situation is not a good situation anywhere in the forces <e> <s> it is said and i have said it before that some of the vehicles being driven are older than the people driving them <e> <s> this is not a desirable state of affairs <e> <s> it is something that we shall rectify as soon as possible <e> <s> here again the main thrust of a re-equipment drive must be on the offensive front-line weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords supplementary question shows a considerable understanding of an important problem <e> <s> we talk as much as possible to all forms of industry <e> <s> government-owned industry tries to give a lead the csd tries to give a lead <e> <s> there are two problems <e> <s> one is the question of when it is convenient for industry to allow people to go off to attend camp and the other is the possibility of actual direct financial support by giving more holidays to compensate for the holidays given up through training in the auxiliary forces <e>", "<cs> my lords whether there is sufficient i do not know <e> <s> it is something that we are trying to improve upon <e> <s> it is not an unsatisfactory situation but i dare say that there is room for improvement <e> <s> we talk to people like the cbi about it <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been said many times that the matter of the control of these bases is a question of joint decision between the two governments in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time <e> <s> the bases may not be used without such a joint decision <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord calls that a veto or not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is easy to understand the anxieties and the concerns that have been expressed here today <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord kennet and like other noble lords in a sense i regret that this should be the occasion on which we are addressing such an important problem but of course we have addressed it before <e> <s> as the noble lord said we addressed it yesterday to some extent in a starred question and it has been referred to on a number of occasions in various debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i had better check exactly what the noble lord is saying to me and what i have said to him <e> <s> if i am wrong i will write to him <e> <s> i will grant him this <e> <s> clearly the polaris and poseidon missiles are not deployed on the soil of this country since they are submarine-launched systems but they are deployed from bases in this country and that is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add to what i said <e> <s> i think that the noble earl will have to await the outcome of the thorough investigation which is being made at the present time <e> <s> may i just point out that making an investigation of this kind is far from easy years after the event when a great many of the relevant records have been destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say that we have to be careful to distinguish between the situation which applies in the far east and the situation which applies in europe <e> <s> the geneva convention applied only to germany and <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is perfectly true that the statute of limitations would indeed legally apply but here again it would be prejudging the issue for me to pass comment on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the psa is something of a soft target in parliamentary debates particularly defence debates <e> <s> however while a number of people feel that the psa is unnecessarily bureaucratic it is extremely difficult to get any evidence that that is in fact the case <e> <s> i think i can reassure my noble friend that on the whole the practice would be to use local contractors as being the most cost-effective way of doing the job <e> <s> as far as recognition of the urgency of the matter is concerned i would make two further points <e> <s> first it has not been <e>", "<cs> that is a different question my lords although it is a question as i said that crops up on a number of occasions <e> <s> there should be no misunderstanding about this <e> <s> i think it is likely that all these contracts will be put out to private contractors <e> <s> i am not aware of a suitable government contractor who would undertake the work anyway certainly so far as this work is concerned <e>", "<cs> i do not think i could give an assurance of that nature my lords that would be a matter for the consortium and the manufacturers <e> <s> but it is predominantly a british consortium and i would imagine that the basis on which they went into the tender was therefore a british manufacturing base <e>", "<cs> my lords what i tried to explain to my noble friend is that there is a difficulty about letting the works services until one knows the exact dimensions of the equipment one intends to put inside and clearly one does not know the exact dimensions of the equipment until one has had the contract <e> <s> i can confirm that so far as the data processing equipment is concerned it is my understanding that per cent of the equipment is british but i have to remind my noble friend that regrettably some of the primary radar equipment will not be made in this country and that outside contractors have been successful <e>", "<cs> with the agreement of the committee i too will speak to the three amendments <e> <s> i totally understand the attitude that the noble lord is taking <e> <s> i have served in opposition and i am sure i would be taking a very similar line <e> <s> i agree with him that in principle governments should not be given more powers than are absolutely necessary to do the things which one conceives they should do <e> <s> i believe however that these powers are necessary <e> <s> i do not believe that they are dangerous <e> <s> we have a precedent for demonstrating that because all these powers are lifted from the new towns act <e> <s> he will find that through many of these amendments this is something which we will mention time and time again <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we were slightly doubtful as to what the exact intention of the noble lords amendment was and i do believe that no <e> <s> covers most of the points he has raised <e> <s> i suggest that i check the specific question he has asked me and perhaps we can come back to it when we get to no <e> <s> <e> <s> if i am going to give him a categorical assurance i want to make certain that i get it right <e> <s> as far as the other part of the amendment is concerned we do not believe that any additional provision is needed to enable the udc to enter into arrangements in connection with the provision of goods and services <e> <s> we think the udcs have the necessary powers <e> <s> rather what is needed is a provision to enable local authorities to enter into agency arrangements with the udcs which i believe is the noble lords point <e> <s> i think he will find that it is satisfactorily covered when we get to the later amendment <e>", "<cs> in one sense i am glad that a lawyer moved this amendment but in another i have to express some surprise <e> <s> my understanding is that this is essentially a lawyers point and i have two courses i can either read from what lord diamond used to call extensive notes or i can try to give a laymans summary of what i understand to be the situation <e> <s> i propose to do the latter because i think it will take a little less time but it may not convince the noble and learned lord who is an eminent lawyer <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is very persuasive but i have just explained that subsection was specifically put in by the draftsmen because they deemed it to be necessary and who am i to quarrel with the draftsmen <e> <s> but like noble lords opposite many is the time that i have read out incredible gobbledegook as i see it and it became the law of the land <e> <s> i think the best thing for me to do in the circumstances if noble lords would agree is to agree to write to them to try to convince them that the governments case is a sound one otherwise i think we would be detaining the committee for <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can reassure the noble lord <e> <s> here again the wording is very wide and has been based largely on the equivalent provision in the new towns act <e> <s> however i am advised that the present wording would enable the urban development corporation to contribute to expenditure incurred in the past and to expenditure incurred in negotiations for land <e> <s> therefore i must resist these amendments simply on the grounds that they are not necessary <e> <s> however perhaps i should add one further comment <e> <s> the power to contribute on the part of the urban development corporations is permissive <e> <s> they would have the powers to contribute to expenditure and the merits of the individual cases would clearly weigh heavily with them when considering each case <e>", "<cs> the governments objection to similar amendments which were put down to clauses and was that a legal requirement to consult might lead to delay in making designation orders <e> <s> it was thought that such a provision could constitute an unreasonable power to delay the establishment of the udcs and therefore could be potentially frustrating <e>", "<cs> we are getting into deep technical waters <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that he feels our amendment should go wider than it already does <e> <s> if he is <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that we agree the amendment in the meantime and that we undertake to come back if it needs further adjustment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to tell the noble lord that i have to resist the siren song of his logic <e> <s> again this is a slightly technical matter <e> <s> i do not think that the situation of statutory undertakers is quite the same as that of local authorities <e> <s> certainly the effect of this amendment takes us back again to the situation whereby the local authorities would be in a position if they so wished to frustrate <e>", "<cs> i did not want to say this but the noble lord lord ross of marnock claimed that he had spent many hours trying to find out what this was about <e> <s> may i suggest to him that he could have saved himself and the committee a lot of time if he had got in touch with us if he felt there was this error <e> <s> if he spent many hours on it he could have given us many hours notice so we could have dealt with this whole issue in a few seconds <e> <s> i am not trying to defend having errors <e> <s> this is a revising chamber and the noble lord is doing a jolly good job <e> <s> he could have done even better had he given us a chance to put it right <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for this amendment which is a useful contribution to the problem of ensuring a fair valuation of land to be acquired by the udcs <e> <s> however in fact it does not go quite far enough in dealing with the special situation of the urban development areas where development which could properly be regarded as part of the scheme underlying the compulsory acquisition has been or is to be carried out by other public authorities <e>", "<cs> i must say frankly to the noble lord that we have to resist this amendment <e> <s> we believe it would seriously erode the effectiveness of the compulsory purchase powers of the udcs and their ability to assemble land and buildings for redevelopment a point which we have touched on a number of times this evening <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will find it reassuring when i tell him that paragraph is a standard power which applies to authorities with powers of compulsory purchase and has done so for some time <e>", "<cs> i am not sufficiently familiar with the experience of these acts to be able to give the noble lord an unequivocal assurance of that kind <e> <s> i would say only two things <e> <s> first i deduce from the fact that these powers have existed for quite a long time without there having been an explosion that they must have proved reasonably satisfactory and secondly what i will happily do for the noble lord is discover exactly the detail of how this operates what the experience has been and let him know in the hope that it will be satisfactory to him <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to tell the noble lord that i have to resist all these amendments <e> <s> so far as the first amendment is concerned this is a straightforward reasonably commonsense point as it exists in the bill at the present time <e> <s> it does not make <e>", "<cs> we agree with the noble lord that it is very important for consultations to take place between the udc and the street works authority about standards of construction alignment and so on before the execution of street works <e> <s> it is our belief that this can be achieved administratively and that the way the amendment is drafted might require the udc to consult the street works authority before the execution of works on each and every street that is proposed for adoption which could be onerous and would be unnecessary provided there was the degree of understanding between the two authorities about the lay-out and standards of roads in the urban development area <e> <s> i therefore hope we may persuade the noble lord that the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right in what he says but i have to disagree with him <e> <s> we believe that if the amendment were accepted the highway authority would insist on standards which while they might be appropriate to the area of street works as a whole might be unreasonable within the special circumstances of an urban development area <e> <s> essentially therefore we believe the amendment could be detrimental <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords feeling particularly in view of the fact that he chose to divide against clause <e> <s> i cannot pretend to understand every word of the amendment but i am informed that it is essentially a technical amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord can accept that it is that and nothing else <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that this amendment is unacceptable to the government since the powers contained in part xvi of this bill do not in themselves wind up any local government organisations in a manner comparable with the reorganisation of local government and the reorganisation of london local government <e> <s> so we do not believe that there is any need for the complex legislative provisions that would be provided by this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not saying anything of the kind <e> <s> what i am saying is that this part of the bill does not wind up any organisation so you do not need to set up a complicated organisation to deal with the fact of what would happen if it did <e>", "<cs> what i am saying very simply is that this is not the place to tackle that particular problem if indeed the problem exists and i do not know that it necessarily will <e>", "<cs> here again much the same arguments apply <e> <s> we cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> we do not consider that the creation of urban development corporations will lead to a situation comparable to the reorganisation of local government <e> <s> if the london local authorities decide in view of the udc to wind up the ddo there will on the whole be savings in administrative costs which the udc will carry instead of the local authorities <e> <s> it would be doubly unfair if the udc also had to bear the transitional costs <e> <s> there is no provision of this type in the new towns act and we do not consider it necessary or appropriate in the case of urban development areas <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that that is <e>", "<cs> this is a fair point <e> <s> in practice i think one would envisage that the organisations we hope would be more active and will require a larger number of people to get on with the job than at the moment <e> <s> one does not envisage the kind of disruption to which the noble and learned lord refers <e>", "<cs> there is nothing wrong in principle with what the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> the question is whether it is the right way of doing it and whether it goes far enough <e> <s> there are quite a number of ways in which there might be other information that might be required and sometimes on a different time scale from the annual report <e> <s> what i suggest to the noble lord is that he bears in mind the point made by my noble friend lord bellwin when he was dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he referred to the new clause which is going to be introduced after clause in connection with the code of practice for the publication of information <e> <s> we shall be able to do a very much better job under the provisions of that section than we would by this amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot let the noble lord get away with the suggestion that we are not taking cognisance of the problem <e> <s> my noble friends department is engaged in discussions with the glc over the implications of the docklands udc for the staff who are now employed in the ddo <e> <s> but it would be quite inappropriate to establish a staff commission to deal with the relatively small number of staff involved <e> <s> it is something of the order of whereas in the case of the local authority analogy which the noble lord talked about it was million <e> <s> it really would be a sledgehammer to crack a nut nevertheless an awkward and not very agreeable nut <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is getting very dangerously near the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i can certainly agree with him to the extent that the bgc believes and we support it that gas should be used for premium purposes <e> <s> the noble lord would perhaps go a little further than the government would go down that particular road <e> <s> i was saying that we believe that the price mechanism is the best way in the longer-term and do not let us get into the question of how long we are talking about here to keep supply and demand reasonably in balance and of course we must prevent the profligate squandering of what all noble lords have mentioned tonight is a finite resource the production of which from the north sea will peak in the middle s on the best advice that i can find <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i am sorry that he felt insulted when i accused him of possibly postulating a quango <e> <s> but we must be very careful i shall leave it like that in following the american example on close regulation of energy prices <e> <s> i hear what my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls says and i am sure that the government are highly sympathetic to what he is suggesting <e> <s> however i must say to him that certainly looking at the long-term we must regard america as a frightening example of a situation into which we can get and from which they are finding great difficulty in extracting themselves <e> <s> therefore i am saying that generally we should not wish to follow the american example <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the noble lord reminded me <e> <s> in my wish to try to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain to what international convention the noble lord refers <e> <s> i would very much doubt whether we in this country would believe that the soviet union has not produced chemical weapons in the last years <e> <s> on the last part of the noble lords question i would agree with him that there is no completely irrefutable evidence of the use of these weapons but of their possession by the soviet union we are in no doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend referred to precisely the kind of misgivings that have been expressed on a number of occasions by a number of people in this country including myself at this dispatch box <e> <s> these are precisely the issues that we are addressing at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i would disagree with anything that the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> may i remind him and i have said it on a number of occasions here and i would not wish to bore the house that the united kingdom is committed to seeking an arms control solution of this problem <e> <s> we have backed that policy with initiatives <e> <s> in the united kingdom tabled a draft text in the committee on disarmament to assist in those negotiations <e> <s> that draft text would have proscribed not just the use of chemical weapons but as the noble lord says their possession <e> <s> of course the difficulty in getting any agreement with soviet russia on any of these issues is the problem of the soviet union accepting adequate verification <e> <s> most of these agreements are meaningless unless you have some means of ensuring that the other side is sticking to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i would defer to the noble lord in his knowledge of military history <e> <s> however i have to say two things to him <e> <s> i have to say first that it is hard to believe that the soviet union would bother to possess these weapons unless they had at least given consideration to the possibility of using them <e> <s> that being so i should also like to tell him that we have a very good <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could go quite so far as to give an undertaking to assemble all this information but i certainly hear what the noble lord has said <e> <s> indeed it is perfectly true that there have been a number of allegations at various times <e> <s> i shall try to discover exactly how solid the evidence is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful for that intervention coming as it does from someone with the authority of the noble and gallant lord <e> <s> again this is clearly one of the considerations that would have to be borne in mind in addressing this very difficult problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to repeat that we remain committed to the notion of this kind of disarmament if agreement could be reached <e> <s> we continue to exert every effort in that direction <e> <s> the problem is i repeat persuading the other side to permit the necessary measures of verification <e> <s> so far as the first half of the noble lords question is concerned i think it is an exaggeration to say that there is no defence <e> <s> we have good defensive equipment which certainly gives some measure of protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the noble lord is referring to the parity in nuclear weaponry <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of parity between ourselves and the soviet union so far as chemical warfare capability is concerned <e> <s> this is exactly the problem as i have been trying to explain to the house <e> <s> we do not have any offensive capability <e> <s> because we have no offensive capability and the other side do there has to be a temptation to them under certain circumstances to exercise the advantage that they enjoy <e> <s> we regard that as a very unhappy state of affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states has a very antiquated capability and the capability of that capability is questionable to say the least <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand the noble lord correctly he is suggesting that we might he asked to stockpile american chemical weapons in this country <e> <s> if that is so that has not arisen and it is a hypothetical situation with which i can hardly deal this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his extremely understanding response particularly in view of the fact that he has not yet had the opportunity to read the report <e> <s> the sentiments that he expresses are exactly those which are expressed in this report <e> <s> i can reassure him on one point i do not believe that his name appears in the report in any way <e> <s> i can also assure him that my honourable friend has taken a lot of trouble to check on what records were available <e> <s> i think that i shall have to inquire of my honourable friend regarding cabinet minutes <e> <s> the question of inflation does not really arise once one assumes that the arrangements were properly administered at the time and the question of the worthlessness or otherwise of camp currency is one of the matters which is addressed in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is referring to exactly the point to which i was addressing myself in the last paragraph of my answer which is to say that really we would be better advised now to look at what is happening today rather than try to rake over too many of the events of past history <e>", "<cs> my lords whether there were a large number of commissions is one of the difficulties <e> <s> certainly it is true that there must have been some omissions if omissions is the right word <e> <s> it is quite impossible now to establish that total fairness applied to everybody <e> <s> that is admitted <e> <s> on my friends suggestion about the fund i am sure that that is the kind of issue that my honourable friend intends to look into in the inquiry he has promised <e> <s> with regard to publicity he is meeting the members of the press at this moment to discuss these questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was a minister long enough to know that there are never any funds available in the treasury for anything <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that my noble friend recognises that the other ranks is a different question <e> <s> of course i shall be happy to answer any question that she puts down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> this is again a matter that could be included in any inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that our allies in nato were impressed by our ability to perform the reinforcement role which we had undertaken and i think they also particularly welcomed this demonstration of our commitment to defence on the european continent <e>", "<cs> my lords the exercise cost was in the region of million in excess of normal exercise costs and we believe that this was very well worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his question which shows considerable understanding of what <e>", "<cs> my lords these are two interesting ideas <e> <s> certainly a full analysis of the exercise will be made after spending that much money of course it would be necessary <e> <s> when the report has been compiled in the new year we shall have to consider how much of it could be presented both to the house and to the public at large and what would be the most effective way of doing it consistent with the security considerations which are bound to surround it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is asking me rather a technical question and i think this is exactly the sort of thing which will come out in further analysis <e> <s> i do not in fact know whether the reinforcement forces were using the kind of laser-guided weapons to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises both a general and a specific question <e> <s> so far as the general question is concerned i think the exercise demonstrated that there is an ability to provide the necessary transport to do the kind of reinforcement which is required <e> <s> i do not know the answer to the specific question raised by my noble friend but i am sure it has been considered <e> <s> i do recall that the americans have for some years considered the possibility of strengthening all the civil transport fleet but they have decided that even for them it would probably be a prohibitively expensive exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords my memory does not go back as far as the noble lords and i would not dispute his facts <e> <s> i do not know what numbers he is referring to but the hours we are talking about covered the whole of the reinforcement and i would imagine that some of the forces arrived there in less than hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend with the permission of the house to touch upon three particular elements of government defence policy at this stage and then later with the leave of the house i shall do my best to answer some of the specific points raised during the course of the debate although i cannot promise to do so when there is such an extensive list of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord who has just spoken particularly for his remarks about the high opinion he has formed of our service people <e> <s> it just shows that it is wonderful what a little education can do to stimulate the mind <e> <s> if i may say so he should have joined the group years ago <e> <s> defence debates in this house with due exception as far as i am concerned are renowned for their wisdom and the scope of the views expressed and this evening has been no exception <e> <s> the lateness of the hour is perhaps an indication of how many noble lords have contributed <e> <s> i should like first to thank them all for a particularly stimulating discussion which i hope will be widely read <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord cathcart for initiating this debate which he did so elegantly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is an intelligent man who has listened to many debates on this subject in this house and i really do not believe that i should need to tell him again that i do not agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred at some length and in some detail to a specific case which is being investigated <e> <s> even if it proves that one contractor has behaved improperly this would not necessarily invalidate the principle involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the first part of the noble lords supplementary question because i do not have before me the official estimates of the number of people who perished in the hiroshima case <e> <s> so far as the general thrust of the second part of his supplementary question is concerned i think this gets fairly technical <e> <s> in the first place the background radiation which exists is something like times as high as the radiation which has been caused by the accumulation of all the tests in the atmosphere in recent years <e> <s> the answer to the third part of his supplementary question is yes the government of china are well aware of our view that it would be desirable for all states to adhere to the treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere in outer space and under water of which this government is a depository <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the government are exercising all the influence they can on the government of china to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the feeling that the noble lord is asking us to intercede in areas which perhaps might apply to other members of this house rather better than to the government <e> <s> if we start talking about the effects of natural occurrences then no doubt they do have an effect <e> <s> but what i have been trying to say to the noble lord is that the effect of testing is insignificant in relation to the background radiation which exists <e> <s> the difficulty about these figures is that the calculations were derived from information about the effect on man of a very high level of radiation something like one thousand times the dose from fallout <e> <s> therefore it is very difficult to extrapolate backwards and draw the conclusions that are being suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords however much i might agree with the noble viscount i must say to him that that question is rather far from the original question and it is making the situation even more complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that encouraging response and i certainly do not intend to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> however i have certain remarks to make to him and i must say at the outset that i do not trust governments <e> <s> i do not trust them even when i am in them and i am not in this one any longer <e> <s> it is not satisfactory to resort to saying that we must have further discussions this point to my certain knowledge has been raised for about five years and even <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for his support <e> <s> i am of course particularly grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> there is no way in which we could refuse his offer of examining the amendment which the government intend to table for third reading <e> <s> from what he has said i think we have every reason to believe that it will be satisfactory in covering the point that we seek to make <e> <s> i confess to a very slight sense of nervousness when the government talk about abating charges <e> <s> this is a fairly good government approach to a problem such as this saying provided you recognise our right to be unreasonable we are prepared to say that we will after all be reasonable whereas we are seeking

collecting economies later <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend and i are as one on this purpose <e> <s> however i think that he will understand my slight nervousness when i hear him talking about agreements to abate charges <e>", "<cs> my lords it is never a very easy matter to follow the noble lord lord shinwell when he is in robust form as he obviously is this afternoon <e> <s> unlike him i have no difficulty in one respect in that i can give an unequivocal welcome to the noble lord lord mayhew and i am the first to do so from this side of the house <e> <s> i can only say to him that he

hope that it is a non-contentious bill which will commend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to my noble friend lord mansfield for the welcome he has given on behalf of the government to this bill and even more grateful for the additional help which he has proffered to us in tidying up any improvements which are needed to the drafting <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord ross of marnock was quite right this is not a government bill but as my noble friend lord mansfield said we have done our best to make sure that the general objectives of the bill are likely to be acceptable

viscount lord thurso <e>", "<cs> it is very satisfactory to be able to satisfy the noble lord lord ross of marnock in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in no doubt that we must accede to this request

reading debate on this bill <e> <s> these arguments were exhaustively covered at that time <e> <s> what is the noble earl trying to achieve by the speech that he is now making to the house which in

not alter the purpose of the bill and i accept the amendment gratefully <e>", "<cs> my lords it is heartening indeed to hear such an authoritative figure as the noble lord lord obrien adding his voice

as an underwriting name and indeed i think probably the first underwriting name to address your lordships this afternoon first thank the noble lord lord windlesham on behalf of the underwriting names

said he was sorry he had not had time to write a short letter <e> <s> the noble lord succeeded very well in summarising all the issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am but a humble underwriting name <e> <s>

to express my gratitude for the support i have received from all sides of the committee <e> <s> this is an extremely serious matter and it puts me in a difficult position <e> <s> i am very tempted by the suggestion made by the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> there is no doubt that when you are dealing with a government it concentrates their mind wonderfully if you move an amendment against them which they have then got to put right <e> <s> i have to say to the noble earl on the front bench that i find it rather extraordinary that in this committee quite late at night we are being asked to consider a bill while apparently the government have not thought of something as fundamental as the tax status of the commission they are proposing to set up <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble earl it is not much good thinking about it <e> <s> the government have written all this verbiage which we are having to wade through tonight <e> <s> we are wasting a great many peoples time

just come back to make the position quite clear <e> <s> the point is that we are trying to protect those staff who are being transferred <e> <s> that is understood but do we not probably need a separate rgime for any new staff that the commission takes on subsequently and one that would give them the flexibility that perhaps they need <e> <s> would the noble earl be receptive if we were able to devise an amendment at a later stage which would make that possible <e>", "<cs> as i understand if the noble earl is saying that if the commission had to meet redundancy payments it would be funded by the government in respect of that part of the redundancy payments which referred to the previous employment of a particular employee <e> <s> if that is what he is saying <e> <s> i am grateful to him and am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister three questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken before <e> <s> is it suggested that i have and that i am

precisely at the language which is used <e> <s> what my noble friend said was clearer and more unequivocal than what i thought he said at the committee stage <e> <s> but i agree with him this is a case where we have to read exactly what has been said and reserve our right to come back at third reading which i sincerely hope we shall not have to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment but i confess that i found the ministers reply was compelling <e> <s> i think it gives us most of what we are seeking as i understand it <e> <s> he resorted to giving us an exposition of the legal position and one must assume that he has had first-class legal advice in advising us in this way <e> <s> i am perfectly clear that it would be unwise for us to put the commission in a position where they would find themselves in conflict with themselves <e> <s> some attempt should be made so far as possible to give them a sense of priority <e> <s> i believe the noble lord said that was implicit in the wording of his amendment <e> <s> if that is true then presumably we are getting what we want <e>", "<cs> moved as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords

<e> <s> may i take just a couple of points on what he said before i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> he talked about a gap <e> <s> what i thought he would be fearful of was an overlap <e> <s> gaps are not what this is about <e> <s> i accept that an overlap is a danger <e> <s> what i think i am saying is that if it seems sensible for the landscape to go with the building then so be it let it do that

my noble friends response difficult to understand <e> <s> as for the last point he made we read in paragraph of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is clearly trying to meet us so far as he can <e> <s> i get nervous when we are at report stage and talking about things being done at a later stage or in another place <e> <s> this bill will not be discussed in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to echo the opinion of many other noble lords who regard the response of the front bench as being disappointing <e> <s> it was what one might call a dreary smoke screen <e> <s> my noble friend spoke about statutory controls and about the details of burdens and procedure and then turns round and says he hopes that his reply is satisfactory it is not satisfactory at all <e> <s> the noble lord lord montagu and the noble lord lord digby have both described how a great deal of this work has already been done <e> <s> it is not particularly difficult work <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley quite rightly says that you can affect the whole climate by <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems to be a wholly satisfactory state of affairs <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> if i may say so he said all the right things <e> <s> but does this not leave us in a slightly awkward situation because i wonder whether he is also saying that he is totally satisfied with the wording in the bill <e> <s> by implication i think he is saying that he is not necessarily totally satisfied with the wording in the bill but nor has he said that he intends to see to it that the government will introduce satisfactory wording when the bill goes to another place <e> <s> we are placed in an unfortunate situation in that we should not have arrived at this point in this house we should have been able to deal with it earlier <e> <s> but we all know why we have arrived where we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to revert to the comments made by the noble lord lord winstanley in supporting the noble duke <e> <s> i agree with him that we should not be frightened of the overlap and i also agree with my noble friend the minister who i think was helpful even if he was being slightly delphic <e> <s> he started by talking about clarifying powers and then he appeared to be saying that he did not want to extend the powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only hope that the house puts the same interpretation upon the speech of my noble friend from the front bench as the noble lord lord winstanley does <e> <s> my noble friend started well <e> <s> unfortunately he deteriorated somewhat towards the end if i may say so in his resolve to encourage us to put these words in the legislation <e> <s> i hear what the noble and learned lord says with the greatest of respect <e> <s> there are a good many provisions in this bill which seem to me to be repetitive and some of them are unnecessary <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the house will support me in suggesting that these words are valuable and as the noble lord said at least they do not do any harm <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister as i fear he may very well do stands up to say that he does not want to extend the powers of the commission which will have limited resources may i tell him that the reason i put my name to this amendment was that it seemed to me that here again we were getting into a situation which was somewhat similar to that we were in a few moments ago on the other amendment when we were talking about gaps and overlaps <e> <s> i put it to him most simply can he not envisage a situation where the commission might be wanting to do something which in their judgment entailed a proper use of their resources but which they would be precluded from doing unless something like this was in the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may for a moment i should like to underscore what the noble and learned lord has just been saying <e> <s> first of course we must congratualte my noble friend lord avon for the truly masterly way in which he has handled this bill <e> <s> i wish him well before he goes over to an area which in fact is slightly more familiar to me <e> <s> but the energy area is even more complicated than is the heritage area <e>", "<cs> voluntary participation is very dear to the hearts of many of us in this country <e> <s> perhaps it is best exemplified by that charming but nevertheless cost-effective anomaly the royal national lifeboat institution <e> <s> nobody could begin to justify an organisation of that kind but it does happen to work <e>", "<cs> in face of the soft answer from the minister which turneth away wrath clearly i have no alternative but to withdraw the amendment he is being so helpful <e> <s> however i must say that what slightly surprises me is the timing of this kind of a reaction <e> <s> it is not as though this is a wholly new concept and the noble lord the minister knows very well that he is in for a big battle on the whole question of the clause <e> <s> he leaves us in a slightly unsatisfactory state of affairs <e> <s> he says i am going to do something to try to help those of you who feel as you do and i suspect that there are many other noble lords who have more experience of the matter than i do who would wish to be satisfied on it <e> <s> i believe that the minister is now going to place them in an extremely awkward situation where they will have to rely on something that he is to bring forward at report stage on the assumption that clause is still in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers has asked me to change places with her so i find myself in the happy position of following the noble lord lord diamond who referred extensively to the mallabar report of <e> <s> but i have to tell him if he is not already aware that the working party which i had the privilege of chairing and which worked hard for six months came to a somewhat different conclusion years later but perhaps the passage of time had something to do with that <e> <s> on that working party there were three distinguished figures from industry and commerce <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to that is yes <e> <s> in a very general way i <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there are examples of specific pieces of weaponry and specific competitors but there are a couple of pages of the various constraints which they identify and i am sure illustrations would be readily forthcoming if the noble lord was to talk to someone who is still in touch with the situation and has much greater knowledge of it than i have now <e>", "<cs> my lords i resisted the provocation earlier <e> <s> the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him two questions <e> <s> the first may sound rather ignorant but if these amendments were carried what would happen to the intellectual property rights when the rest of the assets of the royal ordnance factories are transferred <e> <s> secondly <e> <s> what is so different about the situation of the royal ordnance factories from for instance the transfer of the decca company which was bought by racal not so long ago <e> <s> there must have been all kinds of intellectual property rights that were bought at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord again but procedure demands that we work in this way <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that the royal ordnance factories and i too am a past chairman of the royal ordnance factories board have for a long time been working on a trading account <e> <s> they have been running it as far as possible as a commercial concern <e> <s> i have no doubt that if they were asked to maintain surplus capacity they would expect to be paid for it by the ministry of defence and the treasury would have to agree to it in exactly the same way as it is suggested should be done with a commercial company <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i should like to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always lost in admiration for my noble friend lord buxton for never saying i told you so <e> <s> i well remember the warnings that he gave us before the falklands conflict developed <e> <s> of course we are all lost in admiration for the authority with which the noble lord lord shackleton introduced the debate and the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend again whether he has put a timescale on how long he thinks it will take him to decide either that it is possible or that it is not possible <e> <s> if it is more than couple of years what we are being told <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister tell the house what has been the french experience what action the french have taken and whether we believe that their research is relevant to the situation in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to be grateful to the noble lord lord shackleton for giving us a very clear introduction to a subject which i personally find gets more and more complicated the more i go into it <e> <s> we are particularly grateful to him for flushing out his colleague an ex-prime minister and an ex-board of trade minister who gave us a particularly robust performance <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the house any information as to how these charges compare with the costs of pilotage which we shall discuss later this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord to say that i saw those figures as well and was staggered by them <e> <s> i asked a question and those of whom i asked the question fell about laughing <e> <s> they said oh everybody knows that neath is a husband and wife and they own the port <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is right <e> <s> there is general agreement that some <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord lord mottistone ever heard the story of the shuttle pilot who was asked what he thought as the shuttle took off <e> <s> he said i remind myself that every component on this ship went to the man who put in the lowest bid and we know what happened to the shuttle <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to speak to these amendments <e> <s> however as we are at report stage i should like to make a point about the groupings <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should like to make two points <e> <s> this little debate has reinforced the point i was trying to make at the very beginning of this report stage that it will be extremely important if each of these amendments should subsequently be moved and discussed for us to do our best to keep it as short as possible <e> <s> some of the considerations spread over a whole series of amendments and it is proper that we should be having a debate on this amendment attempting to cover many of the others <e> <s> i believe we shall need to have an opportunity to discuss them one by one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for one second <e> <s> surely the implication of that is to say that the pilots who are doing the job at the moment are not capable of doing it <e> <s> either they are capable of doing it now and capable of going on doing it or else they are not capable of doing it now in which case they are not adequate to do it in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> will he consider the possibility that an amendment along these lines might apply to existing pilots in the changeover period as opposed to what happens thereafter as he has said that the future employment terms will be subject to arbitration <e> <s> i think that we can all accept that one could argue about the subject then <e> <s> some of us are concerned apparently to be taking away something from pilots that they now have <e> <s> therefore we are in a slight muddle <e> <s> may i ask whether this is something that would be covered by the arbitration clauses in the transitional period <e> <s> if so it may well be that this meets the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend who is sitting behind me because i feel that he has flushed out from my party in government a rather embarrassing state of mind <e> <s> most of the early part of his reply struck me as essentially irrelevant if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he has said that the guidelines will refer to the pilots present entitlement <e> <s> he did not say what sort of a reference it would be <e> <s> he said i do not like the present entitlement <e> <s> that leads me to suppose that the guidance will say that the arbitration should take no cognisance of present earnings levels even if it addresses the general problem of earnings levels <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> it goes back to the definition of what is meant by fairness <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that the period of service prior to the change in the nature and the terms of employment should be reckonable <e> <s> it is one of the four conditions which to me relate to the question of the governments good faith in being prepared to write into the legislation the undertakings of fairness that they have so often repeated <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems to be a very good question <e> <s> the noble lord has taken refuge in what to me is not a very respectable point and we have mentioned this before <e> <s> he fell back on the self-employed argument being the reason why this period of service should not be counted <e> <s> he overlooks i think a letter which has very often been quoted from the prime minister which said that she recognised that the terms of service of pilots had few of the characteristics of self-employment <e> <s> i think i am quoting her actual words i do not have the letter with me <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that i have that correct and i am greatly relieved <e> <s> if he has said that we have gone a long way <e> <s> whether he and i will disagree about the interpretation of what taking into account the present level of earnings means is still open for discussion <e> <s> however i understood him to say and to repeat just now he did not feel that the present level of earnings would necessarily be sustained <e> <s> he seems almost to have made two conflicting statements because the thought that most of us have is that if the government unilaterally decide to alter the whole basis on which people earn their living it is up to them to see they are no worse off than they were before <e> <s> i really believe it is basically as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shackleton is quite right <e> <s> this was a hastily conceived amendment and we did not think that it was a serious legal proposal <e> <s> i freely acknowledge that i have called down upon my head the predictable criticisms of the noble learned and formidable lords on the cross-benches if i may so call them <e> <s> it may be that the proper course is to have a look at something on similar lines taking out such words as undertakings given <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not yet spoken to amendment no <e> <s> and i hope the house will not think that i am trespassing upon its time or generosity nor will the minister think i am trying to take advantage of his very valuable offer of this arbitration clause but i want to put something to him <e> <s> he will recall that at report stage we discussed what was then amendment no <e> <s> which will be amendment no <e> <s> if we ever reach it whereby i was concerned that there was no system for consultation or appeal against regulations produced by competent harbour authorities <e> <s> i suggested that the pilotage commission during the transitional period would be a suitable body to tackle that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister two questions <e> <s> did i understand him to say that he hopes to bring forward regulations before the bill leaves this house or before it goes to another place <e> <s> that is my first question <e> <s> my second point is possibly not in the form of a question <e> <s> the noble lord lord swinfen said that the people who are vitally interested in the state of these boats are the chaps who have to ride in them i refer to the pilots <e> <s> i acknowledge what the noble lord lord greenway has said <e> <s> formal surveys can be very expensive <e> <s> at the committee stage i said that i was not enamoured of the idea of introducing the rather elaborate and to me rather rigid board of trade type of regulations in respect of pilot boats <e> <s> but could we not have some arrangement whereby the pilots will have the right of consultation and indeed our old friend the arbitration procedure if they are not satisfied with the boat that is being provided by their cha <e> <s> the difficulty is that they go to the cha and say look its a ropey old boat that you are giving us and the cha turns round and says if you dont like the pilot boat you had better go and work somewhere else <e> <s> that is not a very satisfactory situation at all <e> <s> what is needed is some way in which the pilots can express the view that the boat which is being provided is not satisfactory for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> which i can modify so that it reads section instead of section <e> <s> will that be in order <e>", "<cs> my lords if it will make the noble and learned lord any happier i shall be very happy to make a manuscript amendment which will read <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a scant claim to be speaking in the debate except that on one occasion i contributed to the congestion in lyndhurst by breaking down when i was towing a steam launch which is even older than either my noble godmother the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood or indeed the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that we have now to give this bill a second reading <e> <s> i can only say that i hope that all the arguments will be pursued rigorously and as quickly as possible in order to minimise the extra expense with which the county council is faced <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord underhill is right in what he suggests will be the effect of this amendment and certainly he makes sense to me it seems to negate a great deal of the underlying purpose of the bill <e> <s> it appears to put the competent harbour authority in a position in which any ship being moved from any buoy the expression that is used in the bill is from one mooring to another will entail in the case of ports up rivers the major part of a movement which requires the skilled services of pilots <e> <s> i think that all of <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether there will be any capital gains tax liability on a sale of this kind <e> <s> it is rather an unfair question to throw at him <e> <s> however it occurs to me that such a sale might be liable <e>", "<cs> my lords there is clearly no point in pursuing this argument <e> <s> i am bound to say that i found one of the ministers statements very curious <e> <s> he said that if the commission has to give advice the minister cannot ask it to give advice <e> <s> that seemed to me to be a curious tweedledum and tweedledee arrangement <e> <s> if the minister had said that he agreed that anybody had the right to ask the commission to pass comment <e> <s> i should have understood what he was saying which would be roughly speaking what i had in mind <e> <s> however the minister appears to be adamant that the competent harbour authority will be the sole arbiter essentially on commercial grounds in a highly-competitive environment on all the conditions which apply to all ships entering or leaving the harbours for which it is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will not be surprised that the pilots are rather more than disappointed with this amendment <e> <s> their objections are on a number of grounds <e> <s> first of all i find the governments posture on this strangely inconsistent <e> <s> throughout the bill they have said let competition thrive even if it is at the expense of environmental danger and public safety <e> <s> then the noble lord turns round and says oh but we cant have competition on deep sea pilotage which is an international matter and he has himself admitted that if we restrict the entry into the deep sea pilotage field it is likely to be filled by foreign nationals <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord underhill who said that the ideal arrangement would be to write these things into the legislation certainly as regards amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however the minister has fallen back throughout upon his arbitration scheme and all of us i believe wait with bated breath to see what is revealed in the guidelines which will direct the arbitration scheme <e> <s> i understood the minister to say that his understanding was that pensions would be something that one would expect to bring under the arbitration arrangements in the same way as the discussion upon basic earnings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister <e> <s> we were only trying to save him a little trouble in the long term <e> <s> however i am perfectly happy to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> in view of what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that pilots will be very relieved that the minister has agreed to accept amendment no <e> <s> because they were naturally concerned that the choice should remain theirs <e> <s> what troubles me is that the minister says that subsection is needed to make something clear <e> <s> yet the noble and learned lord lord simon speaking with all the authority of a judge says he does not find the meaning clear at all <e>", "<cs> my lords before we finally dispose of this matter will the minister confirm that the effect of the amendment is not to negate the arbitration clauses which we discussed at report and to which we shall be returning in a few minutes <e> <s> is he quite sure that the amendment does not make it possible for a competent harbour authority to avoid the arbitration clauses altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to ask a further question <e> <s> what will happen if the cha says that it wishes to employ the pilots but the pilots wish to be self-employed <e>", "<cs> my lords to put it mildly i found the ministers speech a bit of a curates egg it was good in parts <e> <s> everybody who has been concerned with this bill greatly appreciates the effort that he has made to try and accommodate the considerable differences of view which have been expressed during the passage of this bill on the question of fairness <e> <s> it is a complicated matter and i must apologise to the house if i speak about it for what i hope will not be an unduly long time because i think this is the most important issue the most important amendment which we shall be addressing this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just coming on to say that i was delighted to hear that the officials and the pilots have had a satisfactory discussion on the general guidance issues <e> <s> i gather that there are one or two extra bits that they want put in <e> <s> that is very good <e> <s> but we shall not be able to finish up this evening knowing that there are satisfactory lists of issues to be discussed <e> <s> one or two important issues are missing which we have spoken about already this evening <e> <s> nor shall we know whether the criteria by which they will be adjudged have been finally agreed by all those concerned <e> <s> with the greatest respect that leaves us in a very unhappy situation even though it is a very much better situation than when we started considering this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not believe i used those words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> everyone would agree i think that we have no wish to remove the responsibility from the cha <e> <s> clearly this must be its responsibility <e> <s> i think that the minister is saying that while it is the chas responsibility there will be some oversight of how it exercises that responsibility <e> <s> from the point of view of the pilots they would like to be confident that there is some higher authority apart from a rather inacces-sible higher authority in the skies to which they can refer if they are not satisfied with the quality or maintenance of the pilot boats being
