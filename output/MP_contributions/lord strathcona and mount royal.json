["<cs> my lords it is difficult for me to add much to the initial reply that i gave <e> <s> the fact is that there is no formal machinery <e> <s> obviously a great deal of informal consultation takes place between members of the nato alliance but the noble lord has to remember that nato is an alliance designed to protect western europe and it is a matter of some discussion whether we should have some other kind of alliance to deal with the areas outside western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering a question concerning natobut i quite agree with the noble lord that the track record of some of the alliances outside nato has not been wholly encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the dockyards do run recruitment campagins in close co-operation with the local schools and with the youth employment services <e> <s> all are fully aware that girls are accepted for training on an equal footing with men <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords a letter sent today to the general synod refers to the governments view that there are substantial benefits to be derived from defence sales but that this does not mean that the government consider that the united kingdom should export arms indiscriminately <e> <s> we follow a policy of responsible restraint and examine each case on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that the way in which a potential client <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be proper for me to go into individual cases <e> <s> there has recently been a case where arms sales to argentina have not been sanctioned <e> <s> as regards the general point about disclosure of arms sales the position is that it is extremely difficult to do a commercial deal if the customer is anxious that it should not be disclosed <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that one has to try to hold a balance between ones desire to conclude the deal and the desire to justify ones moral conscience <e> <s> on the whole at present we do our best to vet most carefully any deals which are proposed while at the same time doing what we believe is in the commercial and industrial interests of this country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords first i was not aware that we had supplied arms to the plo <e> <s> as regards the general point that the noble lord has made i should point out that in many cases even if we do not supply arms other people will do so <e> <s> we must use our judgment as to what is the balance of advantage for this country <e> <s> i believe that we do so reasonably well <e> <s> i may add that we try not to supply arms to people who we think potentially will use them against us <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot be responsible for another nations policy <e> <s> our policy is to pursue the arms sales which we believe to be in the interests of this country and we believe that those interests would be damaged if we had to disclose every sale in great detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is necessarily true at all <e> <s> we would not sell arms to what we would regard as repressive rgimes that is quite clear policy <e> <s> i do not say that we always get it right and rgimes change as indeed the nature of the amin rgime changed <e> <s> however we must bear in mind that in many cases arms sales open a door to commercial deals and ultimately exercise political influence which is beneficial to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can go all the way with the right reverend prelate <e> <s> we have diplomatic relations with countries but that does not necessarily imply that we approve of their regimes <e> <s> on arms our attitude is that unless there is a pressing reason and there is clear evidence of a repressive regime we arc inclined to pursue the sale of arms to them <e> <s> incidentally we believe that there is no reason to assume that another country does not have the right to buy arms to protect itself which is a point which is made in this pamphlet which gives rise to the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for what happens in another place <e> <s> i believe that there is no evidence that we sell arms to repressive rgimes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think if i may say so that the question of what athletes do or do not do has a great deal to do with the selling of arms <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult for me to answer for the party opposite <e> <s> indeed i doubt whether they would agree with me if i answered for them <e> <s> the noble earl is perfectly right that the proposed arms sales to iran would have offered a great deal of employment in this country most particularly in the royal ordnance factories which are now in serious difficulties as a result of the default on those contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could accept either of those propositions <e> <s> i do not accept that those are all repressive regimes and i am not at all sure that we arc in fact selling arms to all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord requests me to do i shall certainly study the american regulations <e> <s> i do not think that i could necessarily agree with the noble lord about the status of the plo and i am perfectly certain that we would not involve ourselves in supplying arms to terrorists of any complexion <e>"]
