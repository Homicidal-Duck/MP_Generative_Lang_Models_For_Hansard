["<cs> my lords i should like to thank and congratulate her majestys government on fulfilling their pledge and increasing the pay of the forces to a level that is almost in line with civilian life <e> <s> this affects me very well because my son is a major and he can now take me out to dinner instead of my taking him out to dinner <e> <s> there is still a problem of far greater magnitude in that officers and men are leaving the forces having served only three years in their units <e> <s> this is uneconomic because they will have cost the government more in the first three years than in any other period of their service <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to your lordships views on northern ireland and i am grateful to the noble lord lord dunleath for drawing our attention to this momentous task <e> <s> in ulster since and i hope you will forgive me for repeating these figures but they are important there have been civilians killed ruc killed and soldiers killed <e> <s> the total number of civilians and soldiers wounded to date has been <e> <s> these are staggering figures <e> <s> the annual cost of supporting the army in northern ireland amounts to million and the ruc million <e> <s> public expenditure on governing the province is million <e> <s> this vast and appalling cost comes on her majestys government and therefore ultimately on the taxpayer <e> <s> the destruction of private and public property has been enormous and the compensation falls also upon her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for inaugurating this debate <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord murton on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> a department of health and social security study on the health service in war had a course at the home defence college at easingwold in yorkshire in march <e> <s> in their study report they advised that first aid posts should be set up and manned by st john and red cross personnel all over the united kingdom because of these two organisations considerable knowledge and practical experience in nursing and first aid <e> <s> also it was thought that they could both play a very important role in organising crash courses in first aid to increase the number of those able to provide first aid home nursing and elementary hygiene <e>", "<cs> my lords after lord raglans speech i feel rather like a christmas card i was sent of the crimean war <e> <s> there was an officer of the th royal hussars looking around him against a crimean background and the caption was lost as we often were <e> <s> i am going to be very quick <e> <s> my noble friend lord strathcona has stressed the importance of personnel in the armed forces and the noble and gallant lord lord carver has mentioned the cutbacks among the individual members of the armed forces in training <e> <s> so i am on the advice of the noble lord lord shinwell exercising his maxim that only repetition gets ones point over <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his answer may i ask whether he is aware of the damage being caused to the training and recreational facilities in the armed forces by the per cent <e> <s> reduction in the fuel allocation <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be very happy and relieved to hear that my average speaking time in your lordships house is three minutes and i shall not disappoint you today <e> <s> i feel that i ought to express the great concern of the racing industry at her majestys governments decision to increase the rate of general betting duty from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> the jockey club the levy board and the horserace advisory council have repeatedly warned the treasury of the dangers of an increase in the tax of betting turnover <e> <s> between the last increase in and betting turnover rose by per cent <e> <s> while the retail price index over the same period increased by per cent <e> <s> the effect of this has been that the levy boards revenue is now insufficient to meet the accepted requirements of the racing industry <e> <s> as a result a number of very harsh decisions have been taken on the allocation of the limited funds available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity to congratulate my noble friend lord henley on introducing the epsom and walton downs regulation bill and on explaining so clearly the intentions of the bill <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord wigg on his amendment <e> <s> the last time that i spoke on the same side as him was over the green howards band and we won so perhaps we might win again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord newall on introducing this bill at such an appropriate time <e> <s> when many horse racing fixtures have had to be abandoned due to the arctic conditions we are experiencing the fortunes of the nations punters are at present resting heavily on greyhound racing <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord attlee and i know that i should not have used the word friend but he is one i had the honour and privilege of being a guest of the royal marines in norway earlier this year <e> <s> i should like to say how very impressed i was at the efficiency determination and <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish i could be as humorous as my noble friend lord cork has been but i cannot so your lordships will have to listen almost to what has been said by my noble friend lord cathcart which needs repeating anyway <e>"]
