["<cs> my lords first may i congratulate my noble friend lord trenchard on his appointment to the front bench and on the very great responsibilities that he has acquired in connection with industry <e> <s> all other noble lords who have spoken have congratulated him and i should certainly wish to do so myself <e> <s> may i also congratulate the noble lord lord melchett <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i was not referring to any particular case but i have heard this said and it is important <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to bp <e> <s> what the noble lord has said surely bears out my last remark namely that every case must be taken on its merits <e> <s> but i will make one other point on this and that is that before any move is made in any such case one wants to consider what will be the effect on the people employed in the industry because all too often the question of change of ownership has a disturbing and unsettling effect and that may go a long way towards offsetting the advantages that the would-be changers have in mind <e>", "<cs> rose to call attention to the problems of the shipping industry and to the twelfth report of last session of the european communities committee on eec shipping policy hl <e> <s> and to move for papers <e> <s> the noble viscount said my lords in calling attention to the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that anyone moving a motion in your lordships house and having from every speaker the feeling that the debate has been worthwhile and has raised important matters cannot but be satisfied <e> <s> for my part i am very pleased with the way that this debate has gone <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate from their several points of view and experience and from many points of view there has been great experience shown <e> <s> i should like in parti <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased indeed to be speaking following the noble lord lord ardwick being as he is another lancashire peer <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord rhodes both on the way in which he introduced the motion and for the excellent report that he in particular and his colleagues have presented to us for discussion today <e> <s> it is a most valuable report not least because it contains as well as the report itself the full minutes of evidence various memoranda from different expert organisations and a valuable appendix of statistics <e> <s> it is certainly a report that needs very careful study if one is to get all the various points included in it in fair perspective <e> <s> it is difficult to do that for anyone although if i may say with an appropriate degree of humility it is perhaps a little easier for those of us who have spent many years of practical working in the textile industry but i feel sure that even we find it not too easy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first along with other noble lords who have spoken thank the right reverend prelate for introducing this very important debate and may i say how extremely privileged i feel to be able to take part in it <e> <s> the noble lord lord soper will perhaps forgive me if i do not follow him entirely <e> <s> i agree with so much of what he said <e> <s> i would merely say that his eloquence and very deep sincerity whether here in your lordships house or elsewhere such as in the media i for one always admire tremendously <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to be able to take part in this second reading debate and to thank my noble friend lord trenchard for the explicit way in which he introduced the second reading of the bill <e> <s> as he said it is a very short bill and has a very limited application but it is none the less an extremely important bill as a link and as a rung in the ladder to get our shipbuilding industry back to viability <e> <s> i was most interested in what the noble lord lord shinwell had to say <e> <s> in some respects i hope to follow some of his thoughts <e> <s> your lordships will remember that we had a very full debate on shipping in june of this year <e> <s> we saw the situation of the industry as a dismal and rather aifficult picture and of course that has its implications on shipbuilding but i do not think we need to cover much of the ground that came out in the june debate because that can be read <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is quite right <e> <s> there is not all that much difference but it gives the measure of the problem <e> <s> so much for oil <e>", "<cs> my lords like every other noble lord who has spoken i should like to thank my noble friend sincerely for introducing this very important debate which i have found extremely interesting particularly the noble baronesss own speech and what she had to say about the united states of america <e> <s> i want to confine my few remarks to the small manufacturing firm and i take as my criterion the definition that was given it by the bolton committee on small businesses when they reported in which was a firm of fewer than employees a firm directed and managed by the owner and with little equity capital <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my humble but very sincere congratulations to those extended to my noble friend lord renton upon his excellent and if he will allow me to say so mature maiden speech <e> <s> i learnt a tremendous amount from it and i look forward to hearing him speak in your lordships house in future on these and many other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have listened to every word that has been said during the debate today and i have certainly found it extremely interesting <e> <s> so much has been said about the various points in the bill some favourable and some very critical <e> <s> that being so i shall resist the temptation to deal with detailed clauses of the bill that can come out in the committee stage <e> <s> what i want to talk about is something which i regard as very important that is the general background to the whole bill and the main subject matter that underlies it <e>", "<cs> i want very briefly to raise one matter at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i also welcome this bill <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend on the very concise and clear way in which he has introduced it <e> <s> i intervene in this important debate with some hesitation particularly when i follow my noble friend lord nugent who speaks with such a great number of years of experience in this matter <e> <s> quite rightly as i see it in our small country with very considerable mineral resources we need to watch very carefully review how we handle extraction and what steps we should take to ensure within the reasonable capabilities of present techniques the practical restoration and after-care and i use that word despite my noble friends comment on the term of the land affected without putting too heavy a burden on the extractive industries and without also its resulting in a situation where some important minerals may actually become sterilised <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord brooks will forgive me if i do not follow him in the details that he gave <e> <s> this has been a most important interesting and fascinating debate and one <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that my analogy is the right one because we have however unconsciously allowed ourselves the comfortable way of life <e> <s> it has been the weve never had it so good idea that has resulted in our difficulty and our lack of productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like with other noble lords to congratulate my noble friend lord renton on having introduced this debate <e> <s> it is a very important debate <e> <s> i apologise to him in advance if i do not agree with all that he may have said <e> <s> i should also like to say how much i appreciate the green paper which i think has been an extraordinarily valuable document <e> <s> i do not know whether i am in order in making a critical comment on something in that context that the noble lord lord mccarthy said because he is not in his place at the moment <e> <s> but as he wound up his speech he questioned the sincerity of those who drafted and put forward the green paper <e> <s> that was very unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my congratulations upon the two maiden speeches which we have heard this afternoon which again confirm what a tremendous volume of expertise and experience we can always rely on in your lordships house <e> <s> also as a member of the sub-committee who was with it throughout the whole of the preparation of this report and i like to think that i did not miss any of the meetings i should like to say how fortunate we in the subcommittee were that our chairman was able to bring to it such a vast amount of experience gained in his past career experience which was of immense value in dealing with the complex subject with which we were concerned <e>", "<cs> as the report produced by the committee over which i had the privilege to preside in the early s has been referred to perhaps i might be allowed to make one or two observations <e> <s> if the noble lord lord underhill had moved his amendment or years ago i can assure him that i would have jumped at it at once received it with open arms and supported him in any division lobby <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord bellwin has said a great deal has happened in the last or years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very brief answer <e> <s> can he give me some indication briefly of what it will be <e> <s> bearing in mind that the whole matter has been before the public for three and a half years when the north-west water authority first put down their proposal <e> <s> is he aware that this very long delay must be causing considerable concern to conservationists and considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords before i ask your lordships to approve the motion i should like to say a few words more by way of thanks than anything else to all those who have spoken and who have contributed their profound wisdom and experience in particular the noble lord lord rhodes my noble friend lord kearton and others <e> <s> it has been a valuable debate and i am grateful to them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for a very few minutes <e> <s> i do so as a past chairman of harland and wolff and i am moved to do so following a point made by the noble lord lord blease in his very interesting speech <e> <s> he referred to the apprentice school in harland and wolff and in particular to a remark made by the personnel director of the shipyard mr david tinkler whom incidentally i had the honour to appoint at the recent prize-giving to apprentices just the other day <e> <s> in his speech he said as i understand it with sorrow that he feared very much that the level of the apprentice school would be maintained in the future with very great difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for the detailed and careful way in which he has led us through the order <e> <s> may i also very much endorse what the noble lord who has just sat down has said particularly when it comes to the question of cost <e> <s> however desirable may be a scheme that the commission puts forward somebody has to pay for the cost of it <e> <s> this is made more complicated by the fact that the pilotage industry is a self-employed industry <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say to what extent the improvement in the finances of the corporation are due to improved technology <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to take part in this debate but i feel i must say a word in regard to what the noble lord opposite said on industrial democracy and particularly in regard to its relationship with shipbuilding <e> <s> i happen to have taken part in the debate on the bullock report in your <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and thank also my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth for covering such a wide field <e> <s> i was particularly interested in his last remark concerning the meeting of transport ministers in i believe a months time <e> <s> i only hope that our report will be of some use when those discussions take place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by adding my congratulations to my noble friend lord kaberry of adel for his very interesting and important maiden <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for at any rate clarifying the situation <e> <s> would he not agree that the completion of the clifton bypass near workington means that every other village and town on the a miles in length from scotch corner to the west coast of cumberland will have been bypassed with the exception of the two villages mentioned in my question <e> <s> will my noble friend not bear in mind and will he not agree with me that that being the case it is natural that the flow of traffic should increase substantially as it is doing today and that the proportion of heavy-duty vehicles should be far above the national average with the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he will convey to his right honourable friend the secretary of state the fact that this is a very urgent matter and also the strength of feeling of the vast majority of villagers in temple sowerby even to the extent of an unfortunate feeling of considerable bitterness <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a great satisfaction to me to be able to serve on the subcommittee under the very penetrating chairmanship of the noble lord lord brimelow <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him as other noble lords have done on the very skilful way in which he has introduced this debate <e> <s> this debate follows closely on that introduced by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby on nd may to which reference has also been made <e> <s> unfortunately i was not able to listen to all of that debate but i have read <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i am the first member of the sub-committee to follow the noble lord lord brimelow i should like to say how grateful i am sure all the members of the sub-committee were to him for the skilful way in which he steered us through an extremely complicated and difficult inquiry <e> <s> i should also like to join with other noble lords who have spoken in thanking him for the way in which he has introduced our report <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is in existence a draft document from the commission in brussels on this very matter of maritime policy and the strengths of the various merchant navies <e> <s> is he further aware that it seems likely that the select committee of your lordships house on european affairs is likely to inquire in some detail into this matter in the autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that there is further business to be taken in the house this evening and therefore i shall be quite brief <e> <s> however there are one or two points that i really must make <e> <s> first i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this very interesting and informed debate <e> <s> i personally am immensely grateful to them <e> <s> they have put forward different points of view some agree with the committee and some do not but they are all very valuable <e> <s> in particular of course i should like to add my very sincere congratulations to the noble baroness lady hooper for a really excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i hope we shall hear her very often in the chamber and i should like to think that we shall hear her in the select committee and i see the chairman of the select committee smiling across the way so perhaps that remark will go home <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that we may now return to the subject of european union <e> <s> i had the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by adding my thanks to the noble lord lord seebohm for introducing this very important debate on the completion of the internal market <e> <s> perhaps i may then go on to make a personal apology to your lordships <e> <s> several months ago long before we decided to have this debate i committed myself to speak this evening at a meeting in the north of england on industrial year <e> <s> i came to the conclusion that i could not possibly go back on that commitment but nor did i wish to forgo addressing your lordships on the particular report produced by sub-committee b of which i was chairman <e> <s> after taking advice i decided that i ought to try to carry out both commitments <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first became aware that this bill was to be introduced into your <e>", "<cs> my lords i have ventured to put my name down on the list of speakers even though it is an extremely long one <e> <s> the reason is that having taken part in the work of your lordships house for over years i think i am only behind the noble earl lord longford in that respect i believe i have learned some lessons which may be of help to your lordships in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe your lordships an apology for intervening in this debate but i could not let the occasion go by without saying a brief word <e> <s> in a major committee of inquiry into the ports of great britain reported to the government of the day <e> <s> i happened to be chairman <e> <s> i regret to say that the committee made only one brief reference to felixstowe and we were rather disparaging about it at the time <e> <s> perhaps i may report what we said <e>", "<cs> i am a little disappointed at what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i should like him to go a little further on the question of exemptions <e> <s> when he was about to sit down he said that he was in some doubt as to what i meant when i said that the charity would suffer <e> <s> the charity would suffer because it would have to increase the salaries of the individuals concerned by a certain amount <e> <s> those amounts would cause the individuals to pay increased tax <e> <s> all that would have to be added up and made good to the individuals by the charity <e> <s> therefore the charity would suffer to that extent <e> <s> the figure i gave in the particular case that i mentioned was something like <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to ask the committee to divide on this issue <e> <s> but i would ask my noble friend to give it further thought between now and report to see whether something further can be done <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> has been directed mainly to fulfil an undertaking that he gave to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs on her amendment moved in committee <e> <s> i am sure that many members on both sides of the house will be very glad about the amendment in so far as it meets that undertaking <e> <s> i should like to go a little further because during the committee stage it may be remembered that i too moved an amendment dealing with care workers i was hopeful that my noble friend would have been able to do something about that amendment when it came to the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that possibly i owe your lordships an apology for intervening in this third reading debate as i was not present for second reading <e> <s> however i can assure noble lords that i have read very carefully most of what was said in another place <e> <s> i have read and studied all that was said in your lordships house on second reading and i have read the special report and much of the deliberations thereon <e> <s> i can assure the house <e>"]
