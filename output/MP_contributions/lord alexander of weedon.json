["<cs> my lords i suspect that none of us ever forgets the first occasion on which we speak in any forum <e> <s> i certainly well <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> i watch with considerable concern the suggestion that there should be monitoring of the activities of those supervised by the professional bodies <e> <s> what does it mean <e> <s> monitoring is a positive obligation <e> <s> how frequently is it to be carried out <e> <s> by whom <e> <s> what are the standards to be <e> <s> how efficient will it be <e> <s> that of course will depend entirely upon who conducts the monitoring and how frequently it is conducted <e> <s> i view this proposal as a superimposition of yet another regulatory activity over the actions and work of professionals which requires the fullest justification <e>", "<cs> in the last legal year i argued the government case in the <e>", "<cs> my lords as an indifferent cricketer i rarely saw the magic number beside my name and never before in hours of darkness <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that answer <e> <s> as a result am i right in understanding that the government have carried out no studies of the actual costs of the proposals either to the public purse or to private litigants and if not bearing in mind that this issue is of critical importance to the administration of justice is it not right that wide-ranging studies should be carried out before any proposals are implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble and learned friend note that the professions <e>", "<cs> may i seek to support this amendment <e> <s> in doing so i declare an interest <e> <s> i have recently succeeded my noble friend lord boardman to whom if i may respectively pay tribute for his skill courage and sense of honour as chairman of nat west <e> <s> the present position we have to consider is clearly an anomaly <e> <s> under our companies legislation banks or any contracting party can deal with a company however small on the basis that a transaction decided on by directors is within the power of the company <e> <s> there is no need for the counterparty to read let alone get lawyers to interpret the company constitution <e> <s> by contrast the present position of those dealing with local authorities is impossibly uncertain <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down while not seeking to comment at all on his views of the city community to which he is well entitled perhaps i may ask him to reflect a little upon what he suggested about those of us who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> perhaps he can point to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord no doubt consulted rule xiv before he raised this point initially <e> <s> it is the first time that i have had occasion to look at it although i have been informed generally of its contents <e> <s> as i understand it it falls into two limbs <e> <s> the first limb reads <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to congratulate the noble lord lord byron on his maiden speech <e> <s> i do so with very much warmth and pleasure <e> <s> i congratulate him particularly on offering us such an even-handed approach on topics which are not free from a measure of disagreement in your lordships house <e> <s> i should also like to express the hope that he will speak more frequently than has been the family average during the course of this century <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise another point <e> <s> i would accept that it is clear on the face of the bill that the order-making power would be under clause <e> <s> i also accept that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is concerned to seek complicity and to make consequential arrangements <e> <s> i want to put to him a different point which concerns me <e> <s> it relates to the practice and procedure of the courts <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> when there is consideration of whether somebody should be housed by a local authority a fundamental right is being adjudicated upon <e> <s> those against whom the decisions may go are those who are possibly least equipped to employ the machinery even though in some ways it is a swift machinery of seeking judicial review in the high court <e> <s> as we are increasingly learning many of them are psychiatrically ill and have been released from psychiatric homes <e> <s> therefore being mentally ill they come within the category of those who fall for consideration of housing as the noble lord lord mishcon described <e> <s> i believe that we should supply that category of our citizens with a cheap and effective access to the courts <e>", "<cs> in response to that invitation that is the purpose of the provision <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness lady phillips will accept that even lawyers can occasionally in this house seek simplicity <e> <s> but once a statutory objective is spelt out it is important to have within that <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend for his clear assurance that the factors which i indicated as being factors which fell for proper consideration by the advisory committee and the judges would be factors which under his amendment he would regard as being entitled to take into account <e> <s> in those circumstances i do not seek to answer my noble friend lord coleraine <e> <s> i say simply that the kind of considerations that he raised would on the basis on which we are all proceeding be matters for conscientious consideration in the future by the advisory committee and the judges <e> <s> therefore i hope that he will forgive me for not dealing with them <e> <s> in the circumstances i am pleased to seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to draw attention to the fact that amendment no <e> <s> contains the words new and improved which may meet the preference of some members of the committee <e> <s> in the light of the concerns that have been expressed will my noble and learned friend take away the amendment reconsider the phraseology and come back on report having taken account of those concerns <e> <s> in that case i shall have the pleasure of not moving my amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> as i understand it this amendment is designed by reference to a subsequent amendment to the bill to cover the point made on second reading by my noble and learned friend both in his opening and closing speeches that rules of conduct would be wide enough to cover rules of practice <e> <s> on that basis may i say that i welcome this amendment <e> <s> if accepted it will enable me to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> za standing in my name because i believe that subject to his confirmation my noble and learned friends intention is to cover the point that we were also seeking to cover by our amendment <e>", "<cs> although i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for the obvious sympathy that he feels for the rule i respectfully differ with him in one way namely that what he so eloquently described when he was dean of the faculty of advocates as a constitutional guarantee is surely something which should be embodied in legislation at this time of change and not left to some advisory committee <e>", "<cs> in the light of my noble and learned friends indication that he will consider the matter even if he will not consider it favourably and i lack the eloquence of the noble lord lord mishcon to persuade him to do so we shall study his answer and if appropriate return to it at report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that indication and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was not part of my suggestion in opening this amendment briefly that there was any sinister intent by the exclusion of the judges from the provision in clause <e> <s> all i sought to suggest was that as clause is in the bill as a matter of caution it would be sensible to have the provision in the earlier parts of the bill <e> <s> i may be wrong but i thought i interpreted my noble and learned friends response though he did not actually say so as an indication that he would consider favourably an amendment along those lines <e> <s> if he gives an informal indication that that is so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is nothing to do with the supremacy of parliament <e> <s> it is to do with who is responsible for educating and training in areas where the maximum knowledge is needed and where it is important to preserve the separation of powers <e>", "<cs> may i add a word to that <e> <s> my noble and learned friend said a few minutes ago something with which i think we would all agree <e> <s> it is often difficult for lay people to understand the processes of the law <e> <s> i am sure that we all agree that we as lawyers must seek to reduce those difficulties as much as we can <e> <s> but if that is the starting point it is hard to see how lay people should dominate a committee engaged in these technical activities <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson replies perhaps i may intervene briefly first in regard to the suggestion that when the bill was introduced there <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord lord ackner has an opportunity to respond perhaps i may say how much i welcome the response given by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> it is sometimes suggested that the judges are not innovative or that they are not critical of counsel <e> <s> that has not been my experience at the bar <e> <s> i very much welcome that the judges who have so often taken the lead in procedural reforms will be in a position under the suggestion accepted by my noble and learned friend both to take the initiative in putting forward proposals and to be consulted at an early stage <e> <s> i believe that that is the way in which effective progress in the administration of justice has traditionally been made that is by regular consultation between the lord chancellors department and judges <e> <s> i am very glad that my noble and learned friend believes it desirable to continue in that way <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene on the amendment <e> <s> i was however a little surprised when i heard my noble friend lord coleraine say that training in advocacy in the magistrates courts was necessarily adequate for conducting a plea in mitigation in respect of some of the most serious criminal offences which might carry a period of imprisonment of up to life <e>", "<cs> long before i became involved with a financial institution i felt great concern about the proposals that financial institutions should be entitled to provide those services together with lending services <e> <s> i hope that it will not be thought disloyal to the financial institutions with which i am involved if i say that i still have the same reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank most warmly all noble lords who have taken part in or listened to the debate <e> <s> i shall begin by referring to two points which my noble and learned friend made towards the end of his response <e> <s> the first concerned those firms of solicitors which refuse to represent rapists <e> <s> as i understand it he regards that as something that may have to be looked at <e> <s> the point i was making was that if and in so far as that attitude was extended to advocacy in the superior courts it would be undesirable <e> <s> my noble and learned friend appears to accept that <e> <s> he accepts that we need justice in all courts <e> <s> therefore i ask your lordships quite simply this evening why we should not then begin with regard to the superior courts tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am sure about is that my noble and learned friend whether he then described it as a rule or not undoubtedly mentioned the words constitutional guarantee <e> <s> why should we not elevate a constitutional guarantee into a principle <e> <s> that is what i always thought constitutional guarantees were even if they could also be described as rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> there have been a number of occasions during the passage of this bill when i personally felt that the government might have been wiser to take the view that judicial experience when expressed unanimously might call for some change to the content of the advisory committee <e> <s> i do not propose to speak on the concept of the lay majority nor do i propose to speak to the suggestions which have been made that persons other than judges might be added to the committee <e> <s> i want to focus and focus alone on this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may focus on one aspect of the debate not so far emphasised the provision that requires all advocates to undertake legal aid work <e> <s> my noble friend lady carnegy mentioned the problem of securing an advocate to undertake a task for a fee which he regards as appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also thank the noble lord lord irvine of lairg for instituting debate on this important topic <e> <s> the part of his speech to which i should like to add a little is the theme that he developed at the end which related to the question of whether or not we should incorporate the european convention on human rights as part of our domestic law <e> <s> without the constraints of party discipline i think that the noble lord would have said unequivocally that he was in favour <e> <s> whatever the constraints of party discipline i should like to express my own view in support of the incorporation of the convention but i do so with a somewhat different emphasis from that of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to call upon my noble and learned friend lord hailsham to lead me on my response to this issue <e> <s> my impression is that the convention contains protection for rights of property <e> <s> but it also contains a margin of appreciation to the domestic government on how those rights shall be balanced <e> <s> that is reflected in the decision in the aircraft and shipbuilding nationalisation case <e> <s> it was illustrated by that case when the bill was before parliament <e> <s> if i remember rightly the present government were then in opposition and opposed the passage of the bill because they believed that it was inappropriate and as a matter of domestic politics did not sufficiently protect property rights <e> <s> however when the issues came before strasbourg the government recognised that a larger issue was under consideration the right of government and parliament within a particular country to draw the balance in that area <e> <s> they therefore upheld the principle under the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement recently made by mr michael spicer as regards what is to be done to lessen the problem of homelessness was a very welcome first step <e> <s> perhaps i may ask whether my noble friend agrees that it would be an appropriate corollary to that to remove homelessness as an offence from the criminal legislation <e> <s> is it not now time to recognise that that part of the legislation which had a quite different economic context should be removed from our statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by paying tribute to the words expressed in support of the principle both by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and my noble friend as i think of him for these purposes lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> all those who have taken part in the debate on this issue share that common aspiration <e> <s> where i hope i am correct in differing slightly from them today is not as to the principle but as to the fears which they have expressed over the effect of the commons amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord lord mishcon makes i sincerely hope that it is not based upon experience <e> <s> i wonder whether the point that he raises might narrow too much the definition contained in the clause <e> <s> the clause as i understand it refers to alleged conduct in relation to the case and not merely to actual conduct and is intended to cover broad aspects of a persons behaviour or characteristics such as those raised by my noble friend lord hutchinson <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first make the briefest mention of the uruguay round of gatt talks and the contentious issue of agriculture <e> <s> western europe is in world terms comprised of rich countries <e> <s> it seeks to promote free trade within the community <e> <s> it seeks access to world markets on a multilateral basis <e> <s> yet in regard to agriculture it has been and is protectionist and is currently grudging in the concessions that it offers <e> <s> for many of the countries taking part in the uruguay round countries less rich than those of the community the main hope in negotiations is to secure big gains from cuts in farm protection <e> <s> it was wholly appropriate that this should have been the principal topic on the agenda for the recent rome meeting of heads of government <e> <s> it was wholly inappropriate that the issue was not debated then and that the stance of some community countries remains curmudgeonly and self-seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will not be surprised to know that i cannot answer my noble friends question <e> <s> however i very much look forward to being present in the chamber when he puts forward such a question for answering at question time <e>"]
