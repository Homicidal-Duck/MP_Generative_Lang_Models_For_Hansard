["<cs> my lords as the president of the value added tax tribunal i am not in a position to comment on the political aspects of the chancellors statement <e> <s> therefore i shall be very brief because i really only want to raise two matters which are now relevant in the background of the statement matters of the administration of the taxes <e> <s> before coming to those two matters may i associate myself with the congratulations expressed by the noble lords who preceded me to the noble lord lord miles in relation to his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating the noble lord lord renton for instigating this debate may i apologise to him and to the house for my inability to attend the opening speeches <e> <s> my inability was caused by having to sit in the crown court today <e> <s> this did not rise until oclock <e> <s> i have come along following the sitting in order to express a few remarks derived from my experience in the crown court the court where most of the offences which your lordships are considering this evening are dealt with <e> <s> we are here concerned with the offences of violence and dishonesty <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the long delay is because of the great number of cases awaiting trial <e> <s> i believe therefore that if one had a simpler system of preparing for trial and a system whereby the trials would not take so long as crown court trials involving the judges giving lengthy explanations and summings-up to the juries it might speed up these cases <e>", "<cs> my lords after some two and a half years of investigation the noble and learned lord lord keith of kinkel and his committee have produced two volumes of their report on the enforcement powers of the revenue departments <e> <s> clearly much thought and effort have gone into this production <e> <s> i understand that a further volume is yet to come in relation to customs and excise duty <e> <s> however this is a suitable time to discuss the recommendations made in relation to the taxes dealt with in the report administered by the inland revenue and value added tax <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is to be thanked for focusing our attention thereon in such a witty manner <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the fact that a large number of views have been expressed and time is getting late i shall be very brief <e> <s> before i start i should like to disclose a minor interest <e> <s> i am a small shareholder and a member of the controlling family in the littlewoods organisation which has a large number of chain stores and operates mail order and other matters within england wales and scotland <e>", "<cs> the question is that amendment no <e> <s> a be agreed to <e>", "<cs> it is very difficult to understand the amendments and this one in particular <e> <s> if you are entitled not to require voting rights to be exercised but you do not exercise the right not to so require then all those votes are not to be regarded for any purpose even though your right not to require the exercise of those votes is not exercised <e> <s> the whole thing seems to be rather odd <e> <s> perhaps the minister could explain how these matters work <e>", "<cs> does this amendment cover cases of voting rights not being exercisable by persons being dead and the shares not being registered in the name of anyone who can vote <e>", "<cs> i am induced to speak because i spent some -plus days in the hearing of the <e>", "<cs> i remember that when i was in practice one public company convened an important meeting for christmas day to be held somewhere in greenland <e> <s> the court had no difficulty at all in holding that that was an invalid convening of the meeting because the directors are under a duty at all times to act <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i have just one reservation in relation to the wording however <e> <s> i believe that the notices sent out by a company should be accompanied by a reply-paid form of proxy for posting only in the case of those shareholders who are entitled to attend and vote at meetings <e> <s> notices are normally sent out to shareholders generally but that is a minor point <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment which is designed to make it easier for <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a great honour to take part in the proceedings before the select committee which produced this report <e> <s> i should like to start by commending my noble and learned friend lord oliver of aylmerton for his guidance in leading the committee through its deliberations <e> <s> at this stage i also wish to record my praise for the officials who assisted the committee in its work and who efficiently and competently prepared the innumerable technical and legal papers drafts and advice for our consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may now ask two technical questions which arise from aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by adding my congratulations to those tendered by others to the noble lord lord byron on his maiden speech in which he made some telling points both in favour of and against various provisions in the bill before us <e> <s> we hope that he will pursue those matters in more detail at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> more often than most i have sat on tribunals and courts hearing not only litigants in person but representatives of litigants who are not qualified <e> <s> in those circumstances it is the duty of the judge and the tribunal to assist as much as they can the litigants and their representatives because it is their duty to achieve justice <e> <s> when there are incompetent people in front of you you have to treat them kindly and point out the way in which they should conduct themselves and their case <e>", "<cs> i also support the objections to this clause <e> <s> as i understand clause a person who is in contravention of the clause and fails to turn up at a hearing can be fined <e> <s> i assume from that that in due course if he does not pay the fine he can be sent to prison <e> <s> i believe that that goes one step too far <e> <s> i understand that non-payment of fines results in an automatic prison sentence <e> <s> i cannot see that that provision is at all justified <e>", "<cs> the trouble that arises from cases being settled normally arises because they are settled late <e> <s> when a case is settled the day before the hearing or in the morning before going into court the court may waste a day <e> <s> i have never heard of the courts time being wasted through a settlement and a failure to inform the court thereof <e> <s> i do not believe that that is a difficulty which is met in the courts <e> <s> i have never met it <e> <s> this provision is a sledgehammer to crack a nut <e>", "<cs> this is a fairly standard provision in acts of parliament in which people are called on for assistance and to sit with courts and tribunals <e> <s> there are specified rates <e>", "<cs> i had wished to speak to amendment no <e> <s> so should i wait until the noble lord lord mishcon has moved the amendment <e> <s> i was about to speak in case he failed to move it <e>", "<cs> i understood that the noble lord lord mischon was going to move amendment no <e> <s> so i could say something <e> <s> he has now not moved it <e> <s> if i am out of order i can only create trouble later on <e>", "<cs> i wanted to make one observation and i thank the noble lord lord mishcon for allowing me to do so <e>", "<cs> in the light of those explanations i should like to withdraw the amendment subject however to the one caveat <e> <s> i had in the back of my mind that the authority and its members would be interested in the actual carrying on of the activities and the treatment services <e> <s> the idea was to give an overall parliamentary control <e> <s> however having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as another member of sub-committee e which produced this report i wish to make a few very short general observations on the background against which it should be read <e> <s> like most matters which are considered by the <e>"]
