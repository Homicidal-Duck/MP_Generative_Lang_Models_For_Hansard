["<cs> my lords if i may intervene in this private argument that is going on i should like to say that i listened with great interest to the exposition which the minister gave us today on this order <e> <s> day after day we are now getting many orders and statements it was oil again today <e> <s> it was harold macmillan who referred to the wind of change but with the many statements that we are now getting it has become something of a gale before the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow my noble friend lord davies of leek who nearly always charms the house with his speeches <e> <s> i have listened to most of the speeches in this debate in this house and also to those in another place by the minister and the shadow minister <e> <s> i should like to compliment my noble friend lord strabolgi who also listened to those speeches on a -minute speech which cogently put the case in clear terms <e> <s> i think there is very little more that one can say at this hour which has not already been said <e> <s> i should like to refer to part of a letter in yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my tribute to those that have been paid in this debate to the noble lord the foreign secretary for his speech and for the manner in which he is handling not only the rhodesian crisis but the afghanistan problems as well <e> <s> i am sure that he has the support not only of your lordships house but of the great majority of the people in this country in the work that he is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to make one point quite clear <e> <s> he has indicated in his speech that at present large orders certainly for military aircraft and civilian aircraft are very much a matter for governments <e> <s> certainly that is so with regard to sales to the united states of america <e> <s> may i ask the minister with regard to permits currency and all the rest whether that function is to continue <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves the point on directors may i ask him this if british aerospace is going to be designing researching manufacturing military aircraft which may be on the secret list surely those directors themselves would have to be subject to the official secrets act <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very indebted to the noble earl lord kimberley for introducing this problem again <e> <s> it is obvious that there are two views about it and in contradistinction to the speech from my noble friend lord goronwy-roberts i cannot see why so many people are making a great fuss about not going to moscow <e> <s> i have said before and i repeat that the old olympics as we knew them and certainly as they were in the days of the greek conception are a dead duck <e> <s> the change perhaps began in in that other totalitarian state <e> <s> perhaps we never noticed it happening then or if we did we decided to disregard it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for introducing this subject and also for the very interesting speech which he made <e> <s> i should also like to add my congratulations to the noble lord the leader of the house on his recent honour which he so ably earned and to wish him well <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the speech of the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead very interesting because he knows this subject <e> <s> he is one of the very few people who tell us about the film industry who have had any real and practical experience in this very difficult and complicated industry <e> <s> i should like to join him in adding my congratulations to the noble viscount lord gormanston on his maiden speech in which he managed to say so much in a short time <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships house will listen to him in future with very great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful i am sure to the noble earl lord kimberley for introducing this short debate and i listened with great interest to the speech of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> the purpose of this paper is to explain how we believe the public sector can deploy its purchasing power to strengthen and promote the competitiveness of united kingdom industry <e> <s> this is as the noble earl has said a very important paper and a very interesting report and i am sure that if there is an adequate follow-up the exercise will certainly have been worthwhile <e> <s> in paragraph it says <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister if he can say how this will help the three electronic factories that were recently closed in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how this policy really helps technical development and research in the electronic industries in this country upon which our war potential and our defence requirements may vitally depend <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the figures he has given refer entirely to capital investment and not to hot money coming into this country to take advantage of the high interest rates money which can be withdrawn at the drop of a hat <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there is a certain amount of disquiet about this matter which i think was first raised last week in your lordships house <e> <s> i am intervening only very briefly because i happened to watch the incident with millions of others i suppose on the box <e> <s> the unstarred question asks her majestys government whether they will state the circumstances and also asks was mr michael carver dragged from the conference <e> <s> it further asks whether his fingerprints were taken and why he was asked to report today at six oclock <e> <s> it will be very interesting to hear the ministers answers to these questions because i hope very much that he will be able to set our minds at rest <e> <s> of course a great number saw this on television it happened to be a prime viewing time of the day and a superb opportunity for maximum publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that industry may be changing over to the silicon chip far more rapidly than was originally estimated would the minister therefore consider very considerably increasing the inmos scheme for the training of young school-leavers in engineering and science so that we are not left behind by the japanese and the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl lord bessborough that those of us who had the opportunity of listening to the speech of the noble lord the foreign secretary were not only very pleased to see him back in the house again after his many journeys but were impressed with the review which he gave us in the area of foreign affairs <e> <s> there is no doubt that he has re-established the name and the influence of this country in many of the capitals of the world even when he has been accompanied by the prime minister and even when he has been dealing with the nato chiefs in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning the war and the crisis over abyssinia i agree that the attempt to try to solve it at the stresa conference with flaudin and i think paul boncour was a failure <e> <s> while i recognise all that what we have to recognise today is that if the aggressors believe that we are going to do nothing about keeping ourselves strong as part of an alliance it will happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords i was particularly interested in what the noble lord said about the territorial army <e> <s> i understand they are going through some rather intensive training some of it commando training of a severe nature <e> <s> i hope we are not making it too severe or we might lose some of the youngsters involved <e> <s> at this late hour i wish to refer briefly to a point raised by the minister concerning supply and research and the ordnance inquiry which i gather he is chairing <e> <s> i wonder whether it is understood even now how vital at the outbreak of the last war we found our industrial technical war potential to be <e> <s> at the outbreak of hostilities we found ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to offer the noble lord lord boardman our congratulations on his maiden speech <e> <s> he comes to us with great experience and a distinguished career and i am sure that the contribution he will make in your lordships house will be of great assistance to the house and to the government <e> <s> i was interested in his reference to smaller industries a subject to which the prime minister refers often and i agree very much with what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble viscount lord sidmouth for introducing this debate and also for his very interesting speech with most of which i heartily agreed <e> <s> i have to apologise to the minister for the fact that owing to a previous engagement which i cannot cancel i shall not be able to stay to hear his reply because i always like to hear his speeches in this house <e> <s> i agree with the noble viscount that the government may have to look at the channel tunnel again in the near future if only to relieve heathrow and other forms of transport <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord greenhill who has just spoken that it is a hopeful sign that the minister of transport is now in the cabinet and as the noble lord lord tanlaw said that we are going to get a transport bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we have all listened with interest to the noble lord lord hinton of bankside with his great experience and knowledge of this problem <e> <s> it seems to me that the government might have consulted with him before they drafted their bill but no doubt as the minister suggested much of this can be dealt with in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord spens for having introduced this debate and also to the noble baroness lady seear for her considerable knowledge and the noble baroness lady sharpies who introduced the subject i think a year ago <e> <s> i agree with lord vaizey that it is certainly a long way from the executive suite to running a small business of your own and this is one of the problems that many find when they have the initiative to attempt to do this <e> <s> there have been many speeches today extolling the virtues of small businesses which we all support which depend for their survival upon enterprise <e> <s> my mind went back to a lunch at the reform club with sir will beveridge the day after he introduced his great social scheme when he said that he hoped it would not discourage the spirit of enterprise and make this country too security-minded <e> <s> i wonder whether he was right about that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always very interesting to follow the noble lord lord allen of fallowfield because he certainly knows the problem and understands the subject <e> <s> i found myself very much in agreement with the backward-looking view which he was taking of the matter and the way in which he related it to our real needs and what is in the bill at present <e> <s> i was also interested in the maiden speech of the noble lord lord tordoff who has spent many years in the chemical industry and who certainly understands the problems <e> <s> as he said in his speech i have no doubt that he will have many contributions to make when we reach the committee stage <e> <s> i agreed very much with the speech of the noble lord lord vaizey who is not here at present when he like other noble lords indicated that this bill is all right as far as it goes but that something else is needed if we are to grapple with the tremendous problems which we still have to face if we are to get out of this period of recession and unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not attempt to follow the interesting arguments of the noble lord lord selsdon regarding the amount of employment which can be absorbed in small businesses <e> <s> no doubt the minister will deal with that <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord glenamara for having introduced this motion which all of us will find no difficulty in supporting and for an interesting speech <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been better if the government or the ministry of defence had appointed a minister of information as in the last war <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the noble earl finishes his book and gets it published because i think that even this debate has illustrated how short can be our memory about some of the events that took place before the falklands invasion <e> <s> i agree with other noble lords that we were all very glad to hear the speech of the noble lord lord carrington because undoubtedly he holds a very real place in your lordships house <e> <s> but i must confess that listening to some parts of the debate i began to wonder perhaps wrongly if after all the lessons of the past months we are going to get on the old merry-go-round again and again with no possible solution in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to add to the tributes paid to the leader of the opposition <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos made a very able speech in introducing the motion and drawing attention to the record of industrial production and growth <e> <s> most of the speeches have referred to that <e> <s> it has certainly had the attention which the motion requested <e> <s> i also much enjoyed listening to the speech of the noble lord lord thorneycroft who i thought made a very eloquent appeal which i have no doubt will be listened to outside as well as in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as there are many more speakers to come in this interesting debate i am certainly going to be very brief <e> <s> like other noble lords i believe that the great speech we heard this afternoon from the noble earl lord stockton will have a profound effect not only in your lordships house but in the country as well <e> <s> those who remember his never had it so good will agree that he has never lost the golden touch <e> <s> we look forward very much to hearing him again in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead not only for initiating this very interesting debate on the film industry but for the great part that he has played in giving the service which he has to the film industry in the past <e> <s> i hope very much that he will continue to do so <e> <s> like other noble lords who have contributed to the debate i have tried to understand the governments white paper which is to precede the bill which will be going through another place <e> <s> it seems to me certainly from listening to the speeches that have been made here tonight that what the government have to decide is do they really want a viable film industry or do they not <e> <s> i hope very much that they will listen very carefully to what the noble lord lord willis said in his speech <e> <s> he put the whole case because he is in the industry and he knows what is happening <e> <s> it was completely realistic <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of the continental day coaches come to the centre of london put down their passengers and then cruise around empty for two or three hours and that this in itself is causing serious traffic delays <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon the showing on breakfast time television this morning of amazing scenes inside a rather doubtful night club in cyprus with british airmen taking part in all states of inebriation which operation was then turned into some kind of a soap opera may i ask the minister whether there will be any control of cheque book journalism over the next week or so while this inquiry is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested in the speech of the noble lord who has just spoken and in his reference to the north to which i hope to refer later which is going to be our great problem and also in what he had to say with regard to trained engineers <e> <s> in any newspaper today one can find six or seven pages advertising vacancies for skilled engineers and probably one of the mistakes we made some years ago was not to concentrate more on their training <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord molloy for his motion and for his moving and sincere speech <e> <s> i am sure many of us agree with him when he says that a sense of unity and purpose is vital <e> <s> i should like to deal with another <e>"]
