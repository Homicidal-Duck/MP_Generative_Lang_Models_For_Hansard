["<cs> my lords it is with all the humility and hesitancy of a new boy in his early days at a new school that i rise in your lordships house for the first time to make my maiden speech <e> <s> it is not merely that i am unaccustomed to this place it is also that i am determined to observe your lordships convention that in my first speech i should avoid controversy <e> <s> but i can assure your lordships that this <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order <e> <s> your lordships will know that i have no intention of speaking in this debate because of the privileged and honoured position that i enjoy in your house <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord will explain how the depreciation of aircraft affects the bottom line of the balance sheet <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord feels that the accounts have been manipulated <e> <s> i think that if the noble lord explains that in greater detail it will be of some interest to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> i was going to say that that is totally untrue but i am sure that i should not say that here <e> <s> your lordships will forgive me for my newness <e> <s> but that is quite wrong <e> <s> a licence exists for british airways to fly to america from there and an application to renew the service was filed some time before that <e> <s> i cannot give the date to the noble lord but it was not as he described the next day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reminded today really of the many hours that i have spent with the noble lord lord ezra discussing that great industry the mining industry which we were concerned with together <e> <s> i think that he has left me still concerned with it <e> <s> however he speaks eloquently and well and thoughtfully as he did so often on the subject that he knows so well <e> <s> it was in the debate on the second reading of the finance bill a year ago that i made my maiden speech here in your lordships house <e> <s> i have not spoken here since <e> <s> it made a deep impression on me but it was certainly not my intention that speaking should be an annual event <e> <s> however circumstances have conspired to keep me away from here at my desk rather more than i would wish <e>", "<cs> illegal my lords <e> <s> that is an interesting word to use <e> <s> i believe that your lordships would like to hear at least i would my noble friend expand rather more on the word illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords in the view of whom <e>", "<cs> my lords whether it is illegal is decided by the judiciary and the laws and the judges of the land and for something to be illegal is as a result of the law being tested <e> <s> this is too casual <e> <s> the noble lord may think it is improper <e> <s> i suggest that he does not suggest that it is illegal <e> <s> if it is i find myself in the most impossible position <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord suggest that i submit myself to bow street forthwith <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be no further interruption from me but i suggest that the law is tested as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not be free to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords now that my noble friend has asked me i must consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i comment before the noble lord finishes his speech <e> <s> the noble lord refers to assets that the airline which belongs to the state does not legally possess <e> <s> the noble lord is very casual if i may say to with the law and i am anxious that he would become more involved and he has promised us that he will <e> <s> as far as british airways is concerned the route network which is its principal asset is in the gift of government in the gift of government my lords <e> <s> the routes that british airways enjoy are routes that they have because the government allow us to have them <e> <s> the government can take them away <e> <s> the british airports authority can decide with government and through their agencies the use of heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i would want to ask the government who own the company <e> <s> i really do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course a sad time to be discussing this bill <e> <s> therefore one feels perhaps a little inhibited about what one might say about it <e> <s> but my noble friend lord mottistone has reminded us that this is now a parliament bill <e> <s> i think it a clumsy ill-considered piece of legislation <e> <s> i am surprised that it received such scant attention in another place <e> <s> no one is quarrelling with the view that audit committees and non-executive directors can and do make valuable contributions to our corporate affairs <e> <s> some of my best friends are non-executive directors <e> <s> what the bill seeks to do is to discriminate in an insidious way between the two categories of directors <e> <s> the effect of the bill would be to derogate from the collective unity and responsibility of the board <e> <s> it would be interpreted as a move in the direction of a two-tier structure which this country plainly does not need and on the evidence does not want <e>", "<cs> as noble lords may know i have had some experience in matters of privatisation <e> <s> i must with all humility say that privatisation has vast and untold benefits to consumers and the workforce <e> <s> it is however with regret that i must oppose the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> over a long period of time he has been a true and tried friend of mine and i disagree with him with some reluctance <e>"]
