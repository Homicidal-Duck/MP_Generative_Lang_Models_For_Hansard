["<cs> my lords i am one of those who are speaking this afternoon but who did not speak on the previous occasions when this bill was before your lordships <e> <s> house <e> <s> i voted against it but i did not speak because at the time the motion was put down my feelings on the matter were rather cool and i wanted to hear what the noble baroness had to say on the one side having listened to representations from my friends on the other <e> <s> after listening to the debate i voted against the bill because i thought an insufficient argument had been made out in its favour <e> <s> in the interim i have been studying the matter in more detail and in the last few days i have been doing some homework immersed with <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never come across such a case but that may be because my samples are selected like the noble baronesss by the people who talk to me <e> <s> one of the fathers of marxism it may have been marx himself was responsible for the dictum that our problem is not to understand society but to change it <e> <s> i cannot imagine anything more irresponsible by way of attitude <e> <s> it reminds me of an amateur surgeon trying to do an appendectomy with no knowledge of anatomy with no knowledge of asepsis and no knowledge of anaesthesia <e> <s> the result i imagine could only be the death of the patient <e> <s> to try to alter something as complex as society without taking the trouble to understand what holds it all together is to my mind very irresponsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for raising this matter and giving those interested in it an opportunity to air their own views <e> <s> at the same time i should like to apologise for missing the first few minutes of his speech to which hurried when i saw his name indicated <e> <s> i should like to refer first to his plea for moderate leadership and also to thank him for the exercise of that moderate leadership <e> <s> since he assumed the leadership of what i might call the animal protection lobby in parliament it has been possible for the first time because of his personal qualities for the leader of that lobby and myself as the leader of the lobby dealing with the use of experimental animals for medicine and science to talk to one another and trust one another <e> <s> the fact that i can tell the noble lord in confidence what i am doing and he can tell me in confidence what he is doing and that we trust one another and that he is an honoured guest at the annual dinner of the research defence society of which i am president is entirely due to the personal qualities of the noble lord and i should like to pay tribute to him <e> <s> that does not mean that i agree with him or with his political friends on a large number of matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to regulate the use of laboratory animals and related matters and for purposes connected therewith <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord sherfield for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in rising to put the motion which stands in my name to your lordships and commending the bill to your lordships good favour i should like to start by thanking all those whose names appear on the long and distinguished list of speakers this afternoon <e> <s> i am particularly gratified to see the name of my noble friend lord adrian who has selected it for the subject of his maiden speech <e> <s> his profession particularly well qualifies him to speak on this subject and i am sure he will win his spurs to your lordships entire satisfaction <e> <s> i shall listen to what he has to say with the greatest interest <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up the debate i should like to begin by thanking the whole house for the kind reception that has been afforded to this bill <e> <s> without a single exception everyone has paid tribute to the work of the drafting and advisory team which i was able to engage <e> <s> i should like generally to thank the whole house <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to establish that the technique of using whatever it may be a placenta or tissue culture gives the same result as that which would be obtained using an animal there needs to be correlation of the results on the former with the results on the animal <e> <s> that is where the supernumerary animals must be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount bear in mind that a statistical investigation into the utility of statistics could be a cure that was worse than the disease <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount tell me when the <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking nearly last unless somebody makes an intervention when i sit down i will try to be brief <e> <s> i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord nugent of guildford on his sustained initiative in bringing this matter once more before your lordships house <e> <s> he has recruited to the team that he has fielded on this occasion the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson <e> <s> i was very glad to find myself batting on the same side and to be able to record the great pleasure that i had in listening to his speech as to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord strauss <e> <s> he cut some skilful figures over some thin ice but his skates bore him safely to an elegant conclusion <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will look forward to similar performances on a future suitable occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to those of previous speakers to the noble lord lord northfield for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject <e> <s> may i at this point offer my congratulations to the noble viscount lord thurso for his faultless presentation of the facts which he has struck at with such scholarly command thereby enabling me to economise on a lot of what i would like to say <e> <s> economy is much called for <e> <s> two years ago somewhat euphoric because the met <e> <s> office of whose advisory council i am chairman had successfully predicted a blizzard on caithness some five days in advance of the actuality i travelled to caithness through all the hazards of those days and spent a very pleasant hours at dounreay getting a lot of questions answered which had been concerning me since the occasion of the motion of my noble friend lord sherfield <e> <s> i returned so euphorically to take part in the debate initiated by the noble lord lord wynne-jones on st february two years ago that i spoke for minutes a calamity which i shall endeavour not to repeat at this late hour <e>", "<cs> i gladly support the amendment of my noble friend lord ingleby and i added my name to it <e> <s> the bill is a convenient vehicle in which to introduce this amendment into parliament although the bill generally speaking is concerned with the administration of education rather than its content <e> <s> those engaged in sexual education are a mixed bag <e> <s> some of them are highly responsible dedicated people but alas infiltrated from time to time by extremely unpleasant types <e> <s> we know what infiltration can do <e> <s> from time to time the repercussions of a scandal like a jumping cracker still explode in the public domain starting with permissiveness at oxbridge and softness at the foreign office and ending with treason based on sodomy <e> <s> we know the whole unfortunate history of it and that is what comes of soft attitudes in ministries towards undesirable people <e> <s> i have a word for these the phthoraphiliacs of this world <e> <s> that is the same root as was used in the indictment of socrates for corrupting the youth of his city <e> <s> although what followed was judicial murder the nature of the indictment is still a grave one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that for many years this has been standard practice <e> <s> whenever a credit squeeze has been <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the noble lords reply to my noble friend do we have to wait until a policeman is run over before taking precautions <e> <s> surely prevention is better than cure <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall how only five years ago the whitley council system having broken down two bodies under my chairmanship managed to bring order out of chaos and align all these salaries with one another to the satisfaction of everyone and that the consequence of it being handled piecemeal ever after has been that it has got back into the mess it was in <e> <s> have the government any proposals for reimposing unity through a unified command over this structure <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that whatever conclusions come from todays studies would be a function of todays costs and prices and that what is at issue for the future is not realistic assumptions on the lines of lord aveburys questions but updating the conclusions of any current inquiry regularly year by year in the department of energys annual report so that the issue is not lost sight of in future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government be ever mindful that the finest way of securing unemployment among heavy engineering firms in perpetuity is to postpone making a beginning on the installation of full-scale plants until everybody else is doing it and has the experience so that we then have to buy abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord ever considered reviving that ancient custom of the stocks <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord boston will permit me i should like to make a very brief intervention <e> <s> i did not put my name down as i was not sure that i should be able to attend the debate <e> <s> i merely wanted to say as one who opposed the noble baronesss general bill that i would still oppose the general bill but i would not do other than follow the lead of my right reverend friend by saying that i would consent and approve the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords could those responsible adjust the system so as both to conserve fuel and stimulate employment in the textile trade by turning the temperature down in winter and perhaps up a little in summer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that if speakers on the second reading of the housing bill were to do what they are asked to do which is to confine their speeches to minutes with an extra minutes for the three front benches speakers then the whole debate would be through in four hours and as it is now three oclock we would be through by seven <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the amendment moved by the noble marquess lord salisbury if he <e>", "<cs> on every question that the clause shall stand part in both the heath and carr bill and every other bill since <e>", "<cs> the party of opposition has read several noble lords order <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into a committee on recommitment on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to explain to the noble lord lord mishcon that the passage to which he has referred is an importation from clause of the bill as committed by way of a transfer to the first section of the act which includes all sorts of things like bull-baiting horse beating and so on in order to make sure that scientists as it were do not come under the suspicion of all these various horrors <e> <s> it is stated explicitly in the act i hope the noble lord will give me time to find the reference to it before i wind up that the painless killing of an animal in a

should we explicitly include agriculture is it to be interpreted as public health or biological science one or the other or possibly both <e> <s> i do not regard this as a very serious matter <e> <s> i regard it as a negotiable point between what i might call consenting draughtsmen in private and i should be very happy to open talks with the noble lord on those lines <e>", "<cs> i can only say that we occupied much time in committee on this very point and that this was the balance of our considered judgment <e> <s> noble lords will notice that the words registered laboratories occur in clause b <e> <s> the words are the management of registered laboratories <e> <s> it seemed to be a convenient way of referring to them throughout the rest of the clause <e> <s> i hope the noble lord is satisfied with that explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the choice of the word insurgents a rather odd one to describe a nation in arms defending itself against a foreign aggressor <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> last thursday when the bill received its third reading i omitted to move the usual privilege amendment before it was sent to the commons <e> <s> such an amendment is necessary because of the financial provision in paragraph of schedule the purpose of this motion is to enable the error to be corrected by giving the bill another third reading and including the privilege amendment before the bill is finally sent to the commons <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> in face of that very positive assurance from the noble lord i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> or a landlord <e>", "<cs> i am anxious to oblige the noble lord and to save the time of the committee by not prolonging the argument but when the noble lord talks about asking what will be reasonable in the future of course the future means the present when a decision has to be taken and the court would only be asked to decide in the present how it would view the matter retrospectively <e> <s> if the noble lord will as it were take that under his belt as well then i shall be content <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his reply to my question <e> <s> i am glad to learn that there has been reconsideration of the security arrangements <e> <s> in probing a little deeper into this matter i wish to steer between the scylla of asking the noble lord to comment on a matter which is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i observe that i should like to speak on the amendment of the noble lord lord howie of troon but i have taken advantage of the advertised programme to do something else at oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry <e> <s> i have been doing my best to speak into the microphone <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord the minister was able to hear what i was saying <e> <s> i was saying that i had tried to find some general legal authority for this but that although consulting a textbook i really felt that i was not up to the task <e> <s> i should be greatly obliged to the noble lord the minister if he would he so kind as to give me the authority for whatever assurance he is able to give <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to anything that the noble lord lord strabolgi or the noble baroness lady birk may wish to add for my own part i must be content with the very positive assurance given to me by the noble minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment standing in my name <e>", "<cs> i believe that nobody else has indicated their wish to participate in the debate so with the permission of the committee i should like to wind up on what i hope will be a helpful note <e> <s> i do not wish to divide the committee at this late hour of the night on this issue <e> <s> i know that many noble lords feel very strongly on the point as i do and that a number of them have not been able to stop up so late as this but have had to go home so if i do not divide the committee on this issue tonight i must reserve the right to bring it forward again on report with the consent <e>", "<cs> then why are we subjected to this flood of bad language if this system works <e>", "<cs> it does not work so let us try something else <e> <s> my noble friend lord hill of luton was chairman of the board of governors for substantially longer than i was a member of the board of governors but i was a member rather before he became chairman <e>

to be under some limitation on this amend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to regulate and control the use of living animals for scientific research and other purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords like others who have spoken i should like to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord nugent for the opportunity to debate this contentious territory yet again knowing that however contentious it may be i cannot convince myself that the balance of the argument one way or the other is very much more than marginal <e> <s> i have lived with this subject for very many years because the noble earl lord howe is not the only member of the public policy committee of the royal autumobile club to address your lordships <e> <s> he and i sat on that committee together for years and the noble lord lord chesham was also on the main committee <e> <s> the engineering and technical committee was always thinking about the design of seat belts and i should think i came up against this problem once every three months whenever we had a committee meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in rising to do so i should like first to assure your lordships that down to the last comma it is identical to that which your lordships were kind enough to pass in the session of parliament that has recently ended <e> <s> your lordships passed it about six months ago <e> <s> it is no longer just a private members bill my own bill drafted by myself and those who help me <e> <s> it represents the best solution that a select committee of your lordships house could find to a complex and controversial matter <e> <s> it was a formidable well-qualified select committee and i am glad to see my noble friend lord ashby in his place and so many members of that committee down on the speakers list to speak about it <e> <s> i have already expressed my thanks to my noble friend lord ashby <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up what has been a most interesting debate i shall try to do so as quickly as possible because i am sure you all want to start your christmas holidays certainly with my good wishes as soon as possible <e> <s> if i may take those who spoke in that order the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley and i often did not appear to be agreeing <e> <s> but i think that our disagreements were not always as wide as they sometimes appeared to be if one took a superficial view of them <e>", "<cs> my lords my interest in this subject for the debate on which we are all grateful to the noble baroness lady masham of ilton has been progressive with the years and has marched in parallel with the progressive disablement of my wife <e> <s> she has wisely followed the example may i call it the <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a field game at eton called the under- <e> <s> if the noble lord is ignorant of that i will tell him about it after the debate but i should not think that the rest of your lordships would be interested in the precise technical details in which as i was told in after years i had slipped my disc <e> <s> it was just called a bad back in those days and later on lumbago <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl bear in mind always the overriding interest of the british housewife in the conservation of supplies and the non-depletion of our reserves and that anything done to cheapen the price of industrial gas and to promote its largescale use is directly contrary to the interest of the domestic consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords no matter what is the outcome of the considerations that the noble lord is seeking may i ask what steps will the government take to prevent the fast reactor becoming an example of so many praiseworthy british initiatives which have been heavily backed with public funds only to find themselves lost in the sands of governmental penuriousness until the day when we have to pay others for the know-how whose completion we have foregone in this case probably the french <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord strathcona and i withdrew our amendment at report stage against an undertaking by the noble earl to take its subject matter under his wing and review it <e>", "<cs> my lords our debate is taking place on the initiative of the noble lord lord peart whom we thank for it because the locust years are now yielding their harvest of dead sea fruit <e> <s> how often have i not asked your lordships in rhetorical mood do we have to be cold hungry and unemployed before we come to our senses <e> <s> because if that is the way we insist on having it that is the way it will have to be and my lords that is the way it now is <e> <s> a world depression has found us out <e> <s> we with one of europes weakest softest economies are having to endure a long overdue shake-up of our shortcomings <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be but i chose roosevelt as an example and if the noble lord will permit me i will construct my speech in my own way and choose examples of my own selection <e> <s> i repeat why would it be wrong for the government to do now what it was right for roosevelt to do then <e> <s> if the demand on the capital goods sector falls below its potential output at full employment the wage packets in that sector cannot load the demand on the <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary i am saying it is the only thing but it is the one thing we have legislated ourselves out of a position to invest in <e>", "<cs> i was saying it cannot be done in the way he wants at the moment <e> <s> a trading nation such as ours cannot ignore its terms of trade <e> <s> if they turn against us our standard of living must decline or we must work harder or we must work more effectively through rising productivity <e> <s> in such circumstances it is futile to suppose that we can make someone else pay our share by putting in for a compensatory pay rise <e> <s> it is sometimes said there are only two sentences you need to learn in a foreign language when travelling abroad <e> <s> the first is my friend will pay for the drinks <e> <s> that is no basis for a policy <e> <s> the second is one with which i will not trouble your lordships this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> would he agree that ici has just coughed up million in redundancy payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord for giving me the origin of that quotation <e> <s> i took it from the title of a book by wynwood reid <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord matthews who has acquitted himself well in that very trying ordeal we have all been through at one time or other the making of a maiden speech <e> <s> such a speech is supposed to be non-controversial <e> <s> so far as i am concerned this speech conformed to the model and i agreed with everything that he said <e> <s> under the classical categories of modesty wisdom and wit he has won his spurs and i am sure i will be voicing the good wishes of your lordships if i say that we shall look forward to hearing him again on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the real problem in all this <e> <s> how are you to keep a workforce of million or thereabouts out of mischief happy and occupied with something or other when literally there is no manual work required for them to do <e>", "<cs> if i may come to the help of the noble lord who has just spoken i too sincerely apologise to the committee because i missed the beginning of this debate it was called a little earlier than i had budgeted for and i arrived late <e> <s> like the noble lord i do not wish to take up the time of the committee by doing more than recording my support for this amendment <e> <s> i think that one or two bits of sandpaper could perhaps be used before report stage but i should like my noble friend to be assured of my support <e>", "<cs> i hope that the right reverend prelates who have sponsored this amendment will not <e>", "<cs> i cannot remember whether this bill is before us now for the third or fourth time round but i think it is quite possible that it will not get on to the statute book this year and it may be before us for a fourth or fifth time round <e> <s> so i would not want anyone on that occasion to suppose that i had been a party to letting it go through on the nod <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby whose characteristic vigour always enchants your lordships when he addresses us in bellicose mood has drawn attention to the fact that a certain very famous bill took eleven times round before it got through this house <e> <s> i have been consistently against this bill from the start and the voting on it what the noble lord calls the bran tub depends very much on what day of the week it comes forward what time of day it comes forward and what was the previous business before the house <e> <s> that is what controls the composition and cross-section of those who debate it so it may be that it will come forward for a fifth sixth or seventh time <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by apologising to the committee for not being in my place when the motion to move the house into committee should have been moved <e> <s> a sudden acceleration in the tempo of the business on the floor of the house coincided with a blackout in the public information service and i am greatly obliged to my noble friend lord houghton for intervening on my behalf <e> <s> perhaps i may just respond in general terms to the remarks made by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley on the obligations of those who worked together as colleagues in the select committee of the house <e> <s> by all means let us discuss matters which are on our minds in committee <e> <s> everyone is entitled to have second thoughts <e> <s> it is quite a little while since the committee reported unanimously but the bill as it stands represents a fragile concordat between two groups with a century-old tradition of mistrust between them <e> <s> my noble friend lord houghton and i have worked for quite a number of years in trying to resolve those feelings of mutual distrust and to get people working and talking together <e> <s> in a sense the unanimity of the select committee and the compromises there to some extent symbolise his and my hopes for the future <e> <s> if we renege on that unanimity then one factional amendment and as i said at second reading anybody can improve the bill from his own point of view and i say factional not factious will generate another and the end result is that our handiwork is undone <e> <s> therefore i appeal to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley to withdraw his amendment when it has been discussed and debated to his satisfaction as i on my side shall ask leave in due course to withdraw my own amendments for the same reason notwithstanding their merits <e>", "<cs> with my coat tails torn in one directon by my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby and in the other by my noble friend lord energlyn i think i must obey the newtonian principle that action and reaction are equal and opposite and maintain the position which i started from which is that this amendment was an illustration of the fact that if you desert the principles of unanimity that we had on this bill then an amendment from one of the interested parties merely provokes an amendment by the other <e> <s> i think that is all we need to say <e> <s> we have had a useful discussion <e> <s> the last thing i would wish to do would be to use the need for unanimity to stifle discussion or anything like that but i think i <e>", "<cs> again i feel as the peer in charge of the bill that i cannot go along with the noble lord lord beaumont on this one and once more i hope he will do what he said he would do i have no need to underline it and withdraw the amendment in due course after we have had a reasonable discussion of it <e> <s> i do not feel the amendment takes us further than subsection <e>", "<cs> i delayed my contribution because i thought that in the course of discussing alternative methods we might drift a little towards a second reading type of debate <e> <s> perhaps i can assist the committee by bringing us back to the substance of the amendment <e> <s> first there is here some loose drafting which perhaps the noble lord lord beaumont has not noticed <e> <s> a procedure and a result are two entirely different things they are different kinds of animals <e> <s> one is consequential upon the other they therefore cannot be similar <e> <s> that is a drafting point which i can see the noble lord has taken and i will not refer to it any more <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord beaumont that this is an amendment of substance <e>", "<cs> i do not think that either under the cruelty to animals act of or this bill the minister is bound to give a licence to anybody merely because he asks for one <e> <s> the point is that if someone is under an obligation to have his product tested and the conditions of test fall foul of this act it is not a question of whether this act gives the secretary of state power to issue a licence but whether his doing so or not doing so falls foul of some other act <e> <s> this is the real point at issue <e>", "<cs> i am well content at this point with what has been said on this amendment and propose to withdraw it unless the noble lord himself wants to speak on it <e>", "<cs> i should be prepared to concede that the noble lords point may indeed have some substance and i should like to look at it rather closely when i have more time available but the amendment will be withdrawn in any case <e> <s> i should like to assure the noble lord lord beaumont that it is not mandatory on the government to give licences under these conditions <e> <s> it is permissive to say they may do so <e> <s> if the foreign testing procedure was abhorrent to the conscience of the british people they could say all right then let it be done abroad <e> <s> that is all right you cannot stop it being done abroad <e> <s> i am merely saying that for the most part to do one set of experiments which will provide safety standards for two countries is an economy of animals but i think we have said all we need on that <e>", "<cs> i feel that if with the last amendment standing in my name i violated all that i have pleaded for during the course of our debate the noble lord lord beaumont could with justice charge me with a double-cross <e> <s> in those circumstances notwithstanding what the noble lord lord ferrier has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on this question of clause i want to take the committee a little further through the clause which was to some extent anticipated by my noble friend lord houghton on clause stand part and press the noble lord the minister to tell us a little more than he did on clause about the position in regard to strasbourg <e> <s> i know there was a meeting of which i have had an account but not yet minutes from the home office last week <e> <s> everybody made their points as part of the briefing of our representative at strasbourg but i still need to learn the governments reaction to it <e> <s> i know that all is not well at strasbourg <e> <s> the germans have reneged on part of

"<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> that is not the way i read the condition in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel that the answer that the noble lord gave to my noble friends question was really satisfactory from a logical point of view <e> <s> he quoted the fact that the immigration officer can require this or can require that or must not be obstructed and so on <e> <s> but if he is not there how can he require anything and if not even his ghost is there how can he be obstructed <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not putting the cart before the horse <e> <s> are not the people who ought to exercise restraint those who resist the modernisation of archaic processes <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships indulgence i should like to add a few words to what has been said in support of my noble friend lord nugent in this context that i have supported him so often that it was natural that he should ask me to speak in this debate again <e> <s> unfortunately i was so preoccupied with other business of the house yesterday that i forgot to put my name down <e> <s> i should like to thank him for introducing this bill and to congratulate the promoter of the bill in the other place <e> <s> prostitution is a general evil to which we do not know the answer but i think that the transformation of the streetwalker into the call girl is the reduction of a public mischief and acceptable on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to draw the attention of his right honourable friend to an article i wrote in <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord nugent replies may i draw your lordships attention to the fact that the word includes occurs twice in subsection once in line and a second time in line <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment is defective in so far as it alters the word includes to means in line but does nothing about its receurrence in line <e> <s> i should have thought that for an amendment tabled as late as this has been to ask us to take this in our stride is wrong and i appeal to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby to withdraw this amendment and have another look at it before it is brought forward again at a further state of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am feeling confused by what the noble lord has been saying <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord mishcon can come to my rescue here <e> <s> i have always believed

mean by the th day there having been no prosecution <e> <s> because if that is what it means it does not say so <e>", "<cs> i must leave for another occasion the question of whether the amendment says
