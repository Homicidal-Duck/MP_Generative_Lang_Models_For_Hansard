<e> <s> at least i hope they will not shut the door upon that going into this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give an assurance to your lordships house without any equivocation that no pressure will be brought by the government upon acas not to pursue its legal rights in the courts as was rather suggested by the noble lord who asked the question <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord robbins looks at clause he will see that the amount of is alterable by order <e> <s> i wanted to ask the government if when they reconsider the penalties imposed under clause they will consider

analogy as it were as reasons for not extending it into company affairs <e> <s> they doubted whether union members knew of their rights under the act and they doubted whether they could get the forms to contract out <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord harmer-nicholls even alleged at column of the <e>", "<cs> your lordships will have noticed as has the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that i am

any tax disadvantage under my schedule compared with the situation as at present <e>", "<cs> would the minister state exactly who did the surveys and across what sample they were done <e>", "<cs> following the noble viscounts reply i feel that it is necessary to say something more to the committee on this matter <e> <s> first i wish to say on behalf of myself and i think one or two of my noble friends that the noble viscount adopted an attitude which we have noticed some of us being quite new to your lordships house has become a fairly regular procedure on the part of the government <e> <s> with great charm and urbanity he attacked my personal integrity in moving the amendments <e> <s> if i may use his words he said that those who moved them were bogus in motivation and hypocritical in nature <e> <s> this kind of attack from which we on this side of the committee always try to refrain is one part of the double standards with which one hopes your lordships committee will not be troubled too much longer <e>", "<cs> i have views on that and i would be happy to discuss with the noble lord on some other occasion whether we should reconstruct the entire law rather than the trade union act but the noble viscount has already accused me of being irrelevant in these very amendments and it would be wrong for me to follow the noble lord lord robbins into further irrelevancies <e>", "<cs> i see <e> <s> we can resolve that by looking at the <e>", "<cs> i accept the noble viscounts remarks about my sincerity and express my now new understanding about the amendments themselves

concentrates on the act and ends up by saying that the shareholder does not have less rights than the union member <e> <s> i repeat that the shareholder does have less rights but he will have equal rights when these amendments are passed by the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has put it in a nutshell <e> <s> you could sum this up by saying you the director must promise

apologise for missing the opening remarks of the noble viscount but i heard him say that it is not appropriate to introduce this consolidating measure now because the common law is still being

<e> <s> i am saying that no such test exists <e> <s> what is common between myself and the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls is that an across the board test would be quite impracticable when our company law deals as it does with both small companies and giant companies <e> <s> if we ever divided our company law so that we had one code for the giant one for the small and perhaps something in between there might be another debate <e> <s> however as matters stand i agree with the noble lord that it is not practicable and presumably the government agree too i am sure that the noble lord and

of directors is to take account of the interests of employees <e> <s> no doubt we all accept that just as they take account of other interests the interests of consumers and so on but we agree that the position in law is not that <e> <s> the position in law is that they owe their duty to the company and the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls pointed that out <e> <s> in fulfilling that duty to the company they must take account directly of certain interests above others <e> <s> the law is clear that they must take account directly of the interests of shareholders present and future and in fulfilling their function and since cases like <e>", "<cs> it is precisely from the parliamentary point of view that some of us wish to press these amendments including that amendment now under discussion <e> <s> if the government had wished they could have brought forward not a bill i quote the long title to amend the law relating to companies but a bill with a different long title <e> <s> if they had chosen to bring forward a bill to amend company law so as to bring into effect the second directive and matters related thereto then they might have been able to resist these arguments <e>

donington has said it has to do with company accounts and that will take a long time and is very controversial it has to deal with the new small proprietary companies and that is controversial and complex and it has to deal with all these clauses <e> <s> it will be a very large bill <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord has just said on behalf of the government is very surprising because what he has said is that the government appreciate that this matter has been under discussion for a long time that it has become very urgent because of the london and county matter and the peachey matter that they know about the jenkins report and know that loans to directors are a major engine of malpractice but they can think of ways around the clause <e> <s> the government have thought of other forms of credit <e> <s> the government did not have to think of them they were raised by the previous bill <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to what the noble lord has said in seconds i am well aware that the peachey

a golden opportunity <e> <s> they appear to have legislative time for two companies bills <e> <s> no secretary of state for trade has been in that position for generations <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> i

my noble friend has suggested his previous government of had clauses for it clauses were put forward in standing committee f in another place this very year on behalf of his party <e> <s> it would not be impossible to put through in this bill a reasonably worded set of clauses to deal with insider trading <e> <s> he asks us now please let us leave it out of the present bill after <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble viscount will not misunderstand me if i say that we have heard that argument for years or more <e> <s> some of us have argued for this legislation since the s <e> <s> we have always been told that it is the wrong time and the wrong draft <e> <s> it just will not do any more <e> <s> the noble viscount implied that it is a small problem <e> <s> i am not sure how small a problem it is <e> <s> i promise that i shall make these points as briefly as possible but they deserve to be made on a companies bill <e> <s> to put it in context many of us were told in it is just not necessary

number of practitioners have said to me how convenient it would be if schedule adopted the practice of its own paragraph and set out where words are substituted or inserted or altered in the or so amendments to the older acts the full text of those sections <e> <s> may i ask the government to consider this point before the report stage <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend and i should like briefly to point out to the noble lords who sit on the liberal benches the peculiar constitutional doctrine which they have now invented for themselves <e> <s> if their doctrine were right and one could not vote in this house against a second reading against the will of the elected other place and one could not vote against a clause be it the important clause of a bill because that is the will of the elected other place then it would always be possible for the government to have their way in this house by bringing forward one clause bills <e> <s> that would be a most peculiar state of affairs <e> <s> my noble friends have said that this is the only way in which properly and constitutionally we can vote and express our revulsion and horror at this attack upon comprehensive education

squeezing out of unpleasant measures and the budget and the other statements made <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case the noble earl had better listen to the statistics <e> <s> it is often said and i understood the noble earl to be supporting this that the employment laws are antipathetic to recruitment and that the consultation redundancy period is also antipathetic to the recruitment of workers <e> <s> this has been investigated by chambers of commerce and certain employers organisations <e> <s> but the only two independent investigations of this matter have been first the survey by daniel and stilgoe in of firms employing from to workers and secondly the opinion research centre survey also carried out in of firms employing less than workers <e> <s> what did they find <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will deal with that in his reply <e> <s> i am saying that as far as the statistics exist they do not form any platform whatever for a change in the law <e>", "<cs> my lords the two surveys i quoted were carried out by independent investigators and they covered some firms <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to get the record straight <e> <s> we are discussing the acts of and and i state publicly and for the record that i played a very small part in advising on those two statutes <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister tell the house

her to recognise that this policy will debar universities whose income is being cut by an average of per cent <e> <s> and in the case of certain institutions including those in the university of london in which i am proud to declare <e>", "<cs> and therefore will inevitably damage irreparably the education which they can offer <e>", "<cs> not only to overseas students i am sure the minister will wish to hear my final few words but to home students who come from british schools as well <e>", "<cs> i have listened to most of the second reading debate and what comes through to me is the importance of the committee stage <e> <s> it looks as though the noble lord the foreign secretary may be intending to resist the amendment <e> <s> i hope that he will not but it looks as though he is going to <e> <s> that means that the government arc going to commit themselves to the prospect of acting without a cease-fire <e> <s> the noble lord the foreign secretary cannot blame noble lords on this side for stating that obvious point that by resisting this amendment they have to go on record as being in that position <e> <s> it was the unwisdom of bringing forward this very bill which has impaled the government upon the amendments moved in committee amendments which noble lords on this side have been bound to move <e> <s> i still hope that the noble lord will not resist the amendment but if he does he will put himself in a position because of the governments own bill of having to make a pronouncement which he might have wished not to make in order to retain a better position in the negotiations themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to contribute four points to your lordships debate for which we are very grateful to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> i wish to assure the noble baroness that on this occasion at least i approach the problem in no party spirit or with no party interest <e> <s> indeed i must declare an interest <e> <s> i hold a chair in the university of london at the london school of economics and on this occasion i speak largely against my background of some years of teaching and research in universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to advert to the quota point if the noble lord will allow me to develop the argument <e> <s> there was the factor of the quota which was imposed on universities but such evidence as i have heard from those in charge of admissions in various universities also relates the decrease to the increase in fees <e> <s> that is to say two factors were at work as the noble lord lord annan is quite right to remind your lordships the quota and the increase in fees <e> <s> i do not know how many overseas students the noble lord lord annan has discussed this matter with but i have discussed it with a few and it is perfectly clear that the per cent <e> <s> increase in fees was a factor in that per cent <e> <s> decrease <e> <s> what can we expect in after further fee increases of between and per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies may i say that i have some sympathy with him in not being a scottish lawyer but if an english lawyer could <e>", "<cs> in view of the noble lords great experience in these matters does he not think that one of the problems in our <e>", "<cs> with the experience of lord taylor it is difficult to disagree <e> <s> my experience in regard to matters concerning school governing bodies is much less than his except through the children i have had at state schools <e> <s> i detect in the debate something of which i have a great deal of experience

the universities <e> <s> it was said that graduate students must not come on to committees of the college and of the london school of economics <e> <s> then it was said about undergraduate students

disagree earlier in committee took me a long way down the road of his argument albeit that i did not share his starting point in religious beliefsand i felt that his argument was very compelling for

<e> <s> this would lead to a lot of litigation it may be said <e> <s> i suspect not because any adviser to a third party would naturally find it difficult in many cases to prove the chain of causation

amendments nos <e> <s> and the director must or must not do certain things and a connected person must not be the loophole or way out <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my question is really that the government will not accept any amendments and i say that with respect to the noble viscount <e> <s> he says it is unfair to single out the grownup child who has left home <e> <s> the bill says nothing about him leaving home <e> <s> children over are fully independent and the likelihood to do wrong is less <e> <s> is that so <e> <s> i know some people over who are crooks and would do wrong at the

i have the difficult job from this bench of replying to the debate <e> <s> as did the noble baroness lady seear i will attempt to be brief but i cannot promise to be so brief as she <e> <s> one reason for that i say this particularly to noble lords like the noble lord lord orr-ewing is that sometimes i felt as when the noble lord lord orr-ewing attacked my noble friend lord mccarthy for misinterpreting and misrepresenting the bill that i had been reading a different bill from that read by some noble lords who have addressed your lordships house tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords national

goes on to reduce the unfair dismissal rights of workers as a whole as my noble friend <e>", "<cs> indeed the noble earl reminds me i had forgotten the point <e> <s> if it is so offensive to the free market economy to have in schedule statutory machinery to help the low paid why is it not offensive to have statutory wages councils <e> <s> do not they offend the mancunian leanings of the government

noble friend lord mccarthy <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene very briefly in your lordships debate on this clause <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl resumes his seat there is perhaps one slightly technical point in the clause which i should like to raise <e> <s> we on this side of your lordships committee have noticed with interest that it applies to firms where there are workers <e> <s> that is a very different term from employees of course it is much more widely defined in the act and includes contracts of service and for services including people working on for example the lump in a construction firm <e> <s> if you take workers employed by an employer and his associated employer that is any other company in the group as the <e>", "<cs> the remarks of the noble lord lord spens require one of those of us who sit on this side of the committee to comment <e> <s> i hope that we are not to have the debates on this bill against the background of the claim that the avenues of democracy in the trade union movement are so closed as the noble lord suggested <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord mccarthy the avenues of democracy in the trade union movement in britain today are more effective and wider than those in almost any other institution in our society <e> <s> it really will not do to ignore the fact that trade unionists spend much of their time voluntarily administering their union on a democratic basis in the branch the regional committee the district committee the specialised committees and groups annual conferences and special rules revision conferences <e> <s> it really will not do for a chamber of this authority to approach trade union affairs in that manner <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes an interesting point <e> <s> is he in speaking to his amendment now advocating compulsory ballots within the labour party if members or per cent <e> <s> demand it <e> <s> there is a distinction of course between the labout party and the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> perhaps i misphrased what i said and the noble earl is unable to understand the point <e> <s> ballots are not to be sneered at <e> <s> ballots are a good method of testing the opinion of members when a union wants to use them and in the way that a union decides to use them <e> <s> there are faults in union democracy we said so but what the noble earl has not explained and perhaps he will now explain it since he is favouring this clause so much is exactly what industrial problems will be solved by enforcing ballots upon the unions as this clause wants to do <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the spirit in which the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has responded and i understand his argument but we do not share his view and perhaps very briefly i might put the case why we feel we must press these amendments <e> <s> but first in relation to the press charter and the existing code of course what he says is absolutely right but there is no question of it being adducible in evidence in any court under the existing section <e> <s> so far as the example suggested by the noble lord lord wigoder is concerned if the code said that pickets should wear armbands it might or it might not be to the advantage of a particular defendant be he a trade unionist or not but it highlights the question which my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones put as to what criminal issue the wearing of the armband will relate <e> <s> it is in that respect that in the criminal law the code is bound to do rather more than it does in the civil law <e> <s> if i may take the

"<cs> in that kind of case but that is a case of a discretionary civil remedy as between the law of scotland and england and i think there is not a great deal of <e>", "<cs> one feature which has been mentioned is the question of why the clause if it has any logic and we shall argue later that it has not should apply only to someone who has lost either a job or an offer of a job <e> <s> even in the pre-entry situation there could be an offer from the employer saying if you get into the union then i will take you <e> <s> that is a well-known situation <e> <s> as regards seamen if the union will take him in the man may be put on the register which is perhaps the tightest of all <e> <s> the reason we say that this clause if it is to apply at all which we shall resist must logically apply where a man has lost a job prospect or an actual job <e> <s> this is related to admission to unions and several speakers have referred to unreasonable admission and it is much more relevant to that particular point <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl resumes his seat would he take his logic to extending the very unusual appeal on a question of fact from the tribunal to the appellate body the employment appeal tribunal in cases of unfair dismissal by the employer <e> <s> there too there might be a <e>", "<cs> i cannot express how disappointed <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble baroness lady seear that accepting as i do that she agrees broadly with this amendment we agree that there may be cases where the practice should be broken <e> <s> but the difference in our approach to industrial relations from hers is that we say it should be done by agreement not by the <e>", "<cs> i accept everything that the noble and learned lord has said but i trust that he will not leave the matter without pointing out that when the person goes to the industrial tribunal the industrial tribunal can order not his card to be returned to him but compensation <e> <s> however that tribunal cannot tell the employer to take him on for a job <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind that we are in committee there is one very important point that the government have not answered <e> <s> the noble earl may think it right that i should put the point to his noble and learned friend the lord advocate or indeed to the noble earl himself as it is a legal point <e> <s> the question has been raised but i think not answered <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to ask a brief question <e> <s> in unfair dismissal the limits in the governments bill apply to someone who is and has years of service <e>

<e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the spirit of his reply <e> <s> i accept that this is what would happen normally <e> <s> the amendments are meant to raise the problem with the government and perhaps in doing so i may also say that the question surely arises whether the high court should have power to stay the proceedings in the tribunal if the two sets of proceedings overlap <e> <s> it would be very unfortunate if as he accepts could happen there were two sets of proceedings proceeding contemporaneously <e> <s> on that basis in the hope that the government will deal with this matter expressly on report and in the two jurisdictions i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am happy to adjourn now <e> <s> i misunderstood the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i misunderstood the noble earl before <e> <s> it is the view of my noble friends as well as myself i was discussing it when he made the point which was why i misheard him that there is a need to discuss the next amendment very fully because it is one of the most fundamental points in the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord lord mottistone will not think ill of me if i say that i do not think he was in the committee when i began my speech on this amendment <e> <s> i then said that the burden of proof has to lie on someone and in an unfair dismissal case it lies upon the employee to prove the dismissal <e> <s> it lies upon the employer to prove one of the what are sometimes called ok reasons such as conduct capability qualifications to which he was referring as regards that subsection

be unfairly dismissed in a society which faces million and more workers unemployed is something the government cannot do without deep shame <e> <s> we shall divide the committee on this clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount for giving way in order to save time on the point <e> <s> following my noble and learned friends question would the noble viscount also not agree that the commission decided the case on the facts before it <e> <s> in paragraph it said that the situation might be different where a worker entered into a contract of employment with an enterprise where a closed shop agreement already existed in which case it might perhaps be said that he consented to join a specific union when taking up employment <e> <s> in paragraph the commission states categorically that according to the commissions interpretation and again this is the majority article neither prohibits nor allows the system of closed shops in general <e> <s> they decided a particular case <e>", "<cs> i was asking a question <e>", "<cs> there are two things to be said on this amendment and i address myself <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord rochester is surely right it is a

opportunity to say that we will come back to this matter on report <e> <s> since the noble and learned lord said that he did not quite understand the point i was putting may i explain that the point is that if this chamber were a group of employees and a union membership agreement were coming into effect and all the noble lords sitting on the benches <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to take issue with the noble and learned lord but in view of the hour i shall take his word and ask leave to withdraw the amendment asking the government still to consider the matter when we come to the report stage

is taking that example when in the next paragraph the government are about to abolish the basic award altogether <e>", "<cs> i should have been much happier if the noble and learned lord had added an assurance that this would be enshrined more clearly in the revised industrial tribunal regulations <e> <s> however in view of his response i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect in some manner the noble and learned lord has not fully understood the full complexities of the problem <e> <s> he accepts that section is not to be in any way amended but he then says the complainants evidence will come first the employers evidence second the trade unions third and then the tribunal will take into account those parts of the evidence that are relevant to fairness on the fairness and those parts that are relevant to pressure on the pressure <e>", "<cs> something needs to be said as to whether this clause shall stand part of the bill because of the

not in any sense a criticism other than my own surprise at being in a position in which i have never been before that is to say being in a revising chamber at in the morning discussing what will

sex discrimination act was thought by many to cover at least some of the types of case which have subsequently arisen <e> <s> now it is clear that the sex discrimination act does not apply to a case such as the one which has come to light recently of an apprentice electrician on a six-months probationary period who was sacked after five months because her employers discovered that she was

friend lord houghton that the problem of what amounts to compulsion and here i agree with the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is a very difficult matter <e> <s> i personally think and i have discussed it with others that the three examples i gave are at least within the ballpark of argument as possibly amounting to compulsion increasingly probable as one goes on <e> <s> when the noble and

of the possible consequences of this clause <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord pursues the legal logic which i follow under the bill <e> <s> he did not pursue the practical consequences which we believe arise in particular from the very lines which we suggest should be deleted <e> <s> we shall not divide on the issue but we shall not withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the

upon that the concept that there is no onus of proof involved in relation to the issue of reasonableness surely flouts the very fundamental description of the tribunal which has been put before your

matters in relation to that issue is on somebodys shoulders <e> <s> i appreciate that the tribunal try to act in a very informal way but from this side of the house one cannot accept that that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment from the government cannot be allowed to pass without three comments <e> <s> i follow the noble and learned lord the lord advocate when lie says that because of the definition in section <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have not sat down perhaps i may respond <e> <s> the noble lord is putting it to me in the terms of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate

and later legislation but we had better concentrate on this <e> <s> there is a serious risk <e> <s> i was interested that the noble and learned lord went as far as he did in saying that if the risk materialised the government would consider introducing something <e> <s> i should have thought the case is now strong enough for the government to think again before third reading in this sense that the matter is clearly not just theoretical secondly because if the noble and learned lord considers the passage of amendment no <e> <s> you cannot use that way out of the problem you cannot define your union membership agreement boundaries by reference to union membership in any way at all <e>", "<cs> my lords plainly we must leave this as a disagreement <e> <s> i meant to say previously that

found earlier with slightly different definitions <e>", "<cs> my lords we are disappointed at this response from the government at this very late stage <e> <s> since the noble and learned lord referred to it i have to refer to citrine <e> <s> but first i say that the noble lord produced no argument as to why our amendment would be confusing <e> <s> our amendment clearly states in effect

com <e>", "<cs> my lords i expected little else except that i did expect the noble earl to say that there had been consultation on the point with the tuc and the cbi but he did not say that <e> <s> it is interesting that the government have decided to change the basic definition of trade dispute which has been there since which in their previous administrations they have not even put on the agenda for amendment except in the period when it disappeared for quite different reasons which they never consulted about with anyone and about which says the noble earl there are very rare but very damaging cases <e> <s> with no consultation the entire area of worker v worker disputes disappears from trade disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points <e> <s> the amendment proposed would in fact solve the problem because the test of purpose would then become the test of when the secondary action was to be put within the ring as it were of discussion <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has not solved our problem at all <e> <s> he says the relationship is as described <e> <s> there are two points of description in subsection about the strike action or industrial action <e> <s> one is that the employer is not a party to the trade dispute and the second is that the industrial action is taken in relation to the trade dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i withdrew the notion of absurdity from my description of the noble and learned lords reply to a previous clause <e> <s> i am sorry that he should think this absurd because it really is not <e> <s> in fact with great respect his description of the situation is absurd <e> <s> the workers who wish to join the union have been penalised and to their aid comes whatever the word compulsion means the industrial action from another place of work <e> <s> so they are not doubly penalised but doubly aided <e> <s> it is the non-unionists at the place of work caught by our amendment who of course would be penalised in the sense that if there is any economic pressure or compulsion that can come from the industrial action under subsection that of course would tend to push them into the union <e> <s> but the workers who want to join the union get a double assistance not a double penalty out of our amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that does require some response <e> <s> firstly in regard to the case of the <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord referring to subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords my printing of page of the bill if the noble and learned lord has the same document as i have relates to subsections and <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble and learned lord my lords <e> <s> my complaint then about it being only in the schedule is wrong <e> <s> nevertheless what is the justification for reversing the burden of proof <e>", "<cs> that is so my lords <e>", "<cs> i accept the noble and learned lords assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not appreciated that i needed the leave of the house to speak again but if the noble and learned lord chancellor says i need it then i ask for it but i did not think i needed it in replying since it was my amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord resumes his seat having heard him say that in this respect the only proper way of ascertaining the best allocation of resources the real value of resources and the rate of return is current cost accounting no doubt he therefore takes the same view of companies engaged in similar work registered under the companies acts <e> <s> when do the government intend to make it mandatory upon these companies in his view there being no other proper way of obtaining a true and fair view of the allocation of resources <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl ensure that in a review of the operations of the wages councils care is given to ensure that the wages inspectorate is afforded more resources and is able to inspect and enforce the wages orders <e> <s> at the moment it appears to engage in only a small number of inspections but in regard to average inspections it secures for the workers many tens of thousands of pounds of wages which ought to have been paid to them but which had not been paid <e>", "<cs> nevertheless before we leave this matter i was listening very carefully and am partially convinced by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and i hope that we shall come back to it on report one of the points that has struck me about a debate in which i have not pretended to be as expert as noble lords who have spoken is the place of the police <e> <s> i believe that the record will show that the description of recent events by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor brings that out <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is of the opinion that he has moved this amendment which i understand is the position in this committee i did not speak to the last amendment for the reason that that amendment did not change company law in a fundamental way it extended the ability to have redeemable shares which already exists to some degree <e> <s> this amendment i would submit is the very centre of the new structure which as the noble and learned lord has suggested will be entirely novel albeit we have for centuries been out of step with many european legal systems and with the united states jurisdiction in certain respects as well <e> <s> nevertheless since the noble and learned lord i am sure has relied a great deal upon the most interesting report by professor gower <e>", "<cs> i think that it is necessary to put on record the fact that at twenty-five minutes to nine oclock this evening your lordships have just passed over amendments in committee true we can come back to them on report which no doubt is the assumption in everybodys mind <e> <s> as has been said by my noble friend on this side of the committee from the front bench these are very important clauses <e>", "<cs> it would be unfair of me not to substantiate a slightly wider area of difficulty than the noble and learned lord has suggested <e> <s> of course he is right in saying in the situation he has suggested that where there is a clear breach of contract and no other problem emerges then if you apply this clause to that situation yes that is as far as you get <e> <s> but there is another area of difficulty <e> <s> if you take cases such as <e>", "<cs> may i intervene before the noble lord replies so that he can perhaps deal with all the points raised at the same time <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd has surely raised a matter of very great importance in relation to the way in which company law appears to be made under this administration in the legislature <e> <s> the last companies bill went through your lordships house with a certain girth and then expanded to twice its inches in another place <e> <s> this bill has now had made to it perhaps one of the most important additions in company law for a century namely that which reverses the rule in <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to speak in a different sense on this amendment because the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran appears to have established a norm of close agreement which is reasonable from which one trespasses at ones peril <e> <s> but i hope that your lordships committee will not accept the amendment <e> <s> for once i hope to hear from the government front bench the sentiments which i wish to put before your lordships <e> <s> it is true that after the two decisions of the court of appeal in the case of <e>", "<cs> the minister has dealt with so many interesting points that i am tempted to follow them but i suspect in view of his tone that he would not wish me to do so and i shall limit myself to this it is not my understanding that this amendment is contrary to any treaty to which the united kingdom is party <e> <s> nor do i believe that there is great <e>", "<cs> i am sure that your lordships committee will have been very interested in the reply of the noble lord the minister in one particular namely that the government accept that section may well be too restrictive and that they are to bring forward proposals which relate more to companies powers to effect the necessary remedies via their own articles rather than via other action <e> <s> i can say only that that seems to me not to be the most fruitful road down which the government should go <e> <s> i suspect that many of my noble friends will feel the same and will consider that in a sense it is a rather dogmatic assertion that one should stick to the area of traditional company practice to boost company articles by the force of law but not to use the force of law behind investigations and inspections <e>", "<cs> it is necessary to say something more on the ministers reply <e> <s> he was kinder to our drafting than was the noble lord lord trefgarne but i have to be less than kind in my response to the rest of what he says because this is not an occasion where the bill is simply consolidating previous law <e> <s> it is making changes and we wish to make a few more <e> <s> it is not true that investigations are only to establish facts <e> <s> the noble lord cannot have been reading any since the savoy hotel report of <e> <s> it was once the view that they should establish facts but mr milner-holland broke through that in in the remarkable report on the savoy and berkeley hotel company <e> <s> since then inspectors have roundly stated matters of law and consequence and conviction and value judgments <e> <s> it is true not irresponsibly and that is why this amendment has so much virtue <e> <s> it attaches to people who make these statements a great deal of responsibility <e> <s> when lord justice buckley was quoted in the pergamon press case as saying that an inspector is not exercising a judicial function the noble lord knows as well as i do that that is in relation to a doctrine that lawyers invent like the doctrine of natural justice <e> <s> whether or not they get into that area of judicial or quasi-judicial power it has nothing to do with the fact that inspectors do not make judgments <e> <s> of course they make judgments where they think it right and they will go on doing so <e> <s> they will not be prevented from using even the phrase culpable malpractice by knowing that the phrase might carry certain consequences <e> <s> on the contrary they would know when and when not to use it <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for his response <e> <s> i must admit that i am still not at all clear about the second part of the matter <e> <s> i am posing the same questions and i seem to be getting the same answers <e> <s> no doubt we shall come to it again on another occasion <e> <s> as to the first part i and my noble friends have to remain in disagreement with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it does not seem to us that it is right that all the long-term contracts of service should necessarily be kept from the inquisitiveness of others whereas the long-term contracts for services are exposed in the accounts <e> <s> we do not see the logic of that <e> <s> but in view of the position in the committee i beg to leave withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an amendment which in my submission your lordships should treat as one of the most important that is being made to this bill <e> <s> for many decades it has been accepted by practitioners and writers alike that the financing of the acquisition of its own shares is one of the most objectionable features of company malpractice <e> <s> it has been known for many years that section of the act which attempted to ban it was inadequate and indeed that it sometimes hit the innocent and failed to deter the guilty <e> <s> but that it should be thought of as a nuisance is a novel concept <e> <s> it is a necessary protection for those who put their trust in a company be it as investors or creditors and when the noble and learned lord the lord advocate suggested that this amendment on the part of the government was introducing satisfactory barriers to misuse of the practice i would submit to your lordships that that is the opposite of the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls amendment does not satisfy me because the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord saying then that the bill wants to say that the thing is implicitly or expressly authorised by the constitutional documents or resolutions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord resumes his seat may i just intervene <e> <s> in keeping his and his colleagues minds open in respect of the innocence of the noble earl and again i have great sympathy will he consider with a tiny chink of an open mind the introduction of a rather more objective test in subsection in view of what i believe we shall find when we read his remarks which i shall do with care which is the great reliance which he placed upon the subjective test of subsection <e> <s> perhaps he could do that in that respect in regard to the guilty as well as to the innocent <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be useful if i say two or three sentences on these amendments the noble lord having made reference to my speech in committee <e> <s> i followed him with some sympathy in his early amendments from through to but gradually as he came to what he himself called the most important part of the list of amendments he certainly lost my sympathy <e> <s> my sympathy dwindles into opposition if i may say so when he comes to his amendment to subsection because there he tries by way of a list to free certain specific transactions <e> <s> one of the reasons why i wish to put this point is that i said in committee that i thought the list approach that is that financial assistance be unlawful except for a specific list of transactions was still possibly an avenue to pursue <e> <s> on reflection i came to think it was not possible to pursue it and that is why i have my name to the amendment which the noble earl will move later <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord replies to the mover of this clause may i put to him that while i find it a compliment that he should put upon a slight emphasis of my mind the importance that he ascribed to it nevertheless it cannot allow the government i say this without hostility to them at least on this occasion to escape from the fact that this is a legislative chamber <e> <s> if the government come forward with a companies bill and say we havent quite made up our minds then they cannot ask this house not to make up its mind if it comes to a view <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene it would not be his job to surmount that burden of proof <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord not agree that he would have to have under the next subsection a no reasonable cause to believe that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down and i intervene because i know that the noble earl lord selkirk will reply to the debate and therefore this is the only way in which i can ask a question will he perhaps reconsider his castigation of the subsection and paragraph on civil liability on page in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend as i am sure many of your lordships will for introducing this subject in your lordships house this afternoon a debate on higher and further education in a week which may well be crucial in many respects i too like the noble baroness lady seear must apologise to your lordships as i shall be unable to stay for the whole debate because of obligations owed to my university <e> <s> if i speak about universities it is not because i have failed to recognise the equal importance of further education i know that others of my noble friends will be speaking on that subject but because my experience lies in teaching and research throughout my life in the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords surely neither leavers nor population is the statistic to seek <e> <s> the important point is that although the number of year-olds has increased to a certain point by the number of year-olds will be the same as it was in <e> <s> it appears then not to be going down very much <e> <s> it may be just over <e>", "<cs> my lords without trying to bandy statistics with the noble lord would he not agree that there are other universities in which it is longer than the three which he referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks which country <e> <s> it is this country <e> <s> and which university <e> <s> the london school of economics <e>", "<cs> my lords without <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness therefore telling the house and the country in respect of the very large cut in public funds going to higher education over the next three years that being unable to estimate at all the cost which will be involved in early retirement and in breaches of contract on which i understood her to answer the noble lord lord robbins that she would prefer it if the contracts were kept or paid for if they were broken the amount that will actually be saved in public expenditure by the cuts in higher education is therefore totally unknown even to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment tabled by my noble friend to the original motion is of very great importance <e> <s> indeed for a government which is devoted to free enterprise and privatisation and market forces i would have thought company law is a matter of some seriousness <e>

unfortunate but it does perhaps characterise the situation with which we are faced <e> <s> every big companies bill is a re-examination of the mechanism by which business is carried on and a re-examination of the relationships of society with the enormous privileges of limited liability and incorporation which companies enjoy far bigger privileges than any other organisations in the land

prosecution <e> <s> it is no good the noble and learned lord saying that of course we face the problem of the burden of evidence and the prosecution having to prove something every day the question is what are the hurdles which the legislature puts up against the prosecution succeeding and this hurdle is too low <e> <s> the noble and learned lord did not address himself to that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i move amendment no <e> <s> h for a very simple purpose first to see whether we are right in assuming that the government also assume that civil liability will arise if there is a breach of

to investigate about overseas students is he aware that it is a little alarming that there is not even a general figure to give as an estimate of the contribution to the million which the charges on overseas students will provide <e> <s> secondly is he aware that many people will hope that his right honourable friend will have had consultations with his right honourable friend in charge of higher education <e> <s> is he aware that a large number of overseas students are now a necessary condition for the survival of the university system in this country <e> <s> is he therefore able to give your lordships or able to promise to provide the information which arose from those consultations as to the effect that these charges may have on the continuing availability of some of those higher education students <e> <s> i ask that because if i read in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would allow me would the noble lord like to tell the house the actual amounts of earnings those percentages relate to whether or not the workers got them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that the president of the birmingham chamber of commerce yesterday stated that the level of major disputes reflects directly the recession and as he put it the unacceptably high level of unemployment and that no one should be under any illusions that that will remain when the economy accelerates <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that it is widely understood that because of that situation his right honourable friend has introduced in another place the repressive labour legislation which is now about to go through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming back the noble earl whether with a sense of <e>", "<cs> that you will not do it again my lords <e>", "<cs> i apprehend that the noble and learned lords the lord chancellor and the lord advocate will in their good nature say something to accept the principle of this amendment whether or not the precise wording <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has laughed to scorn my noble friends suggestion that the bill attacks the rights of trade unions and in other ways laughed to scorn the idea that it has a serious effect will he tell your lordships what he thinks is the meaning of the new power to dismiss those on strike and the redefinition of the term trade dispute in respect of trade union rights <e>", "<cs> my lords how to try to wind up from this side of your lordships house an interesting debate perhaps first by addressing the noble earl lord ferrers and taking the opportunity to congratulate him from this side of the house on his recent honour and to sympathise with him in having to wind up the debate from his side of the house <e> <s> i have been listening all afternoon and evening for the answer to a simple question about this bill <e> <s> what has happened since th april to require this legislation <e> <s> that date is a very important date because on that date the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor gave evidence to the house of commons employment committee and in the midst of other sentiments of a similar kind he said this is at column <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wish to apologise to him and to your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord said that he was not sure which amendment i was moving <e> <s> if your lordships will permit me to point out i should have said at the onset that with your lordships approval i wished amendment no <e> <s> to be taken with amendment no <e> <s> because they go together <e>", "<cs> we are not getting on very well <e> <s> it is a very simple amendment <e> <s> what we are asking for is quite simple <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships for not having read part of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we want to know the secretary of states decisions and we want to know his grounds <e> <s> it is no answer to that to say that what should be a judicial procedure when you already know what it is because it would be published has been turned by the governments own bill into an administrative procedure and should therefore be kept secret <e> <s> that is no argument rather the opposite <e> <s> that which is done in secret in the expenditure of public money on grounds which are not disclosed is far more obnoxious than keeping it secret in court when it is dealt with <e>", "<cs> that is not true <e>", "<cs> my noble friends and i are very disappointed with the governments response to this matter <e> <s> i should like to make two points <e> <s> first it really does seem that despite the understanding of managements interest to avoid multi-unionism which the noble viscount has displayed and which we understand nevertheless in pursuit of their general policy on non-unionism the government have acquired a blind spot because they believe that the protection of non-unionism to the point of promoting industrial chaos is a policy which is defensible on the ground that it is even-handed <e> <s> we do not think that that is good enough in a modern society <e>", "<cs> what has happened in the southern states of america is something on which we should consult seriously in terms of how we want the workforce for the new technologies to be organised <e> <s> if you do not care whether the unions are independent then of course you do not care about the amendment <e> <s> it is because we still care about the whole question of house unions and unions being truly autonomous and independent and because we believe that industrial relations and society will best be organised on the basis of the autonomous and independent organisation of workpeople that we have moved the amendment at any rate to express the spirit which the government have taken out of the previous legislation by what is now in the new section and clause <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> that was rather disappointing and perhaps i might briefly point out why <e> <s> the previous legislation dealt with non-independent unions in a comprehensive way and this is a replacement for that <e> <s> the scenario which the noble viscount put to me would fall within section <e>", "<cs> it was not altogether surprising to hear that the government will not accept the amendment <e> <s> the government do not seem to be willing to accept any amendment to the bill nevertheless we shall try <e> <s> it is very heartening that my noble friend lord howie of troon and i when it comes to the crunch of looking at the bill really do not find that our positions are that far apart though when it comes to his amendments i fear that there will still be a distance between us <e> <s> i must say that i find the governments position quite extraordinary especially when it is supported by the kind of points that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made <e> <s> i should like to touch on two of them <e> <s> he said that the closed shop is an abomination <e> <s> there is a lot of this talk <e> <s> he also said that public opinion says that it is an abomination <e> <s> certainly time and again the public are told that it is an abomination without any reasons being given <e>", "<cs> i take the noble <e>", "<cs> can the noble viscount help your lordships on two points which are <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble viscount a question for clarification <e> <s> in referring to the period before he said and i agree that there was the right to sue for dismissal in breach of the contract of employment <e> <s> would he also agree with me that it is not a question of getting a job back because the remedy for breach of contract of employment was and is damages and not an injunction <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will reply naturally to this debate <e> <s> i intervene for only one minute to make two points <e> <s> the first is to the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> articles and as interpreted in the strasbourg judgment last year do not add to article <e> <s> we come to that in a later amendment <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friends and i feel like saying to the noble earl welcome back all is forgiven because at last the government have acknowledged that there is a problem of multi-unionism and they do not want to enact anything which would increase the problem <e> <s> we have been trying to impress that on the government during the last few hours of the debate <e> <s> whatever else divides us we share the conviction of the government that this amendment certainly would increase the problems of multi-unionism <e> <s> i cannot quote the noble earl fully but i am roughly right when i say that we share the view with him that this would mean anyone could join whatever union he wished and it would fragment bargaining arrangements in practice a great deal more <e> <s> there is also the right of any person not only to join an independent union which the noble earl mentioned but also the right to resign from any union in relation to section of the act as amended in <e>", "<cs> it was of course the noble and learned lord lord denning who had his knuckles rapped for referring to a speech of mine in this chamber in a recent judgment <e> <s> noble and learned lords will not do that <e> <s> so there is the point about the common law developing <e> <s> therefore what the legislature does at this point is extremely and doubly important and it is necessary to say the extent to which we feel and my noble friend lord mccarthy has told me he joins me in saying this that the position put from this front bench has not been fully understood and so it must be clearly re-stated in reply to the noble viscounts amendment <e>", "<cs> of course i do not accept it in those terms <e> <s> what i say is this as a matter of history and not just as part of a party battle this late at night <e> <s> the noble earl will know that this judgment is not technically binding on the united kingdom government <e> <s> if you regard it as morally binding you have to search for what the lawyers call ratio decidendi <e> <s> i join with him and entirely agree that the <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount resumes his seat may i say that i am sure we are in accord <e> <s> the minority judgment which he cited was the judgment of six judges agreeing with the majority but going much further in one direction <e> <s> the greek judge made a few remarks which agreed with the majority <e> <s> so that we remember it and i hope that the government pay due attention to it there was also the dissent of three of the scandinavian judges if we include iceland in that description which i regard as being brilliant <e> <s> i hope that the government will read it carefully <e> <s> they dissented and thought we <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is any risk in this amendment of controlling the union rule book <e> <s> on the contrary what i am saying is that if a trade unionist was reading as carefully as your lordships do heaven help him <e> <s> a bill of this kind and came to the point where he said i am going to be at fault he would ask who is going to be at fault if i am not readmitted <e> <s> obviously they will include lapsing i have just been discussing with my noble friend lord mccarthy the words used in case i get them wrong because in practice he is much closer to the ground than i am <e> <s> the words used are lapping automatic ceasorand automatic termination <e> <s> these are the phrases which are used <e> <s> i would chance my arm and say that in every major trade union rule book one will find a period beyond which there is loss of all or some benefits and beyond that a period after which ones membership runs out <e> <s> that is the structural arrangement <e>", "<cs> i can see that the government are not going to give way and we want to make progress <e> <s> perhaps i can say this <e> <s> my noble friends and i have been trying to think of the perfect illustration for the noble viscount <e> <s> we cannot give him the perfect one <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord jenkins because he referred to the kind of case we have in mind <e> <s> it is not a case where somebody is wrongfully expelled which the noble viscount seems to understand my noble friend to say which he did not <e> <s> it is the case where the man has left the union if you like has lapsed for non-payment of arrears under the rule hook <e> <s> then there is the question which section <e>", "<cs> yes if the noble viscount wishes <e>", "<cs> it goes on to say or <e>", "<cs> i was in my last sentence but i am grateful to the noble viscount for proving to me that he does indeed understand the bill <e> <s> i entirely agree with every word he said <e> <s> let us take a simple case a case where proceedings are pending and the complaint is i was improperly excluded <e> <s> it involves a lapsing and whether that be the only reason does not matter for the moment <e> <s> that is the complaint and it is pending <e> <s> the issue arises is he at fault through not accepting an offer of readmission <e> <s> that brings into play subsection <e> <s> obviously we cannot agree on whether the bill does that <e> <s> i believe that it does <e> <s> i believe that the question <e>", "<cs> further to the point the noble viscount has clearly put to us we now realise the division between us and the government on this much more clearly <e> <s> the point is that the agreement made freely entered into outside a closed shop to pay money to a charity in some agency arrangement outside a closed shop if anyone after this act decides to welsh on that then his dismissal is unfair irrespective of unreasonableness <e> <s> if it was simply a good reason for dismissal so long as the employer acted reasonably in dismissing that would be one thing but it comes within <e>", "<cs> i know that my noble friend lord howie has indicated that he would like to hear a view from this bench and of course there is some distance between some of my noble friends and myself and his view on this matter <e> <s> he has i now hear one advantage over me in discussing matters with the noble earl because the noble earl says that they are like two blind men approaching one another in the dark <e> <s> with the noble earl and myself i sometimes feel that it is a debate with two blind men walking away from one another in broad daylight <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount sits down although this is a late hour as my noble friend has said may i say that this is a most important matter <e> <s> this is something upon which the noble viscounts noble friend lord campbell of alloway plainly relied because the noble viscount first mentioned going to the high court <e> <s> first as the tribunals are to be out what is the procedure for going to the high court <e> <s> is it a writ a normal action a declaration interlocutory proceedings what is the procedure envisaged <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me a question and i will reply <e> <s> i have taken a case to the industrial tribunal and i have taken a case to the employment appeal tribunal <e> <s> i do not claim a great expertise <e> <s> many people who are not lawyers represent workers and employers at tribunals <e> <s> the noble lord may well have been involved in more cases than i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak in this debate only because of the state of the documentation that my noble friend and i found or rather did not find when we began to search this evening <e> <s> my noble friend is not fully aware of the fact that i acquired the full documentation only after he had come into the house and i rise therefore to make a separate point on this scheme <e> <s> in order to make it clear to your lordships i must put it carefully and may i say immediately that i join my noble friend in wishing to make it quite plain on the record that nothing that we say is any criticism of the staff and officers of this house or indeed of the other house <e> <s> they could not have been more helpful and they went beyond all measure to try to find the documents concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord glenarthur finally resumes his seat while i appreciate what he says i hope that he and his colleagues will not feel that we were trying to fire fast shots at him <e> <s> indeed i recollect that we passed one another in the corridor very rapidly shortly before this debate <e> <s> is my noble friend lord mccarthy not right to this extent that it will not do to say that we may pray against the amending regulations and to give no further answer than that <e> <s> tonights order will validate a certain area of ballots as being within the scheme and the amending regulations are plainly meant to provide the money and machinery <e> <s> so tonights order and the amending regulations go together hand in glove <e> <s> indeed tonights order is the glove without the hand because without the amending regulations the hand will not hand out the money <e> <s> would it not be right for the noble lord the minister at least to give your lordships an assurance that the amending regulations will be looked at again so that we do not pass without debate or with the need to pray against them regulations which if they were looked at again could well be put into proper shape <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur should at least assure your lordships of that <e>", "<cs> the noble earl says that he was not a conservative <e> <s> i thought he might take some comfort from the fact that there might be some militant trade unionists among the conservative trade unionists <e> <s> but i can believe he was wrong <e> <s> but this man was dismissed after a couple of days <e> <s> the tribunal considered the case on the basis of whether he was dismissed for his trade union activities <e> <s> the answer of course was no <e> <s> he had not had time to have any trade union activities <e> <s> he had been got rid of before <e> <s> that has happened in other cases <e> <s> what happened elsewhere is known <e> <s> the second problem and this is central to the noble earls reply on the last amendment is that he said that the need is to create an effective deterrent for dismissals on union grounds as against the vast generality of cases that the closed shop dismissals had continued to occur he concentrated on them so it is clearly about non-unionists and continued to be deliberate despite the act <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord gowrie is much too experienced a minister to know that if he distrusts my gifts or bouquets then i do not take easily to his pink herring <e> <s> what he says is true <e> <s> i hope that i did not mislead the committee and if i did so i apologise <e> <s> i shall put the following point in two or three sentences because what the noble earl is now saying leads my noble friends and ito even greater concern <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will know very well that one of the matters that most disturbs some workers in ethnic groups is the question of constructive dismissal where the worker is treated so badly at work that he feels he has to leave and whether he can prove a constructive dismissal in those circumstances <e> <s> that may sound rather an arcane and mystifying point but i am sure that the noble earl knows very well what i mean <e> <s> if one takes account of that there is a very worrying area of unfair possible dismissal <e>", "<cs> i did not wish to imply anything <e> <s> i would say two things to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> when he says that the question is different from the one to which i addressed myself namely that the question is of public authorities who dismiss workers i say that that is not so <e> <s> the noble lord must allow my noble friends and me to pick our own amendments and draft them for ourselves <e> <s> if we wanted to put down an amendment about dismissals by public authorities we would have tabled one and we have not done so <e> <s> i quite understand that the noble lord lord harris would wish to vote for that <e> <s> on the other hand he is being asked whether he will or whether he will not vote for an amendment which would end the distinction of between race and sex discrimination in dismissal and unionism and non-unionism dismissals <e> <s> that is what he has to decide <e> <s> no doubt his name will appear somewhere in the list <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> the noble earl made a number of points and i shall refer to only a few of them <e> <s> he said reinstatement was ordered in only a very small percentage of cases and that is so it seems still to be running at about per cent <e> <s> why not go to the root of the trouble and make reinstatement an effective remedy <e> <s> reinstatement and re-employment at the moment are generally called among those who look at the situation in the words of a recent article the lost remedy <e> <s> it can be done because in italy under the workers statute reinstatement is effective for unfair dismissal <e>", "<cs> we have now investigated at any rate most of the extraordinary areas of an extraordinary clause <e> <s> it is said as the noble earl has mentioned more than once that there are those who ask for protection but the examples are few <e> <s> indeed they can be matched by far more examples of other types of discrimination that might be thought to be as bad <e> <s> the figures have been discussed and while i and indeed the party for which i speak do not think this is the primary issue nevertheless the govern <e>", "<cs> the social democratic party give loud cheers <e> <s> of course because that is what they want <e> <s> they cannot see a way of solving the industrial relations problem which is a very real problem of workers who feel very strongly that they want to work with trade unionists <e> <s> workers are few who have to be heard with justice and who want not to be in the position of being pushed out <e> <s> the sdp has no answer to many things and it has no answer to this <e> <s> they say let us support the governments legislation which means punishing the people they do not like <e> <s> and those people are labour councillors <e> <s> all parties other than my own in your lordships committee will unite around that <e> <s> that is why they will unite around this clause <e>", "<cs> if i may <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord will remember that i said that those who are non-unionists may well be unjustly treated and that each case must be looked at on its merits <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down and with the leave of your lordships as the noble lord lord harris asked me a direct question about the position of the labour party on this clause perhaps i could answer him <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris need have no fear <e> <s> there have already been three divisions on this clause two of them on amendments proposed by us which went to principle as against detail <e> <s> fundamentally we oppose this clause but we do not think that that position would be made any clearer by making everyone tramp through the lobbies for a fourth time <e>", "<cs> this amendment was introduced at a fairly late stage in another place and in our submission it is a part of the philosophy of the bill which it has been made quite clear is not shared by members of the party opposite or indeed the members of the social democratic party <e> <s> but the position that clause requires is i suppose a quite logical development although one may question whether it is absolutely necessary as a practical matter in terms of that philosophy <e> <s> the industrial tribunal is being asked in regard to dismissals that come before it on grounds which are principally those of unionism or non-unionism to disregard action in so far as it constitutes any of the things set out in the clause that is to say a requirement that someone becomes a member of a union or ceases to be or refrains from becoming a member or <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble earl <e> <s> may i try in a sentence <e> <s> my objection and my partys objection to clause as a whole is made worse by this amendment <e> <s> i thought it was worth speaking to it now rather than twice <e> <s> if this amendment is passed it will make worse the central feature of clause namely that in no case whatever will anyone in the section position be able to have used against him the reduction procedure which the government are so keen on because anything that can be put against him will be rebutted <e>", "<cs> as amended <e>", "<cs> i hesitated before getting up as with leave i wish to do just for a moment because i did not know whether the noble lords who sit on the social democratic benches were going to say a word about the justice of this position <e> <s> however they are not and so may i say three things <e> <s> first to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i would say that i have had cases demolished and i am sure the noble lord has too but if the noble lord says that tonight the noble lord the minister demolished the case for this amendment then the noble lord the minister demolished the case put by the government on th march <e> <s> i shall look up the records with interest to see whether the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter voted with the liberal party spoke with the liberal party marched with the liberal party against the bill as it was then which is completely contrary to what it is going to be after this bill is passed <e> <s> i doubt very much whether i will find that <e> <s> secondly i have heard no evidence <e>", "<cs> indeed no but i am sufficiently sensibly radical always to want reasons for the change and none has been produced tonight none at all <e> <s> changing circumstances mounting coercion good phrases but not a good case <e> <s> indeed the words employee joinder have been used <e> <s> but of course the next amendment will show but let me put it now this is not employee joinder this is non-unionist joinder because it does not apply to trade unionists who are dismissed <e> <s> the case was that of the government in and it really has not been answered tonight <e>", "<cs> may i deal with one of the points at least made by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> perhaps i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i meant and hope that i said that industrial action within the meaning of clause does not necessarily have to be industrial action which is in breach of a contract of employment <e>", "<cs> may i just finish the point <e> <s> it is a very important point because if it can be lawful but industrial action then it means that one is being joined in a tribunal for something which is less than a breach of ones contract of employment <e> <s> i do not have the precise reference concerning that authority although it comes on another clause i hope to find that reference when we come to it <e> <s> the name of the case and it was a recent case was <e>", "<cs> i was speaking too fast i am sure <e> <s> the work to rule or go-slow does not necessarily involve a breach of contract not always not per cent <e> <s> in every single case as in the <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl think that the corollary of that would be an exclusion clause in the bill for trade union blacklists <e>", "<cs> i find that profoundly disappointing if not wholly surprising <e> <s> the noble minister says responsibility for their actions <e> <s> that is what i thought i was asking for in the last amendment and i did not get it <e> <s> now we have got it again and why <e> <s> because the defendant is a trade unionist <e> <s> the noble lord points out that there are orders of the high court order rule and order whereby other parties can be joined <e> <s> i was straightforward about this during the proceedings during the hearing <e> <s> that is quite true <e> <s> i said that the leave that you have to obtain is rather difficult <e> <s> it is not what you are supposed to do and to obtain leave from the high court will be very different from obtaining <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> on this amendment in saying what we shall do with it i would say this to the noble lord lord glenarthur and to the government <e> <s>

do for the government to tell us when the bill is obscure that the easy way to avoid problems is to stay within the law <e> <s> that is a self-contradiction <e> <s> what we are saying is that the law is not clear <e> <s> tell us what the law is we say and we will try to keep within it <e> <s> but i do not know what it is and the noble earl has not told me so that it is no good his getting up and saying that there is nothing wrong with the bill keep within the law and do not break it so as to effect a contravention <e> <s> what i am saying is that the bill is obscure <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble earl will not think i am in any way being other than courteous and respectful <e> <s> i want to remind the government of an occasion i have to admit that i do not remember which bill it was but i remember reading the <e>", "<cs> it is in the view of my noble friends and me very important now to look at the clause as a whole and indeed as i have said in regard to previous amendments to look at clause as the final chance of the committee to pass a judgment upon the trio of clauses <e> <s> as i shall suggest later they enact anti-union measures and indeed measures aimed at businessmen who are happy with their relationships with their unions and merely want to see common standards and fair wages resolution standards applied in a decent way throughout a trade <e> <s> it is not just unions who have things to fear from these clauses and the message should go out to businessmen <e> <s> as we have just seen over the last amendment the government do not care whether a businessman has charitable reasons decent reasons and justifiable reasons so long as he has one reason that he wants someone else to recognise or consult with a union that is enough for the government <e> <s> then he

is nothing in the document about that <e> <s> may i ask him a second question <e> <s> i asked i think specifically about fair lists <e> <s> the government specifically took a stand in and gave the reasons for their position on section of the act <e> <s> that position has now been overturned and these clauses do what the government said they would not do in <e> <s> what specific points about fair lists have the government taken into consultation and which parties on fair lists have they consulted <e>", "<cs> we on these benches have listened with great interest to the debate <e> <s> we have been a little disappointed <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris said that his noble friend lord marsh would explain the full legal complexities to us <e> <s> i do not think that he did that <e> <s> i contest the law in denmark france and germany as stated by the noble lord lord harris with which no doubt he and i can join at another time <e> <s> there are legal questions and indeed industrial and moral questions in these amendments <e> <s> there is a sense in which the noble lords lord marsh and lord harris solve the problem of lay off by the ultimate solution of putting the employer completely in the saddle and indeed equating lay off to dismissal at any rate as near dismissal as any employee would like to get <e> <s> the clauses as the noble lord lord marsh has taken your lordships through them give the employer as much power as it would be <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his efforts and i shall make a bigger effort <e> <s> i have said that the remarks that i am now making will save time in the end because they are a necessary preface to the amendments that we are moving and to which i am about to come <e> <s> one is dealing with damages because the first amendment is about injunctions not damages and that is why i am explaining the basis of the damages difficulty <e> <s> the basis of that difficulty is that with the six or seven major new developments in the law of tort in the last <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i shall ask leave to withdraw these two amendments although on the basis of some puzzlement <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate would well get his remedy if he went against all the officials <e> <s> the only point against going against the union is to tie it up or half tie up to get halfway towards damages and by an unsatisfactory procedure but to that we shall return on a subsequent amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is absolutely right <e> <s> i should have said that we would prefer the common law but that the government <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord lord lloyd has just said i must obviously try harder <e> <s> but i will not start again <e> <s> i will finish by saying this <e> <s> the noble and learned lord says that he does not follow the problem <e> <s> the problem is this that there are two different sets of principles in the bill that govern the liability of trade unions for the acts of their agents or the like <e> <s> we ask the government by this amendment why should there be two <e> <s> we do it in

has nothing to do with the members at swindon as against the union and in a sense that mistake is plain if one reads the amendment in the context of clause which is about liability in tort <e> <s> i agree <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway suggested that the amendment might be the plaintiff <e> <s> that is possible of course but it has nothing to do with the internal relationships between unions and members and trotskyists and all that sort of thing <e> <s> it is of course about the issue which could be very important for union liability in the union funds as to the validity of a repudiation <e> <s> as the bill stands it refers to the top people the general secretary the president and the executive although one fancies that the executive would not act until it had been convened therefore the problem is not quite so acute <e> <s> but the problem is acute for the president and the general secretary for the reasons adverted to in the last set of amendments by my noble friend <e> <s> therefore the issue does arise upon what basis of evidence is the general secretary and president although i say that it will be the general secretary in most unions to act <e>", "<cs> coming to the end of the string of amendments we begin to see through each crack how rotten is the core of the timbers of the clause and on clause stand part i think that it will be taken apart <e> <s> there are two small points which the noble earl raised <e> <s> he said that this change is to deal with the nod and a wink problem <e> <s> there is always a nod and a wink problem

you seemed to do it <e> <s> you overtly appeared to do it <e> <s> but in some way you cancelled what you did <e> <s> there is almost no formula except a very long and legalistic one that would avoid that even in part <e>", "<cs> i quite understand that <e> <s> the noble earl and i are very rarely in disagreement <e> <s> we both agree that it would be better if the problem did not arise <e> <s> if the president were removed there would not be a problem <e> <s> one would be left only with the acts which he had already committed <e> <s> the noble earl might like to ponder this <e> <s> we are on to a much more important point than i had realised and i am very grateful to him <e> <s> if he says that the way out for the union is to repudiate the president and to dismiss him under the rules i presume they get rid of him <e> <s> but the president has acted in his capacity as president so the clause applies <e> <s> where in the clause does it say that if you kick the president out by proper lawful means under the rules the acts which he committed to repudiate the repudiation of the general secretary do not stand <e> <s> what would you say if you were in court and you were asked where it is said that what he did was in his capacity as president <e> <s> there may be a conflict of evidence as to whether he acted in a private capacity <e> <s> the noble lord lord howie of troon would not do that <e> <s> he would give his lecture as president on union policy to members to convince them about what to do <e> <s> he would say that they should support south wales but that the general secretary does not <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord causes me anxiety <e> <s> i was going to press him as the noble baroness did about his answer upon the use of property paragraph <e> <s> i was also going to say to him that i knew that he understood very well that trade unions had never to my knowledge had any complaint made against them for not paying compensation for personal injury in spite of the technical legal position <e> <s> i see the case for saying that if they are liable in tort then in personal injury cases defined in a slightly better way than this broadly speaking yes <e> <s> i quite see that and in a sense i half conceded that in opening <e> <s> but it is the contrast between paragraphs <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down in order to make progress on his answers depend the question whether or not we move the next amendment <e> <s> we had hoped not to move it <e> <s> i should like to get this clear not merely for the purpose of vicarious liability for unlawful acts but in terms of legal analysis <e> <s> i heard i thought the noble and learned lord say to your lordships as the governments considered view that the trades union congress is now a trade union within the meaning of section of the trade union and labour relations act <e> <s> i should just like to check that i understood that correctly <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i say with leave that there is a total difference between having a general description which is not exclusive for the purposes of the tax law where the revenue has a discretion and presenting the court with a description which is not exclusive of the provident benefit fund having defined the political fund above by saying what it means <e> <s> here the government are dealing with what is and what is not not liable to taxation with a discretion but liable to be attacked by a plaintiff who has the right in the court to enforce against the fund except for that which is protected <e> <s> that is why it is a slovenly piece of work <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> was not moved <e> <s> i am moving amendment no <e> <s> and speaking to amendment no <e> <s>

disappointed at the reply by the noble earl but not surprised <e> <s> i cannot accept one of the points that he makes both legal and other although there is one at the end where we are at one but for different reasons <e>", "<cs> i wish to assert strongly that a number of the matters we have not discussed in detail are nevertheless of great importance <e> <s> what could be of greater importance than the definition of trade dispute <e> <s> the governments own green paper of accepted at paragraph <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to say so i am sure that the universities and the polytechnics stand in solidarity together <e>", "<cs> both the noble lord lord campbell and the noble lord the minister have addressed this repeal of a section which has been in our trade dispute law for many years as the noble and learned lord said since in two ways first that the subsection does not matter and can therefore be removed and secondly that it does matter and therefore it had better be removed <e> <s> it is an interesting way that the government have of approaching our trade union rights and trade dispute matters <e> <s> although broadly i accept the historical account that the noble and learned lord provided admirably condensed what a tortuous route it really was nevertheless i must add a word because there is a question mark against it <e>", "<cs> of course i was aware of the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have some reason to suspect that we understand the governments dislike of having even this small whiff of industrial democracy in this bill although i should like to ask the noble earl the minister for further details about the orders under the companies act <e> <s> i share the bewilderment of the noble lord lord rochester about their character in being different from what would be done under his clause <e> <s> but my specific question to the minister is in saying that the government will consult with industry is he saying that there will be consultation over a reasonable period on this very important matter with all relevant parties <e> <s> will that include the trades union congress and the relevant trade unions who have made representations to all governments on these issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the noble earl the minister notice albeit brief for which i apologise of a view which my noble friends and i wish to put to the house about this amendment <e> <s> it is perhaps a little unusual to say anything about the addition of the word or in a clause but one word can mean a great deal if it is anything like not <e> <s> it is a somewhat complex matter but we do not take the view that it is necessarily a drafting matter <e> <s> at least we would ask the government to look at it again in the light of the points which i would put briefly to your lordships on the clause <e> <s> this is after all a clause which was introduced in committee at a late stage and which introduces a very new principle into our law <e> <s> it is the central words of the principle which in my view and in the view of some of my noble friends may be affected by this amendment <e> <s> the new principle revolves around the prohibition of commercial or if it is taken in connection with clause industrial pressure designed however slightly to require that someone should recognise negotiate or consult with a trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down would he perhaps make quite plain to your lordships house what the government are saying about safety <e> <s> is it the case that the government are saying that the prohibition in this bill will prevent a person from requiring another either by commercial pressure or by industrial pressure to do his duty under the health and safety at work act and negotiate or consult with union representatives merely because they are trade unionists <e> <s> is it the case that this bill will take away the operation of the safety legislation which of course is not only the act of but the regulations of and the code of none of which the government have put forward for amendment <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord saying that the government retaining the law of the land as it is are now passing a bill which will prevent someone from using ordinary pressures of commerce or industrial argument and pressure to require that that be carried out as the statute requires and as the regulations require <e>", "<cs> my lords i invite the minister to think again on this subject and perhaps come back to it at third reading <e> <s> we take no particular pleasure at this stage of the bill when one is not able or indeed willing to oppose its main thrust in asking whether the government are not impaled on the horns of a dilemma of their own making by introducing a certain amendment late in committee <e> <s> all governments do that from time to time but i cannot refrain from noting that i wondered where i had seen it when in july in the middle of committee it was brought to us and then i found my <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be your lordships wish that i say a few words in reply to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> first it is true that what i was saying is relevant to amendment no <e> <s> a and possibly amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i was trying to be helpful to get the noble and learned lord to give us guidance which might make it unnecessary to discuss those other amendments because the same issue is below the surface of the present amendment as is apparent on the surface of the other amendments <e> <s> i was not in any way trying to do anything revolutionary <e> <s> that is not appropriate on <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord wilson tell your lordships whether he accepts that the analysis of the donovan report was shown in all major respects to be correct over a period of years in a publication last year entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it reasonable i do not think it just to have a position where a trade union is judged on totally different principles in one case where counts in the statement of claim allege torts of trespass and nuisance where the common law applies and in another case where allege trespass and nuisance and one tiny little interference with contract is thrown in which is very unimportant but nevertheless there because the plaintiff wishes to allege it

he said what i remember him saying i would have to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the time the debate having become one between lawyers when it is better to end it <e> <s> the refrain dont ask me what my law means leave it to the courts to decide is the refrain of the bad lawgiver from hammurabi and before <e> <s> that is what we have had today <e> <s> this is a perfectly reasonable series of amendments but the government are determined to leave the clause not only unjust which it is but also unclear and we shall therefore press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is not an amendment that it would be right to press but on the other hand my noble friends and i are somewhat puzzled by the noble and learned lords response and it is right that i should say why <e> <s> first we are interested that he did not mention the shop stewards handbook and that type of document <e> <s> we are very interested in the concept of branch rules branch by-laws branch powers chapel rules this kind of rule made under a power which stems from the union rule book for that is where its constitution is and that that is what is intended to be brought in <e> <s> one might have thought that it would be sensible to bring that in expressly of course as written provisions of rules made under or by reason of the main rule book because that would be much clearer if that is all that is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitated to give all the possible examples that could arise in this connection but they were canvassed in committee it is true <e> <s> the noble and learned lord will know as well as i do that section of the act as it now is it was section of the act in a different form has never been tested in the courts except in a number of irish cases <e> <s> he may well be right that were i briefed in such a case i might not make the same argument that i am making tonight because i would not be writing my own brief <e> <s> but i am writing my own brief tonight and what i am paid to do as an advocate in other circumstances might be different <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments logic is like the will o the wisp <e> <s> one adopts their marker for defining things such as the industrial torts and then we are criticised for adopting their marker <e> <s> one says lets do it this way which was done in and which would suit that marker and they say no we have learned a lot since then <e> <s> that did not get enough money <e> <s> unions were allowed to defend their funds <e> <s> this clause just shows that this bill is worse than the act of <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment will certainly not be withdrawn <e> <s> we have had a most astonishing response from the government <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell suggested that the widening of the concept of trade disputes would some-how affect the ability of trade unions and those engaged in industrial action to escape through section of the act <e> <s> there might be a case for that if the escape gateways

wearies the noble lord to hear about these matters my lords but the last debate suggested that the point had not got home as to the reality of the workers on these ships <e> <s> it is perhaps the cleanest and most decent example of workers throughout the world trying to help one another in a situation at the commencement of which everybody has to say i am against flags of convenience ships and

would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend resumes his seat i should like to ask him to accept that my intervention was out of a concern that he should not be misrepresented on

for political purposes whereas the full report shows that they received weighty but as it turned out incorrect and wrong advice from a solid legal source that this was not within the act and the meaning of political purposes <e> <s> i did not want him to go on record as regards the question of the defendants knowing that they were doing wrong which was not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to say that this is ground which we have covered in part before but not in quite the way that my noble friend suggests <e> <s> there are clear precedents for employment meaning in statutes the

not accept that it does not lie in his mouth to make the type of charge that he has made against my noble friend because <e>", "<cs> my lords in case i suffered from any slip of the tongue may i

lords perhaps it is suitable after a debate of this kind to draw a few threads out of it in response to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> if i may do so briefly to my noble friends who have spoken on the matter i respond with two points <e> <s> the first is that motivation is an essential part of clause and clause <e> <s> the grounds on which one is acting are the essence of these clauses so that naturally an amendment would be couched in similar terms <e> <s> secondly so far as my noble friend lord davies of leek is concerned i should have thought it should be noted more thoroughly than the noble and learned lord the lord advocate noted it that it may well be that there are more legal obligations coming from eec law by which <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is always quick to take advantage of our mistakes my lords <e> <s> with respect to the two points he made first he said that it was only about clauses in contracts <e> <s> that is not so because although clause is so subsection relates back to the previous clause and that deals with all sorts of commercial dealings with failing to put people on the lists failing to contract with them terminating contracts with them and so on <e> <s> it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mccarthy tells me that he is not able to speak again in this debate as we are on third reading <e> <s> so with your lordshipss permission i should like to address two remarks to your lordships concerning the arguments we have just heard from my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether to speak in support of my noble friends amendment although i support it <e> <s> however i believe it must be said that the noble and learned lord has done less than justice to it <e> <s> it is not entirely fair to say that this amendment would destroy the clause <e> <s> it goes to contracts and it goes to contracts especially to which employers would be party under most parts of the subsections proposed <e> <s> therefore the position would be that the employer would have another reason for saying i am not going to make that contract and the law does not allow you to pressurise me when i do not make it <e> <s> so that is not quite a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have welcomed today the bronzed translucent tan from the noble earl lord ferrers and we gave cheers for that but he cannot expect us to give cheers for a bill about which we can feel at the very best only a great deal of sadness <e> <s> in reading the debates during the recess i must admit to your lordships that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to explain to the house how the governments ambition to clarify the interpretation of the convention which i am sure your lordships would share is consistent with the express withdrawal by this administration of a defence which is clearly open to a country and which was put into the pleadings by the previous government to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> how is a desire so to clarify consistent with withdrawing such a defence leaving the court to say as it did a few words on the matter but having to leave it open because there had been a lack of legal argument <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government wholly satisfied with the legal status of a large number of young people in this scheme <e> <s> in particular are they satisfied about the way in which their status is at least doubtful and about the fact that in many ways they are excluded from the employment protection and discrimination legislation <e> <s> and i am hoping that the noble earl the minister will not say that this is a different question do the government recognise that this at least is one disincentive in respect of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords since the european court ruled against the united kingdom legislation on th july last year the government have tried three times if not four times to get it right <e> <s> on that evidence looking back one is bound to say and i say it not in any necessary condemnation of the noble earl because the house knows that the noble earl is deeply interested in this area that the government have not shown any great enthusiasm for the principle of equal value which they must now submit to and which this country is now obliged to adopt <e> <s> it is a great pity that community legislation on a matter of this sort has to go through this house and another place by way of regulation which cannot be amended <e> <s> that deprives certainly this house and it may be in certain senses another place of any function in relation to it in terms of getting it right <e> <s> i suggest to the government in this respect that because it is impossible to amend the government should pay more attention to argument today perhaps even than to votes <e>", "<cs> my lords i took the parallel that acas had certain powers to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i have obviously failed to make the point clear to the noble lord <e> <s> let me try to do so in one sentence <e> <s> if you are asking someone to do a job to make an assessment of a situation he ought to have the right to go in and look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever our ages would it be proper for the government to clarify a matter which is perhaps of profound constitutional importance <e> <s> is it the governments position in the light of the obligations of community law that legislation is nevertheless valid at westminster if it passes through the customary stages of both houses even though one or more of the houses clearly expresses the view that it is not in accord with our community obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the governments welcome but belated move to extend the protection of the health and safety legislation to young trainees will the government now take equal account of the need to extend to trainees employment protection legislation generally and fully to protect them in respect of the race relations act and the sex discrimination act under which at the moment there is only partial protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that by now the noble earl would have been at the dispatch box following the speeches of my noble friend the noble baronesses lady seear and lady lockwood and the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> but alas <e> <s> it is not so and it seems that the government are going to defend these quite extraordinary

party would wish to adduce <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble earl but before he leaves the point entirely i want to make sure that we have the case aright <e> <s> is it not the case that after the experts report has been admitted the only person who can call a witness upon matters of fact on which the conclusions of the report of the expert is based is the employer in

says that he intends to do that <e> <s> it must be one of the things that he is setting out to do <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down would he agree that if he reads on in the

understood the noble lord wrongly and i am glad that he accepts that there is not any case of gerrymandering proven in that area <e> <s> for the rest we can read <e>", "<cs> in regard to the election of directors which is the parallel would the noble earl accept that companies by way of a resolution of shareholders can indeed opt out of table a of the act which sets up a model <e>", "<cs> before expressing my disappointment with the ministers response i would say to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway that if i fell into error i am sorry <e> <s> it may be because i went too quickly as he put it <e> <s> but i could say to the noble lord that we are not dealing with model rules <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> donovan was talking about a model which you could then satisfy with variation from union to union <e>", "<cs> merely for the record i am sure that the noble earl would agree that the legislation is contentious in one respect in that it has met the sustained opposition of the trades union congress <e> <s> the noble earl feels that he is right but it is contentious legislation and he should not go on record in suggesting that that is not so <e>", "<cs> i can dissent from very little that the noble lord has told your lordships committee except his conclusion <e> <s> of course the definition has caused no problem under the employment act because no issue has yet arisen in court in which the problem occurs but it will <e> <s> secondly it is of course the case that in most situations one will see what is the executive committee but i come back to my example of the nupe rule book <e> <s> the noble lord gave us an extreme example <e> <s> but let us take the nupe rule book under which the executive council can delegate another committee to carry out certain of the functions <e> <s> that is what the rule book says <e> <s> carrying them out is exercising them <e> <s> it is still responsible to what the rule book calls the executive but then when the ordinary executive of a union carries out its functions it is responsible to some other body usually to biennial conference annual conference or whatever it may be <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble earls sympathy in so far as it related to the gastronomic aspect of our debate but not for the rest of his remarks which would perhaps best be taken up as he suggested on government amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i can perhaps just say in respect of my right honourable and honourable friends in another place that they certainly accepted the distinction between <e>", "<cs> if i may say so this seems to me a very simple point which the noble viscount has not addressed <e> <s> i agreed with almost all of what he said <e> <s> but my noble friend lord howie gave a second example involving the one that i was going to take in the three points that i want to put in reply <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty <e> <s> the noble lord has said that so let me briefly say a word <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and i apprehend that both he and i are in disagreement with the minister about a very simple matter of construction <e> <s> the bill states in clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble earls agreement <e> <s> this is a matter of human relationships <e> <s> unions we say faced with all the <e>", "<cs> i do not agree with the minister that this matter is dealt with by amendment no <e> <s> which has really become amendment no <e> <s> which we are about to debate when the government insert their new subsection <e> <s> but if the minister invites me to return to this point in that context i shall be happy to do so <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that those malpractices are proved or is the matter <e>", "<cs> nothing like it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that what he has just done is to repeat the argument of a disappointed litigant <e> <s> it is precisely the argument which was given to the ilo committee that decides these matters <e> <s> what the government are doing is simply saying that they will not accept the judgment <e> <s> in view of the way in which the government relied so much upon the international obligations of this country under the european convention on human rights in the light of the judgment given under that convention the way in which they pick and choose the international obligations which they will satisfy and obey is hardly an agreeable perspective <e>", "<cs> i feel that we have kicked off to half a good start <e> <s> the noble earl has given us an assurance that he will consider it almost sounded favourably but at any rate consider half of what we have said <e> <s> i would beg him also to consider the standard of best endeavours and reasonably practicable <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning speaks with such experience on these matters because he knows how to put down any advocate who advances an argument on the basis of either of these phrases <e> <s> we ordinary mortals have to deal with these phrases in order to advance arguments to the courts and they do it is thought by some judges anyway make a difference <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will have a look at that as well <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this may be as far as this curious alliance goes but my noble friends and i have some feeling of joy in this amendment and it is necessary to say two things to explain why that is so <e> <s> this amendment touches upon a large number of other matters <e> <s> first we note the governments argument that although it might be said that the court would do this anyway and therefore the amendment could be unnecessary there is a doubt and so the government wish to make explicit what it is they want to be made clear and not rely on that argument no doubt to avoid unnecessary litigation <e> <s> we hope that the government will adopt that attitude in all the other cases where there is doubt and where there is reasonable doubt <e> <s> we hope that they will not say it is unnecessary but will agree to make things explicit <e>", "<cs> before the noble minister resumes his seat will he answer a specific question on this amendment <e> <s> it is part of the governments case that the union is always protected by the duty to do only that which is reasonably practicable <e> <s> the primary duty under clause which i apprehend will not change is to ensure entitlement to vote <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> my noble friends and i have given notice of our wish to oppose the motion that this clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> there is a difficulty about discussing this clause which both my noble friends and i have expressed <e> <s> i should be very happy to give way if the government would tell your lordships committee whether there is anything further about their intentions which can be said at the moment in order that your lordships committee can discuss the clause in the light of whatever the government may have to say <e> <s> if the noble earl wishes to do so now rather than later i shall be happy to give way and to speak then <e>", "<cs> we have heard what the government have to say and it is perhaps not surprising that my noble friends and i have heard nothing which has made us wish to support the motion that this clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> it is surely very odd for a legislative chamber to be asked to decide on whether a clause should stand part of the bill when part of the central core indeed the amendment to subsection is not a peripheral matter is in such a degree of doubt <e> <s> it is doubly odd that the government should put forward such a detailed and important amendment as amendment no <e> <s> referred to earlier by the noble earl in reply to my noble friend but in a somewhat erroneous context whereby one can have either postal or workforce ballots and to argue as the government argued in the other place when the minister of state spent many columns describing how he had been persuaded on very good grounds it seemed to us against postal ballots as the only way for democracy to operate in this area <e> <s> to have all that behind them and for the government still not to have made up an attitude to something which has been so resisted for eight months does seem very strange <e> <s> however we are very grateful to the noble earl for his statement and it is quite understandable that sometimes government cannot go further on a particular point <e>", "<cs> i have a much shorter question for the noble earl <e> <s> if that is the attitude then i can understand it but is it not also the case that the common law rules to which he lays claim as an analogy also require that the individual member before he pursues his action in the courts should exhaust his internal remedies under the union rules <e> <s> that has no analogy in the bill <e> <s> it is a principle that has been somewhat refined in recent cases but it is still there in the common law yet that finds no place in the bill either <e>", "<cs> my submission to your lordships is that what your lordships have heard <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble lord before he resumes his seat that the phrase procedural irregularity is indeed the subject of a considerable amount of interpretation <e> <s> it is a fairly well-known phrase and would be understood <e> <s> of course he is right that one side or another would argue that this is not a procedural iregularity <e> <s> but of course he cannot have it both ways <e> <s> as the bill stands and without this amendment one side or the other would argue that it is not appropriate for the court to make an order <e> <s> one side or the other will always make an argument at any rate if you brief them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord campbell invites me to debate a wide area <e> <s> may i reply with just two sentences <e> <s> first i did not quote the taff vale case <e> <s> i cited the osborne case but if one takes the taff vale case it was a discretional remedy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble minister <e> <s> i am quite happy that he is not a lawyer so long as he is happy that i am <e> <s> i understand the point that he has put in response indeed i anticipated it <e> <s> in a sense the government are saying that subsection covers the point already <e> <s> i hope that they are right <e> <s> i listened to the short and incisive intervention of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i would have been quite happy if that had come from the noble and learned lord sitting as master of the rolls <e> <s> but suppose we had the present master of the rolls would he say the same <e> <s> one does not know <e>", "<cs> on this question the marshalled list does not include a notice from my noble friends and myself concerning our not accepting this clause <e> <s> but so many things have happened to clauses and that we feel some point must be made on it because this part of the bill has perhaps become clearer in some ways because of its obscurities <e> <s> the importance of clause in regard to a number of matters is now beginning to be apparent by reason of what clause may turn out to be <e>", "<cs> the ministers answer has confirmed to me that my noble friend has raised a very important point <e> <s> the ministers answer was to be expected when it ran all the organisations are within the bill which are organisations within the definition of trade union under section of the trade union and labour relations act except federations which perhaps one might say include on <e>", "<cs> that is a somewhat extraordinary reply and i congratulate the noble earl on giving it <e> <s> of course it would make a difference <e> <s> but in order to illustrate the difference one would have to enter into a discussion on the part of the liability in clause which relates to interfering with the performance of a contract of employment <e> <s> it is perfectly possible for a situation to arise where the protection of the whole of section having been taken away liability for civil conspiracy is an alternative ground of liability and even a further ground of liability to any which is there in subsections and <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble earl has just committed i almost said the sin the fact of reading a passage from the middle of a judgment without explaining its context <e> <s> i should like to take just three points to reply to what has been said <e> <s> the noble lord lord orr-ewing gave the example of a go slow <e> <s> of course he is right in saying that if workers are going slower than they should under their contracts then that is a breach of contract <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> it is the need to cover these things with speed that sometimes makes one go too slowly <e> <s> going slow may be a breach of contract and often is <e> <s> for example as i always tell students it is very difficult to know whether that most sophisticated form of industrial action working without enthusiasm is a breach of a contract of employment <e> <s> it depends on how much enthusiasm one is contractually obliged to show <e>", "<cs> this is the amendment that might come to be known as the statute of labourers and combination acts together amendment <e> <s> it is the road down which the government head if they do not take careful note of the problems in respect of interference with employment as a liability <e> <s> why did the cbi come to the view at least according to the reports that i have seen in the newspapers <e> <s> it appeared to come to the view that it needed a new type of liability which as the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has just said is way outside the normal common law tradition <e> <s> it decided it because all these difficulties of breach of contract and immunities were too much for it it could not get at people who stopped work when it did not want them to stop work <e> <s> that is what it is all about <e>", "<cs> my noble friends and i have given notice that we oppose the question that this clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> in the light of our debates i ask what contribution this clause makes to industrial problems and to industrial disputes <e> <s> i think that it was the noble baroness lady seear who said in the course of a debate on an amendment that the whole notion of strike ballots is industrial nonsense <e> <s> that of course was the message of the donovan report <e> <s> the government seem to have very little to advance as an argument to oppose the general thrust of what has been a well-known argument about strike ballots before during and since the donovan commissions deliberations <e>", "<cs> with this amendment to their own bill brought forward nine months after its first introduction the government reach the high point of their dogma in their approach to these matters <e> <s> these are changes for dogmatic changes sake and this can be seen if one looks a little more closely than did the noble earl at the experience with the present law <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would he care to say whether he would join us in wishing that union members were protected against interference from whatever quarter when they came to vote <e>", "<cs> it is far too late at night to withdraw amendments <e> <s> the minister has told us that section already includes these words <e> <s> it does <e> <s> i said so myself <e> <s> the question is whether the new definition makes the words meaningless <e> <s> nothing that the minister has said has suggested to me that that is not so <e> <s> the government are adopting in this clause a humpty-dumpty control of words more so than they have done previously in the bill <e>", "<cs> in the confident belief that commitment will grow in the noble earl i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very happy that we have made such a good start <e> <s> i am sure that as he says the noble earl will look carefully at it and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble earl <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down i do not wish to question him about the two particular cases which he cited because he may well be right on the particular facts of those cases <e> <s> but i want to ask him this <e> <s> if the government knew all along that quite apart from updating which they have always said right from the beginning was the purpose of the exercise of this sort of clause there were all these anachronisms that required major changes why did not they put those anachronisms in the green paper in the one and a half pages that they devoted to this matter <e> <s> why did not they consult on the matter <e> <s> why did not they even in the subsequent typescript paper that put forward their positive proposals for legislation put forward these anachronisms <e> <s> why have they kept them back until they have put the bill through parliament when the trade unions no longer have a chance to consult upon them <e>", "<cs> not on anachronisms <e>", "<cs> it is necessary to say just three things in response to the noble lord lord gray <e> <s> first one really cannot have ones blood made to run cold in this matter by being told that there are severe criminal penalties in the companies act for hundreds of offences <e> <s> there is nothing in the companies act whatever about political funds or the like for companies <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> there is about disclosure that is common ground but nothing more <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mishcon has criticised my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby for giving unreal examples <e> <s> recently i happened in the real world to be with some people who for the most part were young <e> <s> one of them said can i borrow your video <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords having had from my noble friend lord mccarthy in the usual way the pure milk of moderation in his amendment my noble friend lord howie has produced if he does not mind my saying so also characteristically an amendment of pure milk and water moderation <e> <s> in many ways i and i am sure my noble friends are happy to support it although not perhaps on the ground that it would bring relief from the dogmatic tight bandage as the noble lord himself once called it of government regulation of the procedure of internal union affairs for election of the national executive committee only to small professional trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that it might have been better to put this question to him before he ranged widely over the bill and the labour party conference <e> <s> perhaps i may put it now <e> <s> he made a statement at least to the effect that it was different for companies with their limited liability immunity because they were regulated by law and trade unions immunity in trade disputes was the one that he cited for trade unions <e> <s> would he not accept that in respect of the massive immunity for limited liability there is no structure of regulation for one single type of election to the executive boards or committees or bodies of companies and nothing whatever like it <e>", "<cs> my lords i had understood and this puts us in considerable difficulty that it had been agreed that there would be a separate debate on amendment no <e> <s> and those amendments that go with it <e>", "<cs> my lords it has become somewhat customary for me to speak to an amendment after dinner to an excited and somewhat less than crowded house <e> <s> but i can assure your lordships that the reason why i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> and i am sure that the noble earl will not object if i refer also to amendments nos <e> <s> and since they patently go to the same substance of the matter is as my noble friend lord mccarthy explained that we are perhaps at one with the noble earl in thinking that these are what he called in our earlier debate major changes in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble earl will not mind if i ask him two questions because it may save time on third reading <e> <s> as a preliminary to them of course we are not concerned with whether the union obeys the law of the land <e> <s> good procedures are devised so that those who break the law by mistake or those who wish to enforce the law can have proper remedies throughout <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the union <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl would think this is a useful way forward <e> <s> i apprehend that we have presented to him i say this with no disrespect as i say these matters have been prepared with great rapidity some problems which could perhaps not be fully covered by the present clauses such as the position that my noble friend has just managed to put to the noble earl in spite of my most ill advised attempt to advise him in a different direction namely the position for example where the union faces a decision by the certification officer <e> <s> it is no good saying that he is not a high court judge because he is given powers to make a declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble earl to sleep on this with a turbulent mind <e> <s> the date was not put in for wedderburnian reasons <e> <s> with great respect it was put in for gowrie-an reasons <e> <s> if we had not put in a date and simply said that they are not on the list people would have said that they could take themselves off the list and that the south yorkshire area of the national union of mineworkers could get itself out of the bill <e> <s> we are trying to be severely practical <e> <s> what the noble earl has said must be considered by your lordships <e> <s> i am sure that another place will come back to it <e> <s> this is a new amendment remember it has to go to another place <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether the noble earl is sitting down or i am sitting down but i wonder whether i may address a questioning remark to him <e> <s> as i understood it at one point he said that one was a trade union only if one was on the list <e> <s> but i think that was my misunderstanding because he ended by saying that one was a trade union if one met the definition <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a question on amendment no <e> <s> if i may address it to the noble earl <e> <s> it was raised on the previous amendment which sets up the register by my noble friend lord houghton when he commented that it was the duty of every union to maintain the register in the way there set out <e> <s> one of the obligations of the union is to maintain a register with the proper address <e> <s> therefore the proper address definition becomes a matter of some importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not reassured <e> <s> i understand what the noble earl says <e> <s> of course he is right in saying that the government inserted an amendment to say that an inaccuracy in the counting should be disregarded if it is accidental <e> <s> that is as far as they went <e> <s> what is special about counting <e> <s> let us take the provision that every person entitled to vote in the ballot must be allowed to vote <e> <s> that is fundamental <e> <s> the government want that <e> <s> let us suppose that an honest mistake is made that somehow removes the opportunity <e> <s> the bill contains nothing at all which <e>", "<cs> my lords this is perhaps one of the most disappointing answers throughout the long course of disappointing answers in this bill <e> <s> if the noble earl thinks that the amendment as drafted would have the ludicrous effect of possibly making a union liable for the act of a third party then of course he can easily propose two or three extra words to stop it <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i had understood that amendments nos <e> <s> and were to be taken separately <e> <s> they involve a government concession which naturally we rejoice in <e> <s> the other amendments are amendments that we would wish to oppose <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under a misapprehension <e> <s> we had thought that amendments nos and were to be taken separately and i addressed my remarks to them <e> <s> my noble friend lord dean who is perhaps better at rejoicing than i am will deal with the happier amendments nos <e> <s> and although i am sorry to be deprived of an opportunity not least tonight to rejoice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl continues to be hard on this matter <e> <s> i would be suprised if jonathan swift would have approved of what one might call his defence by way of semantic gambit <e> <s> in a trade union bill companies have no place <e> <s> it is rather like saying that in an employment bill limitations on the right to strike have no place or that bodies should not be considered in relation to the title of the bill <e> <s> the title and scope of the bill are the governments choice <e> <s> and of course for eight months they forgot to put employers associations in the long title <e> <s> then they realised that it was also concerned with employers associations <e> <s> all these are semantic moves around a board <e> <s> i understand that the noble earl has to make them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words about this amendment <e> <s> i listened carefully to what the noble earl said <e> <s> it introduces a quite major factor <e> <s> he has not really explained at least to our satisfaction why clause should be included under this provision <e> <s> it seems to us that it might well be a matter to which we would want to advert on report stage in the context of part iii as a whole <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the noble earl to say a word about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the nature of the governments announcement is astonishing <e> <s> at this late stage the bill is now to impose upon trade unions not from but from the day the act is passed from day one a duty to compile a register that is to compile it not to begin work on compiling it <e> <s> if the noble earl had come along and said that then i could have understood it <e> <s> there will be a duty to have from day one and to maintain a register of hundreds of thousands of members including those on building sites and those listed on branch and regional registers <e> <s> all of this will become a duty on trade unions on day one <e> <s> why <e> <s> so that it will be possible to say with much greater ease that trade unions are breaking the law than it would have been had this amendment not been brought forward from the depths of the back-benches and gratefully accepted by the government <e> <s> in view of its link with amendment no <e> <s> we shall resist this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we should not take too long with this amendment but the noble earls reply requires that i say something about it <e> <s> of course the bill applies at the moment to all trade unions within the statutory definition <e> <s> in saying that the act as it will be might apply to all manner of branches up and down the land i apprehend that i disagree with what the noble earl said in one important respect namely that i think he said it is only a very small minority of branches <e> <s> since this is a very difficult matter of law i would prefer to couch our disagreement in terms of what might be within the definition of trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is a little difficult to know how to deal with the governments attitude to these matters <e> <s> i am very grateful for the support which has been given to this amendment by the noble baroness lady seear and the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord put the case higher than i put it <e> <s> i listened very carefully to him and i am rather distressed to consider his view which he expressed strongly that judicial review would not be open <e> <s> i can see the argument <e> <s> if judicial review is not open then the union is left totally without any right of appeal against a decision which <e>", "<cs> i shall finish the sentence <e> <s> it is a declaration which has legal effect <e> <s> the idea that declarations have no legal effect in the broad sense went out with professor zamirs book on declarations <e> <s> unhappily i do not have that book with me to cite the date but i believe that it came out in <e> <s> the idea that declarations are some vapid froth on the procedures of courts and tribunals went out a long time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have to put the matter to the noble earl in this way <e> <s> i respect his view but he is always saying to me that he is not a lawyer and therefore i must say to him that he must be badly advised <e> <s> this is a legal point <e> <s> he has said that the certification officer is not in a judicial position because he has no powers of enforcement <e> <s> being in a judicial position does not depend upon <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave perhaps i may address the noble earls last remarks and say what we want to do with this amendment because the government have had their opportunity <e> <s> my noble friend lord houghton surely put it to the government straight either put the certification officer back into the position of giving advice no doubt strong advice or if he is to have this power of judgment which is what a declaration is let there be the normal appeal <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> the noble earl having heard the noble and learned lord say that in his judgment there probably <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and i will be brief but it would not be right that this bill should go to another place without a proper debate <e> <s> i cannot avoid saying that during many of our debates in committee on report and on third reading my mind dwelt upon companies in our land not because of any political funds or donations and so on but for a very simple reason <e> <s> the city of london is in the middle of volcanic changes <e> <s> the gower report has made an unanswerable case for a statutory commission for investor protection <e> <s> scandals in the city and i say this deliberately because it is easily proved go on year after year <e> <s> that is proved by the department of trade inspectors reports in the library a list as long as your arm <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is also very important that this subsection is subject to the boards duty under subsection of the same section to make supplies of coal available in a way best calculated to further the public interest in all respects <e> <s> therefore this particular subsection on which the noble lord has asked his question is subject to an obligation to have regard to all public interests including a long-term energy policy and the social interests of the communities that depend upon pits <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do my best from these benches briefly to respond to a most important debate and not trespass on the time of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> first i join in the thanks offered to my noble friend lady lockwood for introducing this motion for short debate especially with her wide and profound experience of the problems <e> <s> indeed we have heard also from her successor in the chair at the equal opportunities commission the noble baroness lady platt <e>", "<cs> my lords since as the minister points out the section is concerned with companies recording information about employee involvement will the government consider asking them to state whether they recognise their employees independent trade unions <e> <s> if the government are not considering that what other steps do they intend to take in regard to companies that refuse to recognise trade unions in particular if they are in receipt of public contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has explained the nature of the order and much of the explanation we can accept <e> <s> but this is far more than a technical piece of fine tuning even if the government believe that it might help with unemployment <e> <s> the common ground between the two front benches is i believe less than the minister suggested <e> <s> the old bipartisan approach to the qualifying period for unfair dismissal was based upon the notion that you needed such a period in order that the tribunals should not be flooded with work <e> <s> it is there in the literature from to <e>", "<cs> my lords what about the unions <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way in order to show on the record that we are not at odds may i say that of course i was not objecting to attitudinal surveys of employers in order to see what they thought <e> <s> that was done in all three surveys and no one in his right mind would object to that and even if i had lost mine i could not do it <e> <s> it is ridiculous <e> <s> i object that the last survey is said to contain results which on inspection it does not contain and it was the other evidence such as that from the adam smith institute and so on which was not balanced by any kind of research in areas which might give a different attitude or indeed where trade unions or others were also asked for their views on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall explain it to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister finally sits down i was going to ask him whether we could clear up his misunderstanding of my speech but i shall let <e>", "<cs> i said number of jobs <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he has made a fundamental point <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has put forward the view that this should be pursued by negotiation <e> <s> this is very important <e> <s> if the noble lord found from the debates on this bill and elsewhere that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has i believe moved amendment no <e> <s> and it is to that amendment that i would ask noble lords to address themselves again <e> <s> the minister has already said that paragraph is a crucial paragraph if not the crucial paragraph to the new schedule which as the minister said is a complete redraft following what was said in committee <e> <s> indeed the noble baroness lady trumpington relied on paragraph when answering a point about the old paragraph as to why section should not be disapplied <e> <s> it is indeed paragraph that is the crux of the new draft <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have intentionally changed something that is the crux within that draft <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question of which i have given her majestys government private notice <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for his reply and while i understand as other noble lords will do the need to study the judgment more closely i have questions to ask of the minister in two areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house is grateful to the noble lord for his suggestion that the government will make proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble lord the minister for his explanation of his bill for his birthday present to your lordships and note from earlier parts of today that there may be more goodies to come <e> <s> however it is a pleasantly packaged and wrapped-up present <e> <s> but when one takes it apart a little it does not look like the wrappings which the noble lord the minister has described <e> <s> it must be clear that in so far as it aims at real equal treatment it is doubtful whether it would be dissented from in any part of the house and certainly not from these benches <e> <s> the question is the reality not merely the semantics of its presentation <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> i was going to join the noble baroness in saying that at that time we know on the unimpeachable authority of the noble earl lord stockton that the party opposite had given up the tradition of shaftesbury mr disraeli and sir winston churchill <e> <s> we did not know that it had taken on the early exuberance of the rather conservative mr gladstone <e> <s> they have backtracked <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would allow me to say that i am very grateful to hear that <e> <s> i was merely relying on his written answer to me last october <e>", "<cs> that is the answer that i expected <e> <s> i think that there are arguments for putting the phrase in in full but in view of the noble lords reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was confident that the air of agreement would not be broken so quickly and on that basis without giving guarantees about future offers i am happy to thank the noble lord for what he said and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the minister has referred to me i think it is necessary to stress and i agree with the noble baroness lady seear on the liberal benches how extraordinary was the answer that he gave to the amendment <e> <s> if the government want to be clearly quit of any suggestion that they are somehow prejudiced or look unkindly upon the central arbitration committee they must make a case first for abolishing the jurisdiction which it has and secondly for not extending that jurisdiction in the obviously sensible way not necessarily from any party point of view but from the point of view of industrial relations <e>", "<cs> there has been an interesting debate on our amendment <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend that i follow her nearly all the way <e> <s> on one point perhaps i should say that this amendment is not meant to deal with precisely the rights of existing employees <e> <s> it may be that some of those rights have fallen into the gap between this and other amendments but it was not the function of this amendment and the new clause to deal with them entirely although of course they may by a side wind be provided for <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mottistone feels that <e> <s> i hope that we can prove him wrong <e> <s> although the ministers earlier remarks were disappointing i found and i suspect from what she said that the noble baroness lady seear did so too that in the second part there was a <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> it began again rather disappointingly but pepped up a little as it went along <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for his statement that he will look at the arguments or at any rate the problem of young people <e> <s> i must repeat that i was not dealing with the question of repealing provisions about young people <e> <s> i was asking about the relationship of the conditions of young workers and women workers and indeed men workers if particular provisions of the legislation are repealed <e> <s> i am glad that we have got the minister on to that ground <e> <s> we look forward to his consideration of the matter following this discussion <e>", "<cs> in a sense the noble lord lord mottistone is discussing our amendments without the context of the new clauses which are now in the bill <e> <s> we are entitled to discuss them tonight at any rate against the background of those new clauses <e> <s> i tried to explain that i was going to move the amendments against that background for the specific purpose of seeing where the government stood on particular matters <e> <s> therefore in answer to the noble lord lord mottistone i shall not engage in argument about whether or not this would have been a modest repeal or an immodest repeal of the factories act provisions <e> <s> nor indeed do i intend to meet his argument that everyone should be allowed to work in exactly whatever conditions they like without any further conditions which was the kind of argument which justified the use of chimney-sweep boys <e> <s> historically there has been a good reason for protecting women workers in certain areas <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords for their comments and especially the noble lord lord mottistone for his paternal concern for the state of my amendment <e> <s> he feels that it is over-ambitious or has vaulted too much <e> <s> i thought the noble lord said clause subsection but i must have misheard him because there is no such subsection <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> now i follow him but i do not agree with him about that <e> <s> there would be a ballot and this answers what was said by the noble lord and by the minister of the workers concerned who would be subject to this procedure before an authorisation order could be granted to an employer <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for correcting my amendment it is defective in that it refers to an exemption order when it should be an authorisation order <e> <s> those workers concerned would be asked to ballot on whether or not the right under section would be taken away <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says no <e> <s> i understand <e> <s> the minister is entitled to his rest just like anyone under the factories act at the moment although their rights will be destroyed if the bill goes through and the minister has his way <e>", "<cs> would the minister in quoting the extract from the rees committee report not agree that if he read out the rest of the report we would find that the committee recommended that there should be legislation that the government in moving that legislation accepted that it was the basis of collective bargaining that such legislation remains the basis of collective bargaining and that before it is swept away and without deleterious effect perhaps another committee should look at the matter in the way that the rees committee did <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i can ask him a question <e> <s> i shall preface my remarks by saying that as the noble lord has said that he knows of cases of women wanting to do night work and so on i hope that he will make that sort of experience concrete and feed it into the discussions which must take place if the <e>", "<cs> this committee must press the minister and the government to think again on this matter <e> <s> the record will show by the time this clause is completed in committee an overwhelming case against merely the sweeping away of the act in regard to the baking industry <e> <s> i limit myself to two matters because the noble baronesses lady seear and lady lockwood and others have made the point <e> <s> but these are still not understood by the minister because of his latest intervention <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is what the noble baroness asked <e> <s> perhaps i did not hear her correctly <e> <s> i think that she asked whether <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly we express our pleasure at this amendment <e> <s> the government amendment brings this bill into line with the sex discrimination act more completely than the amendment that we moved at committee stage <e> <s> therefore we express our happiness with it <e> <s> this is a bill that has gone through many changes already <e> <s> your lordships have heard this afternoon that the portents are perhaps that the bill will go through many changes again <e> <s> in the hope that some of those can come this afternoon and that this is a hopeful sign of the governments willingness to think again about parts of the bill we welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the noble lord the secretary of states answer as disappointing as did the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i wish to make seven brief points about it <e> <s> first the european court of justice judgment did not with great respect regard the need to legislate on the equal treatment directive as merely presentational <e> <s> on the contrary if the secretary of state looks at the passage in the judgment at page of the industrial court reports for he will find that the court put the terms of the directive rather differently from the directive itself which of course that court is known sometimes to do <e> <s> it said that there is a need to ensure that the directive is completely effective and that requires that clauses in such agreements which are incompatible with the obligations imposed by the directives may be annulled amended or eliminated by appropriate means <e> <s> that can mean a number of different things <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have had an interesting debate on this bill and of course it is right that it should be the subject of our utmost endeavours to provide a full debate despite the unusual calendar if only because whoever is right about the effects of this bill we all agree that it is going to have an important effect upon the lives of millions and millions of working people <e> <s> so there could hardly be a more direct piece of legislation bearing upon those lives than that which changes the minimum they are allowed to be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords the contract of employment point is another one <e> <s> of course there is the problem of the contract to which i shall come in just a moment <e> <s> i was addressing myself to the legislation that is being repealed <e> <s> the first objection for the employer who employs a manual worker is that unless the workers make the necessary request under the act the truck acts will apply <e> <s> it was the need to adjust that position with which i was agreeing <e> <s> by forcing cashless pay on workers i refer to the position where the employer is in practice in control of the contract of employment <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester must surely know that the cases decided in the courts on redundancy and unfair dismissal give the employer the power without a dismissal for redundancy or unfair dismissal to adjust the contractual terms where he can do so by his power in negotiation without any fear of the employment protection laws <e> <s> the people we are thinking about in part i of the bill are mainly those in respect of whom negotiation at the bargaining table is not really a very serious protection either <e> <s> in other words we are taking away the legal protection of statutes from those who have the least protection at the bargaining table <e> <s> it was in that sense that i spoke of the employer forcing the matter forcing it into the contract if one puts it in a legal way <e>", "<cs> all right my lords <e> <s> then if so how <e> <s> let us know how the funds are to be used <e> <s> that would be very interesting <e> <s> if the secretary of state says yes and i take it that he said yes then let us in committee and on report know for what those funds are being used and whether that is a proper way of taxing for them <e> <s> i can see that some employers might perhaps feel that it was slightly out of phase with our usual constitutional arrangements <e> <s> surely the one justification that we cannot make is that which the secretary of state appeared to give that the rebate on redundancy payments is now inappropriate because it was there to help shed labour in the s <e> <s> there are plenty of redundancies around and one should have thought that it was there not merely to help shed labour but to help with redundancy pay arrangements <e> <s> i should have thought that some employers would find that a very strange statement <e>", "<cs> when we come to the amendment concerning clause <e>", "<cs> it is a novel experience for me to hear albeit from the noble and learned lord lord denning that i am not going far enough but i take his point <e> <s> after consultation my noble friends and i have come to certain conclusions <e> <s> i shall say just two or three things about the arguments against our amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne speaking for the government produced some astonishment <e> <s> every time there appears in this chamber any bill that has anything to do with the protection of workers we are told that it must be bad because it will stop recruitment into jobs <e> <s> there is no evidence of that in relation to matters which have come before us recently any more than there is that jobs will be promoted by the governments plan to charge workers for going to an industrial tribunal which is contained in their latest policy document <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> it is one that i followed in one respect namely that if the effect of the amendments was to reduce the protection of the worker we certainly should not wish to move it <e> <s> but in a phrase the objective and effect of the amendments i apologise to the committee and to the minister because amendments nos <e> <s> and on the new numbering are those we agreed should be considered as they involve the same thing would not be to remove written agreement from the bill <e> <s> written agreement is presumably contractual <e> <s> it is intending that the parties should be bound <e> <s> if i have a contract of employment and a document is put before me saying here is as a loan to buy your season ticket <e> <s> will you agree to that being deducted from your wages <e> <s> and i accept whether by signature or otherwise that is a point we are coming to then it is difficult to understand how that does not vary the relationship my consideration being my going on working on those terms and the employers being employing me on those varied terms <e> <s> that is a variation of the contract of employment <e> <s> i could imagine very bizarre documents that would not be but the noble lord the minister did not put any of those to us <e> <s> i am still mystified <e>", "<cs> sometimes i think it difficult to make these subsections rather more confused than they are but no doubt if we have achieved that it has not been a very good step to take <e> <s> the noble lord the ministers objection to the amendments seems to be that they change the provisions of the bill <e> <s> that of course is the objective of amendments to a bill <e> <s> let us take the two examples that he gave because they are important <e> <s> he said and i follow him a long way that the agreement must be signified in such a way that the employer knows about it <e> <s> so it can either be signified to the employer or to a third party and so long as the employer knows about it then that is good enough <e> <s> well if the employee does not inform the employer that he says would create a problem <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have that qualified assurance as perhaps i should call it from the noble lord the minister and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i do not press the amendment i shall certainly press the argument and it is a matter to which we may come back on report because with great respect a number of fallacious concepts seem to be floating about in the committee <e> <s> it is perhaps the hour of the day <e> <s> for example there is a distinction made between terms which are implied in a contract and terms which are incorporated into a contract by reference <e>", "<cs> one of the problems with these amendments and with the noble lords response is that many of them relate to apparently small points but they are real ones <e> <s> each one it is argued will either be all right in practice or will have no effect <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord the minister says <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am nearly encouraged to press it especially when the minister to whom i am grateful says that deductions can be made in the case of a go-slow because it will be a term and often an implied term of the contract that employers are allowed to do so <e> <s> as seen in the recent teachers case this may be difficult to interpret <e> <s> but the noble lord goes on to say that implied terms arc very difficult and that this explains why the government have excluded the area of strikes and industrial action from the scope of clause <e> <s> to exclude the problems of implied terms from clause and to leave the matter to common law where one finds implied terms that are very difficult to interpret seems a curious policy to follow <e> <s> the government wish of course the employer to be in the clear so far as this is possible in respect of fines for industrial action <e> <s> that is what they wanted that is what they have done <e> <s> it is that approach that these amendments were meant to challenge <e> <s> beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> in case he said something that we would want to take into account or there is a new point that we have missed i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have to admit that that was not my interpretation of the two subsections put together <e> <s> it was our interpretation that the gross amount in clause l <e>", "<cs> whether or not i pursue the amendment we are clear that the employer can pursue a demand for payment there and then <e> <s> after all what are the reasons given for not allowing the vulnerable worker a period of notice to pay this money <e> <s> it is argued that it is unnecessary <e> <s> that means that it is unnecessary for the workability of the bill <e> <s> it is argued that there is no control over the timing of <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i am getting up or sitting down but i take the ministers point <e> <s> i had of course noticed although i did not mention it that clause <e>", "<cs> now we have it <e> <s> our discussion as is usual after dinner is very fruitful <e> <s> now we have it that the employer a few days before perhaps we couched it wrong with seven will know the liability and will know roughly the sort of amount that the employee is going to be paid <e> <s> one can press this so far i agree in respect of the garage attendant the forecourt attendant the shop assistant and the stock room worker if in retail <e> <s> yes it may vary a little but we are not talking about vast sums when we finally discover that x has of overtime instead of none <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that <e> <s> i do not expect too much i am not quite sure whether i expect anything at all <e> <s> however the point has been made and i am sure that the least we can all do is look at the arguments <e> <s> i am hopeful that when the minister does that in the warm light of another evening he will be able to press the points a little further <e> <s> after all we are a long way from our demand for reasonableness which i know that he has rejected <e> <s> we asked for reasonableness we asked for no deductions where there was no dishonesty or wrong-doing <e> <s> we are now asking for a few days before the money is taken away <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to find it in his heart and more particularly in his head because it rests on the case that he made as much as the case that i made in that exchange to assist us <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> one advantage of debating a bill with the noble lord the minister is the delightful circularity of some of the arguments which are deployed against one and which here have been exemplified with respect again with one exception <e> <s> that is the exception that most employers do not want what is in the bill on consultation <e> <s> i am all in favour of consultation <e> <s> i believe devoutly in consultation but i do not necessarily think that one gives a clause merely to what the majority of employers want <e>", "<cs> of course there may be many different ways as the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> the worker may be able to take different steps in regard for example to sums due on inadequate notice <e> <s> when i said recover i meant to use the procedures of the particular matter which the bill is covering <e> <s> therefore what you are how shall i put it <e> <s> owed-recoverable by deduction in law is that which the bill allows <e> <s> therefore if you kept the per cent <e> <s> limit you would not be owed-recoverable by deduction <e> <s> the noble lord says you are still owed and indeed you may have other procedures <e> <s> you may <e>", "<cs> i take what the minister said <e> <s> i merely add this <e> <s> the very fact that one is saying that after the contract has ended where the employer takes proceedings in another court one requires that court normally to recover that amount by instalments would suggest to me that the one thread in the bill which is virtuous and just is that by and large it tries not to impose huge amounts of deductions payments and requirements in judgments for this kind of reduction upon the worker otherwise than by instalments <e> <s> here on the final instalment all those controls are gone <e> <s> i take on board what the minister says <e> <s> i am subsuming in my argument that the points that have gone by in clause and so on are there on the table but subject to that the employer has no limit in the way that he has on other pay days <e> <s> it seems to us wrong <e> <s> it is a pity perhaps that we cannot challenge this more directly <e> <s> it is very difficult to know how to do so <e> <s> it seems to us wrong and immoral and we shall go on saying so but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for his question <e> <s> in a sense to answer it fully would mean covering a lot of the ground that we have covered before and after dinner but of course the short reply is that sancitity of contract for someone who has no bargaining power means something rather different than sanctity of contract means for someone who has a lot of bargaining power <e> <s> the noble lord will know this very well because at the time he was involved with the unfair contract terms act of and i guess he would have supported it which was based on that very concept <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not and i should be very surprised if most of the other members of the committee did especially if we take account for example of the cases that have been cited in the committee today <e> <s> as it is after dinner we are perhaps getting a little too far away from the fact that many garage chains operate the most dreadful practices against young employees who come on an afternoons training to work in petrol stations <e> <s> there may not be so many cases but that is matched by examples given from all over the country of workers who suffer such deductions in shops and in other places including transport workers if they are unfortunate enough not to be properly protected by the tgwu <e>", "<cs> left with the mere words of the bill i would still be worried <e> <s> i have however the assurance of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i can therefore more happily beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply but of many unsatisfactory replies that is about the most unsatisfactory <e> <s> it does not come to grips with the problem <e> <s> tribunal proceedings may seem swift and simple to the noble lord the minister and maybe to myself if they get going and are finished within three months but three months is a long time in a low-pay household <e> <s> if the employer in retail employment has stopped a number of weeks wages completely and the employee is lucky enough somehow to be continuing in the employment or somehow is able to bring an action in the tribunal the suggestion is that there will not be any further consequential losses other than mere inconvenience <e> <s> inconvenience is rather a nice term i had not thought of it for being done out of your wages for having the lot stopped for shorts <e> <s> the family will have to borrow money and the interest is likely to be high <e> <s> they will have to pawn things <e> <s> they will have to get by <e> <s> that is not an inconvenience where someone has done this by reason of an unlawful stoppage is an outrage <e> <s> you should have the right to compensation for the loss you suffer <e>", "<cs> the noble lord and i will look with interest at <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at no point of our proceedings in committee have i begged leave to <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves that point may i ask this question <e> <s> if the two years is about the right balance and since we are dealing with so very many workers who work less than hours and who therefore would have to serve five years before they had the right to approach the tribunal does not the minister consider that on the basis of his own arguments some special provision should be made <e>", "<cs> i may have misheard but i think that the noble lord was suggesting that our second amendment no <e> <s> also replaced part of the existing paragraph <e>", "<cs> with great respect no <e> <s> i rarely have the confidence to say that the noble lord is wrong but i think that he is wrong <e> <s> the present paragraph <e>", "<cs> curiouser and curiouser <e> <s> may i make a point on the limited matter we are discussing so that the committee can catch up with us <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord and i know where we are <e> <s> the point that the noble lord made about labour-only supply is valid only if the person doing the work is under a contract of service and in a limited number of cases he is not to anyone <e> <s> that is not paragraph <e>", "<cs> which is never far from the noble lords mind as he says <e> <s> there is a driver of a concrete mixing lorry <e> <s> he looks as though he is an employee <e> <s> he is dressed in the firms livery and the lorry and the drum are painted with the firms colours <e> <s> he takes orders as to what he is to do and so on <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord the minister says <e> <s> the next time i meet someone coming back from the shop or the garage and he says i thought that i was going to be paid this week and they have only paid me i think that is a rotten deduction i shall say george that is just an error in computation it is not a deduction as the ordinary man would see it <e> <s> i shall then run very fast and get away as soon as i can <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said but i do not understand the differences between us to be as great as he thought <e> <s> it seemed to me that the only difference between us really was that i did not mention william iv and artificers <e> <s> we want contracts <e> <s> there is a difference in regard to what should be counted as a deduction and there is the other difference that we reach in the next amendment which perhaps should be dealt with then <e>", "<cs> or the night watchman <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and will confine myself merely to one remark which is meant to help him in his mature reflections and his search for other plums <e> <s> it is the case in the governments own consultative document that two-thirds of the wages councils workforce is part time and that four-fifths of the workers are women <e> <s> when one adds to those the other well-known facts concerning the situation of continuous employment the idea that such workers are well served while the rule is that they should have two years continuous employment before they can go near a tribunal will perhaps give the minister pause for thought <e> <s> i am grateful that he will look at this matter again and i look forward to the results of that scrutiny <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that in fact the noble lord has invited us all to come back to part iii on report <e> <s> in order to be helpful i put again the question that he did not answer how many workers are involved <e> <s> that is to say what sector of the workforce are we talking about if we talk of firms with a workforce of up to nine <e> <s> what are the other details <e> <s> it is no good merely saying that these are the firms most likely to need help as against those employing or unless we are told why <e> <s> i agree with the minister that any line drawn has an arbitrary element in a certain sense but this appears to have such a high arbitrary element that we are bound to come back to it at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we support this amendment as a final attempt to get the agreement of the government to recognise that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord graham for filling out the case with such justice that it is difficult to understand except for one reason why the government will not move a little on this matter <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord sainsbury <e> <s> i understand the reason <e> <s> it is due to the technical deficiency of the amendments <e> <s> the minister has persuaded me that they are technically deficient and that has so obscured your lordships discussion of the merits of the case that it is obviously a matter to which we must return on third reading with better-devised amendments which will not obscure the points at issue as these amendments unhappily have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord rochester for his support it is a little difficult to know what to say <e> <s> one has here a case where the government are giving an employer by law clear new powers to deprive a family of its sustenance <e> <s> on their own logic they have a choice the noble lord the minister has just said so i presume that the secretary of state also agrees <e> <s> they can allow the employer to go to the county court for his debt we know the nature of this debt the debt is what the company says it is under anthony barratts contract <e> <s> that would be one way round without stopping the wages <e> <s> that might be a very good idea <e> <s> that may be a consequence of our amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we wish to welcome this addition to the bill which we pressed upon the government in committee <e> <s> indeed the government have done even better than the amendment which we then moved <e> <s> when the government are in the wrong they have no stronger critics than those from these benches <e> <s> when the government see the light and repent however limited the repentance they have no warmer friends at least for that moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has moved this as a technical matter but in our submission the governments amendment raises a question of some importance <e> <s> it was our fault perhaps that we did not appreciate the importance of the old section of the act having become section through the amendments to the insolvency act <e> <s> in not so appreciating we perhaps failed at committee stage to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am encouraged to ask leave to withdraw this amendment because i have a nasty feeling that when the government realise the position they may want to add something to the bill <e> <s> i merely say to the minister that my information is from secondary sources that there are various county court decisions including one in the brentford county court in december of which confirm a view which is held not simply by some commentators but rather i believe by any writer who has ever written upon this act <e> <s> if i may quote from professor w rogers commentary of the original act he states that a contract of employment is one where the employee deals as a consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i must add a word or two <e> <s> the last sentence of the secretary of states reply i feel that he will want to reconsider because this is not an area where we leave matters to the parties to resolve <e> <s> we are setting down a rule about what would be an allowable deduction and what would not <e> <s> when the noble lord says that as the clause stands i think i have him right and he will correct me if not if no event occurs in respect of which the worker has contractual liability then of course there will be no deduction to his disadvantage <e> <s> that is self-evidently true <e> <s> the whole point of our amendment is to ask whether a liability under a contract cunningly devised which arose in respect of an amount that would be paid as the wage meant in effect that if the wage on all the other computations comes to the worker has a contractual liability in that event to repay or have a deduction of x number of pounds <e> <s> that seems to us a possible interpretation and if the noble lord is confident that the high court could not put that interpretation on his bill then he will keep his words <e> <s> for once we are trying to be helpful because for once the interests of the noble lord the secretary of state coincide with the interests of the workers <e> <s> on those occasions of course we are always willing to be helpful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment but i very much hope that over a strong black coffee further thought will be given to the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed in the secretary of state <e> <s> i shall explain why in a moment <e> <s> this is a very serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave may i say that i wish to withdraw any wrong description of the noble lords argument <e> <s> that is a case which no doubt we can debate on some other occasion <e> <s> there still remains the central thrust of our arguments which i am sure the noble lord will look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the secretary of states lengthy statement which included the first figures we have ever had on this matter <e> <s> i thank the noble lord very much for that even at this late stage of the bill would that he had given this information to us earlier <e> <s> there is a considerable number of figures there at which my noble friends and i will wish to look very carefully <e> <s> of course one knows when one is congratulated at least when one is in england on putting forward a complicated amendment full of ingenuity that it is going to be resisted because it is clever <e> <s> in scotland and wales one gets points for being clever but in england it is a very dangerous quality indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the minister for his explanation of the amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether he can possibly answer some queries and difficulties that we have <e> <s> little could be more important in the bill than the definition of retail employment and retail transactions <e> <s> unless one falls within that golden area one is as a worker vulnerable to such deductions as ones contract allows these are workers as we know from previous debates whose contract is largely in the hands of the employer to the full extent of per cent <e> <s> but if one is in retail one is allowed the limit of per cent <e> <s> unless it is ones final pay packet when again one can have all of it stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords one could reconsider these amendments <e> <s> they are much too mild especially after the speech of the minister <e> <s> the noble lord has restated the bill and he says for example that this must go on the record because really the government cannot get away with a misunderstanding of their own bill <e> <s> the noble lord says that in many cases the worker would have a right to go to the tribunal <e> <s> of course that is not so <e> <s> the noble lord says that the only case where that would not be so would be where the contract did not provide that the employer had to prove some kind of cash shortage or deficiency <e> <s> i do not know where the noble lord has been these past months and years but that is the ordinary case especially in retail <e> <s> in the ordinary case there may be some limitation but the need to prove the cash shortage or deficiency is just not the normal case so there is no question about going to the tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the secretary of state for his response although we are disappointed by it <e> <s> perhaps i may make two comments about his response <e> <s> i must make it clear that my noble friend lord mccarthy is wholly in accord with this amendment <e> <s> only an unfortunate circumstance prevents my noble friend being here to explain again how the apportionment factor can be anomalous and even unjust <e> <s> i am not sure that the secretary of state actually resisted that argument to the full <e> <s> of course i understand that where people are doing two sorts of jobs there will be a difficulty whatever line is drawn as the secretary of states noble friend lord trefgarne explained in setting the number of employees to reckon on for rebates for redundancy <e> <s> therefore on that matter we remain unconvinced <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation of this amendment but there are one or two questions i should like to put <e> <s> it is a difficult matter <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord trefgarne is on record on th june as saying he considered it to be complex <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester said that he thought that clause was one that he did not understand <e> <s> i certainly did not and i refrained from speaking <e> <s> my noble friend lord mccarthy found it difficult <e> <s> so there has been difficulty especially round the area of what my noble friend lord mccarthy called on one occasion the truck provision or the potential truck provision <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a much more difficult matter than the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i have tried as carefully as i could to note the points that he made <e> <s> there are not many that are new <e> <s> most of them fall within my compass <e> <s> he said about our amendment this seems to be the only point of substance and it is a new point because it is a new amendment that two additions to the wages councils would be made by the secretary of state on the proposal of or at the request of the wages council <e> <s> that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome these amendments <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister for explaining them so clearly <e> <s> they are of some complexity but it shows that complexity is <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish not to thank the noble lord for his kind words and to say that there have been moments when some of the complexities and difficulties of the bill have made us feel that we wish to join him in search of small ships wide ships fat ships and thin ships <e> <s> it has sometimes been a difficult bill <e> <s> however we cannot change our view that it is a bill which is for low wages and for the removal of protections from vulnerable workers <e> <s> the bill differs from much of the governments previous employment legislation <e> <s> it is a bill which is primarily about workers who are either not strongly organised in trade unions or whose collective bargaining machinery does not function in the way which protects them as well as many other sectors of the workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> as amended by amendment nos <e> <s> a to e <e> <s> we thank the secretary of state for taking us through amendment no <e> <s> from another <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to amendments nos <e> <s> a b c and d to which the house is now directing its attention i have to say to the noble lord the secretary of state that at the core of his argument which he has just addressed in reply is that element which is the tomb of all legislation in all courts namely that that which is not covered is unlikely <e> <s> anyone who looks at a set of law reports for a minute will know that the most unlikely things are the things that are litigated upon <e> <s> the canteen example was not my example it was the example of the noble lords colleagues in another place <e> <s> the governments own ministers advanced this example of their own good will to the opposition to let them see what would happen and they said yes this would happen <e> <s> it would not be covered by the bill <e> <s> the secretary of state agrees with that and says that it is unlikely <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state has with respect again made his speech against clause <e> <s> your lordships rejected that the last time it was before the house <e> <s> there does not seem to be any better reason for your lordships to accept the secretary of states reasoning now <e> <s> indeed with the greatest respect to the secretary of state i appreciate that he is in difficulties on this matter i found it somewhat extraordinary that he said nothing to the house or more widely to the public and perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords if the standing committee a proceedings include a reference to the european social charter i shall be delighted to defer to the secretary of state <e> <s> i found it in the slightly later proceedings of nd october <e> <s> that does not alter the fact that this house knew nothing about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the noble lord the secretary of state correctly <e> <s> did he say that in every case where a worker is employed to work certain hours and the employer comes along and says i want you to work different hours and the employer then insists and dismisses or constructively dismisses that that would give rise to a claim for unfair dismissal <e> <s> does he say that that includes situations of reorganisation of the work and the business and other areas on which there is a mass of case law to the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the only debate that this house will have upon the international obligations of the united kingdom government in respect of these matters and i venture to think it will look very strange to those who look at <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the governments new-found desire to tighten up company law considerations in the city will they now reconsider the relaxation of the measure introduced in on the long-standing prohibition of companies financing their own shares <e> <s> will they now reconsider their own relaxation of that central rule which is in the middle of many malpractices at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords before your lordships debate the matter further which will be very welcome will the minister place somewhere on the record or in his publications a precise indication of the few employers he mentioned who today suffer from closed shop problems <e> <s> will he give the particular trade unions and occasions in relation to the abuses which he stated have occurred and the particular experience of the legislation in detail to which he referred <e> <s> the noble lord has come up to the gate in naming names <e> <s> it is very easy to laugh and say that of course it exists but unless he gives names he <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support my noble friend in the amendment which he has moved <e> <s> the noble viscount referred to the important clauses of the bill which he spoke of as intended to give basic rights to workers on matters that were not within the normal scope of their terms and conditions of employment <e> <s> i hope that i have quoted him correctly <e> <s> he is therefore concerned with clauses and <e> <s> accepting that one might think that it was equally if not more important to ensure that similar rights are accorded to workers on matters within the normal scope of their terms and conditions of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords the mark of a good bill is that it never matters at what hour of the night we come to debate it <e> <s> in that context i feel that all your lordships will wish to thank my noble friend for bringing forward such an important matter which has indeed received remarkable support and which i apprehend the minister will not wish wholly to reject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i have two questions <e> <s> i did not want to interrupt the noble lord earlier as i thought it would be better to wait partly as i now see because i can welcome him to the opening of next term <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord place in the library the communication apart from that with the agent upon which his argument rests <e>", "<cs> we can thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> he would not be surprised if my noble friends and i said that we felt that we had never seen such an elegant proposal for clarification by way of amendments that are so obscure <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i agree very much with some of the points that he has just made <e> <s> the example that i gave involved a different question <e> <s> what sort of order would the court make when approached under these amendments in the case that he repeated <e> <s> would the court order the men to work the trade union to make them work or the trade union to make them think <e> <s> what sort of orders will be put forward <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i should like to clarify one point <e> <s> i understood him to say that a member would obtain an order as it is called in scotland and rather more sensibly so than an injunction if he showed an actual threatened inducement to breach his contract or an inducement to him to interfere with his contract <e> <s> i wonder whether i heard the minister correctly because when speaking to the last amendment his noble friend took a long time to tell the committee that it would no longer be necessary to prove such legal matters <e> <s> one would merely need to show industrial action in which he had been induced to take part <e> <s> will the minister help as regards that point <e> <s> is it not the case that remedies will flow from the old legalisms as they have been called or from the new language <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged and hope that we can reach agreement on some later points in the same way <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i hope i have managed to intervene before he does so is he aware that there are two reasons why i hope that he will join us in this amendment <e> <s> first coming at the end of new subsection a as it would it ties in with section of the act <e> <s> that act has clear and rigid rules about who can repudiate and when <e> <s> obviously those rules would apply <e> <s> secondly the amendment is clear about the time namely that repudiation has to take place by the time the application is made to the court <e> <s> i hope that in the light of those two points the noble lord will join us in asking his noble friend to treat this amendment seriously <e>", "<cs> i still think that there is an ambiguity but i am so pleased to be on common ground with the noble lord about being well-meaning that i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the degree of agreement between myself and the noble lord lord renton is becoming quite alarming <e> <s> the point that he makes is one i intended to make to the minister <e> <s> in fact our position is that we wish not to make what i am afraid are the many points on this part of the new draft because we are not sure that we have the sticking and pasting and the details quite right <e> <s> threfore we will come back on report <e> <s> on that basis and partly because there is one more major issue to come in amendment no to which we have an amendment we think that it would perhaps be the view of the committee that we concentrate now on what we think is clear to us and that we should come back to the issues in amendments nos <e> <s> and when we reach report stage <e>", "<cs> before we reach report i am sure the minister as i will will read the debate and derive a great deal from it <e> <s> first i say to the noble lord lord renton that i am happy with the style of the amendment but no doubt we could discuss that later <e> <s> i think that it works <e> <s> secondly surely my noble friend lord houghton gave a large number of good examples of the way the failure to define that is what it is amounts to everything that is inconvenient to the employer not necessarily things that are incovenient to the individual union member <e> <s> that is what is so important about the link between this clause and the new bill on employer-enforced ballots <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister <e> <s> i hope that when he reads <e>", "<cs> it would not be sensible or polite or even wise as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter says <e> <s> i should have had no hesitation about interrupting the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter but i did not wish to do so with the minister <e>", "<cs> i am a little taken aback because with the greatest respect to the noble lord i do not think he has addressed my amendment <e> <s> i am very happy that the minister should write to me with the specific laws of specific countries <e> <s> i hope that he will also send me and my noble friends at least an abstract of this reservoir of factual instances upon which he is relying <e> <s> if i may say so to have a few more presented when we come to the report stage will not be entirely satisfactory especially if they are presented in a similar fashion <e> <s> i happen to know about the case of mr c and would have a certain amount to add to what the noble lord said <e> <s> although i am not suggesting that he misrepresented it i think there are further features to it <e> <s> but if they are presented anonymously it makes things rather difficult <e>", "<cs> this has been for me at least a more important debate than i had expected <e> <s> not only has it revealed the governments opposition to the amendment which i expected in that it has revealed that they mean to have their full fill here the clause has got the unions and they know it <e> <s> it will be effective and it will make things difficult <e> <s> it will harass them <e> <s> they mean to have the lot <e> <s> i did not expect anything else <e>", "<cs> i know nothing of the kind <e> <s> with great respect privilege i know not for the union because it now stands with other defendants <e> <s> that is not the way i would put it in any case <e> <s> there are a few areas in primary disputes where the so-called immunity which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would i imagine call a privilege from the liability of common law still applies to the union or to any other person in the land who induces furthers or contemplates a trade dispute <e> <s> perhaps on some other occasion we can debate just what that area is <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord in view of the way in which he originally put the point i think that perhaps his view is not entirely coincidence in view of the current state of legislative play <e>", "<cs> the nature of the ministers reply has brought up my spirits from any point of flagging because it is really quite absurd <e> <s> however perhaps i may first say something in regard to the remarks made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i think that the noble lord appreciated that when i said that i was not entirely happy with the wording of the amendments my unhappiness was concerned with the point about the burden of proof <e> <s> i accept that there could be better drafting as he said <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i believe that apart from obtaining the leave of the committee this may be the only opportunity i have to put a question to him <e> <s> let us assume that i accept every single case that he advances of oppression by a union of a member <e> <s> how on earth does that justify the oppression of the branch chairman and his family by the member who may be a fraud and a liar and whom he is out to protect in his clause <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> curiouser and curiouser although i share the ground that the noble earl offered me <e> <s> i accept that there is no real analogy between the command structure of a company and the democratic association of a trade union <e> <s> that is why i would be surprised if the government had made an analogy here just as there would be no analogy between company law and trade union law if they enact this clause because the shareholder has no right in law to inspect the accounting records <e> <s> one might have thought that with the kind of manipulations which have gone on in the city in the last few years if the government were really concerned with malpractice they would have given the shareholder a right to look at the accounting records of companies back over the last six years <e> <s> however there is not a word not a whimper not a single syllable upon that <e> <s> why <e> <s> they are only interested in regulating trade unions <e>", "<cs> i can perhaps put it briefly <e> <s> in respect of the inspection of accounting records requiring bodies generally as the noble lord lord rochester said to have a rule of reasonable proportion in that area seems sensible <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord we are not concerned it is the committee that is concerned <e> <s> does he not feel that there is some lack of courtesy to the committee to say i have the evidence <e> <s> we will debate it but i shall not show it to you so that you can debate it with me <e> <s> i will only let it come out in small packages <e> <s> we are not concerned <e> <s> we want the committee and the world to see this great fund of evidence and then debate it <e> <s> that is all we ask <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may address one or two remarks to the minister and to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton referred to the fact that the legislation that one passes is normally measured to the gravity of the problem and the danger <e> <s> until we are able to swim freely in the reservoir of the ministers experience we do not know what that problem is <e>", "<cs> i shall reply first before giving way again which i shall willingly do <e> <s> i referred to the noble lord because he made an interjection from a sedentary position <e> <s> if he was amused i am pleased <e> <s> at least that is some profit to the evening <e>", "<cs> i think we should leave it at that <e>", "<cs> there is nothing <e>", "<cs> i did not wish to mislead the noble lord <e> <s> he asked whether there was anything in section of the act which referred to a duty on a branch to keep accounting records <e> <s> the answer is i think no but a few words should be added <e> <s> subsection make two provisions <e> <s> first a branch when it holds union property may satisfy the unions obligation by keeping the records there <e> <s> secondly as the noble lord will know a branch may be a separate trade union in itself <e> <s> it is a difficult point because sometimes they are separate trade unions in law although part of the national trade union <e> <s> if that is so then the duty falling upon them in that connection is to keep their own <e> <s> so there are two riders to the no but i do not think they affect the substance of the answer to the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> i am not sure where we are except that i appreciate the government are not going to accept our amendment <e> <s> however one gets used to that <e>", "<cs> the common ground between the noble lord and those of us on this side of the committee is even greater <e> <s> branch members should have access to their own branch records albeit i should prefer a framework which the law used to have within which the rules had to come and not this rigid notion <e> <s> nevertheless each union has different rules <e> <s> they provide broadly that members of the branch have a right to know what is going on <e> <s> as a rule if a branch secretary tried to conceal what was going on within that branch he would get short shrift <e> <s> they may also be genuinely interested in the accounting records of the union although like my noble friend lord mccarthy i would restrict that to the date of the last published accounts <e> <s> once the union has published its accounts for the year that is fair <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> there will be branches of some unions that have offices and so on but for the most part it is branch funds that matter <e> <s> that is the main point <e>", "<cs> on this group of amendments our position is one that the government often take except with regard to clause which may be necessary <e> <s> however since the whole issue under the wages act is a matter of contract in a very broad sense we cannot see why this amendment is necessary <e> <s> however as it has been moved we have no objection to it <e>", "<cs> the last part of the noble earls response fills me with a certain amount of puzzlement <e> <s> i thought that he was about to point to a part of the clause that i had overlooked and which allowed that <e> <s> perhaps he will do so at report so that when the reservoir opens we can look at the matter <e> <s> at the moment i cannot see it <e>", "<cs> i shall obviously refrain from reading the whole passage from the judgment of <e>", "<cs> i am naturally disappointed with the ministers answer not merely for its conclusion but because of its reasoning <e> <s> the first and main argument that he appeared to use was that we must exempt the special register bodies from the relevant parts of clause because the list is there <e> <s> i might call this the everest argument why do it <e> <s> because there is a special register <e> <s> i never know how to deal with the everest argument <e> <s> you either like it or you do not <e> <s> but there is a more important attachment to the everest argument which tries to tie us in to the ascent that is to say that governments of both parties have given undertakings to the special register body <e>", "<cs> with the committees leave perhaps i may comment upon that <e> <s> i feel sure that the minister did not mean that in some way i was abrogating vicariously the undertakings of the labour government <e> <s> that government gave no undertakings to special register bodies except that they could maintain their corporate status and there is no question about their maintaining that <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount sits down i accept and endorse the views he put <e> <s> many lawyers are interested in that phrase <e> <s> in our view his amendment is helpful <e> <s> it is something to which we shall clearly return on report because it is a difficult area <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble viscount would answer two slightly critical questions about his wording to clarify the point before we return to the issue on report <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he give us a little more <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may detain the committee a moment longer <e> <s> we are very grateful to the minister <e> <s> we may assume that this class has been ascertained by reference to the ages of particular people <e>", "<cs> disgraceful <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for being absent for the first short part of this debate <e> <s> i understand that i missed very little owing to the short speeches <e> <s> what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and other noble lords have said emboldens me to put a question before the committee <e> <s> it is being said that wherever persons are being proposed for election there should by law be a severe structure and that is my view of this clause of election addresses incidental to the process <e>", "<cs> and for companies <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> we need not dialectical abseiling but a few more intellectual gymnasts on the other side <e> <s> we have put a point and i repeat it to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it is no good telling us that we are only debating trade unions today <e> <s> if the noble lord were to give us a guarantee that a bill about companies would be introduced tomorrow his argument would stand up <e> <s> we have reached a point where the mystification about trade unions has become so pronounced that people do not know when they are victimising trade unions as opposed to any other kind of association <e>", "<cs> on another occasion and at some other hour <e> <s> i do not think that i would do so <e> <s> the minister made four points to me i make four back to him first he said that the certification officer has quasi judicial functions <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> he also has administrative functions <e> <s> for example he keeps the list of trade unions and he has many other administrative functions <e> <s> he is the repository of the annual accounts <e> <s> he publishes an annual report that is the major source of information about union affairs <e> <s> between those two it is not found that his quasi judicial functions are vitiated by his administrative functions and it is difficult to see why this task should bring about a greater conflict of interest <e>", "<cs> i thought we did understand ministers in another place <e> <s> i shall reply to the noble lord in this way <e> <s> i understand the minister in another place if the noble lord does not then i suggest that he looks at these quotations and the wording around them <e> <s> i am trying to cut down my quotations <e> <s> yes i am making my case on the basis that the governments speeches were more sensible than their bill and that what they said was in the bill <e>", "<cs> let me try and put it rather more clearly to the minister <e> <s> the argument for the amendment is that the clause as it stands is rather silly that it will fragment bargaining units that it will have all sorts of consequences which are quite clear in terms of industrial relations <e> <s> secondly therefore there should be wider exceptions than are in the clause as it stands <e> <s> that is until we get to the bargaining unit point which the government put in in another place <e> <s> i am not dealing with the bargaining unit as such i am dealing with all the other matters with which the government dealt separately from the bargaining unit in another place <e> <s> i am following their drift <e> <s> i am saying if a union says we want to ballot all the members employed by company x in our membership and its employment how sensible of the minister to say that that should escape the selective balloting principle <e> <s> i do not know how to put it to the minister more clearly than that <e> <s> it is sensible without reference to the bargaining unit <e>", "<cs> i think that my question still stands <e> <s> i am trying to save time <e> <s> will the minister respond to the question whether the formulae which he read out applied to all the members of a union employed by an employer i think he also said a group of employers but i am not sure without any reference to common factor <e> <s> putting common factor aside does he say that there is an exception as mr <e> <s> cope did to separate balloting separate majorities where all the members of the union are employed by the same employer <e> <s> if he says that please will he point to the place in the bill where that is set out <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry but that was my question to the minister <e> <s> he has just said again that the union does not have to hold separate ballots at different workplaces where it gives entitlement to vote to all of its members employed by the same employer and i hope that i am getting it right <e> <s> will he please tell me where that appears in the bill <e> <s> it is not in subsection b because that is about the common factor nor is it in subsection b a <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a final word about our amendments which i can see will not get very far <e> <s> first the day on which the noble lord lord trefgarne accepts one of my propositions let alone all of them i should if it were not bribery buy him a drink <e> <s> however it is a much more important matter than that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he will understand that i was consulting with my noble friends because we divide the work <e> <s> there are points which perhaps fall to be made rather differently in regard to the two amendments <e> <s> i am often in a minority and that is why i always understand problems about minorities <e> <s> my noble friends tell me that i am wrong in believing that the amendments go together <e> <s> they are not grouped together on the suggested groupings before the committee <e>", "<cs> i said in moving this amendment that although it was very small i suspected it led to matters that were larger <e> <s> the debate your lordships have had shows that to be true <e> <s> i find it quite extraordinary that an amendment that asks that the commissioner who is going to assist <e>", "<cs> finally at long last the minister and i have reached agreement on a small point <e> <s> i propose that none of these three amendments be moved <e>", "<cs> we on these benches should like to clarify one matter <e> <s> is it the case that the pleas put forward to the government spokesman by his noble friends for maintaining the position of parity which is the solution that we prefer even to our own amendment fall on deaf ears and that there is no prospect of the government rethinking the matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am glad that he confirmed much of what i said about race relations and sex discrimination <e> <s> i hope that i gave credit to the government for extending protection in but they did so only after two cases revealed a scandal <e> <s> the government acted because of the burgeoning protests about the number of trainees injured in training schemes in <e> <s> i tell the minister that it will be after other scandals in regard to other areas of employment protection rights that the government will have to move again and i do not understand why it is that they cannot move a little now <e>", "<cs> before the minister finally sits down perhaps i may raise one matter now that he has nearly but not quite reached the question of misconduct <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lords memory stretches to the years which was the first time in two decisions of those years that the social security commissioners decided that they were not bound by the decisions of industrial tribunals <e> <s> therefore this problem has been with us for only years or so and that is why the government ought to look at it <e> <s> he did not tell us whether he was going to look at it and perhaps he will do so <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down may i ask him whether he agrees i <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down his speech was most helpful <e>", "<cs> but does he not appreciate that what he said was exactly what young people object to <e> <s> they look at a place like this and say when their kids leave school sooner or later it is usually later they go off they have a choice they may not get the course they want but off they go to college and university whereas we are not merely told that we have yts with which some of our friends have not had good experience though others may have but we are told that we must take any course that is going <e> <s> does the noble lord not understand that that is exactly the attitude that is objected to <e> <s> i understand it may sometimes do good in the way which he describes but to have it enunciated as a principle is what working boys and girls men and women object to <e>", "<cs> i know you are not <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for what he said <e> <s> i was interested in the answer to the drafting problem <e> <s> it does not solve the problem to say that subsection is as it is because the act is as it is <e> <s> one might ask why the act is as it is <e> <s> subsection is different <e> <s> however we will no doubt have another look at that matter <e>", "<cs> no i shall not press the amendment but the noble lord said two things of great importance <e> <s> the first is splendid and admirable that the government are giving serious consideration to bringing in interest on tribunal compensation awards as i understood it <e> <s> i hope that that serious consideration can be given before this bill is enacted <e> <s> it seems to me that if there is this serious consideration then there is no reason why it should not be done and any loose ends could be tied up if they need tying up <e>", "<cs> disgraceful <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that we appreciate his explanation <e> <s> however will he address himself rather more to paragraph b <e> <s> i appreciate that he has said something about paragraph a <e> <s> albeit that he says that thousands of people may fall within a i do not know about that but it may be so is it not the case within b that the paragraph is <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i am always delighted to have correspondence with him but he says that we have approached this matter on a previous sitting and therefore he must know all about it because he was ready to debate it then <e> <s> we were not <e> <s> we have waited until now to debate the issue fully <e> <s> therefore with great respect to the minister it is not good enough when one asks a central question to be told by him that he will write to us <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for tilling out so clearly what i call the governments inept view that life is as simple as its categories <e> <s> my noble friend lord dean has justified that again and again and the noble earl has not replied <e> <s> the noble earl asked whether our amendment meant to take back the law to what it was previously <e> <s> of course not because we are not trying to amend out of existence the new subsection a <e> <s> perhaps i may put the point again and then make one other point which comes from the noble earls most fruitful response to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i thought that i was delighted by the first few sentences of the noble earls response <e> <s> i thought that he gave some kind of assurance about the minister and the government <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i appreciate that we have an even more extraordinary position than i described namely that we have ineffective inducements effective for clause ineffective inducements effective for section <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation of some of our difficulties <e> <s> however we conclude that they make the need to press this amendment even stronger <e> <s> i welcome the support of the noble lord lord rochester with regard to the difficulties that he mentioned on the shop floor <e> <s> that is where this problem will emerge <e> <s> the governments notion of the shop floor is that it is composed of neat simple boxes <e> <s> one changes the shape of the box occasionally without defining it too well <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will reach the correct reference more quickly that i can <e> <s> i believe that the government are amending the relevant sections in schedule on pages and of the bill <e> <s> i believe that the point arises at page line but the minister will correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> the noble lord will see paragraphs a and b <e> <s> our amendment will become paragraph c <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his remarks <e> <s> i do not believe that those remarks make us any more hopeful that this structure will work very well <e> <s> perhaps i may make two points <e> <s> first of course his answer takes for <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord but as he invites me the noble lord will find the statement in the same schedule which we referred to before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> would we be right in concluding from what he has just said that the proposed new subsection ab would be unnecessary on the grounds that he gave and that the clause does not affect accounting records that fall outside section of the act <e> <s> of course records outside section of the act include the records of branch property branch transactions branch assets and branch liabilities which figured greatly in our discussions in committee <e> <s> it seems that the minister has just confirmed that those things fall outside the terms of that section <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is the right of any noble lord who is of the opinion that a bill has become hybrid by reason of amendments to be able to move a motion at any stage of the bill that the bill be referred to the examiners <e> <s> i wish to move that motion now on grounds that i shall set out as quickly as i can <e> <s> however this being a somewhat serious matter i apprehend that i should do so carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never wrecked anything in my life although i would dearly wreck this bill if i could <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord he is a little less than fair <e> <s> we made it quite clear why we had not moved a motion on hybridity <e> <s> we wished to give him the maximum chance not only to accept our amendments but to give an explanation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter sometimes finds difficulty in considering that it is possible for this side of the chamber to make a genuine point <e> <s> we raised the matter of hybridity in committee <e> <s> we have been quite clear about it <e> <s> my noble friend lord mccarthy raised it in his speech this evening <e> <s> we believe there is a <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord also to read <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord refers to page of the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord may be right <e> <s> i blame no one but i inquired as to whether i should give written notice of the motion <e> <s> i understand the answer to be not at report stage as regards an amendment <e> <s> if that is wrong i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to press the amendment but i am going to press the government to think again on one point <e> <s> i accept that the formulation in paragraph c about vicarious liability does not shall we say hit the target <e> <s> the need is to keep the union the printers and other persons concerned with the address out of liability <e> <s> that is agreed <e> <s> it is agreed also that the candidate himself must be liable for such liability as arises from the address be it defamation or whatever it is <e> <s> surely the government must think again on this practical point which is important to thousands of ordinary trade unionists who will be standing for office <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down now that he has clarified the situation perhaps i may ask him two questions <e> <s> is it not the case that the argument which is deployed against this amendment is precisely the same argument as was deployed against a different amendment in another place and in committee in this place <e> <s> is it not misjudged in respect of this amendment which is different from the ones ich preceded it <e> <s> is it not the case that this amendment by entering the words on the marshalled list at the end of sub-paragraph ii in subsection bbii would give the union the option whether to couch the balloting constituency either in the one employer unit or in the employer plus his associated company or associated companies <e> <s> what it does in this formulation as opposed to the formulation which it took in previous amendments where the government <e>", "<cs> yes it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is a great pity that the government will not think a little more about this question <e> <s> it is argued that to get rid of the new provisions in clause which amend section of the act for the purposes of clause ballots if i may call them that would deprive the member of the advantage of having separate ballots and separate majorities in separate workplaces <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches we support the amendment and appreciate that the noble lord is putting it forward at this difficult time in the industry <e> <s> i am sure that it is not put forward simply as an employers amendment <e> <s> it is in nobodys interest to have the matter as obscure as it is in the bill at the moment <e> <s> either the ship is a place of work as a definition or it is left as a no-mans land and the courts will not decide that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl permit me to intervene <e> <s> perhaps i was inattentive but did he say that a union member as a worker in an industrial tribunal against his employer could obtain legal aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the minister has more sympathy than his brief allows him because the unfairness is now patent <e> <s> there is no legal aid for the worker who goes to the industrial tribunal to enforce his trade union rights against his employer <e> <s> the legal advice scheme produces almost nothing <e> <s> i am glad if the government suggest encouraging workers to join unions and so protect themselves with support before industrial tribunals <e> <s> that is a very good reason <e> <s> however the worker may not be a member of a union <e> <s> in any case in none of those situations is he going to get the great support forthcoming from the commissioner <e> <s> the commissioner is going to pay out a great deal of money <e> <s> where does the worker who has been wronged in his trade union rights get any parallel process or redress <e> <s> it is a biased clause <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the minister for this amendment which we think is helpful <e> <s> we have one question <e> <s> it arose in debates in another place in respect of which mr nicholls agreed to take the matter up <e>", "<cs> my lords we can understand that the amendment is in line with the provisions of clause and indeed the structure of the clauses concerning the commissioner <e> <s> does the amendment not disclose once again how unfair it is that the commissioner can support with this indemnification <e> <s> is it really right that he should not be able to support the applicant in respect of an action on his trade union rights against other persons <e> <s> i do not expect the minister to give any assurance on this <e> <s> as i have said we understand the amendment and we do not oppose it <e> <s> i take this opportunity to ask the minister to ponder on the issue in respect of which the government will be seen to be biased <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue of extending the commissioners role to assist a worker to defend his trade union rights not only against the union but against the employer does not arise on this amendment but it is highlighted because of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we take an attitude on this type of amendment which i think we explained in committee <e> <s> the certification officer fulfils a number of useful roles not merely with regard to the running of trade union affairs but in the running of the industrial relations system <e> <s> it is wrong to attempt to make the certification officer into some kind of law enforcement officer as well as fulfilling his other functions which are already a mixed bag <e> <s> he has administrative functions and quasi-judicial functions <e> <s> despite all the problems of the legislation of the past few years he has retained a remarkable degree of confidence and maintained a smooth relationship with the trade union movement and with individual members <e>", "<cs> my lords we have touched on the headings of a lengthy debate <e> <s> i have decided not to go into the detail to try to persuade the minister to come for a drink sometime when over <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the cast that it is national law that in the vast majority of cases including this determines the meaning of worker or employee albeit that national law cannot change the obligations of the directive <e> <s> there are many instances of that and is not the minister putting a case which is misguided in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> the noble lord has answered a case different from the case made to him <e> <s> of course we accept the definition in clause <e> <s> that is water under the bridge after todays debates <e> <s> that part of his reply was unnecessary <e> <s> my case was that we needed a definition in respect of the act as amended <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a final sentence or two <e> <s> it is a grave defect in the procedure of a legislature that the minister whose job it is to reply it is not the ministers fault i well understand that and whose job it is to explain to people what these things mean has a very difficult and complex brief <e> <s> it is a very difficult and complex matter i want everyone to understand where we are <e> <s> the fact that it is late at night is a great pity <e> <s> the amendment could not come at any other point than here <e> <s> i hope that the minister will find some way other than by private correspondence to publish the more complex technical brief <e> <s> this would be so that we could understand why the government are standing on this point <e> <s> quite frankly i genuinely do not understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like most of your lordships i shall confine myself to one aspect of the bill or rather of the bills because this is a measure which surely contains two or three separate bills which should indeed have been introduced as separate measures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has interrupted me and i have to reply to him <e> <s> the government are about to legislate on one of the most important subjects in this country <e> <s> is the noble lord coming in here at midnight to tell me that points cannot be made at second reading <e> <s> if the government had had the sense to deal with the matter in a separate bill we could have discussed it at a civilised hour <e> <s> i shall give way to him if he wants to make that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not regard this as a game <e> <s> the noble lord has made his point but i should like to make mine in my own way <e> <s> the government have spoken of grievance procedures as a possible protection <e> <s> i agree <e> <s> but surely grievance procedures this point has never <e>", "<cs> my lords in summing up what i have to say it would have been much shorter had it not been interrupted i say that if that is not done it will be a responsibility of this house if we see grave damage to the universities in perhaps the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords although i believe that amendment no <e> <s> is better than amendment no <e> <s> i should not dream of moving it in view of the extraordinary circumstances of having secured two concessions from the government on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with that argument but i think it would be wrong for me to press the amendment or even to speak to it further on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i were very surprised to see the amendment on the marshalled list for this third reading <e> <s> in our view there are three areas which make this a most serious matter <e> <s> the first and perhaps the most formal and i was a little surprised that the minister did not refer to this matter is that although this matter was mentioned by the noble lord lord mottistone on th march and i have re-read what he said that was the only occasion upon which any indication at all was given that this would require attention by the government <e> <s> the matter was raised by us in a slightly different though very similar form on th march in an amendment the effect of which was to require that neither the section in discussion nor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord again says no <e> <s> i shall have to tell him why it is so <e> <s> he might consider for a moment whether he would not feel more comfortable were he to say all right we shall have ballots and these will be the ballot papers and we say that this is what you do <e> <s> after all surely that is the real situation <e> <s> the noble lord is trying to bring the union ballot paper under government control <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i am sorry not to have explained the matter to him <e> <s> i know that he has been most attentive to all the debates on the bill in your lordships house <e> <s> does he recall the discussion of these amendments on th march when the government gave the assurance that they would introduce no such provision <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me to intervene this is a most important matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter raises the issue from a different viewpoint from mine <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to a statement that would be permissible <e> <s> such reference adds the right flavour that of freedom of expression <e> <s> is not parliament entitled to know very clearly the governments intention in relation to this matter <e> <s> there is plainly a doubt about what on the voting paper means <e> <s> i would choose the interpretation of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i should want the provision restricted to on the face of the voting paper <e> <s> are the government considering bringing in a definition of on the voting paper in another place so that the provision can be properly defined <e>", "<cs> my lords i can join with the noble lord the minister over one matter that is in thanking noble lords who have spoken on the bill in thanking my noble friends and indeed on their behalf in thanking the noble lord the minister himself as well as the noble earl lord dundee <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> did i hear the noble and learned lord say that the employing institutions would have to prove reasonableness under the employment protection consolidation act <e> <s> since one would have thought that the burden was on neither side when one reached that second point <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend who is still being asked questions not agree that the tenure that was granted would be a tenure with the university being statutorily enabled to dismiss for redundancy whenever it liked <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make this brief point <e> <s> there are already two known cases of distinguished academics who have have been offered chairs in this country and have refused to come because of the implications of this bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord responds perhaps i may ask him something which is in the nature of a supplementary question <e> <s> this deals with the substantive ground for dismissal <e> <s> as this provision and the whole of the rest of this part of the bill is not geared into the employment protection consolidation act in which forum of the many fora in which employment dismissal questions can arise does he think that this protection for the employee could be adduced <e> <s> in what way would it intermesh with employment law as a whole <e> <s> at the moment it stands like the rest of this part of the bill as an island in itself <e>", "<cs> i am trying to make progress because it may cut out discussing points later on <e> <s> the question is not about the internal procedures <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord said the internal procedures may be used and then if the member of staff remains dismissed he may wish to go elsewhere <e> <s> i want to engage the noble and learned lord on the footing that we are both so to speak advising this client outside of this chamber of course <e> <s> what do we say to him <e> <s> we say to him that he should proceed with his action if there is a good point to argue <e>", "<cs> does the noble and learned lord feel that amendment no <e> <s> zaa might well be taken away <e> <s> he could come back with the amendments which he promised in view of the statement today by the committee of vice-chancellors and principals that the amendment has caused them some concern <e> <s> it has come as a complete surprise to them and appears to be designed to downgrade and reprimand people without sacking them under the procedure <e> <s> universities have not asked for this <e> <s> does the noble and learned lord consider it better that we should look at it in its full context and after the committee of vice-chancellors has been consulted <e>", "<cs> we are trying hard to follow the noble and learned lord <e> <s> perhaps my <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may tell him first that he must not chide us for speaking of academics going to tribunals which is what ministers in the other place have been saying is often enough the end product of this <e> <s> we now understand that this would not normally be foreseen as the end product <e> <s> the normal remedy that the academic would pursue in the test case which is of course the case where all the procedures do not work properly is that he should go for judicial review in other words to use the words of the late lord diplock to show that the university acted irrationally in that sense of unreasonableness <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord kindly said that he would look at this again <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him to put on his agenda a simple point based on the example of my noble friend lord mccarthy <e> <s> i think that on the explanation that he gave the committee this is rather important for a large number of people it would mean loss of tenure <e> <s> i take the case of a lecturer who is on the top of the scale at the figure of my noble friend <e> <s> then there is a per cent <e> <s> pay increase and he gets more <e> <s> from what i understood the noble and learned lord to say that means loss of tenure even on his interpretation <e> <s> so perhaps the noble and learned lord could put that on his agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord makes a point that one can understand <e> <s> however if there is so little difference in the meaning and since everyone who has knowledge of university affairs suggests that this would be a way to make a new start and to heal the breach would it not be wise to consider accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will allow the amendment to be moved before he addresses himself to it <e> <s> i know that his intentions are good but i shall value his support afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor at any rate for some of what he said <e> <s> i shall not try to compete with him in terms of precision <e>", "<cs> my lords my question to the noble and learned lord concerns amendment no <e> <s> aza which is one of a pair which is somewhat unusual in so to speak industrial terms <e> <s> it has been put to me by a number of people that the drafting goes wider than the phrase which i believe the noble and learned lord used in his explanation <e> <s> he said something like this deals with discipline short of dismissal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his response to the amendments <e> <s> i especially appreciated the point with which he ended namely that the spirit of these three amendments with two points is already in the bill <e> <s> the problem is that i must suggest that it might be worth spelling it out <e> <s> the reason i say that is that these are words in another act manifestly borrowed where the burden of proof and the substance would not be entirely the same as that which the noble and learned lord suggested would be the spirit of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble and learned lord says and i thank him for it <e> <s> however with great respect although there is additional protection in the bill there is also an additional vulnerability <e> <s> that would have been a wide vulnerability when we had the eight words in but now that the eight words are not there it is scarcely of any importance except that there is a requirement that in any case where an employer can dismiss for redundancy the consultation obligation should apply <e> <s> that is in the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome these amendments which quite overtake the amendments that my noble friends had put on the marshalled list <e> <s> in particular i welcome the new subsection a which deals with the new pay rise which has caused so much concern <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that there are many studies known of course to the minister which support the remarks of the right reverend prelate about the inefficient use of labour and as the views of many employers have also been cited will the minister see to it that studies which support the view of the consultative papers already published and of the government at any rate prospectively are themselves published <e> <s> so far the government have published no evidence for the view they seem to take and which the minister has put forward <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord will believe me when i say that it was my intention to offer the same felicitations <e> <s> however i felt that i ought not to do so before he had spoken in case anything happened <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has been kind enough to deal with my example and to give two of his own <e> <s> both he and i appear to be suggesting that these two clauses could keep us here for a very long time partly because they are interlinked <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was correct to say that they are interlinked <e> <s> the reason why i refrained from going into detail on section a was because i have points to make in relation to that section later <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the words of the noble and learned lord but i am not very happy with them <e> <s> in fact i am rather alarmed that the government are again looking at section a because the longer we go on the more the argument always turns upon enforcing a transaction in favour of the third party <e> <s> we shall deal with that matter when we come to section a <e> <s> with great respect to the noble and learned lord he does not need section to put into effect the first directive <e> <s> i believe that there are defects in section a <e> <s> that is another matter <e> <s> i believe that those defects make it less likely that we shall be brought into conformity with the first directive than would have been the case with the old section <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i mentioned the words of the noble lord lord strathclyde at col <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> in response i should like to raise two issues <e> <s> this amendment takes one a little further down a road that may be described simply as follows the government wish to uphold transactions with third parties even though they are outside the objects of the company <e> <s> they must do that because of article of the first directive so long as the acts are done by the organs <e> <s> we shall come to that point in a moment <e> <s> that is what section a states <e> <s> anything outside the constitution of the company in terms of the powers of those who are to be designated as the organs can be en forced by the third party if he acts in good faith <e> <s> that is enough subject to the other sub-clauses to satisfy the first directive <e>", "<cs> i must admit that i have sat here in a state of increasing terror because of what we are prising open <e> <s> with no disrespect to the noble and learned lord i believe that this is the first time that the government have committed themselves to this in public <e> <s> i have riot been party to any consultations <e> <s> we see that where directors act i would not say outside their authority in the case we have outside the powers or objectives of the company which is the highest or the lowest breach that directors can commit that is to remain internally within the company and is still something for which they are liable to the company but the shareholder may bring a derivative action <e> <s> i shall not argue with the noble and learned lord about exactly when that could be done but in some situations plainly it can be done <e> <s> but that which is internal as we have seen on every previous amendment can become external <e> <s> i had thought that when the externality was a third party who had sufficient knowledge i agree with the noble and learned lord and am not defending very word in those long <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> clearly there will never be a gulf between us but merely a division <e> <s> i am grateful for those words because they help to clarify this <e> <s> i must ask leave to withdraw this amendment but in doing so i ask him to consider subsection very carefully in the light of what he has said and the emergent policy of the government and the department upon this matter and to ask themselves whether a court necessarily would decide what he has said it should decide in subsection <e> <s> that is what the legislation is all about <e> <s> it is not a matter of guessing <e> <s> i do not believe that that is so <e> <s> the court could hold many interpretations of subsection <e> <s> i hope that they will be encouraged to take the wide interpretation on constructive trust <e> <s> even now the government do not seem very keen on that but i hope they will reconsider <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is necessary to respond briefly to what the noble and learned lord kindly said <e> <s> he said that third parties must be able to trust appearances <e> <s> curiously enough that is precisely what was said in the <e>", "<cs> i see that dinner has not improved matters <e> <s> first we are not arguing that third parties should look inside a companys <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether to be afraid or pleased at that <e> <s> however i really cannot accept what the noble and learned lord says <e> <s> the government should look at this matter again <e> <s> it is rather amusing that when the commission has told us twice that we are in breach of article there is not a peep from the government as regards doing anything about that <e> <s> however on this occasion when they rely upon some unspecified dicta in the cases i say that with great respect and say we are in breach for the governments own reasons they insert a paragraph <e>", "<cs> the point that has just been made is also my understanding of the submission of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i take the point of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran very strongly <e> <s> presumably therefore the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and the government would not mind reproducing instead of new section ab article <e> <s> so if i moved an amendment in the words of article the noble and learned lord would accept it <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to get the government off the hook or out of the consequences of what in view of the remark of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran they have done in having bought a bit of a pig in a hocus-pocus <e> <s> i believe that is what they have done here <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran may have understood the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am not sure that i did <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate appears to have been attacking either article of the french code on companies or some other provision <e> <s> he did not talk about our amendment <e> <s> our amendment does not say that anyone shall automatically be said to be acting in good faith <e> <s> leaving aside what we have just debated which we hope that the government will look at again because that would make this the substantive part of the paragraph our amendment says that the third party <e>", "<cs> the noble lord presses me to full citations <e> <s> i have to do them from memory <e> <s> in there was a judgment by mr justice megarry in a case which i believe is called <e>", "<cs> yes i wrote the article <e> <s> there is very little literature on the subject because it does not seem to come up very often <e> <s> the noble and learned lord raised it tonight so it is not my fault <e>", "<cs> i see that point as far as it goes <e> <s> it is interesting that the noble and learned lords response again brings out and in this case i do not think that i would argue against it how insistent the government are about preserving the rights of the third party because we are here dealing with the sub-agent <e> <s> the distinction that they draw between external and internal effects of <e>", "<cs> what can i say except that i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he is very kind <e> <s> however i would rather win occasionally as well <e> <s> as this is the last of this series of amendments perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will allow me to make a few remarks before with drawing the amendment as i obviously have to do <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i should like to ask whether his argument is not an odd one <e> <s> we shall come to the new section b later in the marshalled list but it is relevant now <e> <s> the legislation will change the law because notwithstanding what has been agreed in the articles the rule of such resolutions as that in new section a being allowable without previous notice will be a rule of law <e> <s> it stands notwithstanding any provision in the articles of association and therefore there will be a serious and important change in the law <e> <s> perhaps the minister can give a good reason for that other than that it is deregulatory <e>", "<cs> before the minister responds may i put forward an example <e> <s> i know that the government have given enormous thought to this clause so they have perhaps thought of this example <e> <s> take the case of shareholder no <e> <s> who signs version a on monday and then the case of shareholder no <e> <s> on whose behalf perhaps we must remember version b is signed on tuesday <e> <s> if shareholder no does not like the look of his version can he withdraw his signature from the first version in favour of the second <e> <s> what procedures are there in respect of the differences that are put to shareholders <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i find this a strange clause <e> <s> i find it even more strange having heard the ministers explanation <e> <s> in trying to get rid of this subsection in his customary way my noble friend is on the side of freedom <e> <s> on the other hand the governments so-called deregulation becomes yet another nanny state provision <e> <s> there is a perfectly clear way of meeting every point that the minister has put forward <e> <s> if the company wishes it can change through a vote comprising three-quarters of its shareholders the articles in order to adopt this way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is relying on a parallel with section of the companies act <e> <s> is it not a fact that the phraseology of matters which concern the auditors as auditors comes at the end of the first subsection so that there are two parts <e> <s> the first part relates to the fact that they shall receive all notices and communications relating to a general meeting <e> <s> if they have the notice then under the second part they can go to the meeting and concern themselves with matters which concern them as auditors <e> <s> now that they do not receive notices the position is quite different <e> <s> therefore in relation to section my noble friends amendment has renewed force because the first part is not included in the new regime <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words in defence of this clause <e> <s> i thank my noble friends and other members of the committee who have supported it <e> <s> i first take a small point <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says thank goodness for that <e> <s> there are four or five places where the consultative document does not even understand what the regulations are about does not understand their origin and wholly misstates their purpose <e> <s> however that is by the way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord succeeded in making the point in less than minutes and these days that counts as being brief <e> <s> however the record will show and i listened carefully to the minister that as regards hours of work for young persons and in particular hours of work at night the government for no clear reason that i could ascertain except that the matter would be complex have rejected the advice given to them <e> <s> let us be clear they have rejected the advice of the trade unions the tuc and various other bodies including the bim the cbi as far as it went and it goes a long way and the health and safety commission <e> <s> therefore we have that confirmation <e>", "<cs> i would not and i am sure the committee would not ask the minister to read all the responses <e> <s> perhaps tucked away in them is a response from someone who agrees with everything in the consultative document <e> <s> of course the bim begins not exactly as i or the noble baroness would begin with lets repeal everything that is there but and this is why i claim the bim in support of this new clause it goes on and let us put in its place a new system of sensible regulation for the hours of young workers <e> <s> therefore none of these bodies is of any help to the government <e>", "<cs> the ministers answer ended with a long passage that was not about anything to do with the matter <e> <s> he did what was done in another place in its rather longer committee stages where speakers go on for more than minutes <e> <s> he gave us a laughing list of the obsolete provisions of the regulations <e> <s> it is a well known laughing list and it is the same brief <e> <s> of course it has nothing to do with the case <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that information and very glad to have it <e> <s> however it means that there will be an interim between this bill coming into effect as an act and the time when those regulations come into force <e> <s> it is that interim about which i ask <e> <s> we should very much like to come back to it on report <e> <s> this is a very specific matter and one which is of great concern to many people especially those who have families who have suffered from these very terrible injuries <e> <s> as one author says it is not so much a question of a back injury but the gradual wear and tear on the intervertebral discs from which many people suffer in certain types of job <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for allowing me to intervene before he finishes his sentence <e> <s> i think those figures are the same as the ones produced in another place in answer to the figures for which show a greater incidence of accidents on the part of young people <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the figures for are the only ones concerning young workers which have been made public <e> <s> the government keep producing these other figures of later years which i am sure are absolutely right with which it is difficult to deal because one has not seen them in advance <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps he can assist us further in the matter <e> <s> i support the approach of my noble friend lord mccarthy what he called the utilitarian approach to the matter <e> <s> the noble lord said that the government had done much work in the matter by way of consultation and obviously they have <e> <s> it may be thought however that one of the most important factors is the question whether what one wishes to do in principle may nevertheless bring injury to third persons that is other workers or whoever it may be <e> <s> can the government therefore further assist us by printing or placing in the library any of the studies or estimates which have been carried out as regards construction sites where the rate of industrial injury is far too high <e> <s> further can such material be made available before the report stage <e>", "<cs> we are very grateful to the minister for his last sentence but not for much else <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister for his explanation of the leaflet <e> <s> we should like to consider that further <e> <s> we are grateful too for the ministers agreement to consider the problem of those who leave school at years and eight months <e> <s> i feel we should all consider that matter before report <e> <s> i do not wish to be categorical as the regulations are very complex and the ministers advisers would score much better than myself in any exam on the subject <e> <s> but there is a possibility of a gap between the ages of and <e>", "<cs> my noble friend makes a good point which enables the minister and i to join in paying tribute to the staff for all their help to us <e> <s> but it is a fact that that is done <e> <s> both the minister and i know that it is right and it would be right for other workers too <e>", "<cs> as i rise to withdraw the amendment i must point out to the minister that not all employers are as good as they are in this place or at least as i hope we are <e> <s> some employers will unscrupulously use the new freedom under the bill to exploit workers <e> <s> those are not my <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i am very disappointed with the ministers answer <e>", "<cs> some of us <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely astonished that the government wish the measure to go forward in this form <e> <s> i gave the minister a simple illustration of the way in which the clause did not work <e> <s> i had not reached the complex illustrations <e> <s> he says that our clause is more complex <e> <s> he should give an illustration of that but has chosen not to do so <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for interrupting but i wish to be clear because i may have misunderstood <e> <s> the minister says that the present wording was introduced because of the <e>", "<cs> the minister confirmed some of the worst fears of those who are very concerned about this change <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway that i do not agree that there should be no right to time off <e> <s> there should be a right to time off <e> <s> as a matter of fact it is widely held these days that employers ought to recognise trade unions and bargain with them <e> <s> that view is not held i know by the government because they do not believe in collective industrial relations <e> <s> they believe in decollectivised industrial relations <e> <s> it has been said many times by ministers that they believe in individualised industrial relations <e> <s> they do not believe in trade unions taking part in collective <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says hear hear but perhaps he would also note that the sections cover non-unionists <e> <s> this is not changing the dimensions of the legislation <e> <s> he may throw the union members to the wolves and say their unions can always support them <e> <s> this does happen but not always <e> <s> however he is then left with the non-unionists suffering what in our view is an injustice <e>", "<cs> there are three types of situation and the noble lord has rightly cited one of them <e> <s> the one he cites may not be particularly relevant to my case namely a trade union member who complains about a breach of section or section if he is an official and whose union takes up his case <e> <s> i agree that that may well be so <e>", "<cs> the amendment has done one thing and that is to establish the governments attitude <e> <s> with great respect to the minister i thank him for his reply but just to tell me that this would extend actions against an employer as an objection of course is right <e> <s> that is what it is for <e> <s> to say that the parties would come together in an industrial tribunal and not in the high court is <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord invites me to interrupt him so i shall do so with pleasurewhen dealing with other amendments we shall make the position clear <e> <s> the employee needs to know the reasons for his dismissal that is quite apart from unfair dismissal in order to obtain another job vindicate his character meet any charges and obtain social security benefit <e> <s> we shall come to that matter later <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord does not know about that <e> <s> if he does not i suggest that he informs himself <e> <s> is it not utterly preposterous for the noble lord to say that the only occasion on which one needs to have the reasons for ones dismissal is when one is going to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> that does not recognise life at all <e> <s> only people go to the tribunal <e> <s> far more are dismissed and they want to know why <e> <s> is that unreasonable <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble viscount will accept that the situation which he describes is not one to which those supporting the amendment are insensitive <e> <s> there is a problem in many employments as to the probationary period <e> <s> there is a problem as to the probationary period within which a person shows more than reasonable proof that he is competent to do the job or that he is someone to be relied upon <e> <s> i believe that that period will differ in many different employments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i am not sure that we agree that the proposal is logical and sensible <e> <s> but at least it is clear <e> <s> this is an amendment to oil the mechanism <e> <s> at the moment the government have no plans to increase the period but every year there are new bills and i suppose that every quarter we can expect a few statutory instruments <e> <s> it is quite clear that the government have oiled the mechanism so that the change in the length of the qualifying period both for unfair dismissal and written reasons can continue jumping along from two years to we know not what <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for one thing for his offer of help in the case to which i referred <e> <s> it has been looked into <e> <s> it is complicated but matters are now much better than they were <e> <s> as a matter of fact as often happens in life there were mistakes in what happened as much as evil purpose <e> <s> it would have been much clearer if at a certain point the person concerned could have asked for a statement of the reasons for dismissal <e> <s> that is how real life works <e> <s> the minister described to me the jurisdictions of the adjudication officers the appeal tribunal and the social security commissioner <e> <s> that does not help me to follow his argument that a written statement of misconduct has no bearing on unemployment benefit <e> <s> why because he says so <e> <s> i can tell him that it has a bearing on unemployed persons <e> <s> they want to know <e>", "<cs> will the minister allow me to intervene <e> <s> would he name those countries in the ec and the issues on which they have been condemned <e>", "<cs> the ministers last remark is rather alarming because either the government will take action on it or they will have to do what the employees in the foreign office would tell them to do that is to honour their international obligations by denouncing the basic convention on freedom of association <e> <s> i cannot believe that her majestys government are contemplating that <e> <s> i do not know <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down will he elaborate on one very important matter <e> <s> the clause makes provision whereby regulations allow for more important cases to go to the full tribunal <e> <s> is it envisaged that the regulations would place among those more important cases those in which there is a jurisdictional issue about which my noble friend lady turner spoke <e>", "<cs> it seems right and sensible to us that we should support the noble lords amendment and not move our separate amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is clear that the amendments concentrate upon the same matter <e> <s> it is perhaps the meanest part of a mean bill to suggest that an applicant to an industrial tribunal should contribute to alleviating the burdens on business <e> <s> the chairman even when sitting alone can decide that the applicant should pay deposit as his entrance fee to the tribunal of justice <e> <s> it is an ignoble and petty proposal <e> <s> as the noble lord has said it will be a boomerang provision because it will bring the tribunals into disrepute <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i must apologise because i did not hear everything she said <e> <s> however i believe that she asked me whether the tribunal has equivalent powers to those of the high court to strike out a case <e> <s> without going to the books i apprehend that its power is not equivalent to that of the high court <e> <s> however it would be another matter if we were discussing a proposal concerning the tribunals powers in respect of vexatious and frivolous cases and striking out <e> <s> i should willingly join her in such discussions but it is a different position from that of imposing a deposit of money on an unemployed person as a right to go to a tribunal <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should say more about the subject since as could be seen from the interventions of the noble baroness lady seear and my noble friend lady turner the ministers speech has turned into a major debate <e> <s> if anything were needed to prove to the international labour organisation freedom of association committee that the united kingdom government are not only below the international minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will agree that my amendment has led the house into interesting areas <e> <s> as regards his reply to me most of it is common ground because it meets a case which was never put <e> <s> the case put accepted that absolute weight limitation is not now the best method <e> <s> medical evidence on that is strong <e> <s> however it would be good to have and we must <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i thought that we had <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have that information <e> <s> i wish to add to those comments two serious points <e> <s> the first point is the one that came out of the deep freeze which we have not had before in this house but which was much discussed elsewhere that is the hours of work at present for young workers in the regulated and unregulated areas <e> <s> the figure is hours per week which is rather above the norm of most national and international limitations but i shall let that pass <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord accept that we are talking about a large number of persons or a number of persons who are mutually interdependent especially on such sites for their safety <e> <s> therefore the consequences of an injury or an accident to one who is a sikh and not wearing a helmet may be for example that he falls awkwardly or lets go of a rope which he might not have done had he worn a helmet <e> <s> that incident might well affect other workers who would then be injured <e> <s> as my noble friend said it is the consequence of the injuries to other workers rather than any question of discrimination on religious grounds which is surely the focus of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening but this is a very important matter <e> <s> the minister has just touched upon another important practical point <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving way <e> <s> he posited the case in which the system of work was unsafe so that the employer started from a position of liability <e> <s> that is common law <e> <s> what is the position if the damage which occurred was more extensive than it would have been if the sikh who was exempted under the clause had been wearing a hat <e> <s> it was an unsafe system of work he might have partially recovered but because he was struck more heavily by an object than would otherwise be the case he could not recover and as a result injuries were caused to other workers <e> <s> i must ask the mnister to take the matter very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> when he says that i have come some way towards him he is being unduly optimistic <e> <s> the bill has come some way towards him because he is in charge of it and except for rather strange affairs late at night he normally has a large majority to see that it goes through <e> <s> it is a bad bill <e> <s> the noble lord plays down and has throughout the proceedings the importance of procedural arrangements in themselves <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords one part of the ministers explanation is unacceptable to me and that is that there is anything opaque about the law as it has been until now <e> <s> section of the act states that its definitions are for the purpose of sections and of the act <e> <s> that is the definition and it includes associated employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> his most important words were the last few sentences <e> <s> the division he is drawing between the industrial tribunals and what we may <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister goes from the procedural to the substantive <e> <s> i was not arguing the substantive case about the governments change of rules although i pointed out that the misconduct <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the minister was asking me a question before i had sat down <e> <s> is that not correct <e> <s> if the minister does not wish me to have the right to reply i shall not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i have the right to continue <e> <s> however i have two points to make <e> <s> the minister misunderstands in the sense that i am not attacking the governments policy on social security rules although i could <e> <s> i did not say that everything would be all right if everyone had a statement of reasons <e> <s> i hope that what i said was that where someone is dismissed there can be an accusation of misconduct <e> <s> i adopt precisely the ministers description as stated in committee <e> <s> where an accusation of misconduct is levied that is precisely one example of where the worker who is dismissed is entitled to know the reason for his dismissal <e> <s> i repeat that it is morally wrong that the first time he or she knows the reason for the dismissal and sees it on paper is when it is produced by a social security officer <e> <s> that is not right but we must leave the matter there <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to other noble lords who have taken part in the debate on our amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes that in terms of analysis if i may dare use such an esoteric or academic term there does not seem to be a great deal between us <e> <s> the problem exists of the vexatious litigant in the industrial tribunal <e> <s> my estimate of the number of such litigants would be smaller than that of the noble baroness <e> <s> with the greatest respect one is always terribly impressed by the particular case which is an extreme illustration <e> <s> this clause is scarcely likely to deal with that problem <e> <s> i also apprehend that the phrase little prospect of success is well known throughout the pre-hearing jurisdiction <e> <s> the reason i wanted a clearer statement from the minister as to its place in the scheme of things is that i wished to know whether the regulations were going to tell the chairman as it seems they must though i shall come back to that later that the deposit was to be ordered where the action appeared to be vexatious frivolous or unreasonably conducted or whether the deposit could be ordered up to the maximum of course where there was little chance or appeared little prospect of success <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister makes up his mind too quickly <e> <s> i ask him to think again <e> <s> if the wide area is assessing the chance of success that is not a legal chairmans point alone <e> <s> the lay members of the tribunals will not feel happy about the minister saying that these questions do not suit i hope i quote his words near enough the practical experience of the lay members <e> <s> the lay members have much to contribute on the tribunals <e> <s> with modest experience and talking to those with far more experience i say with respect to the noble lord lord campbell that it is a well-known fact that on many tribunals the legal chairman and the lay members often get very mixed up in the work of the tribunal and everyone has something to contribute <e> <s> therefore if the case for the chairman sitting alone is simply that the lay members have nothing to contribute then the government should think again if the first criterion is to be a reasonable prospect of success <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his explanation <e> <s> we can say at once that we welcome some of the changes in these particular amendments that were made in the other place <e> <s> perhaps i may go a little further with the noble and learned lords introduction of these amendments <e> <s> now that we come to part v of the bill i am sure the noble and learned lord will agree that we must remember the importance of this area <e> <s> it was the noble lord lord strathclyde who on st november at col said that this matter went to the heart of the operation of the limited liability company <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> we welcome the noble and learned lords introduction to amendment no <e> <s> and the changes as regards the liability of directors in subsection as it now is <e> <s> however i have heard many different views already from those who are in the field as it were of the meaning of the need to have relief for the directors agreed to separately by special resolution rather than by separate special resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i apologise for interrupting him but i want to make clear the ground between us on the issue of the first directive <e> <s> he read the opening words but i shall read the whole of the first sentence <e> <s> article paragraph reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not pursue this argument because i shall have to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i understand the governments position <e> <s> i had not realised that it was as wrong as i now think it is <e> <s> while we are discussing the directive i must say that the noble and learned lord has not engaged with me upon it <e> <s> it is not a question of the third partys knowledge <e> <s> of course the case that i am out for is where the third party may lose out <e> <s> but that is the whole point that there may be some cases where a third party loses out and where a shareholder stops the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the noble and learned lord a question <e> <s> we have no great objection to amendment no <e> <s> unless it be that the last few words are surplus <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> in many ways we regard our amendment as raising the most important matter in this whole part <e> <s> our amendment is possible because there is the new subsection going some way to define or indicate what is meant by limitations on the directors powers <e> <s> we believe there is a central point which has caused uncertainty since the legislation of which this is an opportunity to put right <e> <s> it is a nettle which no government previously have been prepared to grasp <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter becomes more and more serious <e> <s> i am sorry that it has arisen now <e> <s> we have already said and i thought that the noble and learned lord agreed that this is the last time that parliament will speak on the matter <e> <s> it is also the first time that we speak on it except for what was said by the minister in the other place as to the governments intentions <e> <s> he did not say what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> he did not say that the quorum was not a limitation <e>", "<cs> my lords again i put it to the government that this is the first time that many of these matters have been debated <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may say this <e> <s> i am sure he would not wish any formal point to be between us <e> <s> what i said was and i hope that he will accept it from me that this new clause which is now an amendment before us had not been debated elsewhere <e> <s> the intentions of the government were expressed in committee but the matter was not debated <e> <s> it was put to the house of commons on report under a guillotine motion and it was not debated at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble and learned lord one question on the new amendment as it stands <e> <s> that concerns not the dropping of the words that he spoke to but the ability of the company to adopt the status of a general commercial company <e> <s> there is some confusion about the governments intention on one small point which could be important <e> <s> if the company adopts what one might call the general commercial clause as its objects can it do so with exceptions <e> <s> can it do so with provisos or must it take the offer per cent <e> <s> i have no particular view as to which is better but there is a question-mark against this <e> <s> it looks as though the company has to take it per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is something to be said about this namely to ask the government for their opinions about this clause as it goes on to the statute book <e> <s> this is the last time we shall see it <e> <s> rather without precedence in a companies bill it is part of what is called the deregulation provisions of the private company that allows it to operate without the normal company law procedures by signed resolutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join the noble lords who have thanked your lordships committee for this report in particular the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for guiding its work and for introducing the debate in the way that he did <e> <s> we must congratulate the committee as other noble lords have said in the light of its difficulties with the constant amendments to the changing drafts of the charter and of the fact that the commissions action programme became available to them as my noble friend lady lockwood said only at the very end <e> <s> it is to that action programme that i wish to address some of my remarks in the hope that we can obtain further elucidation of government policy on it <e> <s> this is the first time that the government have had the chance to put forward their remarks on the action programme as the debate in another place took place only two days after its official publication <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> i think that we should both read <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish simply to put on record for old times sake my congratulations to the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> as i have told him rightly or wrongly i received advice that the debates which took place during the earlier stages of the bill were not ones in which i ought to participate <e> <s> however i wish to put on record my congratulations to him on getting the bill to this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for taking the house through the bill <e> <s> he has acquitted himself of what is now the annual <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> will he think back to my expression of the policy which has been set out and to which the minister referred desiring a set of rights in employment and trade union law and proposing a whole series of laws <e> <s> there is no question of our wanting no law at all <e> <s> is the contrast not now one that the noble lord would want to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am obliged to the noble lord who invited me to clarify my position <e> <s> i am sorry that i went too quickly for him <e> <s> we are very well aware that the social charter is a statement of principles and that the action programme is a proposal to put some but not all of those principles into community legislation <e> <s> we also recognise and wish that the government and their back-bench supporters would recognise that the social charter enshrines a package of rights against which we would wish to see legislation measured in this house <e> <s> if the noble lord is at one with us on that we are very happy that that is so <e> <s> i invite him to say that he is in contrast to his front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves the subject of the ilo will he confirm that the government accept the many judgments of the freedom of association committee and the governing body and that in accepting those judgments the dismissal of those on strike or taking unofficial action by reason of that action is a breach of convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister for giving way <e> <s> this is simply an attempt to save time <e> <s> there was a long wrangle in another place we both know what was said on both sites as to whether a stoppage in the face of unsafe conditions is industrial action <e> <s> the legal basis on which the contrary view to that of the minister was set out <e>

the legal <e>", "<cs> my lords we were with the noble lord however we were discussing the opposition of other low paid workers who were protected by wage council orders and are no longer effectively protected <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first thank the noble viscount lord caldecote for raising this important and notable debate <e> <s> it is especially notable by the number of noble lords who chose to speak today rather than to speak in support of the bill last week <e> <s> at points i was not sure which debate this was <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will cover many points in his long speech <e> <s> perhaps i may pick one before he continues <e> <s> he notices in particular the demand that we have made it is true that those who are dismissed by reason only of taking legitimate industrial action shall not be open to dismissal <e> <s> is he aware that that basic rule applies with varieties of legal culture of course in almost all of the major industrial democracies not just in europe but in the world <e> <s> does he feel comfortable being a minister in the country which most blatantly breaks that ilo standard <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister continues to deal with gchq i think that i should intervene at this point because his speech has really become quite a saga <e> <s> indeed he has made a personal point against my noble friend and myself <e> <s> of course it is true that for procedural reasons this case went no further <e> <s> therefore it was obviously taken from the recond <e> <s> i put the following to him <e> <s> i quote from the committee of experts report of april which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must protest <e> <s> that proposition has been rejected by the freedom of association committee <e> <s> that committee is by no means the committee of experts and it was not involved in the case which was withdrawn <e> <s> that is the proposition upon which the government pleaded their case and lost <e> <s> that surely cannot be the answer <e>", "<cs> i should be most obliged if i could say a word <e> <s> my noble friend and i were consulting and we have no right to come back at the end <e>", "<cs> we thought not <e> <s> perhaps i may put the point to the noble lord <e> <s> when he spoke about a persons activities as an official surely he was speaking of something to which our amendment did not necessarily refer <e> <s> he questioned the meaning of <e>", "<cs> two important matters arise from the ministers brief reply <e> <s> he criticised us courteously and i must return the same <e> <s> in his opening remarks he made the error of referring to trade union activity <e> <s> the amendment has nothing to do with trade union activity it is to do with trade union membership as the case of <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister did not mean to elide part of the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> perhaps to save time he called it an amendment that would make it unlawful for the employer to act as he described <e> <s> in fact the amendment provides that the employer is presumed to have unlawfully refused employment <e> <s> the amendment does not make such a presumption conclusive <e> <s> it is open to the employer to show that other reasons were present <e> <s> the amendment is clear on that point <e>", "<cs> the minister said absolutely <e> <s> it is important that he said that because the government will not have any exception to that <e> <s> their policy is that employers should always be allowed to help other employers in a dispute but employees should never be allowed to help other employees in a dispute <e> <s> some people might think that that was other than a fair and balanced attitude to industrial relations <e> <s> they might even think that it would be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> i suppose that the ministers speech will become known as the philippic contra priorem because everything he said was a condemnation of the reasoning of <e> <s> let me spend a moment on <e> <s> it is very amusing for the minister and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for that enlightenment <e> <s> i took his reasoning to be argument that he could have applied then since it had so little concrete social content <e> <s> the ford case was mentioned <e> <s> i believe that ministers in particular should be careful how they speak about the ford case in view of the importance of multi-national investments <e> <s> perhaps it is not altogether wise in view of the fact that ford management know perfectly well what happened to describe the situation as simply dealing with trade union obstruction <e> <s> it was interesting that neither the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter nor the minister explained to us as i invited them to do how it turned on secondary action <e> <s> i accept that there were difficulties among trade unions <e> <s> i shall be happy to discuss that on another occasion <e> <s> but it is not a case to which this problem applies <e> <s> noble lords did not refer to any other <e> <s> this vast experience of years which erupts into this enormous prohibition on secondary action produces no other cases except those that we might use <e> <s> the minister referred to wapping and murdoch <e> <s> the minister suggested that it does not matter that murdoch divided his companies into at least six or seven subsidiary companies <e> <s> i am quite willing to believe that there are always major objectives other than labour law objectives in setting up subsidiaries <e> <s> taxation is always to the fore <e> <s> but it is odd and interesting that the effect which is what matters under the law as it was then of setting up subsidiary companies to deal with distribution and supplies separately meant that the possibilities of lawful industrial action were much reduced <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the noble lord <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> that is the governments position <e> <s> they are not prepared to discuss the realities of a balanced and fair approach which allows something on the one hand and something on the other <e> <s> that is why i took the initial point of the noble lord lord prior <e> <s> it is not a policy on secondary action that i share <e> <s> i made that clear at least three times <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter no doubt overlooked it <e> <s> if one takes that point and asks where is the balance then one begins to wonder whether those fortuitous events which relate to which company has a subsidiary on this night and that day in that particular case can really be the proper test of rights <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lord and i are in that genuine difficulty <e> <s> my noble friend will be moving a later amendment on the marshalled list which is pertinent to recognition <e> <s> i would not describe the issue as simply a recognition dispute <e> <s> i think that he is much closer to the heart of the difficulties that occurred in dundee than his noble friends <e>", "<cs> the minister is confident <e> <s> he says that in the face of a number of facts quite apart from the fact that the committee of experts has held the existing law on secondary action to be a contravention of the ilo convention <e> <s> the committee of experts is not as the noble lords seem to think a group of strange people who descend like gods in a machine to solve problems <e> <s> it is a sizeable group of the most renowned jurists from every major contributing member country of the ilo <e> <s> the minister knows very well who our representative is <e> <s> i doubt whether he would want to adopt such an attitude towards his judgments <e>", "<cs> in italy we find that before legislation is introduced there is often considerable comparative debate <e> <s> i believe that in paris there is less since they are as confident as the minister that they are right <e> <s> that is not always very profitable <e> <s> there is considerable comparative debate in germany and also now in spain <e> <s> in germany and holland on the one hand and in france italy and spain on the other there are completely different industrial relations systems <e> <s> but one does not find the same insular confidence which sweeps away comparisons <e> <s> with a certain degree of humility they accept that there may be lessons to be learnt from looking at what other people do <e> <s> however one must not import measures from an alien industrial relations system <e> <s> the governments predecessors learnt that in <e> <s> it really will not do just to say that we are special and therefore we do not have to look at international standards <e> <s> international standards matter <e> <s> they matter to real working people <e> <s> that is a point of reference which the international trade union movement has made <e> <s> it is something that the government should take into account <e> <s> it is very hard to see clause as other than a further breach of the convention <e>", "<cs> the noble lord and i read the same publications <e> <s> there are problems with everyones statistics <e> <s> however if the french produce statistics as they do only for the private sector and if the noble lord were to find as he would that the rate of decline in the french private sector is steeper than the rate of decline in our private sector that is a point to be considered <e> <s> the statistics in germany and in italy have their own problems <e> <s> in some ways in italy they are better <e>", "<cs> if the minister is passing to something else perhaps i could deal with one point <e> <s> with respect our amendment may mislead by being curiously labelled paragraph a <e> <s> the clause would read <e>", "<cs> the minister makes a good and correct point that the amendment is inconsistent with the spirit and meaning of the clause <e> <s> but the clause is so absolutist to use the word again that any amendment that does not make it more extreme is against the spirit of it <e>", "<cs> it was always my intention to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i must say that the ministers explanation has not made it easier for me to do so <e> <s> indeed i could not recognise the juridical history which he put forward <e> <s> that was perhaps due to my inability to follow the speed with which he delivered his speech <e> <s> i shall have to read what he said in <e>", "<cs> my students would say that i often confuse but that i never intend to subvert <e> <s> i am grateful for the ministers explanation on the matter <e> <s> however his reply disclosed one rather important issue <e> <s> i believe that he said that where there was a trade dispute with ones own employer that would be primary action so long as it predominantly related to that dispute <e> <s> predominantly is a very important word <e> <s> however it is not exactly what the second paragraph of subsection says <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not quite sat down <e> <s> i found his intervention most helpful <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the committee of experts has also raised the matter of contraventions of the convention with the german government the government of the netherlands and i believe the government of greece <e> <s> is the minister aware that the government of the netherlands i understand that this is also true of the german government according to a report which i recently read have entered into a constructive dialogue with the committee to try to reduce the incidence of contraventions in their legislation <e> <s> without disclosing the confidential communication to the committee will the minister assure us that this government have also entered into <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness lady seear that lawyers should retreat so far as possible from industrial relations <e> <s> my only amendment to her proposition is that they should be preceded by ministers of the present government <e>", "<cs> i always exert myself to the utmost of my powers to be reassured by the minister <e> <s> i fear that on this occasion too he has been unsuccessful <e> <s> in the passage that i read the noble and learned lord lord donaldson said <e>", "<cs> for a moment i believed that the government were going to reconsider the point in the light of the noble and learned lords admonition <e> <s> i seriously ask the minister to consult on the issue if he does not wish to leave the bill in a curious state and does not want bad law <e> <s> we do not want more law we want better law <e> <s> managers will not necessarily thank the government for leaving the position as it is <e> <s> the unions have a little to gain from the amendment <e> <s> managers will gain from the fact that they will not be able to put the matter to their lawyers as early as they otherwise might <e> <s> subject to that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to put it in this way <e> <s> the distinction is between the employee and the agent <e> <s> the amendment would provide that one is still liable for ones employees in respect of anything done in the course of employment or of the authority <e> <s> however for those who are not employees but are lay agents from time to time there is the capacity to determine the authority within which one will be liable <e> <s> that would seem a reasonable proposition <e>", "<cs> i am not at all reassured <e> <s> the minister has given us even more to think about before report and that is why i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he appears unwilling even to consider the kind of direction in which that goes namely that the purpose of the group has to be substantial <e>", "<cs> we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord rochester amendments nos <e> <s> and tabled by the government and our amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall take four points if i may <e> <s> it is curious that it has not proved more distasteful to more people that persons or bodies should be subjected to government <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i did not tempt the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls into the spirit of the example <e> <s> i appreciate that i would never win many cases in front of him if he were on the bench <e>", "<cs> suppose that the union does not believe the letter it receives <e> <s> suppose that it thinks that the company is trying it on again <e> <s> suppose that it thinks he is a confirmation of repudiation collector <e> <s> we do not believe him <e> <s> he did not have a contract <e> <s> is the union allowed to check up <e> <s> is that permitted within forthwith <e> <s> does it have time to do that <e>", "<cs> what the minister says is rather worrying <e> <s> he says that there is a juridical difference between this clause and those clauses concerning ballots <e> <s> he says that that is why no funds can be provided here but can be provided there <e> <s> he says that that is a statutory duty <e> <s> i do not follow that <e>", "<cs> i accept one point made by the minister <e> <s> an automatic cesser clause that is words which made the official cease to be an official in the event of certain facts which might create liability would evade the purpose of the new section <e> <s> it would be easy to amend the words of our amendment to avoid automatic forfeiture so to speak <e> <s> however with the rest of his remarks the minister confirmed my worst fears <e> <s> it seems that once you are an official within the meaning of section of the act you are an official for ever for life if you want <e> <s> the union can never get rid of you under its rules and that is the end of the matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that minimum statement of reassurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must make two points to the noble lord <e> <s> i was trying to avoid this until thursday but he has a brief at which we shall have to look again in the context of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> we have given notice of our intention to oppose the inclusion of this clause in the bill <e> <s> it is perhaps wrong that the record should cease without a few brief closing remarks <e> <s> what do we see when we look at clause <e> <s> we see a clause which is determined to make the trade union liable <e> <s> it is determined to make it liable whether or not those who acted for it had any authority <e> <s> it is determined to make it liable whether the persons concerned could possibly be known to the trade union either as a group or as we saw as individuals or members of other unions <e> <s> it is a departure from every conceivable principle of law which applies to other bodies <e>", "<cs> i shall achieve clarity only when i read what the minister said in <e>", "<cs> i must say that as the debate went on subject to the helpful interventions of my noble friends it became more and more difficult to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> all i am asking for is clarity <e> <s> if the minister is right that a call cannot possibly include a mere recommendation why is he resisting this amendment <e> <s> that is all the amendment says <e> <s> the minister says that it is not possible ever for that to be so <e> <s> if i wanted to get an opinion on that matter i would pay a lot of money and obtain it from the temple <e> <s> however it may be proved to be wrong the next day in the strand <e>", "<cs> is the french decision quoted by the minister the decision of th january <e> <s> if so is he saying that that is the central core of the decision <e> <s> was it not the case that no demand was made by the union or the workers in that case and that it was upset by the cour de cassation on those grounds <e> <s> it is the second time that the noble lord has quoted that case without a date and without a reference <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised by the interesting debate which this amendment has sparked off <e> <s> i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord rochester and the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> some members of the committee asked why we had proposed the amendment because it is out of spirit with the bill as though our other amendments are always in the spirit of government bills <e> <s> it was put as a mirror in which the ugly features or at least the less than attractive features of the british system at present might be reflected <e>", "<cs> hear hear says the noble lord and we agree with that <e> <s> our systems of free democracy and democratic elections differ <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord and i agree on whether or not we should have exactly the one we have or some new type the noble baroness would not agree with us on that <e> <s> but we all agree on the need for a freely-elected legislature <e> <s> that is what we have been considering in the past few weeks just so we can all agree that there should be a right to strike <e> <s> that would be expressed in different ways in different systems <e> <s> but a worker should not be dismissed merely by reason of the act of taking part in industrial action <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> to help us think about report stage and i am sure that the minister wants us to do that perhaps i may ask a rather more simple question <e> <s> a call to take industrial action before the ballot is improper <e> <s> can the minister give us an example where a unions call for industrial action at that point would not amount to authorising it <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not agree that on his first point this clause is not about whether an employee can be dismissed as he put it <e> <s> this clause concerns access to the tribunal <e> <s> in the example that he gave and allowing all the points in his argument if an employee had a long history of serious misconduct and then the employer attempted to dismiss him but could not satisfy the provisions of <e>", "<cs> further to the point made by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter may wish to reflect upon the way in which his approach differs from his noble friends approach and still further from our approach we believe that our amendment has even more merit and from the normal english legal position <e> <s> if one is at a tribunal fighting out the question whether a dismissal or dismissal of a number of workers is fair or unfair that issue will in the last resort be decided largely by reasonableness <e> <s> in that condition of reasonableness the tribunals and more especially the employment appeal tribunal and the court of appeal have in many cases inserted a requirement that a warning should be given <e> <s> they do so i am surprised at the noble lord in defence of the individual <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to all these points i should put a few more <e> <s> the example given by my noble friend lord murray illustrates the way in which this extraordinary jungle or thicket of legal rules is getting more and more dense <e> <s> it would make a works managers hair stand on end <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord campbell that ballots are only allowed within the provisions of the act and now under clause of this bill <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady seear said what happens in the case of a refusal to take action on the part of the authority that the union regards as its authority i mean by that the executive under the rule book but where the workers think they have a reasonable grievance <e> <s> a local official or a shop steward acting <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister because my intervention may save time <e> <s> i have never understood the force of the word simple used in the ministers kind letters to me and now in his proposition to the committee <e> <s> am i right in believing that it means that if workers stop work in the face of a perceived danger and do no more that is not industrial action <e> <s> however is it right that if they stop work and put pressure on the employer by demanding to have the situation rectified that is industrial action <e> <s> is that the governments proposition <e>", "<cs> with respect to the minister there is no point in continuing with this debate <e> <s> we intend to come back to this matter on report <e> <s> when the minister and his advisers and no doubt other ministers read the discussion i have no doubt that they will reconsider the position <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the ministers point but it covers only a small part of the ground for this reason <e> <s> i am sorry to be drawn on this point but we must have it on the record in view of that intervention <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the minister the fact that there is not a case is the worst argument that a lawyer can advance <e> <s> one then has to argue on principle <e> <s> i can say that there is no case and therefore our propositions are correct <e> <s> it is equally ludicrous <e>", "<cs> the minister repeats the point he made that a simple stoppage is not industrial action <e> <s> we want to know what is a simple stoppage <e> <s> is it a stoppage that puts no pressure on the employer <e> <s> how is it that a stoppage at an unsafe workplace does not put pressure on the employer to put it right <e> <s> that is what we want to know <e> <s> these questions can be answered on report because the minister has not answered them tonight <e> <s> if those questions cannot be answered there is nothing left of the ground on which the government stand <e> <s> i appreciate that there may be cases when industrial tribunals have the last word but workers will hardly be encouraged to go to tribunals in the face of the speech made by the minister the speeches made elsewhere and if i may say so the letter from the secretary of state to the tuc which said that refusal to do work will in practice only rarely be an appropriate response to an unsafe workplace <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i do not mean to interrupt the minister but he invites me to do <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to labour any point even by pun <e> <s> the minister was about to leave a point which had not been covered in debate and which my noble friend raised <e> <s> does he accept that where a union or an official who binds it authorises the action which has begun spontaneously so that it ceases to be unofficial action from that point until the ballot can be completed the union is open to an injunction <e>", "<cs> my noble friends and i have given notice of our intention to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> it has been a matter of some regret to us not to move some of the most recent amendments between nos and <e> <s> in doing so we had in mind a number of matters first the hour and the position in the committee and secondly the fact that there has been over the earlier amendments considerable discussion of various aspects of clause and we wanted to look again as it were to believe with our eyes what our ears told us at the governments attitude to this objectionable clause <e>", "<cs> that is an ambiguous proposition <e> <s> there is a sense in which it is correct <e> <s> it is true that the ilo governing body has never included a condemnatory paragraph in its general report <e> <s> that is what the minister means <e> <s> the government will do their best to ensure that that does not happen <e> <s> however they are not doing their best by argument they are doing their best by other means <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers last remarks <e> <s> he will see what he can do and i hope that he can do something <e> <s> i take his point on costs <e> <s> i may have gone too far on costs but there is still a case as regards what i agree is the unlikely event of frivolous actions <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister allow me to intervene <e> <s> the amendment does not repeat what is in the bill <e> <s> clause states that each dispute is a separate dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister forgotten that the act redefined trade dispute as meaning a dispute with ones own employer <e> <s> therefore a trade dispute cannot be a dispute with anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the summer there is no alternative <e> <s> however the minister must allow me to say a few words even if only out of professional integrity <e> <s> he should not have read his committee brief after i had told him that i was not making the same points as in committee <e> <s> i told him that we believed that there was a problem and that it was in everyones interest to clear it up <e>", "<cs> my lords now we are winkling out something <e> <s> if it is the governments intention to deprive a primary action of its immunity and protection if it relates to another dispute at plant b they have not achieved it <e> <s> the subsection is so obscure that they will not get that out of it <e> <s> however if that was what the minister wished he took another large step in this legislation <e> <s> every time we receive a further reply and supply of information there appears another hole into which unhappily the minister is bound to fall and i sympathise <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has probed a number of matters which should have been probed before <e> <s> the further the minister went the more extraordinary the bill appeared <e> <s> we should remember that we are discussing liability in law for a body of persons whose funds are held in trust jointly for all the members and whether that body will be made liable in the courts for an act done by a stranger <e> <s> the noble lord has not in any way denied nor can he that the actual act done say the calling out of a shop on unofficial strike may be the act of a stranger <e> <s> the link is back through the group to the official <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a difference with this employment bill <e> <s> in my experience there has never been an employment bill where at report stage there have begun to emerge so many fundamental points of greater difficulty than at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> he may be surprised that i say that <e> <s> i thank him especially for his last remark <e> <s> it always seems to me the last refuge of certain lines of argument to say that if a certain state of affairs exists one needs this and if a certain state of affairs does not exist one still needs it because one would not have to worry about that <e> <s> that is what he said about the bill <e> <s> if there is unofficial action all right if there is no unofficial action do not worry <e> <s> it is up to the minister when such enormous deviations from normal principles are involved to prove his case and to show us the problem that requires this extraordinary deviation from a basic civilised principle <e> <s> it is a civilised principle to which one is not normally liable under these circumstances <e> <s> the minister would not be happy to be civilly liable for someone about whom he knew nothing and had never heard of simply because he attended a meeting when he did not realise the consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he accept that of course we understand that there is no problem about balloting persons who are not employees at the time of the ballot <e> <s> that was one part of the judgment that he quoted <e> <s> the problem arises from the other argument <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls adverted to it in a rather longer passage but it is in this context that if the union then calls out on strike those who were not employees at the time of the ballot it will be calling out employees who have not voted in the ballot <e> <s> it is that argument which can be used to invalidate an otherwise perfectly satisfactory ballot <e> <s> that is why the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls said that if it were just a matter of <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very disappointing <e> <s> we shall have to withdraw the amendment but it is a very serious matter <e> <s> first the noble lord says that a conditional call is not included within the phrase because it is an announcement of intent <e> <s> that is not necessarily a reasoning which would convince a court <e> <s> i do not know where that leaves us <e> <s> a conditional call is quite uncertain <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down rather than ask him for a reference to the quotation of my views which he inaccurately gave and which he will be unable to find i wish to ask him something which is internal to his argument <e> <s> i wish it to be made clear so that i may understand <e> <s> the minister said words to the effect that employees who take unofficial action and know that it is not authorised by the union put their jobs on the line <e> <s> i hope that that is a fair rendering of what he said <e>", "<cs> if a clause is devised on that principle should it not include the case of employees who thought that action was authorised but who turned out to be wrong <e> <s> should not the clause include the situation where employees did not think that they were putting their jobs on the line took what they thought was authorised action but perhaps because of one of the shop stewards whom the government are so fond of thinking about a mistake was made and action was not authorised <e> <s> should not the clause allow for that based on the argument that the minister has put to us <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister is discussing that case perhaps he will tell us what factor in that case caused the stoppage not to be a simple stoppage in the face of unsafe lorries <e>", "<cs> my lords we are naturally disappointed because we believe the issue concerned is a serious and important one <e> <s> i am particularly disappointed that the minister has not <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter says <e> <s> i would not claim that the structure of the law is logical now or has been necessarily
