["<cs> my lords as this is the first time i have addressed your lordships house i ask your indulgence for any shortcomings in my speech <e> <s> as bishop of liverpool i have a privileged view of a region deeply affected by unemployment <e> <s> i see a community deeply hurt by those high levels of unemployment which have been experienced over many years <e> <s> in merseyside this is not simply part of a cycle a bad dip in trade although the losses of firms that we have experienced recently are so damaging that we wonder sometimes what industrial base will be left to pick up that upturn in trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the debate and thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for calling for and introducing it <e> <s> perhaps i should say that i am not going to quote quite so much scripture as did the noble lord at the beginning <e> <s> i belong to a small group of bishops who meet privately all of whom serve in the six largest cities in this country <e> <s> last winter we were meeting and in our conversation we felt that we really must try to find ways of expressing the very serious effects of the cuts on people whom we see in our daily work effects on those whose needs are the greatest the great majority of whom live in the big cities of our country <e>", "<cs> i follow with all the energy i can my noble friend the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester in pressing the simplicity and certainty which this amendment would give <e> <s> the question has been raised again of moral and christian comment <e> <s> the noble lord lord home of the hirsel rightly declared his right to speak as a christian <e> <s> however we are not simply swapping different individual christian views or the views of lay christians against priestly christians <e> <s> there has been very substantial debate in all the churches for a number of years <e> <s> there is no subject in which the christian conscience has become more keenly engaged than in this matter which we are debating today <e> <s> within the churches it has been a debate in which black people and asian people have played a very full part <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments of the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead and i should like to speak to all of them <e> <s> it has been argued from the government front bench that discretion in fact gives the better deal to those who apply in one way or another that they can be handled sensitively and flexibly whereas if there is a machinery of appeal everything becomes rigid <e> <s> i want again to make a point which the noble viscount lord colville of culross made namely that everybody knows that there is already a route of appeal <e> <s> if one can find a member of parliament or can get together a campaign appeals will be made to the home secretary <e> <s> everyone knows that that takes place <e> <s> it is an erratic course of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat nervous lest these propositions that the noble lord lord spens has been suggesting to us put in front of us a belief that employers can do more than lies within their capacity although i believe that some of the ideas that we have heard especially those <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for putting down this question <e> <s> i too believe it to be extremely timely and i hope that her majestys government will now consider introducing legislation to modernise and clarify the law relating to charities <e> <s> those of us who are concerned with the charitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl the minister for his answer may i ask him whether he recognises that liverpool polytechnic in particular has been affected very adversely by this change of policy <e> <s> liverpool polytechnic with very little or no fat has never been a free-spending authority <e> <s> does he acknowledge how illogical it seems of her majestys government to talk of pouring money into merseyside and to appoint a minister for merseyside whose first concern is to regenerate employment and to strengthen good training while at the same time reducing the rate support grant to liverpool by million over four years and imposing a new financial system for polytechnics which costs the city of liverpool an additional million a year for the provision of the polytechnic <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps worth making the point that we are not speaking only about the greater london council this afternoon <e> <s> we are concerned for the other metropolitan counties and perhaps i may speak especially from what i know in merseyside <e> <s> it is said that the paving bill is simply a necessary way of making practical arrangements to tide us over a short interim period <e> <s> the secretary of state knows that this next year or two will be a very anxious and important time for merseyside and indeed for the other metropolitan counties and i want to set what i say in the context of this next year or two <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge the concession that the government have made and the irenic way in which the noble viscount the leader of the house put forward the case but i believe the question still remains as i felt the noble lord lord diamond put it quite plainly whether the package which the leader of the house has commended to us has restored a proper democratic accountability <e> <s> i want to make just one or two very brief points <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the minister for some of the good news that he has told us and being indeed glad about that i note that he said that the government do not make prophecies of unemployment <e> <s> i would however ask the noble lord the minister whether he does not agree with me that according to all the evidence we have the market with its new technology will never need full employment again as so many people will agree behind doors <e> <s> does he not also agree with me that if that is true we must look at policies in a quite fresh way and that it is not good enough simply to pay dole to those whom the market does not need but who would love to work <e>", "<cs> my lords we come back to the short debate introduced by the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye <e> <s> i remind your lordships of part of the wording of the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for reminding us at a time when the media has compelled our attention to overwhelming tragedies of the danger of their repetition <e> <s> we knew that these tragedies were coming but we did so little to prevent them <e> <s> four years ago the world banks berg report focused on sub-saharan africa

so many parts of the world have known migration to the cities because of impoverishment and lack of investment in the countryside <e> <s> in sub-saharan africa years ago there were five cities each of over one million inhabitants <e> <s> now there are more than such cities <e> <s> villages lose their more active and versatile labour force while the overcrowded cities become human time-bombs <e> <s> governments subsidise food supplies to prevent political unrest in overcrowded cities and that adds to the process by which food growers do not receive sufficient price incentive to grow more food <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply and for the assurance which i think lies within it <e> <s> does he agree that to survive properly the orchestra needs the unfettered use of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord rhodes for giving us some chapter and verse about the genuine and positive achievements of these last years of the greater manchester council <e> <s> it is good to follow manchester with liverpool <e> <s> we have a man in brussels too and we have hopes of him <e> <s> but the account of these years which the noble lord has given us is paralleled in point after point with the merseyside county council an authority co-operating repeatedly with the private sector and i may say deeply respected by the private sector <e> <s> we need to have that fresh air of the achievements of these years if we are to see what we are talking about in our debate this evening <e>", "<cs> i would certainly not have put my name to the amendment if i had believed it to be a wrecking amendment nor if i had believed it to be a frivolous amendment <e> <s> i support the noble baroness in calling for a committee of inquiry and i use the words on the marshalled list which show that there is an agenda with strict limits to it for such an inquiry to <e>", "<cs> i rise to support amendments nos <e> <s> c and d <e> <s> in this committee as at second reading the point has been well made that skilled teams have been brought together through the life of the metropolitan counties and the glc and that these centres of excellence should not be lost in the abolition <e> <s> that point has been made with great authority by the noble earl lord cranbrook on <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord should put words into my mouth <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendments which propose elected co-ordinating authorities for london and the metropolitan counties because they seem to me to pull together very effectively the amendments which have been passed in your lordships house at committee stage <e> <s> noble lords from all sides of the house expressed genuine anxieties about the inability of joint boards to co <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the warning of the noble lord lord elton about political reality but he perhaps will not be so surprised that i am still willing to have a tilt at some windmills <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord seebohm for bringing this report published last summer back to public debate <e> <s> the two things that i want to talk about are finance and the homeless <e> <s> i want to return to the inquirys very important proposals about housing finance <e> <s> this has touched a raw nerve in the public debate by calling in question mortgage interest tax relief <e> <s> one senior minister recently dismissed that questioning by saying that mortgage interest tax relief had been proved overwhelmingly popular <e> <s> he did not ask whether it was just and equitable <e> <s> nor did he ask in what part of the population it was overwhelmingly popular <e>", "<cs> i have yet to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords when i saw from the list of speakers that i was to follow the noble lord lord elton i thought that i might say some things about the role which he has so often played in your lordships house <e> <s> then after the noble lord lord bellwin spoke the noble earl did so in a manner with which i have no intention of trying to compete of celebrating the years on the front bench <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton has often been in that role where he has replied with unfailing warmth and courtesy to our debates not least not long ago in that excellent debate in this house on the inquiry held by the duke of edinburgh into housing when i congratulated him on his speech and he said that he had put away his brief and had spoken from his heart <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> i felt that the series of remarks the secretary of state made were about planning intervention government resources and that the real help was all to come from self-help <e> <s> our argument is that both have to feed each other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the short debate we have had <e> <s> i saw the extreme nervousness of the noble lord lord williams at the thought of a sermon coming on <e> <s> i shall spare noble lords that <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that in the majority of parishes since long before i was born all the offerings have been put together and used by the pccs <e> <s> yes pccs have what was called alms and dues <e> <s> it is important for them to be called to face both those responsibilities <e> <s> i speak about my own diocese and many others <e> <s> we have now moved to assessment of stipends arid quotas on the basis of potential and not merely on how much comes in so whether a parish is so to speak keeping some of the money in a separate pocket would no longer arise with us <e>", "<cs> my lords the lawyers would be <e> <s> i do not think that we want to say that that is exclusive <e> <s> we hear the point that has been made and will take that back with us <e> <s> on clause we should want to take note and consider that on a compassionate basis <e> <s> my experience is that that has been done when such matters

year <e> <s> i am not sorry for the reason because i had a special time of sabbatical study leave in a tiny cottage in the western highlands but i am sorry that i was unable to be part of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords adjoining occupier was the phrase <e> <s> but it may land the courts in still more trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will respond with some seriousness to this particular issue <e> <s> the exhortation of mr tebbit has been mentioned already <e> <s> it is now part of liverpool folklore that the tebbit express travels every friday from london to liverpool and every sunday night and monday from liverpool in the reverse direction <e> <s> that happens from many cities an extra train on monday morning and several extra trains back on fridays <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support these two very important amendments <e> <s> yesterday i said on a personal note that i had been away on a sabbatical during the earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> i should have said that all of us on these benches were away during the committee stage because we were at the lambeth conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i also hope the minister will seriously consider this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that a considerable bureaucracy will be needed to recover quite modest sums from housing associations <e> <s> if it is not a terrible mixing of metaphors i should say that the bureaucracy will be needed to claw back the fat that they may have <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the purpose set before us by the noble earl we should bring thoroughly to an end the ugly face of football-related violence <e> <s> i should declare an interest an ecumenical interest one might say in that i support both liverpool and everton <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good of the noble lord to give way <e> <s> he said that all the speeches with the exception of that of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe had not suggested that anything needed to be done <e> <s> i certainly said that i agreed with the noble earl in that there was a great need for things to be done to settle the public order of football-related violence <e> <s> believe that was said by each speaker who has spoken <e> <s> the objection was and my own question was would it be effective <e> <s> it is because the speeches of each of them have said it would not be effective that we have said this first part of the bill is bad <e> <s> that is not to be twisted to say that any one of the speakers so far has suggested the government should do nothing <e> <s> no such word has been said from any side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am being asked a question <e> <s> introducing bills is not the only way in which a government can act <e> <s> i made a great deal of play with the importance of working with the grain and of working in co-operation with the police and with the football authorities <e> <s> certainly the government have acted can act and should act <e> <s> whether it should be a bill in this particular shape is what your lordships are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is pressing me <e> <s> i am sure your lordships are getting bored with the conversation <e> <s> i entirely agree with the second part of the bill <e> <s> it is very important that there should be legislation which introduces a restriction on people <e> <s> i entirely agree with the change in the law which makes it possible for the police to prosecute on the basis of what is recorded on closed circuit television <e> <s> those things are of the greatest importance and they are correctly in legislation and i am very glad <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is missing the point <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the official record he will see the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble lord lord peston has drawn attention to this subject <e> <s> he has put his finger on crucially important connections <e> <s> i follow the noble baroness lady david into the adult field <e> <s> in an area with chronic high unemployment stretching over generations like merseyside and indeed other cities such as glasgow and belfast the skills gap is the factor which has held back so many attempts to establish a more successful economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i believe that i speak on behalf of all the churches in this country in expressing our rejoicing that nelson mandela is free <e> <s> i am thankful for president de klerks courage and statesmanship <e> <s> it is an astonishing step forward which we could not have imagined a year ago <e> <s> i hope that the next step may be the complete lifting of the state of emergency and the putting in place of a negotiating framework <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister will agree that the factor which is perhaps the most decisive in determining whether acts of worship take place which engage and enliven pupils is whether teachers have the confidence the skill and the conviction to plan them and ensure that they are carried through <e> <s> however can she tell us whether the des is allotting extra funds and if so how much to support teachers in-service training in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords the publication of the broadcasting bill raised considerable anxieties among religious people not least among the members of the central religious advisory committee of which i have been chairman for the past months <e> <s> that committee has become known by the now highly incongruous title of crac which in the modern world means something different from what we set about <e> <s> i should perhaps explain that crac includes strong representation from the whole of the united kingdom from the anglican church the roman catholic church the church of scotland the methodist church the united reformed church the baptist church black-led churches and the orthodox church as well as jewish moslem and hindu representation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has raised the question of a programme that i understand was submitted towards the end of either or <e> <s> when i have asked noble lords and members of parliament what blocks are alleged to have been put in the way that is the one and only example that has been repeatedly given to me <e> <s> i know that the film was not rejected because it was too evangelistic <e> <s> no such words were ever used <e> <s> it was not rejected by crac because it offers nothing before a programme <e> <s> as the noble earl said crac is an advisory body after the event <e> <s> it does not screen programmes <e>", "<cs> before i speak to my amendments nos <e> <s> and i wish to say a little about the structure of the debate <e> <s> i am anxious that we do not get in a muddle <e> <s> there is an issue here which is worth talking about concerning the religious advisory committee <e> <s> later there are the ministers amendments nos <e> <s> and which are withdrawing the no undue prominence clause that was previously in the bill <e> <s> they refer to new requirements for the owner of a cable station <e> <s> i wish to comment briefly on those matters <e> <s> i also wish to reserve my position to speak to some of the amendments which have been tabled in connection with religious advertising <e> <s> that matter received no debate in another place <e> <s> it is a matter of sufficient importance for there to be a proper debate in this chamber <e>", "<cs> i am glad to follow the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth and i am glad that he referred to the printed press <e> <s> i was surprised and confused when the noble lord lord wyatt first of all drew some parallels with newspapers and then said it was ridiculous to suggest that newspapers should be subject to the same obligations of impartiality as are laid on broadcasters <e> <s> i find it very hard to see why <e> <s> millions are fed bias through newspapers very powerful bias <e> <s> i believe that impartiality is enormously important <e> <s> i also believe that it is indivisible in public media <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i am well satisfied with his answer <e> <s> he said that we need to have clear standards and safeguards and that we shall be looking to see codes from the etc and the radio authority <e> <s> on monday i said that i was pleased that amendment no <e> <s> on religious programmes had been brought forward at the same time as the no undue prominence part of the bill had been withdrawn <e>", "<cs> we are trying to tease out some of the real issues in this matter <e> <s> i should be much keener on the second example <e> <s> however the noble lord has spelt out some of the difficulties involved when one is trying to draw lines if this could be done in respect of a cathedral spire then why not for a religious movement of the kind which has brought disrepute to the gospel in the united states <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will think carefully about the thrust of these amendments <e> <s> i am sure that advertisements create a climate in which young people feel that it is acceptable and manly to drink <e> <s> in our country we have become shocked at drug abuse and we know that alcoholism is a huge issue <e> <s> it seems to me that this suggestion is a sensible modest limitation <e>", "<cs> i see the difficulty expressed by the minister about subsidies for some <e> <s> there s plainly a genuine difficulty there <e> <s> i hope that the government will not push away the need for some help in this direction <e> <s> their purpose is to increase diversity and choice <e> <s> the noble lord lord colwyn is trying to show a way of offering help in programming in training and other ways <e> <s> i have asked a good many questions of people who know about local radio <e> <s> radio by local communities for local communities is extremely fragile <e> <s> it is a very precarious operation <e> <s> the health of a city is furthered by giving a voice to those groups which do not have wealthy friends and which are tempted to say nobody every listens to us <e> <s> it is worth paying a price to make that possible <e>", "<cs> on another amendment earlier this evening i spoke about those groups which have felt themselves to have no voice and of the benefit to the community if they could be allowed a voice <e> <s> this week i heard of two pirate stations which would almost certainly fall within the groups that have been mentioned <e> <s> if it were possible to bring them within a framework where they would have an opportunity on the same level as everyone else of coming into another station legally i would hope we could smooth the way for that <e>", "<cs> i support what the minister has said <e> <s> this is not the place or the time to withdraw such buttresses <e> <s> if we did so i believe we would be sending out the wrong signals <e> <s> last weekend i took part with my staff and other
