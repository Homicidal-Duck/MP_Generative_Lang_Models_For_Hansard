["<cs> my lords much of the bill deals with the powers and the procedures of the scottish criminal courts a subject which an english lawyer is supremely ill-fitted to deal with or comment upon <e> <s> but part i deals with the circumstances in which it is permissible for police officers to interfere with the liberty of the individual to go about without restraint <e> <s> there are no reasons why different standards should apply in one part of the united kingdom from another <e> <s> on the contrary there is every reason why the standards should be the same <e> <s> what is more these very questions about the powers of the police are the subject at this moment of keen debate in england in the context of the royal commission on criminal procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble and learned lord tell us that by the committee stage your lordships will be given some details of the questions which it is proposed should be asked at the judicial examination <e>", "<cs> i have tabled my intention to move that the whole of clause be deleted but since by far the most sweeping innovatory and objectionable part of clause is covered by the various amendments which have been put down in the name of the noble lord lord foot i think it is appropriate that the greater part at least of what i have to say about clause should be said upon the noble lords amendments <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl when he replies to the amendment will answer the questions which i put a few moments ago <e> <s> what steps is it envisaged will be taken by the police in a case where the person whose name and address is given either has no identification papers at all on him or his identification papers are for some reason suspect <e> <s> if the noble earl is coming to the committee asking for these powers to be approved he must have information from those who say they are necessary and in particular the police administration as to what sort of steps are likely to be taken in order for this verification process to take place <e>", "<cs> i am not altogether happy with the reply given by the noble earl <e> <s> the noble lord lord foot made a good point when he referred to the matters which have to be recorded but the question then arises at what stage do they have to be recorded <e> <s> i fancy that in the normal run of things the record will generally be completed when the period of detention is over <e> <s> i also apprehend that no copy of that record would be given as a matter of course to the detained person <e> <s> it really worries me that a new power is being given to detain people <e> <s> that power is only to be exercised in certain circumstances and is to be circumscribed by various rights given to the suspected person the right not to have to answer questions the right to have someone informed that he is there and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask two questions for clarification <e> <s> first can he confirm clearly that it would be perfectly possible and lawful to implement the provisions of section regarding legal aid without implementing the guardians <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to pay my tribute to the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle and in so doing i hope that i may be a little more controversial than he felt himself open to be by adding the following point <e> <s> the probing questions which the right reverend prelate put to the government as a result of his experience in the north-east can i suggest be answered in only one way that the untrammelled right to buy which is contained in the bill is bound to lead to quite intolerable shortages in those areas where there is the most acute housing need <e>", "<cs> i wish to follow my noble friend in supporting the amendment which stands in my name too and to add a point about the importance of the arguments for giving reasons before central government step in in the draconian way in which they can under the clause <e> <s> i believe two principles are involved <e> <s> there is the principle of natural justice which dictates that wherever any person or body is to be subject to severe penalties he or they should be entitled to know why that is happening and should have the opportunity to make representations upon the reasons that are given and if such are mistaken or erroneous to be able to say so in good time <e> <s> the second principle is the principle that the people of the area whose authority is being taken over in this way should have the right to know why that is happening <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord is saying is an argument for this amendment <e> <s> he is saying that in any event his government would wish to give some kind of notice and to make clear their reasons <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord this will he look at the various other provisions existing on the statute book for central government to intervene in local authority affairs <e> <s> i am quite sure that he will find the sort of provision written into the law such as i have quoted from the housing finance act which makes it the normal thing to serve some kind of notice or to request consultation before coming down finally and imposing these sanctions <e> <s> if that is the practice as i believe it is before such reserve powers are used then it ought to be written into the bill and not left to the goodwill of central government to come in when they want <e> <s> at the least the people of the area ought to know in greater detail than the act sets out why these powers are being used so that they can judge whether central government or local government are right in their actions <e>", "<cs> may i first take up the point which the noble baroness lady faithfull made <e> <s> the position is better when the spouses or partners are joint tenants because then at least they have rights at law and can go to a court to get some kind of order which determines who should be able to occupy the home and it is principally the cases where the tenancy is only in the name of one partner who still in many authorities is the breadwinner or the man and the woman has a number of rights in equity but very few at law <e>", "<cs> may i add a quick word about a particular part of the <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down and the amendment is withdrawn may i add just a word on what the noble lord lord belstead said about the problem of arrears being foisted on to a spouse <e> <s> he did in a sense throw out a challenge that if further and compelling evidence were provided he would i hope i take his meaning consider it and consider whether that threw up the need to embody what we agree to be a desirable idea in legislation <e> <s> i believe the evidence to he there <e> <s> there have been submitted to me a number of cases but at this hour of night i do not intend to weary the committee with them <e> <s> however i pro <e>", "<cs> this is an enormously important amendment and i am afraid i do not apologise for prolonging the debate in speaking to it <e> <s> we could alleviate a <e>", "<cs> in his reply to the amendment the noble lord has not given the committee a good reason why it should not be accepted <e> <s> i find it quite impossible to imagine circumstances in which it could he in the interests of a tenant to change from having a protected tenancy with full security at a fair rent to having a protected tenancy without any security beyond a year for a fair rent <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment and i do so as a result of many years experience of the vagaries of county court judges <e> <s> the clause in the bill which amendment no <e> <s> seeks to delete gives a completely open discretion to a county court judge to determine whether <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord bellwin in this at least that the rent officer system has worked well since it was introduced by a labour government in <e> <s> but the rest of what the noble lord said did i suggest show an astonishing ignorance of what actually happens <e> <s> what we are talking <e>", "<cs> i say no more at this stage <e> <s> we shall come back to this <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord evans of claughton has taken the same point as i and my noble friends are proposing to take on clause as a whole <e> <s> we should therefore speak to it now <e> <s> i do not know whether his amendment or mine better meets the point being made <e> <s> even as a lawyer i find the drafting of these amendments to the rent act and amendments to those amendments very difficult <e> <s> behind all the legal jargon there is one enormously important point on which i hope the government are going to move that is that when a tenant who is paying an excessive rent in an area of scarcity takes his rights to apply to a rent officer he can at the moment do so in the security that if he is right and he is being overcharged then when the rent is registered it will be effective from the time that he makes the application <e> <s> this bill changes that position completely <e> <s> it is as the noble lord lord evans pointed out an invitation to procrastinate on behalf of the landlord who may be getting or a week for every week he could put off a determination <e> <s> that cannot be desirable <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may have a point with re-registrations <e> <s> there is not the same problem of a rent which is probably excessive being charged <e> <s> but when it is a first registration the point that the noble lord lord evans and i have made must be met <e> <s> this is a matter which could be considered between now and the report stage <e>", "<cs> we are getting on to slightly technical ground <e> <s> i must take up the noble lord when he talks about letting outside the rent acts <e> <s> the circumstances in which you can let outside the rent acts are very very limited indeed and concern only friendly arrangements holiday lets and things of that kind <e> <s> obviously i am not going to press this to a division but will the noble lord who knows quite well that there are constantly in big cities lettings that may or may not be outside the rent acts disputed holiday lets and things of that kind undertake to consider what the impact of a cancellation would be when someone is in possession without know <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord will take it from me that lawyers and courts let alone landlords and tenants can get into terrible tangles in understanding the rent acts <e> <s> it is on such a point not on a point of great principle that i asked for and have received that assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord began his reply by saying that he did not <e>", "<cs> i do not find that explanation or that reply acceptable at all <e> <s> first it does not deal with one of the <e>", "<cs> may i follow what my noble friend and the minister have said <e> <s> there is probably a general wish in all parts of the committee to find constructive solutions to the problems of multi-occupied housing <e> <s> on the one hand there is a real need for housing for the single homeless and often for families for whom there is no other provision <e> <s> on the other hand we are talking about what is probably the rock bottom in terms of amenities and conditions when discussing these various clauses on multi-occupied housing <e> <s> a little later we and i think the government too will come to the fire problem <e>", "<cs> i think that the report is to be made by the housing services advisory unit <e> <s> the unit has been asked to examine this problem and to report to the minister of housing who i think has agreed to publish the report <e> <s> perhaps the minister can inform me in writing if he does not have details now what progress is being made with the preparation of the report <e>", "<cs> i hope that we all agree about what the present bill is <e>", "<cs> during the course of the committee stage there have been raised from various parts of the chamber a number of positive and constructive points on the problem of those who live in multi-occupied houses <e> <s> i am pleased that the government have responded in a positive way and i thank the noble lord in particular for his constructive reply on certain aspects of this amendment <e> <s> clearly on report we shall be able to look at all the various problems regarding multi-occupied houses which have been raised in the committee and in the light of that i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think this amendment precisely covers the point which was sought to be covered by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is an important little point and i am very pleased that it has now been covered by the bill <e> <s> we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i raise one small point <e> <s> clause includes among other things the title of the bill as the housing act <e> <s> we really have had in this committee two bills a housing act and a rent act <e> <s> while i do not seriously suggest that the title needs to be changed there is one rather more serious point that ought to be raised on that fact <e> <s> a private tenant who wants to find out what his rights and remedies may be will have most of it set out in the rent act but will have small parts of it tucked away in the middle of the housing act <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply by the noble lord lord bellwin shows a spirit which has been all too lacking so far from the government front bench but i wholeheartedly accept it on this amendment and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to these amendments may i also speak to amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and which i think would fall if amendment no <e> <s> were accepted <e> <s> what the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton said in relation to the block of amendments does not meet a very fundamental point that was raised in committee by me and some of my noble friends <e> <s> in fact the point comes rather close to the point made by the noble lord lord monson in his proposed amendments <e> <s> the noble lord said quite rightly that there will be delays in the registration of a rent which could cause hardship to landlords if the rent were increased <e> <s> equally there will be delays in the registration of a rent which could cause difficulties to tenants on a first registration if the rent is reduced particularly since the delays can sometimes stretch over many months when there is an application to the court <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we are of course on fairly technical legal ground here and what the noble lord says clearly has to be studied to be fully appreciated <e> <s> one of the areas where we differ is in thinking that short-holds will do very much to cure this type of abuse <e> <s> time alone can tell which of us is right <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies i should like to put to him one other point which arises out of what he said <e> <s> as regards the question of holiday lets and indeed as regards the last amendment the noble lord lord bellwin said quite rightly that these matters can be tested in the courts <e> <s> he has greater confidence than i have in the capacity of the courts always to do what is just in those circumstances <e> <s> the difficulty is that courts tend to hold the parties to the very letter of the agreement which they have signed <e> <s> that is one of the principles of the law <e> <s> be that as it may it is true that it frequently happens that one can show that the agreement is in fact a sham <e>", "<cs> my lords before this amendment is finally accepted may i voice the disquiet that i feel about the amendment and the debate upon it <e> <s> i think the house needs to appreciate that the law is not being changed one iota by this amendment unless and until the secretary of state takes upon himself to use the new powers that are given in paragraph <e> <s> what i fear is that these powers will be talked about to some extent and then put on a shelf as i understand similar powers under the fire precautions act have been and used only in a very small number of circumstances perhaps when there are very big institutions involved and that they will not meet the dangers that the noble lord lord hylton talked about which were exemplified by the kilburn fire <e> <s> we ought to have from the noble lord lord bellwin a commitment by the government that these powers will be vigorously used <e> <s> even if he cannot give us the detail of what kind of buildings will be specified by them he should give us an undertaking that there will be vigorous use of these powers perhaps more vigorous than the local authorities themselves would like to see so that means of escape from fire can be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a small but important point about which there have been some discussions outside the chamber <e> <s> i wish merely to thank the noble lord for a most prompt and favourable response to a matter that was brought to his notice and which is now covered by this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i approach this bill from a point of view which i hope is not a controversial one that we should encourage the widest possible participation of the public in the administration of justice <e> <s> we have one unique and priceless asset within the common law judicial system that is that we actually invite members of the public to take part in the administration of justice by serving on juries and like my noble friend lord hutchinson i believe that juries verdicts are eminently to be trusted <e> <s> but the participation of the public is needed also and is needed more in those decisions which are left to the judges and other judicial persons acting on their own <e> <s> justice thank goodness <e> <s> is not done behind closed doors except in very exceptional cases <e> <s> the reason why the public are invited and are entitled to come either themselves or through their representatives in the press to listen to cases is not in order that they might worship the majesty of the law but in order that they may pass their own judgment upon what is done both in terms of praise and in terms of criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i did not express myself very clearly <e> <s> it was the united kingdom which did not have a statute and therefore we had to rely on the house of lords to interpret i was submitting erroneously the law <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has not been to the courts that i am thinking of <e> <s> the public are the people of the village and they take a most serious interest and a useful participation in the affairs of the village and the decisions of the court <e>", "<cs> first briefly i should like to apologise to the committee for not being present to move amendments which were down in my name and i should like to thank my noble and learned friend lord gardiner for moving one of them <e> <s> i certainly do not intend to abuse my position by making the speech that i would have made on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i feel very heartened by the debate which has taken place on this amendment <e> <s> i should first like to thank all noble lords who spoke from this side of the committee for their warm and distinguished support of this amendment <e> <s> i am heartened also that nobody has raised technical problems or suggested that the amendment i propose would not cure the serious state of affairs which those who have supported this amendment believe exists <e>", "<cs> i was one of those who criticised clause on second reading <e> <s> but like i think the noble lord lord renton i decided that it was preferable to raise points at this stage on the question whether the clause shall stand part rather than put forward any specific amendments <e> <s> on reflection the worries that i have about the clause as it stands can be allayed if the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor were able to give some indication of the sort of circumstances in which he thinks that trial judges ought to or would or would be likely to give their leave for tape recorders to be used <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the assurance that there will be another look and i hope that when it is given it will be remembered that when we come to the magistrates courts we are dealing with a much wider range of dispensers of justice many more of them we are dealing with laymen and dealing with laymen who are having to deal on the whole with more controversial issues than come before the normally quiet county courts <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say one or two things in reply <e> <s> first i do not think that the lord chancellors answer took account of the concern which we feel about the breadth of this power <e> <s> he thought that i had taken a bad point about the absence of the words substantial and serious <e> <s> but look at the wording of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton <e> <s> surely we should be able to decide today on the principle <e> <s> we want there to be in the bill a list of the courts and the tribunals which are covered and therefore to know which courts and tribunals are not covered <e> <s> of course we can all think of some tribunals for which a case might be made for adding them to the noble and learned lords list but surely that should not prevent us from deciding the matter in principle <e> <s> if at a later stage either before the bill leaves this house or in another place the government want to perfect the list if it has imperfections that can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought he had said that but i did not have the benefit of an exact transcript so i did not put that bit in <e> <s> in view of that i think it is necessary to say that the discussion of this issue in your lordships committee did not offend against the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may seek to clear myself and also put the record straight because i think that i was somewhat misquoted out of context <e> <s> what i said was this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to clutter up the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only because it is a small matter of fact about which i had taken pains to find out <e> <s> although the matter is not made the subject of any formal finding by the court of appeal i am satisfied from talking with counsel in the case and others that in fact the documents were read out and she did not hand them over she let him read those parts which had been read out <e> <s> i certainly approach it on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer some of the points that have been made <e> <s> first of all on the point which i think we need to be clear on although it is not very relevant the question of the funds of miss harman <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the undertaking which the noble and learned lord has given <e> <s> i hope the time sequence is such that this matter can be <e>", "<cs> my lords the peoples of southern africa will i know be very grateful to my noble friend lord hatch for by his question drawing attention to one area of government policy and one element of what the governments responsibilities should be at what is a critical period in the history of southern africa <e> <s> we hold this debate within two months of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the devastating events of this past weekend were foreshadowed as recently as january this year in a very full report of an unofficial inquiry headed by mr david turner-samuels qc <e> <s> bringing to light case after case of intimidation and harassment of black people in brixton by members of the police leading to the most profound alienation and distrust <e> <s> quite apart from the setting up of the inquiry which i welcome i should like to ask the noble lord has any action been taken and will any action be taken to change the attitudes and the methods of work of the police including the special patrol group in the light of this valuable report <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the fact that i was not able to be present for the start of the debate and to hear the introduction given by the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> like the noble lord lord avebury i wholeheartedly endorse and applaud the repeal of the sus law <e> <s> but in considering the nature of the offences that are proposed to be put in its place i feel that we must be very clear about what was the reason for the widespread agitation over and call for the repeal of that law which has grown up over the last decade <e> <s> i considered that the noble lord lord wigoder was absolutely correct in his analysis of the law <e> <s> it is not true to say that people could be lawfully arrested under the sus law merely for behaving suspiciously <e> <s> there had to be evidence of a number of guilty acts in order for a conviction to be obtained <e> <s> the difficulty was and the reason for the agitation was that the law was being abused that prosecutions were being brought by police officers on an alleged basis of true fact which turned out to be totally false <e> <s> there is really overwhelming evidence that that was being done and what is more being done in a racially disciminatory way <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that when i make these assertions they are no doubt attacked because i am believed not to be reliable in my assessments or observations <e> <s> that is why when this matter was debated in this house on the bill of the noble lord lord avebury i took great pains to go to the sources on which i made that particular statement <e> <s> i do not want to weary the house with a repetition the matter is reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope so and i look forward with interest to the answer to that question that will be given either today or at committee stage when we come to consider this <e> <s> but certainly the legal studies into this provision that i have been informed about give me cause for concern that one could have the need for the same campaign against the new attempt provisions as has been mounted against the sus law <e>", "<cs> my lords i would accept that clause merely restates the existing law <e> <s> but it is clause which introduces a new element <e> <s> it was the dangers of that to which i was calling attention <e> <s> that provision and the implications of it we will have to look at more in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who have never had occasion to doubt our british citizenship i think must take a leap of the imagination in order to put ourselves into the shoes of those who are affected by this bill <e> <s> then we might understand how fundamental are the questions which it raises <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate the bishop of truro said the central question is whether people belong to this country and should therefore be treated as its citizens <e> <s> the refusal of citizenship is a statement that you do not belong that you are alien that you are not accepted <e> <s> the grant of citizenship is a declaration that you are part of the british community <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i regret the brevity of that answer may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor these supplementary questions first of all will he generally confirm that the work of neighbourhood law centres which has been praised by the benson commission is all the more essential in these days of recession <e> <s> secondly in relation to these two urban centres in cardiff and birmingham will the noble and learned lord confirm that they have been offered grant aid by his department on a level that is bound to mean for example that the salary for an experienced lawyer would be less than and absurdly low <e> <s> finally irrespective <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble and learned lord accept that the reason for that is that their staffs are being paid ridiculously low wages and as the main provider for those centres is he not responsible for that state of affairs <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble viscount will be glad to hear that both in the next amendment and in amendments standing in my name through the marshalled list i am seeking to delete the words if the secretary of state is satisfied wherever they occur <e> <s> but i shall not add to my speech on that until i move the next amendment <e>", "<cs> it is a point which is slightly technical and on which lawyers have to tread very carefully <e> <s> of course i shall be awaiting and reading very carefully the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate but i am assuming that whatever procedural form the case may take the principles that will be applied will be the principles that have been applied in the similar jurisdiction of immigration which the house of lords has had to consider very recently in the case of <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for that indication and i am also grateful to the noble viscount lord colville of culross for his very pertinent contribution to this little debate <e> <s> before seeking leave to withdraw the amendment i wish to put it clearly before the committee that i am not satisfied that the case which i put in support of this amendment has been met by the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> i wish to follow the noble lord lord drumalbyn in underlining the difference between the provisions of clause and the provisions of clause and to support very strongly the widening of clause which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter proposes <e> <s> it is not just a question of having to apply within months to get within clause it is not just a question of having to comply with the various conditions set out in clause although they are difficult or unclear enough <e> <s> the prospective employee in overseas employment has to weigh up whether the job that he is doing involves a close connection with the united kingdom whatever that means he has to weigh up whether he has been two years in relevant employment and he has to weigh up unless the bill is changed in the way that i earlier proposed whether he will be able to satisfy the secretary of state that all these conditions apply <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord trefgarne could turn his attention to the point which has now been raised both by the noble lord lord avebury and by myself that is to say that the people who will obtain citizenship through registration under clause which is the avenue which he recommends for employees of the eec and of other organisations in the list of the noble lord lord avebury will have an inferior citizenship to the citizenship which is obtained under clause <e>", "<cs> in the light of that reply i want to create unity in the committee and not increase division <e> <s> regardless of whether the noble lord lord renton is right or wrong we all agree that people who are aggrieved by decisions of the secretary of state whether those people be few or many should have the right to have their entitlement tested in a court of law <e> <s> i add only this point <e> <s> the courts of law are very reluctant to review administrative decisions <e> <s> i mention that because it might help the noble and learned lord in his consideration of the matter <e> <s> there might be needed a clause that actually states that a person aggrieved by a refusal of registration shall be entitled to apply to the high court for a declaration and the court should grant the declaration if it considers that the requirements are satisfied <e> <s> some such clause might be needed so as to give this matter the clarity which we all wish it to have <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord geddes in this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that there are going to be all kinds of employment which are covered by the term relevant employment which will not involve a particularly close connection with the united kingdom <e> <s> for a start one thinks of many employments with international organisations to work in foreign countries <e> <s> it may be the food and agricultural organisation or the world health organisation which work wholly for the benefit and assistance of another country but which do not have a particularly close connection with the united kingdom <e> <s> so also possibly with employment with subsidiaries which are not wholly owned by british companies such as was raised by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> surely the nature of the foreign employment is not particularly relevant <e> <s> what is relevant is that people who go to <e>", "<cs> while taking up a point just made by the noble and learned lord i will not go back to the concession he has kindly made about the satisfied formula but he indicated that the thinks fit formula which confers a pure discretion might be challenged on the unreasonableness ground <e> <s> that cannot be right if clause stays intact and perhaps the noble and learned lord would confirm that clause is one of the discretions which would be caught by clause that is the discretion about which if it were exercised against the applicant the secretary of state would not have to give any reasons and would not be subject to any kind of appeal or review <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by the noble baroness which i think raises a lot of important considerations <e> <s> regarding clause this is the first time we have been able directly to consider clause and it is a very important clause <e> <s> it is going to be the main avenue by which people who have been born abroad and married abroad and who want to come back and bring their family back to britain will be able to register their children as full british citizens <e> <s> it is not i suggest in perfect form and the amendment raises the main defect in it <e>", "<cs> i do not want to spend time on the various small differences which exist between some noble lords on this side of the committee as to exactly what criteria should be included in a provision and exactly what form of appeal should be provided for on a refusal of naturalisation <e> <s> there is an overriding point of principle raised in all these amendments to which the noble lord lord belstead has not addressed himself and that is the fact that a refusal by the secretary of state exercising his discretion and not giving reasons of citizenship to somebody who believes himself to be closely and loyally attached to this country engenders a sense of outrage and injustice and a sense of impotence in that they cannot even challenge the decision in any kind of forum <e> <s> if they appeal to a member of parliament to take up the case politically the mp can do no more than write with whatever endorsements of the applicant the mp can give perhaps only to be greeted with the reply having looked at it very carefully i am satisfied that the right decision has been made and nothing more can be done <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble duke one question <e> <s> is not the logic of what he has just said that one would not allow any appeal to the courts against any executive act because they all acted so fairly so wonderfully <e> <s> whether they are fair in many cases or in all or in a few that is not an argument is it against a right of appeal <e>", "<cs> in considering this amendment we have to review the history of our treatment of a group <e>", "<cs> the countries in which they

the people who are being considered in this amendment do not have close links with this country <e> <s> are these not people who have in the first place opted for british citizenship many years ago <e> <s> secondly they have waited for years in the queue to come here and endured enormous strains and hardships in order to settle in the country of their citizenship <e> <s> really when one thinks of the people involved i ask the noble lord lord belstead to reconsider what he has said about a category of people of whom i should have thought over per cent <e> <s> have shown that they have close and surprisingly loyal links with this country in view of the way they have been treated <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of the noble baroness and i very much look forward to <e>", "<cs> has not the noble lord lord avebury in moving amendment no <e> <s> a drawn attention to a real gap in the scheme of citizenships which the bill proposes <e> <s> the british overseas citizens are as i understand it to be some kind of temporary category of citizens who will either come here and become british citizens or will not come here and will become or their children will become local citizens in their own countries <e> <s> therefore a very limited provision has been put into the bill for transmission to their children <e> <s> is the difficulty not that whereas that may be true of the majority some british overseas citizens will not come here and will not be able to transmit to their children some local citizenship <e>", "<cs> before seeking leave to withdraw the amendment which is what i intend to do may i ask the noble lord lord belstead to construe the words i read out in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i urge the minister to look again to see if it is a happily worded phrase because after multiple reading i did not understand it to mean what the noble lord said it meant <e> <s> i shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment because as the minister explained it would not achieve its purpose namely to provide that the children concerned attain at least some status for citizenship even if as the noble lord lord avebury points out it may be an inferior status and create serious problems <e>", "<cs> this is a very complex area <e> <s> i had assumed that the scheme in sub-paragraph was the same as the scheme in sub-paragraph and that therefore the arguments for my amendments and the replies of the government were much the same <e> <s> however the noble lord lord avebury has raised points which i should like to study in more detail before leaving the whole topic raised in this part of the bill <e> <s> i shall read what has been said and unless there is a particular reply which can be given to the points raised by lord avebury now i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting debate and i am particularly grateful to my noble friend lady birk for reminding the committee in her eloquent speech of the nature of the human problem this amendment is trying to meet the awfulness of being without citizenship without a nationality without a country of protection <e> <s> the people who are to be protected by this amendment if passed are by definition within that limbo that she tried to describe <e> <s> i was also grateful to the noble baroness lady elles for making two points very clearly <e> <s> she first reminded us of the basic principle which lies behind the united nations convention on the reduction of statelessness namely that there should be no statelessness and that it should be the responsibility of the country of birth in the last resort to see that that happens <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may add to the noble lords troubles and ask him whether he could give us some indication even in general terms of the governments answer to an enormously important point that was raised by the noble baroness lady elles which is relevant i think to the committees consideration of schedule and in particular this paragraph of it <e> <s> is it right that there will have to be and there will be new immigration rules to deal with the stateless children of british citizens abroad <e> <s> one would imagine and one would hope that at any rate up to the age of majority the stateless children of british citizens would be able without any impediment at all to come back to this country in order among other things to establish residence requirements to enable them to be registered as citizens <e>", "<cs> my feeling at the end of this debate is that we are by no means at the end of our consideration of the children of british citizens born abroad who will be stateless unless they can establish an entitlement under one or other of the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i was particularly disappointed to hear that last reply that we shall not know what if any new immigration rules there are going to be until the bill has passed from this house <e> <s> that seems to me to mean that the rules will be unchanged <e> <s> in the light of all that has been said and the very helpful comments made on all sides of the committee i should like to consider carefully whether this provision as it stands in the bill is good enough or whether as i tend to think it is going to land a lot of families in a terrible mess placing them between two stools as it were by allowing them citizenship only if they can get past the immigration hurdles which as the noble lord lord avebury says in a great many cases are not going to allow them to come here <e> <s> having said that this is something that must be reconsidered i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving a certain amount of reassurance about the operation of this provision <e> <s> i should have thought that the two people who were in the pay of the czech government probably made a false representation when they swore the oath of allegiance <e> <s> leaving that aside while thinking that this form of words is not necessary i accept and welcome the statement which has been made about the extreme circumstances in which it is intended that it should operate <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i press the noble and learned lord a little further particularly with regard to the third provision of imprisonment <e> <s> does he not recognise that there is a certain absurdity in the fact that a good character and a record clear of previous convictions is of no relevance at all to someone who is applying <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely convinced <e> <s> naturalisation is quite another matter which depends on a good character requirement <e> <s> that is the big difference and that is no doubt why the act did not apply to registered citizens the same provisions as we are now considering <e> <s> i should like to be able to look at this again and to come back to it if i feel that it is of sufficient importance as i think it may well be to raise again <e> <s> but for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support the amendment that has been moved and point out that i think it raises a very important point which has become of great concern following a recent decision of the court of appeal in a case called <e>", "<cs> clause introduces a panoply of regulation-making powers and although theoretically those regulations can be reviewed by parliament in practice they never are <e> <s> i wonder if i may as i indicated briefly to the noble lord lord belstead that i would ask one or two questions which appear to me to arise from some of these regulations <e> <s> the first arises on the power in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble lord lord carrington is not here to answer the <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support what has been said by referring to the sense of bitterness which arises when somebody believes that he has been discriminated against for reasons of race or colour or religion reasons over which in the case of race or colour he has no control and in the case of religion should not be expected to play any part in the decision <e> <s> when one is faced with a complaint of discrimination in other fields we now have a law which enables advisers to investigate whether there is evidence <e> <s> i certainly have had experience of investigating allegations of discrimination against government departments <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord pitt has drawn our attention i think really for the third time in this committee stage to the inadequacy of the appellate provisions of the bill and although the government have said that they are going to look again at the appellate procedures so far as an entitlement is concerned i think they have been very firm in resisting any kind of appellate review where discretion is concerned and i am bound to say to the noble viscount lord colville that i would much prefer even the limited review of order no <e> <s> to no review at all which is the proposal in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords when this bill becomes law the people who will have to deal with the hard cases which are going to have to be looked at under it are the advice agencies the lawyers and the members of parliament to whom cases will be brought <e> <s> some of us already have experience of dealing with hard cases in this branch of the law under the immigration act <e> <s> again and again under that act cases have come up of manifest unfairness where one asks oneself why didnt they do something about it <e> <s> or why didnt we do something about it while the bill was passing through parliament <e> <s> they are not matters which arouse any great question of policy and this amendment touches upon that kind of case <e>", "<cs> it happens very occasionally that babies are born at heathrow but the number of times when it will happen in one of the rare cases of stateless children is once a decade or once a century <e> <s> probably per cent <e> <s> of the citizens of the world are able to transmit their citizenship to their children whether they are born in one country or another because most countries have some form of <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first of a few happy moments that we are to have in the course of the report stage where we welcome amendments put <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself very troubled by the speech of my noble friend lord pitt and i think we must ask the noble lord lord belstead to give a very clear answer as to whether the noble lord lord pitt has made a right analysis because if the analysis of my noble friend is right and i am inclined to think that it is then we have not got this provision right and the governments amendment does not get it right <e> <s> there is no question of principle that divides the house on this but we must make sure that all those who are entitled to register whether they be adults or minors have a proper opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies i should like to follow the contribution of the noble baroness who has made a very constructive proposal <e> <s> there are two points which are raised on this amendment <e> <s> the one which is superficially raised is whether the period of entitlement should be five years or eight years and of course one appreciates the reply on that point by the minister that five years is considered by the government and i think indeed that it has been voted on by the house as the right period and we should not extend it to eight years much as we should like to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i would support what my noble friend has said and add this <e> <s> if a discretionary power is being given it does not help to fetter it by some statutory rule which excludes certain categories of people <e> <s> it may well be that in principle that is how the secretary of state would proceed but let us keep the discretion general and then in the sort of hard cases which various noble lords have mentioned in the case of people who are now children the discretion could be exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords who are not members of the legal profession could be forgiven for wondering what the problem is that has been raised by the noble viscount lord colville <e> <s> i hasten to say entirely in his support that there is a problem and it is one that needs an answer <e> <s> of course if language means what it ought to mean we should by now have made this clear <e> <s> we have after all deleted from this bill all reference to the phrase if the secretary of state is satisfied and so when someone is entitled to something under this bill one would think as the government indeed have promised us that the aggrieved person who has been refused and thinks he has been wrongly refused could go straight to court <e> <s> i hope that is right but i am afraid i cannot be sure and i cannot be confident that the judiciary who are very relucant to review the exercise of administrative decision making will see it the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add to the debate only my feeling that the government in their opposition to the amendment which we passed have lost all touch with reality <e> <s> if the amendment which we passed can stay in this bill there really will not be any kind of embarrassment for governments by claims being brought which have no merit in them <e> <s> it is possible at the moment to bring an action against a minister who has made a discretionary decision and it is possible to bring it if that decision has been made on discriminatory grounds in most areas of the law but it is very very difficult indeed to obtain proof or to mount such an action unless there are very solid grounds for the allegations which are being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel angry tonight not only at the content of the measure that is before us but at the means which is being used to put it through <e> <s> this is an order being put through at the fag end of a parliamentary session in a virtually empty house with no possibility of our being able to amend it with very little notice and precious little opportunity for public debate <e> <s> the content of the measure that we are debating is in practical terms in the nature of its effect nothing less than the effective de-control of rents in the private rented sector outside london <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord address himself to the point i made <e> <s> which is that the empty properties that he is talking about are not the house which is free for a year but properties which the owners desire to let as a business at the highest rent they can over a substantial period <e> <s> is that not why the fear of non-renewal is a real one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin with an apology to the noble lord lord belstead and to the house because i shall not be able to stay to hear his reply to the debate <e> <s> with a lot of regret i have to put in a dissent to the general expressions of praise which have greeted the publication of the report of the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord knows i followed the inquiry very closely and i was well aware of the good impressions that were created in many quarters about the noble lords handling of the inquiry <e> <s> i am all the more deeply disappointed by the report as it has come out <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is introduced at a time when there is unprecedented public disquiet being expressed about the workings of the legal aid scheme generally <e> <s> the law society in their recent annual report expressed themselves in terms very unlike the normal mild tone of that body <e> <s> they said referring to the whole of legal aid both civil and criminal <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i do so as noble lords will know as someone who as chairman of the legal action group has been much exercised with this question of how the consumer interest in the provision of legal services can be taken care of <e> <s> it is very difficult particularly in the criminal courts because there are no convenient associations or unions of defendants in those courts so that there is all the more need to ensure that those agencies which are involved in the supply of legal services should be accountable not just to lawyers committees but to committees in which lay people are involved <e> <s> this is particularly so with the duty solicitors scheme <e> <s> in a great number of courts the duty solicitors schemes have been a very valuable innovation providing access to solicitors for those who have no solicitor who may have been arrested overnight in police stations and who come to court quite bewildered <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for what the noble and learned lord has said and i certainly do not intend to press this amendment <e> <s> the matter has been raised and has been met with very clear replies and assurances by the lord chancellor <e> <s> i hope that the work which he reports as being in progress can be brought to its <e>", "<cs> i am very heartened by the words of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i wonder if he will also keep in his thoughts a suggestion which i made on second reading that we could bring the legal aid committees into this process <e> <s> they are in clause already given certain functions with regard to criminal legal aid where for instance there is a change of counsel a change of solicitor or representation by two counsel <e> <s> they have a lot of experience not least from the lawyers point of view of knowing what sort of cases can benefit from legal aid <e> <s> they could deal very easily with the questions which arise on means <e> <s> like other noble lords i believe the important thing is to attain some form of appeal or recourse and i for one would not wish to insist upon a particular court or forum <e>", "<cs> i think that for the first time as the noble and learned lord has said we find ourselves entering into disagreement about what is the best way to pass or amend this bill <e> <s> i am certainly not happy with the noble and learned lords reply <e> <s> the fact is that those who are in receipt of legal aid are not in the same position and can never be in the same position as those who have enough means to take them way over the limits <e> <s> the one are well-off and the other are not well-off <e> <s> the requirement to pay represents a very substantial consideration as to whether they should be represented at all <e>", "<cs> before accepting that invitation which of course i do i should like to ask the noble and learned lord a question which he may be able to answer now or if not perhaps on report <e> <s> can he give us some more guidance as to what is intended as regards the regulations for the fixing of the disposable income and the disposable capital <e> <s> i had imagined and i may be in error that the same rates would be used as apply to the civil legal aid scheme <e> <s> is that necessarily so <e> <s> if it is not so and the rates can be different from those in the civil legal aid scheme will they perhaps be more generous than those in the civil legal aid scheme <e> <s> for instance perhaps a lower fraction and this may be dealt with in another amendment of the disposable income can be ordered to be paid <e> <s> generally before this bill leaves this house i think that we should have a clearer indication than we have at the moment as to whether the criminal scheme will operate on quite a different system of rates which of course could be very confusing or whether it is intended to harmonise the two <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful <e> <s> as to the general reply on this amendment i would only want to make one comment <e> <s> there may as the noble and learned lord says be a case for making people whose capital is above the present legal aid limit but below the supplementary benefit limit have to pay for their legal aid but in criminal cases it would i suggest be a poor case and i am glad that it does not look as though it is going to be one that the noble and learned lord ultimately is going to press <e> <s> i am grateful for his reply and i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene with the greatest hesitation because i am an expert neither in canadian affairs or in constitutional law <e> <s> i intervene only because of the conviction in my heart that the passage of this bill is likely to be calamitous to the future welfare of the indigenous people of canada that we have an obligation to say and do what we can during the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the advice which the minister has given apply not to amendments which <e>", "<cs> my first and least pleasant task at the end of this excellent debate is to answer the extraordinary attack made by the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson on those who had conduct of the case against the home office out of which the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for that further assurance that this matter is well and truly on the discussion table <e> <s> i certainly do not wish to press the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basic principles there is no difference between the noble and learned lord and myself <e> <s> nothing in the amendment strikes at the principle that persons with means should contribute to their defence <e> <s> equally nothing in it strikes at the idea that in a proper case a substantial down payment should be ordered by the court <e> <s> but the amendment would introduce a flexibility where the bill introduces total rigidity in what has to be paid and at what time <e> <s> it is sad that i am not making any inroads into the noble and learned lords thinking <e> <s> i do not think there would be any point in returning to the matter on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving half a loaf in the amendment and accepting that those in receipt of supplementary benefit and family income supplement should not have to pay out of their disposable income for legal aid <e> <s> i see that there are difficulties in the way of extending that to capital but there is an anomaly and i am thinking particularly of the supplementary benefit regulations <e> <s> somebody with up to in capital <e>", "<cs> i have a point to raise on clause of this short bill <e> <s> the bill gives the right to the public to attend planning inquiries and to inspect the documents which are presented in evidence to them <e> <s> i wholcheatedly support that measure <e> <s> the point i want to raise arises out of this <e> <s> the effect of the noble lords bill would i think be limited if after the public were allowed to hear the evidence and inspect the documents they were not allowed to be acquainted with the decision which is made at the end of the inquiry by the secretary of state concerned and of the reasons for it <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl and i am sure his assurance will be of value to all those who wish to follow public inquiries and who have from time to time although only in rare cases been thwarted in their desire to know the reasons for the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the countries in which the rapid deployment force will be stationed morocco which is far from being a free country but one of the most reactionary kingdoms in the world <e> <s> does that make sense of the ministers reply that this is there to defend freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology for devoting my speech tonight to southern africa-southern africa where there has been building up over the years a confrontation between the forces of apartheid and the forces of those who wish to win or who wish to retain their freedom <e> <s> at the heart of that confrontation at the moment is angola where i have recently been travelling a country which is far too little visited and too little known <e> <s> in relation to southern africa there are features which are perhaps unlike other zones of conflict around the world <e> <s> in the first place the united kingdom has a very direct responsibility for the future of southern africa <e> <s> we are one of the five members of the contact group which is seeking to negotiate the implementation of the united nations resolution for the independence of namibia we are a major trading partner of south africa itself and we are much more closely involved than we are in many other theatres of war <e>", "<cs> my lords i should dearly have liked to debate with the noble baroness lady cox her very carefully thought-out speech on educational policy but at this time of night i must stick to the areas which i had mapped out for myself areas which feature in the gracious speech on the powers of the police and on the powers of local government <e> <s> they are areas in which one can discern the philosophy of the new government as they start their first year of office areas where one can seek to distinguish between some of the myths upon which they got themselves elected to government and the realities which they are now seeking to put into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i was not present to hear the opening speeches of this debate and because i was not i will make my speech short <e> <s> i wanted to express my feelings of opposition and concern that if this bill together with the police and criminal evidence bill in its present form are passed through parliament during this year then together that will represent a victory for the most authoritarian elements in our society <e> <s> what started as being a temporary emergency measure has become as such measures so often do become something permanent and normal with now the legislation being renewed with little essential change in its most objectionable features <e> <s> the more it becomes entrenched and the more it becomes used the closer we become to abdicating the rule of law in matters of individual liberty and giving power to the executive <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty with legislation of this kind is that more and more law-abiding people get sucked into detention under this <e> <s> when criminals are suspected of being guilty of offences the law has and always has had a full measure of authority to arrest them to charge them and to bring them to trial <e>", "<cs> as i understand the amendment it is contemplating the introduction of a new subsection which will fit between and of the bill as it stands <e> <s> the amendment refers us back to a consent of the secretary of state pursuant to section <e>", "<cs> the experience that i have had indicates that this question of plain clothes officers intervening to stop and search or to arrest people in the street is productive of an enormous amount of misunderstanding and conflict <e> <s> it is not easy immediately to make oneself known convincingly as a policeman <e> <s> one can produce or flash a warrant card <e> <s> one may or may not be believed and may or may not be understood <e> <s> it is not just the person who is the object of the stop who may fear that he is being stopped not by an officer of the law but by one or as it often is two or three people who are out for no good at all who are footpads or thugs it is other peoplewho may pass by <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> it would still seem to me to be quite sufficient to have the power to detain the driver in order to stop him from driving away the vehicle <e> <s> but the noble lord has referred to a number of provisions and cases which i shall be happy to look up and study and for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in support of this amendment may i seek to point out that there seems to be a gap in the provisions of the bill at this stage <e> <s> the bill says that the article may be seized <e> <s> absolutely nothing is said thereafter as to what should be done with the article once it is seized <e> <s> this stands in marked contrast to the provisions of clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> yes i have and i should like to speak shortly but separately on the other question of articles which have to do with theft <e>", "<cs> this has been a serious debate conducted seriously by everyone who has spoken <e> <s> i hope i made it clear and i say this particularly in answer to the noble lord lord inglewood when i moved this amendment that i did not do so in ignorance of the real fears that people who have been or may be attacked in the street live under <e> <s> nor do i move it and i say this about any amendment that i move in any spirit of being anti-police <e> <s> i am only anti-laws which give the licence to irresponsible or bad police to abuse them unless there are safeguards <e>", "<cs> i wish i could be so reassured <e> <s> what is needed is not a change in the written terms of the law it is a change of attitude on the part of those who enforce such laws as there are <e> <s> i accept that that change of attitude may be effected by a code of practice which reflects the consensus of opinion as to how these powers should be used and that is why i am so anxious that all the codes of practice should be before us <e> <s> it is not enough just to change the law and produce the paper safeguards it needs a change of attitude <e> <s> having made that plea and that point i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that further clarification <e> <s> this again seems to be a new power which needs to be justified and i wish to beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord the minister will agree to look again at the concerns which are being raised <e> <s> this is one example of a characteristic of the bill which we see in a number of places <e> <s> the bill confers a safeguard in that a constable shall make a record of the search in writing and then immediately the safeguard is qualified in such general terms that it leaves the door open for it to be ignored altogether in a vast number of cases <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be convenient for me to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time as we discuss the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and serve merely to insert two further requirements into the same duty to leave a notice behind when an unattended vehicle has been searched <e>", "<cs> i very much want to support what the noble lord the minister said about the approach of the government on this clause although to enter one <e>", "<cs> when we come to consider serious arrestable offences we are going to the heart of one of the governments justifications for their bill which is that it contains safeguards in the case of the powers often very extreme ones which are given to the police <e> <s> in due course we shall come to debate those powers and i do not want to trespass upon that debate but we know it is going to be said again and again when we come to the powers which my noble friend has enumerated do not worry that these clauses give the police considerable power <e> <s> there are safeguards <e> <s> the powers can only be exercised in the case of serious arrestable offences <e>", "<cs> do i understand that the minister is closing his mind to any reconsideration of the inclusion of paragraph <e> <s> it is a matter which has caused the greatest concern among homosexual men and the organisations which represent them <e> <s> they fear and it would seem with substance that their lot which is already an unenviable one because there are many police forces which pay a disproportionate amount of attention to crimes involving homosexuals will be to be classified in the category of suspected serious offenders <e> <s> let us remember that it is not a question of proving the offence but a question of whether someone is suspected of a serious offence and then all these provisions bite <e> <s> we will have persons suspected of having committed or attempting to

should like to say how much i welcome the introduction of a code of practice <e> <s> for the moment i do not take up the point exactly what form it should be but i welcome in principle that there will be such a code <e> <s> i should like to renew the plea that i made on the last committee day that a first draft at least of that code might be with us before we leave our consideration of this bill <e>", "<cs> i intervene to say and to put on record that i am not reassured <e> <s> my hope is that when the code is being considered the question will not be asked certainly as a matter of routine because it is the asking of the question which is offensive <e> <s> most people will not know that they are not required to answer it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and when we come to an amendment that i intend to move which deals with the police being able to stop people selected by any criterion at all i will take up his point <e> <s> when we find out what circumstances the bill envisages for the exercise of this power our confusion and worry grows because in clause <e>", "<cs> i am anxious to be constructive in this debate which deals with an area of law which is confusing to many of us <e> <s> speaking for myself i am not sure that the confusion about the existing law has been dispersed by what the minister said <e> <s> he said that this clause is not so much granting new powers to the police as restricting the unrestricted power which the police now have <e> <s> i find that difficult to accept in view of the wording of clause which states <e>", "<cs> i am following carefully what the minister says and i expect he will further enlighten us when we come to the amendment to delete clause and we might find out a little more about the other powers to be preserved intact <e> <s> however i still have this confusion <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton said that at the moment there is an unrestricted power to stop vehicles for reasons pursuant to the road traffic act <e> <s> but i do not understand that to be an untrammelled power to stop any vehicles for any purposes <e> <s> according to the royal commissions statement of the law paragraph the existing law is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i am not making myself clear but the noble lord is not meeting the point that i seek to make <e> <s> the point that i seek to make is that what is being given in this bill is too wide a power <e> <s> if it even risks being too wide a power one must see whether there are in fact other powers which deal with the evils which are being contemplated <e> <s> the gang of hooligans that the noble baroness lady trumpington described had undoubtedly committed or will be suspected of having committed conspiracies to contravene breaches of public order <e> <s> so far as the turkey rustlers are concerned they will be squarely within clause <e>", "<cs> i too would wish to wait and see what happens with regard to amendments nos <e> <s> and and to that part of the bill before finally asking for any view to be taken about this part of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave well i will not beg leave quite yet <e>", "<cs> i understand that and i have not taken anything that the noble lord has said as any undertaking or assurance <e> <s> however i want to know what is the final form of this clause before commenting in the committee on how acceptable it is <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord the minister will continue <e> <s> if what he says is right and it is that would be a reasonable criterion for stopping the man

committed or has been committed <e> <s> it may be as clear as day that there is a serious arrestable criminal in the vicinity but we need to extend the criterion of reasonableness to the judgment of who is stopped <e> <s> i fail to see so far why that should not be done <e> <s> there is no harm in it <e> <s> it would give that protection and provide an answer to anyone who chooses to complain

controversy in the debate <e> <s> i have so far accepted the integrity of the noble lord lord elton in seeking by this bill to redress the grievances which gave rise to the brixton disorders and which are monitored in the psi report <e> <s> it is totally in that spirit that i move the amendment <e> <s> in asking the committee to accept that the requirement of reasonableness adds something to the bill and adds something that it needs i go no further than to repeat a couple of quotations from the psi report which indicate how some officers select whom to stop <e> <s> it is the criterion of whom to stop that we are dealing with <e>", "<cs> that raises entire questions of whether the disciplinary code is enough <e> <s> i want the complainant to be able to have a redress if the criterion for his being stopped was unreasonable if he was stopped let us say because these are the examples i have given on a racist criterion <e> <s> the amendment is to clause which provides that the power to stop vehicles can be exercised for the purposes of this clause in such a way as to stop either all vehicles one accepts that this may be necessary in some cases or vehicles selected by any criteria <e> <s> all that i seek to do is to insert reasonable into those criteria <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord tells me that my amendment is defective then i feel that it is my duty to find out why although at the moment i am bound to say that i cannot see why the bill should not contain a clause or a limitation on the power to select what vehicles to stop which imports a requirement of reasonableness <e> <s> nothing that the noble lord has said has indicated to me that he is prepared to allow that criterion of reasonableness <e> <s> we shall come back to this matter <e> <s> i shall find out whether this amendment is defective and if it is i shall put an effective one down at the report stage <e> <s> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press this matter but i am anxious to know how these powers which are now more closely defined will be exercised <e> <s> will there be any guidelines short of a code of practice as to how the public will be addressed or is it to be left completely to the discretion of the police constable exercising the stop <e> <s> a check implies that there is going to be some communication between the police officer and the driver <e> <s> one would have thought that there ought to be in normal circumstances some explanation given to the member of the public <e> <s> i am wondering whether any kind of guidelines even if there is not going to be a code will be applied to this power <e>", "<cs> one would have to see how this operates <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i will consider carefully what the noble lord has said but before i withdraw my amendment which i intend to do i wonder whether he could help me about one matter and if he cannot help me immediately he may be able to help me by writing <e> <s> if someone is stopped by a police officer and is searched and in the course of the proceedings whether at the time of the stop or at the time of the search or at some time a little later there is some obstruction and the suspect is finally arrested for obstructing the police and not for anything which is found on him let us say that nothing is found on him would that be an arrest in consequence of the search <e> <s> it may be that my fears can be allayed by being informed that it would not be an arrest in consequence of the search but would be an arrest in consequence of the behaviour of the individual <e> <s> if that were the case it might be that the bill as it stands would provide for the information that we want <e>", "<cs> i quite understand that and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have also heard of cases where solicitors have had the greatest difficulty in finding out on behalf of their clients what has been seized after a search warrant has been executed <e> <s> i accept that there may be the need for a middle way here that there may be an exception permitted in the case of very voluminous documents but i hope that the ministers consideration will take into account that in a normal case days should be quite enough and ought to be inserted in the legislation <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a short point on clause <e> <s> it is a valuable clause because it provides certain rights to those whose documents have been taken which they did not have previously that is to say it provides access to them and enables them to be photo-copied or photographed <e> <s> however in subsection the rights which have been given as happens in other parts of the bill are in danger of being taken away or rendered virtually useless by a very general provision that there is no duty to grant the rights if there are <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will even consider the giving of some general reasons <e> <s> there are certainly a number of cases where access might be refused without reasons and it would be very difficult to challenge <e> <s> if that could be considered that would be one way of meeting my concern <e>", "<cs> as regards controlled drugs i accept the position although i am concerned that the rights of the police are left so vague <e> <s> certainly so far as drugs and appeals are concerned i should have thought that it would be possible to include those purposes in the bill <e> <s> however i shall read what the noble lord has said and i hope that he too will seek to bring some certainty into these purposes at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for giving me the chance to ask one or two questions <e> <s> i accept that if a person has no address at all provision in the bill may have to be made but the noble lord has not i think addressed himself to the other consequences of the bill which the amendment does in fact seek to rectify <e> <s> if someone has a real address at let us say a local inn where he is staying as a tourist under the bill he could be arrested because it was not a satisfactory address for service <e> <s> first of all am i right in saying that that is so and that it is a new power given which does not exist at the moment <e> <s> under my amendment he could not be arrested because he gave his genuine address which is good enough under the existing law <e> <s> is there not a very radical departure under the bill which the royal commission did not recommend <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister explain to the committee whether or not i am right in saying that the bill does extend the law very considerably <e>", "<cs> the point is that there is a danger that police officers will pursue tourists particularly the not so well-to-do tourists over offences of this kind parking offences driving offences dropping litter or whatever it may be <e> <s> tourists will find themselves spending nights in the cells <e> <s> we deplore this happening in other countries where tourists are arrested for trivial offences concerning driving and so on <e> <s> it will happen here under this bill <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will appreciate our concern and agree to look again at the clause <e> <s> i am not saying that my amendment has it absolutely right the noble lord made a point about <e>", "<cs> not serious because all serious offences would either be arrestable under clause or they would come under the various important provisions in clause <e>", "<cs> that is the present position <e> <s> with great respect the noble lord is misleading the committee when talking about obstructing the highway <e> <s> obstruction of the highway is a ground for arrest under paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am upset that the noble lord does not seek at all to meet the point made by myself and by the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> we shall have to return to it at a later stage when i hope the noble lord the minister will look at it <e> <s> i accept the suggestion that there may be an improved way of meeting the point that i seek to make and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> as i understand it clause introduces a new power to have the fingerprints taken of anybody who has been convicted of certain offences which are described as recordable and no doubt the noble lord the minister will tell us what recordable offence is going to mean because under the bill it means only an offence to which regulations under this clause apply <e> <s> what worries me is the concept that the mere fact of being convicted for an offence is sufficient not only to allow the police to take your fingerprints but to allow them to arrest you if you refuse to go along and have your fingerprints taken <e>", "<cs> one can only welcome this amendment <e> <s> it introduces a flexibility into the procedure which was singularly lacking when the minister replied to the amendment of my noble friend lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> besides welcoming it i rise only to ask one question about this procedure and it may be that the noble lord will not be able to answer it immediately <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been good enough to say that i pointed out one matter in this long rigmarole which might be capable of improvement <e> <s> in view of everything which has been said i wonder whether the noble lord will not recognise that the whole thing is capable of improvement and needs looking at again and that the points raised should be returned to on report when the minister can tell us what his further views are <e>", "<cs> that is so <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady trumpington has made out a case based on convenience but with respect to her she has missed the point <e> <s> she says that new disciplines as to time are being imposed by the bill <e> <s> but the point is that far longer time is being asked for in this bill for the detention of suspects <e> <s> the government want hours we have not yet come to that <e> <s> under this provision someone can be detained for hours plus whatever time it is going to take to make these reasonable investigations <e> <s> two alternatives have been put forward from these benches <e> <s> to my mind the one that is put forward by my noble friend lord mishcon is the better one <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment in favour of his <e>", "<cs> there is a crisis of confidence in the police complaints system as it now operates and the central reason why people feel that there is no point in complaining about the police is because they do not feel there is any independence in the investigation <e> <s> i welcome the fact that the police federation as well feel <e>", "<cs> clause deals with a very important topic the need for the police to consult with people in a community <e> <s> but it deals with it in a way which is so vague so generalised that i fear that it will only count as a token gesture towards consultation and will really make very little difference at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i rise to welcome this amendment which i believe derives from a suggestion that i and my noble friends made in committee <e> <s> we hope that during the passage of the report stage of this bill we will contine to do as well as apparently we are starting off although seeing the later amendments i have to express some doubts <e> <s> still we welcome the progress we have made on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i at once wish <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may confirm what was said by my noble friend lord mishcon namely that having listened to the debate i shall not seek to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if your lordships accept amendment no <e> <s> i shall seek to move only amendments nos <e> <s> and which are purely consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> whether or not any limitation is required of the kind adumbrated in amendment no <e> <s> is a question that i shall not raise today but will consult upon in time for another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> i fear that the new power which as the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has said is being given by the clause will be a fearsome weapon for any police officer with which to harass people he <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> oa <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a justified riposte with the greatest respect to the noble and learned lord to suggest that those who put forward some decent basic minimum periods during which people could be held incommunicado are somehow on the side of criminals because that is what they propose <e> <s> we are on the side of decent standards and this bill in many respects is eroding them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too believe that this is a very important amendment and one that should be supported <e> <s> most of the amendments in this batch focus on specific cases where particular protection may be necessary and we will consider those in due course <e> <s> but above and beyond that we have to ask ourselves this question have we got the basic test right <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord denning has said it is a new test <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the answer to the noble and learned lords point that there would be nothing to prevent the interview taking place in those circumstances but we should want to stop the content of it being given in evidence when the person being interviewed was of such a character <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may question the noble and learned lord again is he not begging the question <e> <s> one does not know whether the confession is true and that is why we have to take such care <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> i do so briefly because of the hour but it is enormously important <e> <s> it was said by the minister during the committee stage that only the police are capable of conducting investigations into complaints against the police and that somehow nobody else has the expertise or the facilities <e> <s> i simply do not accept that <e> <s> the police complaints authority would have the task of conducting investigations and would have available to it and would recruit experienced investigators some of whom might have had experience in the police or the customs and excise or in other fields but it would be independent <e> <s> that is what the public particularly those who have had experience of complaining about the police and of having their complaints as they see it dismissed groundlessly without a sufficiently impartial investigation are asking for <e>", "<cs> my lords some three weeks ago i had a happy experience which is instructive in relation to this amendment <e> <s> i moved at the annual general meeting of the bar that racial discrimination by barristers should be a specific disciplinary offence <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i have listened with great care to what he has said about this matter having been discussed before <e> <s> can he tell the house what is wrong with the amendment proposed by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> what is objectionable about it and why could it not be perfectly operative and provide the safeguards which my noble and learned friend has indicated in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask your lordships to support these amendments in particular amendment no <e> <s> and to remember what really goes on inside police stations between police officers and suspects <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hutchinson said there is at present a principle enshrined in the judges rules which allows a suspect to see a solicitor <e> <s> it is subject to an exception if the officer believes that there will be unreasonable delay or hindrance to the process of investigation or the administration of justice which in an admittedly looser form is designed and was designed to prevent the kind of abuses which are envisaged in clause <e> <s> it was intended for rare cases <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps worth repeating in support of the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord scarman something that i said at report stage <e> <s> this question of racialism in professional bodies came up quite recently at a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord elton for the fullness of his answer <e> <s> he has recognised that there have been and legitimately still remain anxieties about the definition of this clause <e> <s> it troubles me that he is in effect saying that this is an approximation to some ideal definition but it is not an ideal definition and that there are alleged offences which could automatically be treated as serious according to the bill as now drafted which should not be so treated <e> <s> we shall have to watch it <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of these long debates how little of substance has been conceded by the government <e> <s> the bill came to us with new and increased powers of stop and search search of <e>", "<cs> my lords late in i was asked by the cobden trust to undertake a mission in northern ireland to inquire into the use of supergrasses in the province <e> <s> i went there and like my noble friend lord longford i was amazed at the breadth of opinion that wanted to come to me to speak of and speak their opposition to the use of supergrasses <e> <s> i met catholics and protestants <e> <s> i met many people who had nothing to do with and no truck with terrorism or terrorist offences <e> <s> i was received with the greatest courtesy by the lord chief justice the noble and learned lord lord lowry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that that man one must speak with caution because the trial is still pending is someone who received a life sentence for his five murders with no minimum term so he can hope to be released early by the authorities <e> <s> that is his incentive <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with enormous personal sadness to contribute to the plea which my noble and learned friend has made for action to keep law centres open <e> <s> i say enormous personal sadness because i was in at the birth of the law centre movement <e> <s> it started in which has not been long for a major new service to develop in our country <e> <s> in two things happened <e> <s> one was the publication of a very well-researched report published by a committee chaired by the then mr sam silkin who is to be a member of your lordships house recommending that law centres which had their precedence in the united states should be developed in this country <e>", "<cs> well my lords i have heard otherwise but i will accept the credit for the first public statement of that remark <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves on from the urban programme he prefaced that part of his speech as i understand it by saying that it was difficult to reconcile the remits of the department of the environment and the lord chancellors department and that therefore there was no prospect of implementing the benson commission recommendations <e> <s> that sounds very much like bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo <e> <s> if the will is there cannot the noble lord suggest ways of reconciling these limits <e> <s> it cannot be as difficult as all that <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in contributing briefly to the discussion on this amendment because from time to time i have given professional advice to the glc about its powers <e> <s> i rise only because of the importance of the amendment and not to trespass on that ground except that i need to say in reply to what has been said by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that whatever the merits of the spending by the glc and the metropolitan authorities on advertising it has not been done under the section which we are discussing in the amendment <e> <s> it has been done under section of the local government act which gives power to put out information <e> <s> therefore whatever is said for or against that it does not impinge on the debate on this amendment and should not be allowed to divert us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> i should have made it clear that there has been a misprint which is corrected by the manuscript amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not agree with the noble lords last point <e> <s> a police officer would be the person who a jury could quite capably find to be a person of reasonable firmness <e> <s> nor do i agree with his point about the people who run off in fear of the approaching riot because they are precisely the people who fear for their safety <e> <s> no doubt they could be called to give evidence <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if i speak to amendment no <e> <s> which also seeks to reduce the long-windedness of clause in a slightly different way <e> <s> although the noble lord lord plant and i have had differing views over many matters relating to public order i think that we agree on this <e> <s> it is essential that a clause like this which will be operated day after day both by police officers on the streets and by magistrates in magistrates courts should be clear in its terms <e>", "<cs> would not both those examples be covered by either the first limb the intent to cause a person to believe that immediate violence is going to be used against him or the likelihood limb in the last clause <e> <s> does not my amendment in fact pick out the one difficult area which is not necessary without jettisoning the likelihood test <e>", "<cs> nearly the whole debate so far has been about the part of this clause concerning disorderly behaviour <e> <s> so far as that is concerned i would not want to add one word to the immensely thoughtful speech of the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e>", "<cs> is not racial harassment dealt with in clause <e> <s> if it is not we can improve the clause <e> <s> clause deals with words or gestures which are threatening abusive or insulting which are either intended or likely to stir up racial hatred <e> <s> it is an apt description of the real grievance which i agree should be included in legislation and which the noble lord intends to include in the bill <e>", "<cs> i put my name to these amendments because i could not understand why we were introducing into the criminal law this concept of awarenes <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble and learned lord lord denning i do not yet understand it <e>", "<cs> since the noble baroness has raised the question of the act i should like to place on record first my opposition to her proposal and secondly a problem which occurred during the inquiry that i have been carrying out into the disturbances at broadwater farm <e> <s> people came to me and said not that there should not be a riot damages act but that it was not comprehensive enough <e> <s> in particular a great number of people suffered loss and damage to their vehicles <e> <s> the riot damages act refers only to premises <e> <s> they had taken the matter up with the police having lost their cars which were not properly or fully insured and found that they could not get any compensation for them <e>", "<cs> i have held my peace during discussions on the amendment to this clause because i thought it neither proper nor practicable nor principled to tinker about with clause <e> <s> i find clause the requirement that a citizen is to give notice to the police if he or she wishes to exercise in a group the right of passing down the highway to be absolutely repugnant <e> <s> unless there are compelling reasons why it is necessary we should not allow it <e> <s> i speak as someone who has been involved in organising a great number of marches and demonstrations some of which the noble lord lord teviot might like to know achieve a lot of points and a lot of purpose <e> <s> i recall once organising in a week when the dictator of portugal mr caetano visited britain <e> <s> his visit was a fiasco and nine months later he was booted out of office <e> <s> i do not say that it was because of demonstrations but they certainly underlined the unpopularity of that regime <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor suggested that this amendment had struck the right balance and the noble earl in introducing it made effectively the same claim <e> <s> it is to that argument that i want to address myself i oppose it and in doing so oppose the amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that the agony as the noble lord lord renton described it of a single farmer during the summer justifies our rushing to introduce the criminal law into this area <e>", "<cs> that and similar agonies are no justification for the simple reason that the civil law offers extremely effective remedies even now before as my noble friend lord mishcon indicated they are to be reviewed by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the noble lords lord middleton and lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it is not necessary to make an affidavit in person to get a remedy from the court <e> <s> a farmer may ring up his solicitor or the solicitor of his association or insurance company and give instructions and the solicitor can type up an affidavit go to the county court judge and

remedies that i am describing <e>", "<cs> he rings up a solicitor <e> <s> like the noble lord i have frequently been involved in obtaining remedies for those who have difficulty gaining access to the law <e> <s> there are solicitors who will act over the weekend <e> <s> there are judges who are on duty over the weekend <e> <s> the high court keeps a duty judge <e> <s> one has only to ring up the high court at any time of the weekend and one is put on to the duty judge <e> <s> one can see the duty judge at his home over the weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is pleasant to begin in a non-partisan fashion not i hasten to assure your lordships by agreeing with the noble lord who has just sat down with almost every word of whose speech i found myself in disagreement but by agreeing with every word of the speech of the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> the noble baroness and i have been on the same side in matters relating to family courts before <e> <s> if there is one work that we could achieve in a bipartisan way in the course of this parliament it would be finally to achieve the family court for which she was pleading and to remedy the inadequacies of the judicial system in family matters which has been so clearly shown up by the events of the present <e>", "<cs> my lords on considering any criminal justice bill we are concerned with trying to strike a balance between the interests that society has in securing conviction of the guilty and an appropriate sentence for them <e> <s> on the other hand there are the interests of society in securing a fair trial that avoids conviction of the innocent and also avoids the oppressive treatment of those who have been found guilty <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the debate and i found myself very bewildered by the heat that was generated in the early stages between the noble lord lord hutchinson the noble and learned lord lord roskill and the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> i found myself agreeing with every word of the speech of the noble and learned lord lord roskill and his colleague on his committee the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> but i found that their speeches were speeches made in support of clause of this bill which as i understand it is not a clause which the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington wishes to amend save in a very minor way because all the documents of which the noble and learned lord lord roskill and the noble lord lord benson were speaking are documents created or received by people in the course of either a trade a business a profession or another occupation or as the holders of paid or unpaid offices <e>", "<cs> may i speak to the manuscript amendment no <e> <s> a which stands in my name and which takes a similar point to that raised by the noble lord lord irvine that this clause should be substan-tially changed but which approaches the matter in a slightly different way because it makes an exception to preserve and slightly to extend the existing law with regard to depositions <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i begin by declaring an interest as a barrister who gets a high proportion of his income from the legal aid fund <e> <s> i also apologise particularly to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in that because of that very occupation i was not able to hear his introduction of the debate <e>", "<cs> i regret that

the amendment <e> <s> if i had been able to be here tomorrow to oppose the question that the clause stand part i should have done so on the basis that the clause in my view breaches fundamental human rights <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton is right because the law does not recognise civil rights as referred to in the amendment <e> <s> that is why i am asking the minister not so much to say that this amendment is perfect but to ensure that the articles of the convention they are not judgments to which i have referred are safeguarded by the final version of this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i must express concern about the renewal of the act and the proposals to enshrine it in permanent legislation <e> <s> i should like to pick out what i believe to be two of its most obnoxious provisions <e> <s> the first which has been mentioned by many noble lords is the exclusion order <e> <s> it is a fundamental interference with human rights <e>

preventing citizens of this country from travelling freely round it and we are doing so in the face of a recommendation from the governments own adviser that the exclusion order is no longer required

law <e> <s> i hope that before we debate it next year the noble earl will look into that aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a difficulty with the amendment of the noble lord <e> <s> we have to recognise that particularly in view of the vote in the last division the house has accepted paragraph a of the new clause as a provision that it wants to be included in the bill <e> <s> in so far as the amendment deletes the whole of the clause it goes over the same ground which we have already covered and it would perhaps be wrong to press it to a division <e>", "<cs> may i intervene on a very important point <e> <s> if a teacher whether in the course of a sex education lesson a literature lesson or in any other way is heard to express a view or even discuss the acceptability of homosexuality and there is a complaint by a parent of a pupil who is upset by what that teacher has taught surely the local authority must pursue or discipline that teacher <e> <s> if it does not it

to the whole house <e> <s> what he has done by the graphic illustration of his own family is to illustrate what an insult the present wording of this clause is to so many people who are exercising their right to have a private life which as i said in committee is enshrined in article of the european convention on human rights <e> <s> that is the right to have a particular form of private life <e> <s> i return fortified by what my noble friend has said to the question that i was posing a while ago to the noble earl <e> <s> i was very interested in his statement that subparagraph b of the new subsection is not intended to affect the way in which teachers approach the difficult issues which they may have to encounter when discussion of gay and lesbian relationships arises in the classroom <e> <s> i have looked up the education act to verify for myself that he is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to appreciate and recognise a concession when i see one particularly one made so promptly and so fully in response to a suggestion i made <e> <s> the wording of amendment no <e> <s> meets the point i raised in committee and meets it beyond any doubt <e> <s> as a perhaps unexpected bonus the logic of my thinking has been followed by the noble earl in paragraph c and i thoroughly support the outcome of that which is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i welcome both amendments <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i believe that the inclusion of the word pretended is perhaps the main remaining outstanding blot upon this clause if we must have this clause at all <e> <s> first it adds nothing to the sense of the clause <e> <s> it would be exactly the same if it read <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very timely debate and i pay tribute to the expertise of my noble friend lord hatch and particularly to the humanity of the speech of the noble lord lord goodman <e> <s> i wish to restrict my contribution to the country of mozambique <e> <s> it is a country with which i have had a long association <e> <s> that association dates back to many years before its independence when i used to speak in your lordships house in support of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord turns to the results does he accept that under the green paper proposals it would be feasible and likely for the crown prosecution service to brief independent specialist counsel in the conduct of serious cases <e>", "<cs> my lords for the past years i have had the honour to be head of a chambers of barristers which is unusual in two respects which are relevant to this debate <e> <s> first we operate as a fee-sharing collective or common purse as it is sometimes known <e> <s> our members pool their fees and draw a monthly salary which is fixed from year to year with reference to the experience and the earning capacity of its members <e> <s> it comes as close to a partnership as the rules of the bar allow <e> <s> moreover i can assure the noble lord lord renton that we suffer no loss of responsibility to our work and no loss of independence as a result of that arrangement <e>", "<cs> it is not rubbish <e> <s> many members of the bar will take legal aid work but many will have their clerks say that they are unavailable because the pay is not good enough <e> <s> we see how barristers especially at the junior less trained end fail to establish any rapport with the client partly because they are briefed so late in the day partly because there are such gulfs in experience in class and often in race which makes it impossible for them to do so and partly because many of them do not seem to try <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am following the arguments of the noble and learned lord with the greatest of care <e> <s> i share many of his sentiments about the fundamental importance of an independent bar and therefore judiciary <e> <s> however why does he think that the independent bar will not continue on merit following the proposals in these green papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for interrupting him but is not the answer to his question that there will be a market for the services of the young man or woman who has a talent for advocacy <e> <s> will that not attract such people back to the bar where they will be able to do a whole range of advocacy which the firm will not be able to offer <e> <s> is that not the answer <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my absence abroad has meant that i have not been able to attend the proceedings of the committee on this important bill before now <e> <s> as regards this amendment and some other parts of the bill i feel that my colleagues at the bar and certain noble and learned lords on the cross-benches are guilty of a degree of rigidity in seeking to put into the bill hard and fast rules about who should and who should not appear in particular courts <e> <s> that policy could operate very much against the public interest <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene only briefly and not make the speech that i could not make on second reading <e> <s> i wish to urge the committee to resist the amendment and to applaud the basic thrust of the governments desire to open up advocacy to a wider range of people and to bring a wider range of services to the client <e>", "<cs> yes the amendment which the committee is discussing <e> <s> it proposes that the bars monopoly on all rights of audience should be retained <e> <s> i believe that to be a retrograde amendment and i am explaining why <e>"]
