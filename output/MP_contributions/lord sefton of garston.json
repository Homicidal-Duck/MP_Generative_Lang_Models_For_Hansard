["<cs> my lords first i should like greatly to thank my noble friend lord melchett for introducing this debate <e> <s> i should like to say how sorry i am that in some respects it follows the budget by hours <e> <s> at the same time i should like to follow him in congratulating the noble viscount lord trenchard on his promotion and to say that i am sure every member of your lordships house is as glad as i was to hear the noble viscount say that a regional policy would remain <e>", "<cs> my lords the government benches <e> <s> i have not yet got used to the transposition not that it is important because in fact i do not think that for very long the government benches will be showing much government because i believe that this budget just earmarks the road to a complete lack of control of our economy <e> <s> i believe that a reliance upon the free enterprise system that has been in existence for so long in this country and has been in existence at such a heavy cost to this country will fail as a government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that answer may i press him a little further because i am sure he will agree that some concern is being expressed in local authorities throughout the country particularly in the north-west and north-east about statements being made in the official side of the police service <e> <s> would he agree to enter into discussions with local authorities to restore some of the confidence of local authority members in the present administration of the police service <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask a question on clause relating to the proposed composition of the negotiating board <e> <s> clause reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not very often detain the house but before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to deal with two specific points <e> <s> perhaps it is unusual to ask the noble lords opinion but is it not a fact that this does dilute the democratic control of the police forces and secondly will he make it clear whether or not the local authority associations resisted to the end the idea of lay magistrates being put on the board <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for not intimating before either by way of an amendment or otherwise that i wished to speak but i should like to put something to the noble lord lord bellwin in relation to the way in which this bill is proceeding in your lordships committee now as compared with the way the social services bill and other bills have in fact been dealt with by your lordships in committee <e> <s> any moment now somebody from the opposition front bench will rise and ask will the government admit for once just one small time that some of the things that have been said about stress areas and the weaknesses of this bill are appreciated by the government and will the government just once give way to the arguments from this side <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that my speech was totally irrelevant <e> <s> i am quite sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> would he not accept that if he now goes on to put the case in favour of the opposition then inevitably someone will want to put the other side of the case and that we shall finally finish the proceedings of this house in the situation of having heard both sides of the case that have already been put in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am mindful of the fact that your <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is very expensive <e> <s> if local authorities have to go through the expense of appearing in front of this house so does the private sector <e> <s> nobody should suggest to me in view of the money wasted in the private sector that they have not got the money to make the necessary representations in front of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords all i am saying is that the case in that regard was presented in detail with figures mentioned in the other but in the other it was glossed over <e> <s> let me deal with the d of es evidence to the select committee <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that that comes from a person who is not very much involved in local government <e> <s> one of the major problems of local government is that the last reorganisation of local government was not a sensible one <e>", "<cs> i do not know why that should cause amusement <e> <s> it was not a sensible one because it did not take into recognition the economic factors that should be taken into recognition when one decides the areas of a particular source of government <e> <s> the reason why we need one authority in an economically integrated area to do this kind of work is quite plain to me and to most people inside local government <e> <s> it would be foolish to have a public sector works enterprise in the greater manchester area under the control of all the local authorities <e> <s> i should like to say this about local authorities <e> <s> this is not a party political issue because i have received a letter from the merseyside county council which is dominated by conservative party members and evidently intending to carry out conservative policy and that letter asks me to support the defeat of this amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would give way it was not my intention to conclude the debate there from my point of view <e> <s> perhaps it may be my ignorance of the procedure <e> <s> it was my intention to sit down while the minister responded to my question <e>", "<cs> i accept that of course <e> <s> let me then try to express some of the fears of those peope who have spent the greater proportion of their lives working in local government attempting to ignore party divisions in governments of all sorts and attempting to get the best out of central and local government for the good of the community <e>", "<cs> i can well understand noble lords on the other side being concerned about points like that being made but it is very pertinent to this clause <e> <s> indeed it is pertinent to this clause for the simple reason that this is the clause that really lays down the powers for the minister to penalise a direct labour organisation if in fact it is failing in what the government say is fair competition <e> <s> so it is perfectly pertinent to raise the question of whether the fairness contained in this clause really is fair <e> <s> it is on that basis that i deal with it and i make no apology at all for dealing with it <e> <s> i attempted to see whether in fact we could get meaningful discussion between the government and the ama with a view to resolving the problem in a form of words that would meet the problem but the minister did not want me to do that <e>", "<cs> in relation to amendment no <e> <s> certainly the offer made by the minister is exactly what i sought at the beginning <e> <s> i make no apology for the fact that i dealt in my speech purely with the question of whether or not in relation to the carrying out of amendment there would be deferment <e> <s> i still say that was a viewpoint that must be held and must be considered <e> <s> previous assurances have been given by the minister that his door is open to the associations and naturally i assume now that they will now be taken into consultation in regard to this clause <e> <s> i would have been prepared to save the minister an hour and half long ago if he had said yes <e> <s> in relation to what was said by the noble lord lord renton i mentioned five years instead of three merely because i thought that was a better period in which to assess the viability of a direct works department <e> <s> three years is too short <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for his reply may i draw his attention to the fact that it has been well known in liverpool that the tate and lyle refinery on merseyside has been under threat for about five years <e> <s> according to the reply which was given to me in this house in july it does not look as though the government have made any approaches other than in the period immediately prior to the announcement of the closure <e> <s> in view of the very harsh effects this will have on merseyside turning it into probably one of the most severely hit areas in the country does the minister not think that it is time that the question of regional policy was examined closely again <e> <s> in view of the statement in col of the <e>", "<cs> well my lords i understand that members are allowed to ask questions these are all supplementary questions arising out of the failure of this government to implement regional policy <e> <s> could i further ask the noble earl whether he is satisfied with the progress made in the governments own words in focussing more effectively on the remaining assisted areas following their redesignation <e> <s> will he persuade his government colleagues to bring a further report to the house on the question of regional aid <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i reply to the point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a further question <e> <s> it seems that he does not get the connection between the tate and lyle closure and regional policy <e> <s> as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to get used to this parliamentary language <e> <s> but in any language it means the same it means that the people on merseyside are beginning to get a little tired of the insistence upon format <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we can take it that the government have given up completely their policy on the decentralisation of the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i tender my apologies to your lordships for the fact that my name is not on the list of speakers <e> <s> i was not certain that i could get here today <e> <s> i had an appointment in the north-west <e> <s> in the event i managed to arrive here and i have heard three-quarters of the speakers <e> <s> i am very sorry indeed that i did not hear what must have been an excellent maiden speech by the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool <e> <s> knowing him i am quite certain that it was an excellent speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will join with the last noble lord in saying that we hope that the private sector will produce sufficient wealth in order to ensure that our economy is a stable and fast-growing one because if it is not then not only will this government have failed but the nation will have failed <e> <s> so it is vitally important that that should happen <e> <s> wealth is not produced only by the private sector it is also produced by the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down on the list of speakers in this debate but i abstained for a specific purpose <e> <s> i thought that with all the varied experience of the speakers this afternoon the points which i wished to make would be made and i was reluctant to delay the rising of the house beyond a reasonable time particularly in view of the event that will take place on television at which i am sure will interest your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords while i think that this house needs to congratulate the authors of this green paper even though it has been suggested that they missed what to some is a very important part of the question of rating in this country ie <e> <s> non-domestic rating i find in chapter that not only did they not ignore the question of non-domestic rating but also made some rather revolutionary suggestions as to how that problem should be tackled covering at least two full pages in doing so <e> <s> one of the suggestions is a single national non-domestic rate poundage which would apply equally to each local authority <e> <s> i mention that only to show that in fact the authors of the green paper did deal with that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the local authority associations may discuss this <e> <s> i can give a few examples where local authorities which are the constituent members of local authority associations put their own vested interests well before the interests of the community at large <e> <s> the police bill gave us a very good example in merseyside where the choice as regards which local authority the minutes of the police authority should go in front of lay between the bootle authority and the liverpool authority <e> <s> what happened <e> <s> it was suggested that the appropriate local authority for those minutes to go in front of in order that the local authorities would be well-informed about the activities of the police authority would be the liverpool city council because that was the larger council of the two <e> <s> bootle vetoed it because the bill said that unless there was perfect agreement it could not happen <e> <s> the consequence was that the minutes of that police authority never came in front of any local government body <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not including my name on the list of speakers but quite genuinely i did not know that i was going to speak until i had actually heard the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord ardwick said that he was the only non-academic to take part in the debate this evening but here is another one who i think is perhaps a little lower than lord ardwick <e> <s> he i understand went to manchester grammar school and in the working-class of liverpool he would be considered to be an academic <e> <s> i left an elementary school at and became a plumber <e> <s> ultimately i became the leader of liverpool city council and then i was very honoured to become the chairman and the leader of merseyside county council <e> <s> i also became the chairman of the north-west economic planning council and besides all those posts somebody somewhere thought that i should also become a member of the social science research council <e> <s> i do not know why <e> <s> it is an even greater mystery to me why a minister of the party opposite reappointed me a member of that august body <e> <s> but i thought that it would be a good lesson in education for myself and i mixed with many academics <e>", "<cs> well my lords may i say that i speak as an ultimate customer of the social science research council not a representative of it <e> <s> by ultimate customer i mean somebody who has been elected to be responsible for looking at and trying to solve some of the problems which concern the social science research council crime poverty race riots drug addiction urban deprivation unemployment and the state of the economy <e> <s> if anyone wants a lesson in trying to gauge the necessary amount of resources to meet those problems i recommend him to go and live in and try to manage a local authority such as merseyside <e> <s> he will then realise that perhaps the problems there are a little greater than those problems that face the academic world <e> <s> when i came into the chamber tonight i expected to listen to what was best in the academic world of our nation instead i have listened academic tearing another another academic to pieces and to academics ridiculing one another <e> <s> it was almost personal abuse <e> <s> i have never believed that that was the best of our academic world <e> <s> but it has happened it has happened tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak about the bill i should like to deal with two points that have been raised in the debate and i shall do so as briefly as i can <e> <s> first there was the point raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who ascribed to this part of the house a statement that the bill was a massive attack on local government <e> <s> i do not think that the words massive attack were used <e> <s> the words used were this is an attack on local government and the noble lord nods his head in agreement and <e>", "<cs> well my lords i am not quite sure what that means and i am not quite sure what a nod of the noble lords head means but it is a trick as old as the hills and older even than this chamber that one should first of all put up an aunt sally and then knock it down <e> <s> no one described the bill as a massive attack on local government they described it as an attack on local government <e> <s> it is a step along the road that this country and in particular local government sees all too clearly <e> <s> it is one more step towards the control of our economy and our affairs by a bureaucratic state <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he like to say how long it is overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain this necessity to conform to central government except in the field where there is a damage to the national economy <e> <s> can the minister demonstrate how the transferring of comparatively small amounts of money measured against the national economy from the ratepayer to the fare payer can damage the national economy <e>", "<cs> my lords does what the noble lord say mean that we can talk about philosophy during the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> some time ago this house debated the question of transportation for school children and i was very impressed by some of the impassioned speeches made by noble lords opposite with regard to that <e> <s> the principle being debated was in the main that governments and local government had laid down certain principles in regard to the education of children and any attempt to take away free transport to schools would have gone against that principle <e> <s> i think the decision of the house was absolutely right in regard to that <e> <s> in regard to this present matter the same principle obtains <e> <s> there are many large cities which have introduced with the support of government the comprehensive system of education and for that system to function properly it is absolutly essential that we should draw pupils from all sections of society in that city <e> <s> we should not have neighbourhood schools if comprehensive education is to function <e> <s> the children must be free to travel to the comprehensive school and therefore must be encouraged to move over long distances <e>", "<cs> i do not for one moment think that it has anything to do with being frank or not being frank <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord understands what is being said <e> <s> what we are quite simply saying on this side is that because of certain events in the past which both central and local government agreed promises were made <e> <s> the basis of an education was established on the basis of movement of children from one neighbourhood to another <e> <s> all we are saying is that the facility to move should not be a choice made by the local authority between money spent for other subsidies and money spent for children first <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> if the government persist and defeat the amendment the government will lay themselves clear to the charge that on a question of priorities they are not prepared to give first priority to children <e> <s> this is something to do with children and not just money <e>", "<cs> i find this almost unbelievable <e> <s> the noble lord is telling the committee that his mind is closed to any kind of amendment to this bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin shakes his head <e> <s> if the noble lords words meant anything that is what they meant <e> <s> he said it has to be taken as a total package <e> <s> another way of interpreting that is to say take it or leave it <e> <s> let me put a simple case with regard to this amendment <e> <s> i come from merseyside as some people know and in any case my accent would give me away <e> <s> the situation on merseyside as i described on second reading is that we followed certain policies <e> <s> being prevented by central government from expanding our boundaries we had to move people out <e> <s> in order to recompense them for their being moved further away from the centre of their activities we operated a cheap fare on long distances <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i have the document here and my understanding has nothing to do with local authorities <e> <s> the question that i want to ask now that i have the document is was this document discussed with passenger transport executives alone under the ministry of transport or was it discussed with local authorities <e> <s> if it was discussed with passenger transport executives what was their attitude particularly to those factors that are not included <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i revert to the question of this document <e> <s> in the second reading debate i said that this bill was the product not of politicians but of bureaucrats <e> <s> i said that it had come from the transport world which was intent only on transport <e> <s> now we have a document which the noble lord did not know about until today <e> <s> it was issued by the ministry of transport and went to the passenger transport executives <e> <s> copies were sent to local authorities <e> <s> it excludes a model which will be used when assessing the protected expenditure level <e> <s> it excludes the effect on the economy of a city in terms of employment location of homes work places and the environment <e> <s> it excludes flexibility <e> <s> the noble lord who sits on the front bench opposite said the government did not know about the existence of that document which is a disgrace and a terrible condemnation of what is going on <e> <s> i repeat that this clause hits at the very heart of the bill <e> <s> whether or not they make mistakes is irrelevant <e> <s> local authorities want to get the best for their area <e> <s> can we leave london out of it for the moment <e>", "<cs> we want to ensure that there is a transport service on merseyside <e> <s> we want to try to redevelop an economy which has been wrecked by private enterprise <e> <s> in doing so we may in the opinion of the government spend too much but in the opinion of the people of merseyside we shall not spend too much <e> <s> nor addressing the noble lord lord plummer shall we spend too much in the opinion of all those people who have to pay rates but do not get a vote <e> <s> the noble lord may know something about london but may i tell him that in liverpool the liverpool stores committee is a very powerful voice in the private sector <e> <s> the bill is opposed not only by the liverpool stores committee which represents all the major ratepayers in liverpool who have no vote but also by the regional area of the co-operative society which is the biggest retailer in the area <e> <s> therefore what has been said by the liverpool stores committee cannot be discounted <e>", "<cs> i am a little mystified because when the noble lord lord bellwin sat down he had almost convinced me that there really was no change in the bill <e> <s> when he said that the relationships between the local authority and the executive remained the same he almost had me believe it <e> <s> but it is not the same because if it was the same there would be no harm in accepting the amendments <e> <s> there would be no harm because things would have stayed as they were <e> <s> so what is the difference <e> <s> what is this amazing thing that converts the noble lord lord bellwin from one of the staunchest supporters of local authorities that i have ever heard speak on the ama <e> <s> at the time when the first water bill was going through he stalwartly defended the right of local authorities members to have their say <e> <s> the government were saying at the time there is no harm <e> <s> they were saying to the association of metropolitan authorities you will have <e>", "<cs> on a point of clarification did i understand the noble lord to say that the plan <e>", "<cs> perhaps we can clear up this matter because i am very concerned about relations between that front bench local government and this front bench <e> <s> i am taking it that the noble lord lord bellwin is giving us an assurance that the preparation of the plan is entirely a matter for the executive in the first place and that it is not determined in consultation with the ministry <e> <s> am i getting that assurance or not <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go into a second reading speech either but if an amendment conflicts with something said from the government front bench on second reading then it is right to examine that amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and perhaps i should begin by telling a story arising from an experience last week <e> <s> i met an old friend of mine who is still a member of merseyside county council and one of the district councils and he asked me whether i was pleased to have come to your lordships house <e> <s> i replied no <e> <s> on reflection i think i would sooner be back in local government because there you appear to be doing something even if you are not <e> <s> he said it is almost four years since you were in local government <e> <s> i suggest you think again because the attitude in local government now is really not worthwhile <e>", "<cs> i do not want to bother the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> i only want to ask him a simple question the one that i asked yesterday <e> <s> is he yet in a position to answer me as to whether or not consultations took place with the executives on this matter and whether any meetings took place with the executives at all of which the local authorities were not notified <e>", "<cs> more for the sake of brevity may i assume that the minister will write to me and tell me about the meetings with the executives <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord lord bellwin has done himself a service by reading some of the briefs that have been given to him <e> <s> it would be better for democracy as a whole if the noble lord lord bellwin stuck to his first statement this afternoon namely that he will not repeat the arguments that he used on other occasions <e> <s> indeed he really should not do so <e> <s> the justification that the noble lord lord bellwin and all the speakers on the government front bench put forward was that these subsidies were of such a proportion that they were endangering the proper running of our economy <e> <s> i hold second fiddle to no one as regards that principle <e> <s> as a member of a local authority for many years i always subscribed to the view that the national economy macro-economics was a matter for central government <e> <s> even though it may be taken as a criticism of some local authorities at the moment i still adhere to that view <e> <s> the government have a right to say what is the maximum but the brief which has just been read and which was closely followed by other noble lords goes further than that <e>", "<cs> i am completely amazed every time the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter speaks in this committee as to how he can develop a speech by making a false assumption first and then building a whole edifice on that false assumption <e>", "<cs> i did not quite hear that <e> <s> at any rate it was not important to what i am about to say <e> <s> the false assumption about which the noble lord on the front bench will disabuse your mind was that in some way i attach no importance to central government deciding total figures <e> <s> i said exactly that and i am glad to see that the noble lord agreed because sometimes i have doubts whether the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter can understand scouse <e> <s> i said i agree with you <e> <s> but the logic of your argument if one listened to it is that you should be moving an amendment to this bill to exclude london from the contents of the bill <e> <s> all you have addressed yourself to is what the position was with you and london years ago <e>", "<cs> i agree with you <e> <s> i disagree with you that you cannot move an amendment <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent you moving an amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps we could have a conversation with somebody who knows more about parliament than either you or i i am assured that it would be possible to delete from the provisions of this bill a place like london <e>", "<cs> you move it <e> <s> you said logically that that is what you wanted <e> <s> let me come back to the other point about you wishing that the planning section of the executive in london should not be there and it should be done by central government in other words by whitehall <e> <s> if you apply that argument to the other authorities included in the bill would you then wish that the section of their planning in the executive should be done by whitehall <e> <s> i am quite willing to give way if you would like to reply <e> <s> you do not want to reply <e> <s> i must imply that that means that you would not want <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether your advocacy in regard to london is not also apparent in the governments mind about the rest of the transportation authorities <e> <s> i believe it very much is <e> <s> on the point about whether or not that should be done at whitehall i do not know and i am not prepared to get into an argument about london but i know that it would be criminally wrong to take away from local authorities in the northern parts of this country the ability to plan <e>", "<cs> is it the intention of the government under clause when they have finalised their decision to report that decision to parliament <e>", "<cs> was the gist of the noble lords speech that central government will not insist on getting these details and going into them <e>", "<cs> i have in front of me a document which the government front bench did not have before them yesterday <e> <s> it is the department of transports revenue support assessment model <e> <s> this model will be used to determine the protected expenditure level <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to stop me if i am wrong <e> <s> i have only just seen this document the government front bench did not get it until yesterday so i may have it wrong <e> <s> one of the questions they will ask the noble lord seems to know what they will ask is <e>", "<cs> what does it mean <e>", "<cs> but what does this mean <e>", "<cs> i have just read it out <e>", "<cs> will the minister compromise a little <e> <s> we designed a railway system on merseyside <e> <s> it is not quite complete <e> <s> there is another branch to be completed to make it serve the whole of the merseyside area properly <e> <s> if we do that and everybody knows that there are fixed track kinds of transportation which need a specific subsidy in order to bed in will the minister go so far as to consider the question of the first years figures being fixed and the second and third year figures being provisional <e>", "<cs> may i spend a few minutes supporting this amendment <e> <s> we have a situation on merseyside where the cross-river traffic is by private cars the railways and to a lesser extent the ferries and we also use buses through the tunnel <e> <s> we could have a situation where labour disputes which are not unknown on merseyside could stop one of those forms of traffic <e> <s> at that time it would be essential that the local transport authority should spend more money on providing an alternative <e> <s> that is the kind of emergency that may well go on <e>", "<cs> i have been attending this chamber now for four years <e> <s> i bow to the knowledge of my noble friend in regard to the star chamber <e> <s> i did not even know there was one <e> <s> i can well imagine the frustration of some people who appeared at the time of the star chamber in front of that body because to some extent i feel it now <e> <s> we get a statement from the noble lord that he does not understand when people refer to the constitutional issues raised by this bill <e> <s> it is something that members of local authorities have felt for a long time <e> <s> they have felt for a long time that constitutionally under our democratic system they had a right to take certain decisions subject of course to the fact that overriding all that was the question whether they had exercised their powers properly in relation to a certain act of parliament <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to tell the minister before he sits down that that speech was not a speech concerned primarily with this bill although it could well have been a second reading speech on the measure which carried out the last reform of local government <e> <s> i do not think that consideration of this transport bill warrants an attack such as has just been made on the whole of local government <e> <s> under no circumstances should it warrant such an attack <e> <s> but the attack has revealed quite clearly the real reason behind the bill <e> <s> as i said on second reading the real reason behind the bill is the governments determination to show that body over the water who really rules <e> <s> it was from that motive that the bill sprung it was from that motive that it originated and that was when it got into the hands of bureaucracy <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin did not reply to the straight question asked by my noble friend lord underhill which was why go to the executive and not to the authority <e> <s> i should like to frame that question in another way <e> <s> i should like a straight answer to the question does the noble lord lord bellwin intend to reply to that question <e> <s> secondly what the noble lord lord bellwin has said seems to answer a question that not only have i asked in this committee but about which i should also like to ask am i likely to have it answered <e>", "<cs> the clause refers to any particular activities of the executive <e> <s> may i ask the minister to say what he takes that to mean <e>", "<cs> i was specific <e> <s> i asked what are particular activities <e> <s> what does the bill mean by particular activities <e>", "<cs> i am still not very clear about the reply that i received from the noble lord to my earlier question <e> <s> i think that he referred to geographical centres as being one of the particular activities that were referred to in the clause <e> <s> am i right <e> <s> the term used was geographical centres <e> <s> i must be right but i thought that i was hearing things <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it is in fact possible to define what is meant by geographical areas <e> <s> i should imagine that the only organisation which could properly define geographical areas in relation to the one place that i think is the best area in the united kingdom would be the merseyside county council or the transport executive <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lord should read the clause <e> <s> it does not say that <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> i accept what in effect the noble lord has just told us from the front bench that the decision on whether to ask for tenders will be a matter for the executive and that there is nothing sinister in it in other words it was no intention of the government in any way to take away from the executive the free choice as to whether to accept a tender or even to go out to tender in that regard <e> <s> that is what i took the noble lord to say <e> <s> i hope that i am not being unfair <e> <s> clause says <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord asked the question why should the noble lord lord tordoff be worried that the private sector would cream off the best and leave the rest for the local authority <e> <s> if that was the question surely the answer is obvious <e> <s> the private sector will only tender for the cream <e> <s> surely nobody in this chamber forgets one of the simple factors that put our railway undertaking into such difficulties <e> <s> it was because the law of the land laid down that railways should be common carriers and they had to carry all kinds of distasteful loads <e> <s> at one time british rail and the railways before it as common carriers had to carry distasteful loads <e> <s> at the end of one particular journey they almost had to scrap the railway wagon because it was not fit to be used for anything else <e> <s> the private sector would never tender to do a thing like that <e> <s> the answer is obvious it is within the very nature of private enterprise that it will go for the profitable and to hell with the needy <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene for a few moments <e> <s> when the present government were elected they took away from merseyside civil service jobs <e> <s> they had their reasons for doing so i suppose but i shall not go into that <e> <s> then there was some trouble in liverpool and so they sent there the minister for merseyside <e> <s> his first act was to suggest an international garden festival and that is to take place in <e> <s> nobody knows whether or not it will be a success <e> <s> but one thing is quite certain <e> <s> there will be a necessity for travel in the district where the garden is to be laid down and as the event unfolds the transport authority in the area will have to take a decision on expenditure to be incurred on transport <e> <s> but under the bill the authority will not be allowed to do that because it will have to make up its mind before march as to what its spending is going to be <e> <s> if due to unforeseen circumstances the authority tries to spend any more in order to make the garden festival a success it will be liable to be dragged through the courts <e> <s> that is a small example of the flexibility that is required in transport planning <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has already given examples of four cases and i urge the government to be slightly more flexible than they have been until now and they would not have to be very flexible to achieve that <e>", "<cs> arising from my intervention before the noble lord sits down will he please tell me whether when the garden festival is proceeding if the committee responsible a committee of the local authority finds that more transportation is needed than was allowed for in the plan it will be able to hire buses <e>", "<cs> i am not asking whether it would be desirable <e> <s> is the principle agreed that a local authority can hire buses for an extra-special occasion <e>", "<cs> we are near the end of what to me has been a somewhat frustrating exercise <e> <s> in view of the fact that the bill was not debated properly in another place we thought when we set out on this exercise that there would be some give and take and that the government would wish to take into consideration the points which have been made on the various amendments <e> <s> but i have reached the conclusion that the government do not intend to give way and that on this clause they will insist upon their right to carry the day <e> <s> this means that the government will insist on having their way against the wishes of every local authority and against the wishes of all the passenger transport executives none of whom supports the point of view of the government <e> <s> passenger transport executives were set up to apply <e>", "<cs> someone suggested to me once that the house of lords is not of this world <e> <s> that speech has just demonstrated it <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble lords remarks about his sympathy with my noble friend lord molloy and his implication of seeming support of the principle of the bill will he be prepared to give his support to an amendment to the transport bill an amendment which will achieve the results sought by my noble friend lord molloy <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships for not having put down my name to speak in this debate <e> <s> i should not have intervened but for the fact that we have now heard three speeches from the other side all of which have expressed sympathy for the contents and the principle of the bill <e> <s> indeed in one particular case the speaker went much further <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway said quite clearly that he agreed with the principle that the unemployed should be assisted in travelling to look for work regardless of their status in other ways for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to be moving back from his previous statement but i shall read with interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be grateful to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for clearly establishing the thinking if there is any behind the governments intention <e> <s> it has been unkindly suggested to me that contrary to the tradition of this chamber the government are not prepared to accept any amendments however reasonable and however minor to this bill purely because of the need or desire of the government to get this bill through by a certain date <e> <s> if that is true it is regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but it may perhaps save the noble lord asking for the leave of the house to speak later <e> <s> can he give an assurance that the government will not issue guidance or a list of benefits for the local authorities to take into consideration which are not mentioned in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may try to see whether the front bench opposite can be a little accommodating <e> <s> i am not an expert certainly not in accounting procedures so i take my advice from other places <e> <s> i am advised that all the executives and i am not talking about london because it is a place with which i do not very often consort would support this amendment if they had the privilege of being in this house <e> <s> therefore there must be something in the case that to restrict them in the way the bill intends to restrict them is bad management practice <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he give to this house an assurance that no instructions that conflict with the act mentioned will be issued from the department to local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i raise a point that i have raised twice before <e> <s> it is the question of the assurances for which i asked from noble lords on the front bench opposite about whether guidance would be given by the department that conflicted with the powers already passed in parliament that enabled local authorities to take certain things into consideration <e> <s> when this issue of the document that was published on st february this year was first raised in this chamber the front bench responsible for the bill did not know <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister mean to tell me that the government would consider an amendment to the bill <e> <s> it would then have to go back to the commons and then come back to this chamber <e>", "<cs> the minister is playing with words <e> <s> we are talking about the principles underlying proper transport planning something the government are supposed to want <e> <s> if the principles are there <e>", "<cs> my lords i never lose my temper over london i merely say i do not want to discuss london <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens when you are discussing london is that you are discussing with a lot of people in a self-contained community who are almost completely ignorant of everything that happens the other side of the watford gap <e> <s> i think that too much attention has been given to london but i do not get bad-tempered over it <e> <s> i do not see why the noble lord had to introduce it into this debate because it clouds the issue <e> <s> the issue is whether or not our amendment is a wrecking amendment or designed to a greater or lesser degree to defeat the purpose of this bill <e> <s> well it is not the noble lord put the wrong interpretation on it <e>", "<cs> i rather suspect that if this bill had been considered for a longer period and in more detail in another place the two opposing sides if i may put it that way would have been able to reach an accommodation in the form of an amendment <e> <s> on one side we have the executive and the authority saying that an emergency should be tackled immediately and that one should not have to go to the money market and have interest levied on the money borrowed to help in an emergency <e> <s> however good management would say that one should do that in agreement with the authority and the executive so that it is not carried on <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment but i would not want to make a second reading speech <e> <s> that is going to be a difficult problem <e> <s> i can see that immediately <e> <s> but it is quite simply resolved because in fact the bill proposes that the government should have the power to restrict the spending of local authorities on transport <e> <s> they have chosen this method contained in this clause as one method by which that control can be exercised <e> <s> so if i address myself to alternative methods of control of that expenditure i do not think that could be interpreted as a second reading speech <e> <s> i would therefore like to apply myself to that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord where the bill mentions the excess <e> <s> where does it say in the bill that the disqualification applies only to the excess over the pel <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a point while this is being looked at <e> <s> i accept what it says in the clause but it does not specifically say subsequently that only the excess is to be applied <e> <s> we can all imagine what is going to happen <e> <s> it will not be just a question of a local authority and somebody discussing with the minister what the excess will be <e> <s> what will happen is that both sides will employ barristers and will go to court and then will have a field day <e> <s> somebody will be saying that the law is an ass because a barrister will be arguing whether once the amount has been exceeded that makes the whole payment invalid <e> <s> that is what he will argue <e> <s> the barrister on the other side will argue against it and at the end of the day the judge will decide <e> <s> that could be the scenario <e> <s> what that implies is as i said earlier in second reading that the judge is sitting before two barristers hearing the arguments and then deciding whether the bill allows him to say that the rest of the payment even up to the pel is invalid <e> <s> having made that point that is what could happen <e> <s> a simple <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a question in regard to the first part of the amendment the obtaining of information by the executive from the nbc <e> <s> if it is shown between now and third reading that some executives do have difficulty in obtaining information apart from the question of co-operation between the two bodies would the noble lord be prepared to accept an amendment to rectify that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to speak because i am absolutely committed to leaving the house but i hope that the vote will be taken before that time <e> <s> the debate should not be allowed to pass before some reply is given to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> he made a very reasoned case and i again read what he said on the bill of my noble friend lord molloy <e> <s> i think i am not misinterpreting what he said when making three points first that assistance for the unemployed should be left to the government and should not be done in the local areas second that benefit should not be related to the status of being unemployed and thirdly that the bill is not in any case intended to allow unemployed people to lead a normal life <e> <s> that was the essence of his case <e> <s> but that is a very good way of doing what an individual did about years ago he sent for a bowl of water and washed his hands <e> <s> but it does not relieve ones conscience if the answer can be given to those three points <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him a question arising from a matter which i raised on second reading and to which the noble lord lord bellwin said that he would refer when replying but in fact he did not do so <e> <s> i raised the question of whether or not this government wanted the courts to decide about the balance between fares and grants <e> <s> that question has not been answered <e> <s> i raised it twice in committee <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether or not it is the governments intention that the courts should decide whether the balance of money is to come from grants or from fare-paying passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not answer the question <e> <s> may i repeat <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that there is a point of view in existence in this country in very responsible circles that perhaps this appointment will be viewed as a very severe reflection upon the quality and type of management contained in the cbi and the institute of directors in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the emphasis of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is on the unforeseen <e> <s> in this amendment the emphasis is entirely different it confers upon the minister the right to say what is an emergency <e> <s> perhaps i could outline its importance by describing what could happen in the place which i know best merseyside <e> <s> on either side of the river we have developed a quite extensive network of rail services <e> <s> they cover both the north and the south bank of the mersey <e> <s> because of the obvious cost we have to rely upon the old mersey railway tunnel <e> <s> this means that both those services are dependent upon one double track under the mersey <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a point <e> <s> if we look at clause that deals with the executive alone <e> <s> if it was left as it is there is no provision whereby the authority could decide who the tenders should be accepted from <e> <s> may i remind your lordships that it is not the first time that committees with delegated authority have done things which the democratically elected body thought other than reasonable <e> <s> i am not quite certain on a point of order whether i should refer to the other place but it certainly happened in the other place when somebody discovered that they were dining off crockery manufactured in west germany <e> <s> that was done because of the freedom of the catering committee i suppose one could call the catering committee the executive in that regard to pick where it wanted to pick in regard to a tender <e>", "<cs> my lords may i commence by welcoming part ii of the bill clause <e> <s> i am sure that my welcome of that clause will not be shared by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter whose only comment about it was that he did not believe that the two bodies were worth the amount of money which was being given to them <e> <s> to those who are not so blind that they do not want to see it illustrates that because of clause it would be difficult for this side of the house to vote against the bill <e> <s> the amendment does not ask the house to reject the bill <e> <s> the house is asked to criticise the government <e> <s> it is not asked to criticise the membership of this house <e> <s> i for one would not quarrel about the way the whip works in this house nor would i quarrel about the fact that members opposite have used their vote on several occasions to defeat the government <e> <s> the important point however is what were those occasions <e> <s> they were occasions when the government were vitally involved in getting a bill through by a certain date <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree with me that if the level of political and economic hostility increases at the rate that it has increased over the past five years and particularly over the past three there will probably be military hostilities between the east and the west and even if those military hostilities start with no nuclear weapons at all being used it will not be long before that stage is reached <e> <s> therefore does he agree that it would perhaps be a good idea if the government of the united kingdom approached the government of the soviet union to talk about dtente and to try to establish some common sense in the relationship that now exists between east and west so that we do not have a situation where the powerful forces in america are determined to stop any economic co-operation between the soviet union and the united kingdom and the rest of europe by opposing such ventures as the oil pipeline <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he refer again to the point made in his speech about the majority of derek hattons colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the word majority in relation to militant tendency <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house but i did not quite understand what the noble lord said about how many militant tendency members there were in liverpool city council <e> <s> as his speech is already written down no doubt he will be able to refer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not putting my name down on the list of speakers and thereby causing some people to think that the debate would be shorter than it will in fact be <e> <s> i have no intention of apologising if i take longer than any of the other speakers <e> <s> let me first clear up the point about the majority of derek hattons colleagues <e> <s> i understood the noble lord to say that the majority of his colleagues i assume on the city council were in fact members of militant tendency <e> <s> let me refute that right away and say that is completely untrue <e> <s> however perhaps when his speech is printed in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who has just spoken said that today he was not voting against the abolition of the glc <e> <s> he is quite right none of us will be doing that <e> <s> in fact the next time that we discuss the abolition of the glc the event will already have occurred because the government believe that the will of parliament is contained inside the house of commons and therefore after this bill we shall no longer have an opportunity to discuss the real issues about the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan county councils <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not want proportional representation <e> <s> i am just about to come to that point <e> <s> what we see is an example of the party caucus having its will in parliament regardless of what the opposition say <e> <s> some people will say what is wrong with that <e> <s> some people said what is wrong with a candidate in an election putting on his ballot paper the party he represents <e> <s> i will tell you what is wrong about it <e> <s> by that simple act parliament recognised that political parties have a powerful role in our democracy and that has led to this bill <e>", "<cs> with all due respect my lords i did not say that they had no mandate <e> <s> they have a mandate of some sort based on seats <e> <s> i said they have no mandate on the votes of the people <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it strange to refer to an amendment of this sort as offensive and as in some way affecting the proper government of this country <e> <s> if we were speaking of a bill which was merely a financial bill and which dealt with certain statistics which dealt with certain matter of fact principles then it might be that parliament would be the only place to decide and to put forward the financial justification of the particular bill <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no one who has opposed what is going on in local government more than i have <e> <s> there is no one who disagrees more with the abuse of power inside local government which is being operated in certain places <e> <s> but am ito say that over and over again <e> <s> because ken livingstone steps over the boundary does that mean that the government are going to change the whole system <e> <s> is it not just possible that if the government tried another approach we could get local government back on to an even keel we could once again re-establish in this country the consensus which used to exist between central and local government <e> <s> we cannot because the government will not even try <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not keep your lordships long <e> <s> i should tell your lordships that i have not been made aware of the amendment that has been moved and in view of the fact that it has been put forward by the conservative group on merseyside county council i suppose i should not be surprised at that <e> <s> but i know that they are of this opinion and i am concerned only to ensure that some of the problems on merseyside in the context of this bill and of the bill which would follow are properly considered <e>", "<cs> my lords this may well be the final stage of this particular bill in this house <e> <s> the motion that the bill do now pass is an opportunity for the members of this house to look at the bill as it has gone through the house in its entirety with all the amendments that have been carried <e> <s> i look at it and i am as appalled as i was at the beginning <e> <s> i am horrified <e> <s> that is not in particular because of its consequences to local government <e> <s> i think that local government is such a versatile machine that perhaps it could have got over the difficulties <e> <s> just as it got over the difficulties inherent in the reorganisation and began to make it work it would probably get over the difficulties inherent in this bill when this bill was followed by the main bill <e>", "<cs> my lords when replying to the noble baroness lady stedman the noble lord lord bellwin said that he would gladly send her information to show that liverpool had not received a windfall following the dialogue if it can be so called between the government and that city <e> <s> i hope that when he used the word gladly he did not really mean that he would gladly demonstrate that liverpool had not received a windfall because if there is any city that needs a windfall it is liverpool <e> <s> the amazing thing is as i said in another debate this week all these ministers keep going to merseyside and liverpool and keep saying how terrible the situation is there and that it is not the fault of the people of liverpool <e> <s> then when it comes to a measure such as this they treat liverpool exactly like all the others <e> <s> from what i have read into and seen of the designation principles they say that merseyside will be treated in exactly the same way as any other local authority area in the country <e> <s> yet the government have demonstrated over and over again as did previous governments that merseyside is a special case <e> <s> but we can never reach a situation where when we talk about this kind of measure governments treat it seriously and as a special case <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that if it was not for the existence in liverpool of some moderate-minded councillors the situation would have been very different indeed <e> <s> at this moment the government should be trying to persuade those moderate councillors to stay with local government and not frighten them away <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of following the noble lord lord beloff in what to me seemed an amazing speech from an academic in which he used the exception inside local government to try to demonstrate the general <e> <s> he used what everybody knows is the exception in local government of so-called abuses in order to try to justify an abolition bill that will sweep right through the country <e> <s> i certainly did not intend to come along here and fire the first shot in a campaign to prevent the abolition bill <e> <s> i thought that the right way to treat this subject was to place it in its historical context as the noble lord on the front bench said <e> <s> lord beloff almost started to do that <e> <s> he started by talking about local government being conceived in the nineteenth century as though somebody sat somewhere and conceived an organisation to do certain things <e> <s> local government did not start like that <e> <s> local government responded to the needs of certain areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware of that <e> <s> but as somebody else much more qualified than i am said we do not want an elective dictatorship <e> <s> it is quite easy to score a debating point but the real issue i am putting to this chamber is not the question of which institution is the right one but how we get consensus among the governed and the governors <e> <s> that is the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not much knowledge of the saxon kings but i would accept the case that at that time it was tolerably efficient <e> <s> however we are not talking about saxon kings <e> <s> we are talking about <e> <s> there are some very serious economic and social problems to be solved i am not pleading that the labour party or the tory party have the answers <e> <s> what i am saying is that if in this situation mistakes are going to be made then it had better be with the consent and consensus of the population and not dictated from whitehall <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that the aim of regional aid is to equalise the opportunities for jobs throughout the country and that as it has now been in operation for approximately years and the disparities between the various areas in the country have become worse instead of better the question of regional aid has in fact signally failed to achieve its aim <e> <s> would he further agree that even now when new jobs are being created in certain industries most of those jobs are being created in the south-east and the least number are being created in the disadvantaged areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the point of my remarks was that regional aid as we see it and as we have been practising it for years has completely failed to remove the disparities in our economy <e> <s> will the noble lord look at the question of devolving jobs from the south-east to the rest of the country as in fact the government are urging the private sector to do <e> <s> the private sector needs to be in the south-east the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me how much less merseyside is to receive <e>", "<cs> but it will be less <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply it seems to me that it is a general statement of conservative philosophy and i should not like to argue that not at this stage anyway <e> <s> may i ask him whether it is not true that in connection with the major servicing of nimrod the tender forms should have been ready in june the summer of this year that they are not ready yet and that if in fact work is not steered to british aerospace before there is a very great possibility that the number of redundancies occasioned in that particular organisation will be very serious indeed <e> <s> what do the government intend to do about that <e> <s> is it true that in view of the fact that some tenderers would not be tendering for the whole of the contract and yet would be expecting to have revealed to them design authority expertise which may well be a threat to the future research and development in the aerospace industry the government are now finding it so very difficult to produce tender forms which are acceptable <e>", "<cs> the last part of my question asked whether the government had made any examination of the consequences of their policy on the aerospace industry <e> <s> perhaps i may frame this in the form of a question what effect would it have on research and development of the aerospace industry in this country if in fact the government allow tenders to be split between sub-contractors who have no responsibility for and have no intention of engaging in research and development expenses such as in the case of british aerospace <e> <s> if it is the governments intention to allow sub-contractors to take part in these tenders and to allow the work to be split up what is the governments attitude to fragmenting once again the aerospace industry which has over so many years been urged by successive governments to merge in order to provide a competitive element in the business <e>", "<cs> but my lords as the whole matter is so important and if the noble lord agrees that it is an important issue which will require some other airing rather than at question time is he prepared to issue a statement about the consequences that the government see following their policy on the british aerospace industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am amazed at the noble earls grasp of all these public spending figures <e> <s> can he tell the house how the overspending of local government compares with the overspending of central government in the last two years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent expressed some concern about this amendment being moved on the grounds that it was in order but that it weakened certain conventions that exist in our parliamentary system <e> <s> that concern is shared by a lot of people <e> <s> many members on this side of the house and on the opposite side of the house well remember the tyrannies carried out in the name of single chamber government in other parts of europe and value highly the nature of this chamber <e> <s> the convention that exists between this chamber and the other and in parliament as a whole should be jealously guarded <e> <s> i share that sense of caution when we table amendments <e> <s> but on this particular issue i do not think we go far enough <e> <s> coming from merseyside my feeling is that we should not just table an amendment to this order we should vote against it and vote it out <e> <s> that is my feeling <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my thanks to those expressed by my noble friend on the front bench to the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> more particularly i thank the minister for the fact that cammell laird will obtain one of these orders <e> <s> this is not the time to debate the worthwhileness of giving cammell laird an order for a frigate <e> <s> however taken against the background of the problems that merseyside has had it is not surprising that occasionally there is industrial trouble there <e> <s> an objective study of the industrial troubles on merseyside by any fair minded person would show that it is not the only place which has industrial problems <e> <s> compared with some other places in the country including the south-east the record is pretty good <e> <s> having said that it would be churlish as a merseysider not to express my gratitude which i am sure is echoed all over merseyside today for the placing of the order there <e> <s> i am sure that the tribute paid by the minister to the moderate element in merseyside will be well justified and that merseyside will return a good job on time <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not put down my name for this debate because i did not intend to speak on second reading but it slowly dawned on me as the debate proceeded that there would be no opportunity for me to speak at the committee stage because that essentially deals with the detail of the bill and i do not want to deal with its detail <e>", "<cs> my lords surely that was not the question <e> <s> the question was what were the criteria for determining demand <e> <s> do the government know <e> <s> if they do not know those criteria will they make sure that they are told <e>", "<cs> my lords so in effect the members of this chamber can take it that the control of the supply of services in london is no longer in the hands of any elected representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether or not the government have given consideration to the possibility of suing some of the commercial organisations in the united states which supplied contaminated blood <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether the government would consider giving consideration to recovering some recompense for the damage that has been caused in this country by the commercial organisations in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies on behalf of the government perhaps i may introduce another angle to the story <e> <s> i do not know how many of your lordships were personally involved in the whole sad sorry story of the changes that were made to transport undertakings in this country <e> <s> however i was involved right from the very beginning when the first ptes were formulated by a labour government to which i was of course very sympathetic <e> <s> then we had the tory government messing about with local government followed by a labour government making other changes <e> <s> slowly over a period of a quarter of a century we have now arrived at this situation <e> <s> of course there were disputes between one and the other as to how it should be done but one theme ran through all the organisations <e> <s> it was a principle to which i gave my personal support <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary to thank the intitiators of a debate in this house <e> <s> i do not intend to do so <e> <s> i regret very much that the debate is taking place because the infantile mentality that infects some parts of the city of liverpool thrives on publicity <e> <s> the labour party did not make mr hatton the liverpool people did not make mr hatton the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting it was not true that trevor jones set up an <e>", "<cs> it is not a joking matter my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord assure the house that if in order to give preferential prices to heavy users the electricity industry cannot easily get the money needed the cost will not be passed on to domestic consumers and that if any subsidy is required it will be met by central government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord ensure that the house receives a report as to how any money is found by the cegb if it sets this privileged price <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether or not he can give us examples of the reckless spending to which he referred previously or like the rest of the government does he rely on newspapers as evidence of the need for change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i did not hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i tender my apologies if i did not hear the minister correctly <e> <s> however i checked with my noble friends and like me they did not hear any examples of reckless spending <e> <s> they heard the minister mention south glamorgan and then go on to refer to newspaper reports on reckless spending <e> <s> does the minister have any examples of reckless spending other than south glamorgan <e>", "<cs> my lords then with all due respect may i point out that it was not a very satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have an assurance that there is no lead poisoning occasioned by the activities of certain brave men pursuing such savage creatures as pheasants and grouse by the discharge of shotguns which contain lead pellets <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand that the minister is telling this chamber that the lead contained in shotgun pellets has different properties as regards sinking from those of lead used by anglers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i heard the noble viscount say that the question of the residual debt of the welsh water authority would be a matter of negotiation with the new limited company <e> <s> if that is so may i ask how does the noble viscount expect a company to make an offer for the undertaking if it does not know previously the intentions of the government as to the residual debt <e> <s> secondly may i ask him for an assurance that the position of the large number of domestic dwellings smallholdings and farms in the welsh hills which up to now have been drawing water free of charge from natural springs will not be worsened <e> <s> thirdly what will be the situation in regard to rivers that run over national boundaries <e> <s> in fact do we take it that the new authorities will have powers which will cross national boundaries <e>", "<cs> what about the issue of the residual debt my lords <e> <s> mine was a specific question <e> <s> do the government have any knowledge of what they intend should happen to the residual debt <e>", "<cs> my lords when i receive an answer to my question perhaps i can cease to ask it <e> <s> the question was quite specific <e> <s> can we have a firm assurance from the government that at no time in the future under the new organisation will those farms and smallholdings and domestic dwellings to which i have referred be adversely affected <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to carry out an inquiry to see what adverse effects the development of the canary site may have on the rest of the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords does it involve that kind of thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether the government would be prepared to carry out an inquiry into the possible adverse effects the development of this site would have even on some parts of the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that the noble lord lord cledwyn was not asking why the no-disruption agreement was not achieved but whether or not the government were willing lo try again to get a no-disruption agreement <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness the minister if this is so <e> <s> arc they willing to try again <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that a sense of injustice still rankles among the civil servants at gchq and that the government should try to settle that feeling by attempting to achieve another no-disruption agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the reply of the noble lord the minister to the noble lord lord mellish does he not agree that the excessive development taking place in the south east of england is denuding now and will denude completely any prospect of further investment in the northern regions of this land <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord cannot see any relationship between the developments in the south east and developments in the northern regions of this country i suggest that he should resign <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that there is a large body of opinion in the country that says that we already give too many concessions to london airports and to airports in the south as opposed to those made to airports in the north <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening the debate my noble friend lord wells-pestell made a speech which i considered to be permeated with emotion and morality <e> <s> it represented to me the best of british politics because my noble friend knew the difference between wealth and money <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord orr-ewing who must have thought that he was the sweeper-up of this debate <e> <s> i did not put my name down because i wanted to hear how the debate went <e> <s> it has been very favourable to televising the house and i am certainly not opposed to that <e> <s> as more than per cent <e> <s> of the committee have spoken or will speak before the debate ends one should not be surprised that the debate is taking the shape of complete support for the committees recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords all the noble lord would have to do would be to press a button or a switch <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may say this <e> <s> i may be mistaken but i do not believe that the noble earl has answered the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> may i present a scenario and then ask the minister for his view on it <e> <s> written into my memory of liverpool and its misfortunes is the position of the liverpool docks and harbour board <e> <s> that organisation had the responsibility of looking after liverpool docks <e> <s> to hold shares in the liverpool docks and harbour board was considered to be very much a blue chip holding <e> <s> it was almost considered to be a government-backed organisation <e> <s> but over the years the control of that organisation got into the hands of people who used liverpools docks and the vested interests of those people created such a situation that finally central government had to step in and establish a new set-up <e> <s> it was quite simply done <e> <s> those people manipulated the harbour dues and everything else in order to ensure that their own trading interests in liverpool docks were safeguarded and it led ultimately to the downfall of the organisation <e>", "<cs> the noble earl would not be delighted if he had anything to do with shipping in liverpool <e>", "<cs> the noble earl should not be delighted because it was an extremely serious situation <e> <s> it was not caused by government doing anything it was caused by government and other bodies not doing something <e>", "<cs> may i urge on the government and in particular the minister today that this should be taken as an urgent matter <e> <s> the history of liverpool airport is a long and complex one <e> <s> i think that at this stage i should refute completely the suggestion made by the noble lord lord tordoff that liverpool was behind manchester in deciding to set up airport facilities within that town <e> <s> when manchesters airport facilities were as some people mentioned a tent and a nissen hut liverpool already had a permanent airport terminal and a very good one too <e> <s> although it is not my role to defend the city fathers of the s i must congratulate them on that although they were certainly not of my political persuasion and left the place in a hell of a mess <e> <s> that was the start <e> <s> it was not long after the war when everybody realised the real need for an airport <e> <s> the need for an airport does not start because someone says we shall put the airport there <e> <s> that is where we used to have the ocean terminal and that is therefore the logical place for a new airport <e> <s> an airport is justified by the activity that is contained within the area of that airport <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord lord tordoff accept from me that had the liberals had their way in merseyside and liverpool there would not have been any airport about which to talk <e>", "<cs> if the liberal party in merseyside and liverpool had had its way there would not have been any airport about which to talk <e>", "<cs> i apologise to members of the committee if they consider that i am wasting time or keeping them here unnecessarily but i should like to go back <e> <s> the only reason i sketched in the history of liverpool airport and the north-west was to demonstrate the importance of something happening in liverpool so that they know where they are <e> <s> the history is quite clear <e> <s> liverpool city council set up an airport committee and maintained an airport <e> <s> the reorganisation of local government came in and there was no dispute on merseyside <e> <s> the whole of merseyside agreed that an airport was not really the right subject for a city but a sub-regional affair that should be handled by the county <e> <s> the county took it over <e> <s> then the government were warned that if they went ahead with the local government bill there would be some particular problems with regard to liverpool and the airport was one of them <e>", "<cs> i wish the noble lord would not confuse manchester with liverpool because there is a fundamental difference between the problem in manchester and the problem in merseyside <e> <s> the fundamental problem is million <e> <s> manchester is making a profit <e> <s> who would turn that down <e> <s> it has a good future for the reasons that i outlined <e> <s> it is in the centre of the conurbation <e> <s> liverpool has not a good future <e> <s> it has to be held in reserve in case manchester cannot provide the necessary airport facilities in the future <e> <s> while it is being held in reserve perhaps we can settle my part of this debate anyway by asking the minister whether he will please write to me to tell me what his department intend if the five district councils cannot agree to take over the responsibility through the pta for floating any loans or investments in the airport <e> <s> will he tell me how he will handle the situation when the pta has been compelled to take over the airport but has been denied the jobs that the principal councils and the other authorities have in the airport structure <e> <s> if the minister will write to me i can use his words in quotations <e>", "<cs> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> may i refer the minister to subsection <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> there is no dubiety about the situation <e> <s> if one of the authorities wishes to question the advisability of having to form a company the secretary of state has the power to say in that case that it need not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course not aware where the noble lord lord selsdon is employed but if i was the chairman of his company and i heard that speech i would immediately promote him and offer him double the salary <e> <s> from that point of view i thought that it was an excellent speech <e> <s> however from another point of view it was completely and utterly weak <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister has been poorly briefed on this point <e> <s> there are two ways of dealing with a leak and may i after about years experience in fitting gas cookers and so on point out that if there is a responsibility on the part of the new gas authority to deal with a leak that may merely consist of turning off the gas at the point of entry to the property <e> <s> what some noble lords are wondering about is the cost of repairing the pipes that occasion the leak <e> <s> is it true to say that the only obligation put upon the new authority is to turn off the gas if there is a leak on the customers side of the meter <e> <s> if that is so why cannot somebody in the realms of government advise the minister properly <e>", "<cs> all that means in other words is that the gas board have to turn off the gas <e> <s> may i ask a question arising from something the minister said earlier because i am rather concerned about the way he so blithely threw the responsibility for having no amendment at all on to the fact that the present gas authority have said that they will continue certain practices and the minister relied on that as an argument <e> <s> will he tell me and the public generally where it is in the bill that he relies upon a future body british gas plc to carry out any promises or commitments made by the present organisation <e> <s> the real truth is that there cannot possibly be any <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but that is not what the minister said earlier <e> <s> the minister was dealing specifically with the fact that work would be carried out on the consumers premises for half an hour free of charge which is done now <e> <s> if one notifies the gas board now that there is a leak they will go to the consumers premises and if they are occupied by somebody who is evidently poor or elderly and only a small amount of repair is needed on the premises to the consumers fittings the gas board will carry it out free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords the case against the unfair subsidisation of stansted has been well and truly made <e> <s> i should not have intervened in the debate if it had not been for the last intervention and that of the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> it is right to say that the opposition to the subsidisation of stansted arose because someone wanted to build an airport in areas of high unemployment <e> <s> the last speaker said that plainly <e> <s> that is not the reason for the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i almost feel that i should apologise for intervening again in this debate <e> <s> we had a long discussion on merseyside and liverpool airport during the committee stage of the bill and i thought that we had taken steps then which might finally resolve the difficulties in merseyside and in my mind <e> <s> i asked the minister to write to me and explain the exact situation in regard to liverpool airport particularly in the light of the not very remote possibility that the district councils will not consider that they have a role to play in regard to liverpool airport <e>", "<cs> the noble lord in describing as superficial the account of the report by the noble lord lord melchett could have taken the opportunity as i assume that he has read the report of showing us how that was a superficial view <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount for demonstrating quite clearly his acknowledgment that it is a question of how much money you can get out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl the minister agree that there is a large body of opinion in this country which would not view with any great alarm the abolition of religious education in schools in view of the past and present association of religions with violence and terrorism <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord who laughed would care to ask a question <e> <s> would the noble earl consider liberalising the law in this regard and recommend his right honourable friend to take some action to change the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather intrigued by the use in the ministers statement of the words democratic accountability <e> <s> i should like to ask him to elaborate on that because democratic accountability means different things to different people depending on where you sit in the spectrum of the political life of the nation <e> <s> what would be the attitude of the minister to democratic accountability regarding a mandate the government are claiming was taken almost four years ago in view of the fact that the last recent by-election and the results in many <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the minister does not pay much attention to the democratically-expressed will of local authority electors <e>", "<cs> well my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord lord mellish has difficulty in understanding what i am saying but i should not have thought that many people shared that difficulty in this house <e> <s> let me first of all say that i have not said that this regeneration so called is too big <e> <s> i have merely said that in my opinion there are grounds for belief that the regeneration is of the wrong kind <e> <s> it could well be that the proper regeneration for london docklands would be to solve the housing problem that exists in the south-east and in london and thereby in one fell swoop also solve the problem of the commuting periods in the present city of london <e> <s> that may be an answer <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord mellish does not agree that that is an answer but i do not expect him to agree <e> <s> the only time he has ever visited merseyside is once in about years so he is very biased towards the city of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to introduce that note but it is a factor and in listening to the speech of the noble lord lord hacking one could almost detect the belief that london is the most important place <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be right i do not know <e> <s> we talk of passengers at peak time <e> <s> what will be the consequences of that upon the travelling public in the city of london <e> <s> certainly we shall not get to the situation where either london regional transport or the london docklands development corporation or anyone else will in fact study the consequences of these proposals upon the rest of the south-east of england and upon london <e>", "<cs> my lords will financial institutions really continue along the lines that part of their operations shall be in the city of london and part shall be on canary wharf <e> <s> is that what we are being told <e> <s> i do not believe that is credible <e> <s> i believe that in time pressure will be brought to bear from those people that they should be sited in one place so that they can carry out their duties more efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords of late years the noble lord lord mellish seems to have become an expert on what he has just shouted out <e> <s> some of the stuff i have heard from him in the past few months has been worse than rubbish <e> <s> furthermore it reveals a complete inability to have an open mind and to see what is happening and be prepared to admit that perhaps the london docklands development corporation of which he was the deputy chairman has gone too far in one direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware that i am one minute over the time of the mover of the second reading of the bill <e> <s> he also has a right of reply and i hope that he will be able to answer some of the questions that i have posed <e> <s> however i am also aware of the fact that people who are oriented towards london cannot be bothered to speak about the problems that affect the rest of the country and that whenever anyone spends minutes talking about those kinds of problems and the real problems that stem from the over-capitalisation of the south-east those people get impatient and want the speaker to <e>", "<cs> no i am not giving way my lords <e> <s> i have just been told off for taking too long <e> <s> i gave way to the noble lord lord mellish who robbed me of two minutes and i am not giving way to anybody else <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to contribute let him put his name on the list and let us hear him <e> <s> there is bags of time

hope that the committee will agree <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that i should now move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> before doing so i think i

london docklands <e> <s> am i also right in assuming that in taking that decision they had the full facts in front of them which i imagine the minister replying will also have in front of him <e> <s> can he tell the house how many jobs have been created on merseyside during the life of the development corporation how many full-time and permanent jobs have been created and what was the cost per job <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister make sure that before any necessary amendment is moved the house is informed of that <e>", "<cs> i just do not know where this chamber is going for the simple reason that the minister adamantly refuses to explain what he means by consultation <e>", "<cs> i heard the minister say that half-a-dozen times and the net effect of it is this <e> <s> if one takes people who are tenants on a housing estate and ultimately per cent <e> <s> agree to private ownership and per cent <e> <s> disagree what does that mean <e> <s> it means that two people on that housing estate have decided the fate of those houses that is of course if the minister decides to go with the majority <e> <s> i am suggesting that that is absolutely wrong when <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask this question <e> <s> i understood him to say that where a tenant does not have the right to buy that would prevent him from going into the home buying market <e>

practice of going into the private selling market <e> <s> they can make excessive profits and move that way into the home buying market <e> <s> there is nothing to stop a person or does the minister suggest that there is <e> <s> who is in a property which he does not have the right to buy voluntarily leaving and going into the private market if he so wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not deny at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not know i was out of order <e> <s> i do not deny at all that if one measures the success of the home buying market by the number of houses sold it has been a success

apologise if i now rise in the wrong place but i understand that it is convention if ones name is not already on the list of speakers to interpose between the last speaker and the reply to the debate <e> <s> that is why i am speaking now <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that a noble lord had made a snide remark to which i should want to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister persuade the government urgently to seek an assurance about the future of the leyland truck site <e> <s> will he undertake to present to this house the result of that as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords if

wharf should he diverted elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords some members of this house will be blaming me for the fact that they are not about their social duties at this hour of the

rather surprised that the noble lord is not aware of what his department or another government department is telling members of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that the noble lord

more minutes discussing the fundamental nature of the problem <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord wants to hurry up so that he can be a teller because his party agreed that we should have had a public

possible to say whether there is any requirement for the concessionaires to carry insurances against any eventuality and for any risks involved in constructing or operating the tunnel <e>", "<cs> this amendment illustrates problems to which i referred but did not mention this afternoon when i moved my amendment for re-commitment to a select committee <e> <s> of whom does one ask the appropriate questions <e> <s> it has been suggested that the people around waterloo were wrong in not having discussions with british rail <e> <s> however there are perfectly logical reasons for that <e> <s> they

i was referring to suggestions made elsewhere that the people of waterloo were wrong in refusing to have discussions before the issue was settled <e> <s> they did so refuse and it was alleged that they should not have done so that they should have had discussions before the fundamental issue of whether or not there was a terminal at waterloo was considered <e> <s> theirs was a perfectly reasonable attitude to adopt <e>", "<cs> where does the noble lord obtain his evidence that british rail have seriously studied the possibility of having the terminal for london on the perimeter of the london underground system <e>", "<cs> in other words i take it that the noble lord does not know whether british rail have examined it or not <e>", "<cs> let me make it absolutely clear again to see if anybody will deny this <e> <s> i am not suggesting for one moment that british rail have not looked at alternatives within their plans <e> <s> i am suggesting quite clearly perhaps the minister can settle this that apart from the stations they themselves referred to and they themselves established the criteria for looking at both in the exhibition and in the written communications which i have had from british rail they did not consider an alternative outside those limited spheres <e> <s> if they did they certainly did not communicate it to me when i asked them <e> <s> if they did it certainly was not in their plan and if they did it certainly was not at the exhibition at waterloo <e> <s> if the minister knows that they did perhaps he will tell the committee <e> <s> i do not believe they did and i believe it is worthy of consideration <e>", "<cs> i feel that i have been provoked by the mention of liverpool <e> <s> i put a plea to the minister <e> <s> having customs on trains is important to a place like liverpool <e> <s> british rail has said that unless there are customs facilities on trains we are not going to get a through service <e> <s> it may well be that british rail will conclude that at the moment potential traffic between liverpool and the continent is not great enough to warrant that service <e> <s> i have bitter memories of the attitude of british rail where commercial justification for projects is involved <e> <s> i remember being invited to the opening of the container terminal at seaforth <e> <s> it was a marvellous terminal <e> <s> anyone who wants to see a good container terminal should go to seaforth <e> <s> knowing of the railway line that ran under the overhead railway and serviced all the docks on seaforth i looked first for the rail link between the container depot and our national network <e> <s> it was not there <e> <s> british rail had pulled it up saying there was no immediate justification for that service <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it was far-sighted or not but i know that five years later after i protested <e> <s> british rail put it back in at considerably greater expense than the cost of taking it out <e> <s> it was absolutely shortsighted nothing else <e> <s> it was unforgivable <e> <s> and here is british rail beginning to establish the ground for no service from liverpool <e> <s> i made the point this afternoon that one of the difficulties is trying to persuade british rail to provide these infrastructures in advance so as to encourage development in places like liverpool where the government intend to put a lot of investment <e> <s> that is one of the things we ought to be encouraging <e> <s> from that point of view i plead with the minister and the government not only to accept what the amendment says but also to encourage british rail to establish these facilities in order to attract investment to places like liverpool <e>", "<cs> i shall attempt to be more agreeable

certainly have not yet received a reply <e> <s> i also asked for information as to the obligation on the concessionaires to insure against all risks in the tunnel <e>", "<cs> there were two phrases

pointed out the matter of reasonable cost of insurance <e> <s> that is not a new point <e> <s> the only matter which the minister has raised which is new to this debate also inside the agreement is that it will be the intergovernmental commission that will decide whether the tunnel should be insured <e> <s> i accept that and i accept it as meaning quite deliberately that the intergovernmental commission will decide the issue of reasonable cost <e> <s> it should be on the record that the minister has said that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is evident that the words used by the minister namely that the agreement of the intergovernmental commission must be subject to the agreement of both national states mean what i said they meant <e> <s> therefore the government cannot escape the blame for

amendments and this clause deal only with trade unions <e> <s> i do not think that anybody on the other side of the chamber any employer in this country or any student of history over the past years

convince the minister however <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will allow me to intervene perhaps i may say that i am getting rather puzzled <e> <s> it seems to me that the principle is that somebody on this side of the committee is saying that the powers accorded to the secretary of state in this bill are not specific and they could be applied to situations other than privatisation <e> <s> that is

sure that this committee would want to know what kind of reorganisation it was <e> <s> so the minister must satisfy us that it is specific to those powers <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that anyone in this committee would wish to detract from the statement which the minister has given <e> <s> he said that he was concerned about the environment <e> <s> that has nicely wrapped up the question of water <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble earl is satisfied that the national rivers authority will look after that problem which may arise from privatisation <e> <s> i am not satisfied <e> <s> does that lead us to the conclusion that when the main bill comes before this chamber that the minister will support the idea of a body similar to the river authority and responsible for the

of the electricity supply <e>", "<cs> on the one hand we have the minister replying that the amendment is imprecise and then on the other hand he is refusing to reply to a request for some precise information from the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> the fundamental problem with coal contrary to what the noble earl has just said is that it cannot compete successfully because there are two things which the british coal industry does not have namely vast surface mining of coal and the availability of cheap child labour in the exploitation of coal resources <e> <s> so it is impossible

government as to what is to be tested on the computer <e> <s> before that information is given will this house have an opportunity to hear the details of the governments recommendations for testing <e> <s> will that include the examination of the present delays caused by using one-man operated buses in london <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept from me my question deals with the whole terms of reference of this particular firm that what the noble lord lord marsh said is perfectly true and seems to agree with the concept that in studying the traffic problems of london one must also study the whole aspect of movement and congestion in london including land use <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he accept that the convention to which he referred is a parliamentary convention <e> <s> it refers to whether this house should upset a decision of the elected chamber <e> <s> as this bill has not yet been to the elected chamber does he not agree that the convention hardly applies <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the point <e> <s> i asked the noble lord whether he agrees that the convention is a parliamentary convention and <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill will say you cant go to a football match when you like unless you have an identity card <e> <s> let us follow through the idea of the identity card <e> <s> there is no doubt that if quintin hogg

extra-parliamentary body without that body being responsible to parliament <e> <s> that is what the bill does <e>", "<cs> that player was found guilty of kicking an opposing player in the face <e> <s> that is considerably worse than any of the woundings i have seen here <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord could answer the questions i asked when both noble lords were out of the chamber <e> <s> first were the association of chief constables approached <e> <s> were they consulted <e> <s> secondly if so what was their reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords when i added my name to the list of speakers i did not envisage that the debate would concentrate on knocking british rail as it has until now <e> <s> the noble lord lord somers referred to our heritage from british rail <e> <s> he made no reference to the history of that heritage <e> <s> there was a time when people could walk on to a railway station and find plenty of porters <e> <s> there was a time when the different regions appeared to look after the customers <e> <s> there was a time when the capitalisation of the railway system was so large that in manchester the authorities could afford to build the longest railway station in the world because one line was competing with another for custom <e> <s> at one time the authorities could even afford to build special railway stations for important people who owned land and who therefore formed an obstruction <e> <s> there are several instances of that on merseyside <e> <s> railway stations were deliberately built to serve one or two of the landed gentry <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> that answer seems to reflect the attitude of the government in regard to what was described by the noble lord lord young two years ago as the dispersal policy <e> <s> the government do not seem to know what they are doing in regard to siting offices in london and do not even seem to know who is to occupy them <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that we get into a greater mess every time the government issue a statement about the siting of government offices in the capital city <e> <s> it is a sad state of affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that this is a sad state of affairs <e> <s> the noble lord lord young said two years ago that we were expecting a statement of government policy on dispersal but now when a member of this house wants to find out what is happening in regard to the siting of jobs which will cause greater congestion in london where people can hardly move it is regrettable that he has to seek such information from the <e>", "<cs> my lords prudence involves the continuous payment of per cent <e> <s> more to staffs in london when they could be obtained much cheaper outside the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the adjournment of the bill i am puzzled as to why we have two motions before the house at the same time <e> <s> however let that go i am no expert on parliamentary procedure <e> <s> i am very disturbed indeed about the talk of some people having discussions in private <e> <s> the suggestion is that within half an hour we shall reassemble and discuss the matter again following some discussions in private <e> <s> i do not know with whom and i do not even know the difficulties that have arisen from something which the noble lord lord renton said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that at this stage we should enter into any details of the bill at all <e> <s> to my mind this is the parliamentary way of saying that parliament has had its say <e> <s> it has now constituted a bill and we should consider it as a whole <e> <s> looking at it as a whole we should ask are we satisfied or not satisfied that this meets the wishes of parliament and the people of the country <e> <s> i look <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not mind being criticised <e> <s> i did not say that i wanted consensus <e> <s> i merely pointed out that some people in political life will not wear it at any price <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give an assurance that the government will be just as sympathetic to the preservation of modern day amenities and listed buildings around the kings cross area when that development takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago central government commissioned a report entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the numerous people who obtain their drinking water and other water supplies from the highlands of the united kingdom and have done so for hundreds of years by tapping a variety of wells and using pumps at no cost can the minister give the house an assurance that the situation in regard to those supplies of water which hitherto have been monitored by the local health authority will remain under the bill as it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what steps will be taken to monitor those supplies <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the intention of the amendment is to delay anything <e> <s> it is merely an attempt to seek another way to resolve what has become an extremely difficult problem <e> <s> i did not speak on second reading and i did not attend the second reading debate <e> <s> we did not decide on second reading to do anything with this bill <e> <s> we merely conformed with practice <e> <s> the second reading debate was allowed to go through without a division <e> <s> therefore it is stupid to talk about this chamber deciding the fate of the bill <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord mellish knows the extent to which i am sincere in that apology <e> <s> the story in liverpool at the moment is exactly the same as the story in london <e> <s> seven miles of dockland were built in liverpool by employers who were concerned only with their own interest <e> <s> the employers constructed narrow roads and terrible housing <e> <s> that extended right up to the docks <e> <s> now we have literally had to when i say we i mean the people of liverpool shift four of those seven miles of docks out of the town of liverpool <e> <s> the docks are no longer in liverpool <e> <s> to all intents and purposes they are now in bootle which is part of sefton <e> <s> we did that with the co-operation of the dockers and the employers <e>", "<cs> the liverpool docks have achieved high productivity <e> <s> people ask why dockers have privileges <e> <s> the answer to that is that historically dockers have endured filthy conditions and bad treatment by the employing classes <e> <s> that is why dockers have privileges <e> <s> the nation realised that without the introduction of some decency into labour relations in britains docklands we should never have sustained our effort in the war let alone have won it <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down will he make clear that his reference to the association of chambers of commerce did not include the merseyside chamber of commerce which registered its opposition to the legislation <e>", "<cs> once again the minister has a very poor brief <e>", "<cs> the merseyside chamber of commerce is a damn sight nearer liverpool than the one in the association in london <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will give way i should like to ask her to say a little more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly in order according to the rules of this house <e> <s> i asked to interrupt the noble baroness and she kindly gave way <e> <s> i now intend to ask the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that nobody justified the subsidies from one set of people to another <e> <s> for many years i was a member of the merseyside and north wales electricity board <e> <s> it was constituted as such for a specific reason <e> <s> in the setting up of the electricity industry it was understood that one of its vital jobs was to provide power to those who until then had been denied it <e> <s> the whole of the north wales area was then enabled to become an efficient supplier for produce and dairy food to the merseyside area <e> <s> that subsidy was paid by the large users in merseyside to the hill farmers in north wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to abolish prosecution for the expression of opinion on matters of religion <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> i am rather mystified although i admit that i did not read the clause before i entered the chamber <e> <s> i have had experience in local government because for five years i was the leader of merseyside county council i was also chairman and leader of liverpool city council <e> <s> we had a policy of always establishing a close liaison between the officers and the membership in those bodies <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e> <s> does that mean that the bill is intended to order local authorities to organise their administration as the government want <e>", "<cs> the minister did not reply to the other point that i raised <e> <s> however it is now clear that the government intend to tell local authorities how to organise their affairs <e> <s> one of the reasons liverpool organised its affairs in the way i described was to reduce conflict between chief officers and members and chief officers <e> <s> if the government intend to tell a council such as liverpool no you must now designate one head they really are heading for trouble <e>", "<cs> i saw the proposal for the first time today and quite frankly i am still trying to understand the calculations <e> <s> i am sure that the minister knows them and will be able to explain them <e> <s> the merseyside chamber of commerce made representations to the government about the uniform business rate <e> <s> perhaps the minister can give us the governments response <e> <s> those representations were made some time ago <e> <s> if he cannot it means that all this talk about the governments consultation with the people who will be affected comes to nothing <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i heard amendment no <e> <s> azu mentioned then thought i heard amendment no <e> <s> w mentioned <e> <s> regardless of the list that is furnished to the parties i understand that each amendment has to be read out individually before it is passed <e> <s> when was amendment no <e> <s> azv taken <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that that is in accordance

the amendments should be read out and discussed individually not as consequential nor out of turn <e> <s> i am not privy to any arrangements that have been made <e> <s> all i know is that the marshalled list shows amendments nos <e> <s> azu and azv <e> <s> it does not go on to amendment no <e> <s> azw <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i am an unsuitable person to speak to this amendment because i believe that it is the first time in my life that i have ever supported a chamber of commerce in its desire to improve things for its members <e> <s> in this regard i speak not only on behalf of the merseyside chamber of commerce and industry but also the national association of chambers of commerce <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps he will say whether he agrees with me that since in particular and well before the companies to which i referred have paid more than they should have done if re-rating had taken place over the whole of the country <e> <s> what does he say about the money that they have lost in that regard <e> <s> does he not think that someone somewhere has a right to compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether the figures for regional aid include moneys paid to the merseyside dockland development corporation <e> <s> if so will he say what the amount was how much each job has cost the government and why the government have not yet responded to the auditors report that they received more than two years ago regarding that corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not putting down my name to speak <e> <s> however i did that quite deliberately because i do not profess to be an expert in this subject neither do i claim to have had a revelation which enables me to determine when life begins and when life ends <e> <s> so i cannot get myself involved in these high-sounding debates about that subject <e> <s> i leave that to people who have these revelations and put themselves on a level where they can decide truly moral issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i promised myself that if i was to speak late in the debate and might repeat what had already been said i should choose not to speak because of the time factor <e> <s> i shall try not to repeat anything that has been said but i should like to pick up one theme that has been established by almost every speaker <e> <s> noble lords on all sides of the house i see that most speakers are not members of my party have pointed out the need for a co-ordinated policy with regard to transport <e> <s> it is a theme which a quarter of a century ago the government of the day enshrined by allowing a man named buchanan to prepare a report for the nation entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to repeat the words of the noble lord lord houghton and add a note of warning <e> <s> i believe that once the authority is set up it will be carefully watched <e> <s> when anyone whether or not in public life finds the authority making a mistake he will be only too ready to come forward and make the authoritys life difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord realises that if he refuses to answer a simple question there is bound to be procrastination in the chamber <e> <s> will he kindly answer the question did we sign the agreement or not <e>", "<cs> my lords the question seems to contain an implied connection between the visit to the prime minister and the subsequent approval of the takeover with regard to the sultan supporting the panel <e> <s> that is a very serious implication <e> <s> will the minister give an assurance that he will look into the matter and submit a further report to this house in order that we know whether there is some substance in the allegation <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked this question will the minister himself look into the matter and then give the house a report on his findings <e>", "<cs> my lords i persist in my question which has not yet been answered <e> <s> will the minister look into the implications of the question asked this morning and report back to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to be very sensitive <e> <s> i did not put the question to him <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady fisher mentioned that she thought one of the problems was that people are rather inclined to treat the tunnel as merely another commercial job <e> <s> in my view that attitude was epitomised by the noble lord lord pennock when in the final stages of his speech he said i will now turn to the subject of the motion <e> <s> as we all know the subject of the motion is
