["<cs> my lords as a newcomer to this august assembly i have become speedily aware that contributions to its debates are made by those who are experts and often masters of their subject <e> <s> being in neither of these categories and making a maiden speech i rise to my feet therefore with some nervousness and trepidation <e> <s> i am however somewhat fortified by the knowledge that the subject is a many-sided one and i am grateful to the noble lord lord glenamara for making it wide enough for me to take a deep breath make the plunge and hopefully <e> <s> not sink in the process <e>", "<cs> my lords in making this first contribution to an economic debate i rise to my feet with some diffidence and this diffidence is deepened by the heightened indignation and passion which has been engendered in the debate so far <e> <s> i recall in a previous incarnation as a spokesman for the cbi being invited to present an economic analysis to the union-sponsored members who dwell in another place <e> <s> at the end of a short peroration i concluded by recognising that some of my opinions were unlikely to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by offering my apologies especially to the noble earl lord lauderdale and to the noble lord lord kearton for not being present at the outset of this debate <e> <s> unfortunately like the noble lord lord ezra i had a long-standing prior public commitment which was quite inescapable and which prevented me from being here <e> <s> i also wish to offer my thanks to the noble earl lord lauderdale for introducing to your lordships an important debate just when it is particularly timely and opportune <e> <s> i wish also to congratulate the noble lord lord kearton for presenting a report which shows scientific analysis business acumen and most important of all the fearless presentation of economic implications in a manner which we would expect from him <e>", "<cs> having listened to the debate may i beg leave to withdraw my amendment in the light of my noble friends assertion that the points which we have raised will be covered in the code of guidance which is to be introduced <e> <s> but bearing in mind my earlier somewhat unworthy suspicions of such documents would it be possible for us to see at report stage some outline of this code of guidance so that we can be reassured on the points which we have sought to represent this evening <e>", "<cs> i underline the ministers predicament which is as my noble friend has said that a per cent <e> <s> reduction is not very much especially compared with the per cent <e> <s> reduction for agriculture and the per cent <e> <s> reduction for the domestic ratepayer <e> <s> but per cent <e> <s> reduction is nevertheless million for the simple reason that industry is at the moment paying out billion and that is such a high figure in the first place <e> <s> i can therefore understand the predicament but perhaps the government can also understand that the nature of the predicament is such because industry for too long and too largely has been paying this enormous imposition <e>", "<cs> with that assurance from my noble friend the minister we are very happy to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the happy responsibility of congratulating the noble lord lord astor of hever on the occasion of his maiden speech <e> <s> i admired the moderation and breadth of his vision and the balance of his outlook <e> <s> i have found that has not always been shared by the fellows and colleagues of his own county <e> <s> i was tremendously impressed by his recognition of the value of the project to the whole of britain <e> <s> that augurs well for his future contributions in this house <e> <s> i hope that he will continue to express them with the same balance fluency and articulacy of expression <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help my noble friend on this question of ventilation <e> <s> it is a fact that in addition to having two tunnels through which the trains pass there is a central ventilation tunnel a service tunnel <e> <s> at intervals of not more than metres there will be doors between the central shaft and the main tunnel providing ventilation and allowing for the expansion of heat coming from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that i begin with an apology <e> <s> it is an apology for the fact that owing to a long-standing engagement which was fixed many months ago and my unsuccessful efforts to have it changed i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> i hope that the house will accept my apologies <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon years <e> <s> when i first became involved in the cbi years later i took the opportunity to check the figures <e> <s> the standard of living in real terms of the man on the shopfloor had doubled <e> <s> at that moment the profitability of manufacturing industry in this country was per cent <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i am happy to withdraw the amendment and shall not move amendments nos <e> <s> b f and za when we come to them <e> <s> i rest satisfied that the business interests have made their points to the government <e>", "<cs> may i take that further <e> <s> as an erstwhile chairman i have had a number of secretaries working with me and on many occasions as the noble lord has mentioned these things have happened <e> <s> the efficiency the effectiveness and the way in which the secretary performs his tasks is a direct reflection on his calibre and ability <e> <s> usually one has secretaries of calibre and ability <e> <s> to buttress the system with some legislation in this way would not make it more effective <e>", "<cs> if we are to present ourselves as a phalanx in a somewhat arrow-headed formation perhaps i may follow in the discussion <e> <s> i should like to begin by reassuring the noble lord lord williams that i am reading my own notes <e> <s> that presents a difficulty <e> <s> many years ago more years than i care to think i presented an essay to my tutor <e> <s> he scribbled some hieroglyphics on the bottom <e> <s> i went along to see him and asked could you please decipher the heiroglyphics <e> <s> he looked at them for a long time and rather shamefacedly peered over his <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin with regret and disappointment to apologise because i am unable to stay until the end of this most important debate <e> <s> i suspect that that is more disappointing to me than to other noble lords <e> <s> however i have a long-standing engagement with some important russian officials who are here on a very tight schedule which was not possible to be rearranged <e>", "<cs> my lords i conclude very quickly but with great conviction that we have come a long way <e> <s> our colleagues in the community recognise the great environmental and economic advantages and are proceeding even faster <e> <s> we have a great deal on which to catch up <e> <s> i hope that it is not too late <e>"]
