to do <e> <s> i will read very carefully all that has been said in the debate because there have been some excellent speeches and i shall want to study very carefully and discuss their contents with my colleagues <e> <s> may i add my own congratulations to my noble friend lord coleraine for a splendid speech <e> <s> as the the noble lord lord robbins said it was certainly of a kind to make one want to listen to him much more and this i look forward to doing in the future <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe really got into the nuts and bolts of the whole field of housing <e> <s> how dearly i would like to have a whole debate for some hours so that we could talk of that <e> <s> because frankly that really is what housing is about about people about the needs about the economics certainly for if we ignore that we get nowhere <e> <s> but at the end of the day it is also about what have we achieved what were the mistakes what was the slum clearance as opposed to the rebuild of the housing scene <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships recent debates have shown there are a number of grave defects in the present arrangements for securing a well balanced transport system for london <e> <s> my right honourable friend is looking forward to the report of the select committee on transport which is examining these issues and is himself giving consideration to the capacity of the glc to discharge effectively the transport functions with which they are vested <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this
