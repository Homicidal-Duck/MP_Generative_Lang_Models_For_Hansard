["<cs> my lords i should open by declaring my interest as chairman of a company which is applying for a pro <e>", "<cs> may i support lord melchetts amendment without rehearsing all the points he made <e> <s> there are two matters to which i should like to draw attention <e> <s> first we are dealing with a part of the bill covering public rights of way <e> <s> these public rights of way have been enjoyed as the noble lord lord houghton reminded us by increasing numbers of people from outside the locality in which those rights of way exist <e> <s> this is one of the difficulties with which landowners and farmers have been confronted <e> <s> it is a real difficulty <e> <s> they find masses of people rambling and coming across their land exercising their rights of way <e> <s> it was quite different in ancient days when it was merely local people making their way along the well-known paths <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly glad to take part in this debate on broad environmental matters within the eec both because in a professional capacity i have been concerned in some aspects of how the commission works and because i have the honour to be chairman of the environment committee of the royal society of arts and a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution <e>", "<cs> there is one point i should like to ask the minister about and it relates not to the privileges of the passport holders but to the effect of the passport on the countries to which a visit is made <e> <s> i certainly support the thoughts behind the amendment but what worries me about a passport which states in effect that the holder belongs to the dependent territories is that it does not identify with any particular country <e> <s> as i understand it one of the basic concepts relating to how a passport works in a country being visited is that the receiving country it matters not which it might be france germany or belgium is aware on the face of the passport that in certain circumstances the holder can be deported <e> <s> under the concepts of international law as generally accepted the country which issues the passport is bound to to accept the return of the holder <e> <s> if the passport refers merely to british dependent territories what will be the effect on the immigration authorities in france germany belgium or wherever it might be <e> <s> in those circumstances will there not be difficulty in regard to receiving visitors for the reason that i have given <e>", "<cs> in our earlier debate on statelessness much sympathy was shown by all sides of your lordships house including the government front bench concerning the position of those who are stateless and it was said that everything which it was within the power of the government to do should be done for the benefit of such people <e> <s> the question that seems to arise from this amendment is what is the distinction between statelessness and british overseas citizenship in the circumstances indicated in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the royal commission i am very grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for introducing this debate not only because it gives an opportunity for discussion of the report but also because the noble lord himself has great knowledge in the field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord kearton as are all other noble lords who have spoken for giving us the first and last opportunity of considering a report from the commission on energy and the environment <e> <s> this report for which we are so grateful to the noble lord lord flowers and his colleagues in the commission demonstrates the misfortune which the country suffers from the governments decision to let the commission fall into abeyance <e> <s> among many others i have been concerned over some eight to years past that such a commission should exist for the very purposes which are emphasised in this admirable report which perhaps i might summarise as educational of the public with a view to establishing the options open with regard to an energy policy within the field of course to which this report relates <e> <s> there is no other body of equal or like authority of which i know other than this which could undertake such a task <e> <s> i shall refer later in my remarks to the underlying theme of this report which is precisely the purpose of the report to educate and stimulate consideration of these matters so that people may be better informed <e> <s> it is a great disservice to the country that this commission should be put into abeyance <e>", "<cs> i would be frightened to accept that suggestion my lords because the accounts of public companies are already over-long and so complicated as to be almost incomprehensible <e> <s> i fear that if one had inflation accounting related to energy we should all go mad but the noble lord raises an interesting point <e>", "<cs> of course i accept the offer of an open and sympathetic hearing <e> <s> as the position of solicitor-advocates was raised which i did not previously realise as long ago as october it is remarkable that the consideration has not been able to be given to this matter until now <e>", "<cs> in the light of the statement made by my noble friend lord mishcon i will withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the comments of the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble lord lord cockfield <e> <s> of course i will look into the matter further and if necessary contact the noble lord lord cockfield with such material as there is on the point <e> <s> i would only add that i have found it extraordinarily dangerous particularly in the field of charities and elsewhere to ascertain what the law is according to what are the rules of the inland revenue in relation to a particular situation though i was much interested in what the noble lord had to say on that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join others of your lordships in expressing my gratitude to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for introducing this debate <e> <s> i have the honour to be a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution which is presently engaged in a study of lead <e> <s> the commission is likely to publish its report some time after easter <e> <s> it would therefore be entirely inappropriate if i were now to say anything about the conclusions which the royal commission is likely to reach in relation to the vexed question of lead in petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords as the th speaker in this debate i wish that i could start by saying something which would fall agreeably on the ears of the noble lord lord bellwin but alas <e> <s> i cannot <e> <s> what i would say however and i think i shall be the first to say it is that this bill comes at a strange time <e> <s> for it was only the other day as it seems late last year that the government indicated that they were going gradually to bring into force part ii of the control of pollution act eight years after it was enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a rare privilege to sit in the committee under the noble earl lord cranbrook and the noble lord lord ashby who are two of the most distinguished scientists and specialists in this field that we have in this county <e> <s> i thought that in speaking this afternoon i should not trespass upon the ground which they have so admirably covered together with the ground which the noble baroness lady birk has also covered but confine myself to a rather different field <e> <s> i thought that i would confine myself to the title of the debate and indeed of the report that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i therefore beg to move the motion formally <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains for me to thank most warmly those who have participated in this debate <e> <s> we have had from the noble lord lord strathcarron an interesting survey of the history of the motor industry an its achievements over the years <e> <s> we have had from the noble earl lord shannon an expert assessment of the technical factors with which we have been confronted <e> <s> we have had wisdom from the noble lord lord nugent which of course we also enjoyed on the committee <e> <s> with regard to the noble lord lord energlyn i must disclaim any intention on the part of the committee under my chairmanship of going into oil and water mixtures <e> <s> this is the sort of thinking which i have been trying to avoid with my own car but it is nice to know that our report innocently though it was composed has led your lordships into these remote pastures <e> <s> we look forward to ever new fields <e>", "<cs> my lords it may interest your lordships to know that before putting into the report our recommendation that it should be debated we ourselves had considerable discussion on the ground that this was a technical subject and that perhaps it was of interest to rather few people although we had no doubt as to the importance of the matters under discussion <e> <s> but in the end we agreed that it was appropriate for debate and i can only say that the debate which has taken place today seems fully to have warranted that conclusion including if i may say so the reply of the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that at this hour i should resist the temptation put in my way by the noble baroness lady white to speak at length on environmental quality objectives and standards <e> <s> however perhaps i may be permitted to make a passing reference to them <e> <s> i should like to confine my remarks to a short point raised perhaps incidentally by the noble baroness that public sector responsibilities presently exercised by the water authorities are to be transferred subject it is true to certain safeguards to private companies established for the purpose of making a profit <e>", "<cs> my lords my task at this stage of the debate is merely to thank those who have participated in it <e> <s> it has been extraordinarily encouraging to find the spread of expertise and knowledge which has been available this afternoon <e> <s> the noble earl lord cranbrook is a leading scientist and his support for so many of the conclusions that we reached is extremely encouraging because of his great knowledge of the subject <e> <s> i was glad to note that he dwelt a little on the alternative proposals that we had listed towards the end of the report and to which i had no time to refer in my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a humbling experience to follow the moving speech of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the privilege of being in the united nations when the law of the sea convention was being debated and when the united states announced its decision not to participate in that convention <e> <s> it was a sad occasion for most of those who were present <e> <s> it may seem churlish to refer to the many years that so many people have been pressing for the extension of the limit of territorial seas to miles when the decision that is so much to be welcomed has <e>", "<cs> my lords my task at this hour of the evening is to thank those who have participated in the debate and that i do wholeheartedly <e> <s> perhaps i may say to those noble lords who were kind enough to refer to my period as chairman of sub-committee f which was formerly sub-committee g how grateful i was for their kind remarks about the time i had held the chair <e> <s> it has been an interesting and sometimes exhausting time not exhausting because of people but because of the subject which was sometimes difficult to grasp <e> <s> it has been an interesting period of four years <e> <s> now the time has expired i shall watch someone else taking over that burden <e> <s> i have greatly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady nicol for enabling us to debate this very important subject <e> <s> she was quite right in thinking that i had intended to speak about waste and in particular about the eleventh report of the royal commission on environmental pollution on which i had the privilege to serve when it dealt with the subject of managing waste and the duty of care <e> <s> however within the very close time limits available today that seemed too large a subject to embark upon <e> <s> it occurred to me that a narrower subject might be more suitable namely the very radical changes for the better made in systems of environmental pollution control over the past year or so which have received very little attention <e> <s> i congratulate the noble earl on the new position he has taken up <e> <s> i hope that what i say may come in a friendly way to his ear <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can she confirm that a draft code of practice for spraying exists and tell the house whether it is intended to have statutory force <e> <s> if so when will that draft code be submitted to parliament and will it require those who are about to spray to notify neighbours so that precautions may be taken <e> <s> will those carrying out spraying have to keep records of the chemicals used <e> <s> does the minister agree that since the regulatory authority in that matter is not the local environmental health department the address of the regulatory authority might well be placed with the environmental health department which is where members of the public will normally seek assistance and advice <e> <s> can the minister also <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> could he give us some indication as to when the government have it in mind to legislate and whether pending such legislation they will take steps to ensure that development does not take place on common land which has been or is about to be deregistered <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the honour of serving on the committee which produced the report that is being debated today <e> <s> it is appropriate that i should start by referring to the noble baroness lady serota who has just spoken and say with what awe and admiration those of us who sat under her chairmanship did so <e> <s> her formidable knowledge of public administration was extremely helpful to the committee as well as her capacity to assemble in her mind and sort out the wealth of detailed information which we were given in the evidence which appears in the full report <e> <s> in saying these things i believe i am speaking for all other members of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not a member of this committee <e> <s> having worked closely with the noble lord lord kearton over the years in different fields i can well imagine the vigour with which he chaired it <e> <s> i have read the report <e> <s> as one would expect <e> <s> it is complete and interesting to the last sentence <e> <s> i am prompted to take part in the debate not from any expertise in relation to the structural funds since i have none but arising from the fact that only last weekend i attended a symposium at which the commission was strongly represented on the need for strong and successful policies for regional development to complement the achievement of the unified market in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to take the opportunity afforded by the question tabled by the noble lord lord rippon to consider the european foundation and perhaps slightly to extend the points that he raised <e> <s> i regard it and have done so for many years as of the very first importance that the european foundation should become fully operative and in being <e> <s> i should like to indicate to your lordships the wider factors which have been in my mind <e> <s> it is remarkable that members of the european community have been working ever more closely together in the fields of trade commerce industry and so much else <e> <s> but no suitable institution exists for carrying on on a community basis objects which we in this country call charitable <e> <s> indeed the lack of an institutional basis has given rise to great difficulty in establishing co-ordinational activity in social education and similar fields based upon the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> may i emphasise in supporting the amendment the other words to which the noble lord lord campbell of alloway did riot refer and which worry me most <e> <s> the words are no reasonable cause to suspect <e> <s> it is not that he did not suspect <e> <s> the burden of proof there is the same as the burden of proof relating to not knowing <e> <s> but this introduction of the words no reasonable cause strikes me as an entirely new element <e>", "<cs> my lords due to the speed with which your lordships dispatched the business concerning self-governing schools in scotland i made my opening remarks as it were before dawn <e> <s> it is indeed over five and a half hours since i did so <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord ackner was kind enough in his opening remarks to refer to the relaxed way in which i served as chairman of the committee <e>", "<cs> that is charming <e> <s> noble lords will have some flavour of the nature and vigour of the debates that we had in committee from the vigour of the debates in your lordships house today <e> <s> it would be a mistake to think that the unanimity and i shall come to the one point of dissent which pervaded our conclusions was the outcome of a series of compromises as i have heard suggested <e> <s> it was not so <e> <s> the unanimity arose out of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wolfson made some very kind remarks about my father and his work not only in relation to his great family foundation one of the great foundations in the country but also in relation to his report of which led to the legislation of which the noble lord lord renton spoke earlier <e> <s> since those days the number size and diversity of charities has grown enormously and so have social changes affecting trustees <e> <s> it is to that topic that i should like to speak this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords as the last speaker on the list in this long debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the last speaker but three i should state my starting point particularly having heard many of todays interesting speeches namely that we in the legal profession have not been and are not now living in the best of all possible worlds <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may support the point made by the noble lord lord renton relating to the incorporaton of such a provision consistently with the provisions of the electricity bill as long ago as as he mentioned <e> <s> the current approach to these problems surely is that environmental consideration should be integrated into all activities particularly into those having significant effect on the environment of which coal mining is one <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the bill <e> <s> for years from to i had the privilege of serving as a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution <e> <s> during that period we published reports on matters which are reflected in parts i and vi of the bill <e> <s> it is a matter of great satisfaction that at long last those matters are before parliament for consideration <e>", "<cs> this amendment seems to produce a very constructive idea which has been tried successfully in the european community <e> <s> since there has been a succession of environmental action programmes within the ec which i believe could well form a model for government here <e> <s> the action programmes i think we are on the fourth at the moment deal with broad principles but they also deal with fairly specific programmes without being too detailed so that questions of philosophy are certainly mentioned for example the emphasis on the preventative approach which has now been accepted everywhere but which some years ago was not accepted in this country at all <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is in order for me to support the definition contained in the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> it coincides <e>", "<cs> there has been a fairly full debate on this matter with very expert assistance from the earl of halsbury the chemist and others and i do not think that this is the time to pursue the matter further <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am dissatisfied with that reply <e> <s> there is no indication as to the source from which this advice is to be derived <e> <s> it seems to me as i said very unsatisfactory that the advice should be written by the administrative arm of the department of the environment <e> <s> the minister gave no indication as to whether the sector of hmip will be charged with this task <e> <s> it is a very unsatisfactory situation which is causing a great deal of concern not only among the regulatory authorities but among those who are charged with the duty of carrying out waste disposal functions <e> <s> therefore i must consider what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for confirming my worst fears <e> <s> however he made a clear statement and for that i am grateful <e> <s> it is a step backward to revert to the pre- position under which those in charge of administration at the doe should be responsible for the production of these papers <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his response and am cheered by the fact that he is taking seriously the question of adequate financing of the waste regulation functions of the local authority <e> <s> it would be a misfortune if in one waste regulation authority area or perhaps in all the economic pressures were such that the charges imposed on the licensees were applied for other purposes and the standards intended to be achieved were not achieved because sufficient money was not applied <e> <s> unfortunately there are other instances where that has happened <e> <s> i hope that that situation will not arise and in that belief and hope i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has made two points to which i should like to refer <e> <s> he has not answered the point that the damage as he would say feared rather than effective to the physical environment is not as i understand it included in the definition in clause <e> <s> that was the main point to which i wished to draw attention <e>", "<cs> i am much in favour of plainer language <e> <s> my amendment has the merit of being somewhat shorter <e> <s> however i understand that the noble earl feels it impossible to accept the amendment and i therefore beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may supplement what the noble lord lord lewis said about information <e> <s> there are two factors which drive one towards the necessity for the provision to the public and i shall return to what i mean by that in a moment of the maximum information about what has been released and the grounds upon which that decision has been made which may go beyond what may be necessary in other contexts in particular dealing with the chemical field <e>", "<cs> this amendment has a certain relationship to the question of public information <e> <s> the issue of information available to the public sounds innocent <e> <s> it would be true if it were limited to the ordinary person such as me expressing views on particular gmos and their consequences <e> <s> that would carry no weight at all <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear the minister say that he is considering each particular release as requiring a specific consent <e> <s> that is extremely cheering <e> <s> however i think some reality needs to be brought into the discussion in that at the moment we are at the stage of dealing with trial releases in the course of development <e> <s> inevitably the supposition in ones mind is that the developer of a particular gmo is the party who knows all about it and who is probably extremely knowledgeable and competent to carry out the release <e> <s> in that context it may not be necessary to consider the matter of registering <e>", "<cs> i recognise the point made by the minister that consultation is extremely desirable but surely there is a limit of time within which it must take place <e> <s> it would not be bad for governments to be under some pressure to hasten the process forward <e> <s> as i said earlier if the period of a year the first anniversary is thought to be inappropriate for the reason that he has mentioned or otherwise then let us have the second anniversary <e> <s> to leave it completely open-ended in view of the experience we have had with environmental legislation closely allied to this is unsatisfactory <e> <s> i therefore feel that i must reserve the position for a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as time is getting on i shall confine myself to brief remarks <e> <s> however before i do so i too should like to refer to the outstanding maiden speeches which have been made this afternoon <e> <s> the outstanding feature which struck me was the positive affirmative and hopeful tone of those speeches on the subjects chosen by the speakers about which they clearly know so much <e>"]
