["<cs> my lords may i first say that i draw comfort from the final remarks of the noble viscount in his suggestion that hopefully the government will not let dust settle on this report <e> <s> as the noble viscount has already said i think we have had one of the outstanding debates of this session and i must thank all noble lords who have taken part in it <e> <s> it has stood up to the highest standards of your lordships house <e> <s> i must especially thank and add my praise for the speeches made by the noble lord lord scanlon and the noble earl lord ilchester <e> <s> recognising beforehand that they were engineers i in my opening remarks predicted the standard of their contributions and i must say that i feel fully justified in what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank all the noble lords who took part in this debate <e> <s> i think it has shown the value of this house in being able to contribute to such a subject in such a masterly manner and showing such a wide range of experience <e> <s> i should also like to thank the minister for his response <e> <s> i now realise of course that we should probably have called him for evidence if i had known about his previous activities in the field <e> <s> i am sure that the select committee will study the ministers words most carefully <e> <s> finally i think i can fairly say that the select committee on science and technology is now set on a road to play a significant part in the future proceedings of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking at the end of this wide-ranging debate and i am not sure that it has kept strictly to the subject in the vernacular of recent debates in this chamber i feel that most of the foxes have been shot <e> <s> therefore i shall attempt to confine myself to a few remarks which may add to the debate as it has proceeded <e> <s> like the noble lord lord thorneycroft i too believe in a mixed economy <e> <s> i believe that there are overriding questions with regard to matters such as the defence of the realm and the economic well-being of the nation as a whole which simply cannot be left to the interplay of the so-called <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply briefly to that the need for that particular quotation was in inverted commas the word haemorrhage and that did come from the government <e> <s> that is what started this whole series of comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to find an ally <e> <s> in the most part the public sector provides goods and services to the rest of british industry and to the public and is directly affected by their economic circumstances <e> <s> this direct effect means that both the private and the public sectors are finding great difficulty in maintaining control considering the unprecedented rate of decline that has been wrought on the british economy as compared with the conditions pertaining in the rest of the western world <e> <s> the point i am making here is that it is the rate of decline which is affecting so much of british industry <e> <s> it is a rate which has not been seen in this country this century possibly and certainly it is a rate of decline which is greater and faster than that in any other part of the western world at the present time <e> <s> it is a totally unstabilising situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point entirely and i do not take back one word of what i have said <e> <s> if i could comment shortly about the speech of the noble lord lord harris of high cross and i am sorry that he had to go i think that when he reads in <e>", "<cs> my lords can i suggest to the noble lord that we ought to concentrate upon this point in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a real problem of trying to rescue the whole of british industry and that includes the public and the private sectors <e> <s> all that i am suggesting in this is that we deal in a civilised manner with the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may comment on a point that the noble lord lord nugent of guidlford made it also reflects on what the noble earl lord gowrie and the noble lords lord thorneycroft said there is a misunderstanding about the question of private companies going into bankruptcy <e> <s> there seems to be a feeling and it came through in this debate that that was the end of those companies <e> <s> but it rarely is <e> <s> in many cases for many of them it is the beginning of a new life <e> <s> they go through receivership <e> <s> there arc very few of the major british companies that go in effect into bankruptcy or however one may wish to express it who do not come out on the other side of the receivership in some form or another <e> <s> there is continuity in that situation <e> <s> it is not quite the dichotomy with the public sector that is being suggested <e> <s> one can give a whole list of companies who went through <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not agree more <e> <s> the shareholders lose out just as in the public sector <e> <s> it is just the same <e> <s> finally could i say to the noble lord lord winstanley on his comments about the remarks by members of the labour party in the other place that we now have a large cross-section of opinion in our party and you choose which bit you like <e> <s> thank you my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too thank the noble earl for introducing the first subject of todays debate and for doing so in such a wide-ranging speech based on his very considerable knowledge <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble earl on the timing considering the importance of the subject relative to the events in another place yesterday <e> <s> may i also thank my noble friend lord shackleton for introducing the second subject of todays debate which is such an important part of the overall question of britains competitiveness in world trade <e> <s> of course one has to acknowledge lord shackletons considerable contribution to the furthering of the generation of standards <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good for the soul <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just make a correction on that point <e> <s> i did not really say that people were buying them <e> <s> the point i was making was that these were being held up as outstanding examples of sunrise industry <e> <s> i consider them to be a very minor market compared with the more massive markets available in the more stable industries that exist in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords first on behalf of the opposition may i congratulate the noble lord lord sherfield and his colleagues for the timely and thought-provoking report that we are considering this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord for his explicit and wide-ranging introduction as it certainly will reduce the length of time that noble lords may have to listen to my speech this afternoon which is always a useful start <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i draw attention to something i said in my speech and ask whether he would give it consideration <e> <s> the problem about the european activity is that it has no defence dimension <e> <s> we all know that very much more money is being spent in this area in the defence field than in the civilian field <e> <s> it really is a crippling situation that the european community should be attempting to drag europe if you like into the new technology without this other dimension being available to them <e> <s> will the government give consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be easy to start another debate in the light of the many points that have been raised but i have no intention of doing so <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> this has been a wide-ranging helpful and authoritative debate in fact this has been your lordships house at its best and that is an important aspect which is not fully understood by the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply but is he aware that there is extreme public concern about all questions relating to toxic and hazardous waste <e> <s> is he also aware that it is now twelve months since your lordships committee reported <e> <s> i should have thought that that was sufficient time even for the department of the environment to come to some conclusion on the matter <e> <s> the recent programme on bbc television in which a number of noble lords on the government benches took part i think highlights the need for much more urgent action <e> <s> may i also ask how when in the fullness of time decisions will i hope have been made those decisions will be disseminated to the public <e> <s> they need in effect to be notified to the various local authorities and to the contractors <e>", "<cs> may i therefore ask that some thought be given to the issue of a waste management paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for that reply on behalf of the government <e> <s> may i say on behalf of the select committee that we look forward with some considerable interest to the detailed reply which will eventually be issued by the government <e> <s> i thank noble lords who have taken part in the debate for their contributions on this subject <e> <s> it is significant that a report of this nature which i consider to be of considerable importance could be debated at the level at which it has been debated this afternoon only within <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to thank the noble lord lord lucas for his kind remarks regarding the time that we spent together on the subcommittee <e> <s> they were very interesting sessions and i am sure that we both learned a great deal during that period of time <e> <s> i also wish to thank the noble lord for his announcement of the study on technology transfer which is at present taking place and i look forward with great interest to its outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour in the evening and with another debate to come i do not intend to respond to detailed points in the debate except to say two things <e> <s> first i should like to say thank you to everybody who has taken part in this debate this afternoon <e> <s> the debate has measured up well to the high standards of your lordships house <e> <s> it has been a most useful debate for expressing and widening the questions that were raised by your select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank the noble lord lord sherfield for introducing this timely debate this afternoon <e> <s> as a contribution to this debate i should like to say something about the importance of the work of the science and engineering research council but before i do so i want to say a few words about the problems which set the scene and underline the significance of this research council <e> <s> i doubt whether there is anyone in the house this afternoon who is not aware that last year we went into negative balance of trade in manufactured goods for the first time in recorded history <e> <s> but i wonder how many of your lordships are aware of the alarming rate of change from positive balance to negative balance <e> <s> in we had a positive balance of billion in we had a positive balance of billion and in a negative balance of billion <e> <s> so far this year including the third quarter we have already recorded a negative balance of billion and the third quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to delay the house this evening as another debate has yet to come on <e> <s> perhaps i may first of all say thank you to everybody who has taken part in the debate tonight <e> <s> i believe that this is the house of lords at its very best a demonstration of the real value of your lordships house <e> <s> i wish to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham on a most interesting and apposite speech <e> <s> i look forward to many more contributions from him in the future <e> <s> i thank the minister for his reply this evening and i look forward <e>", "<cs> i want to talk about waste disposal and in particular about hazardous waste disposal <e> <s> your lordships select committee on science and technology is very considerably concerned regarding those aspects of the local government bill that deal with the arrangements to be made for the disposal of both domestic and industrial waste when seven of the present waste disposal authorities are no longer in existence <e> <s> the committee do not believe that the arrangements outlined in clause and elsewhere in this bill are desirable or even viable <e> <s> that is the reason for amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i will first correct the noble lord <e> <s> i was not a member of the select committee of review <e> <s> i was chairman of the select committee on hazardous waste <e> <s> it was in that capacity that i spoke today <e> <s> the noble earl lord cranbrook was the chairman and no doubt he will be delighted during his comments on this amendment to give the noble lord lord campbell the answer to his question <e>", "<cs> when we carried out the detailed study of hazardous waste disposal at the time in some of the more difficult waste to be disposed of was transferred to england for disposal <e> <s> i do not think that i am giving away any secrets in saying that <e> <s> i do not think that it has differed since <e> <s> i would ask your lordships not to misunderstand this <e> <s> there are some very good facilities for doing this in england <e> <s> that is how some of the more difficult material was dealt with <e>", "<cs> there is a difficulty here <e> <s> the system of co-disposal in this country means in effect that you cannot deal with household waste as a separate issue <e> <s> having put down the household waste on the land fill sites you then pour in the hazardous waste which the household waste helps to digest and dispose of <e> <s> you cannot really discuss as separate issues household <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord also implying that the select committee deliberately cooked up some sort of plot <e>", "<cs> if it is i will apologise to the committee at the right time <e> <s> however as far as i am concerned i have it in black and white <e>", "<cs> i understand there is considerable support for the rest of the bill except for one issue and one issue alone that is hazardous waste <e>", "<cs> by rumour and another sort of suggestion that report has been hanging around for a long time <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down may i ask him to clarify something <e> <s> i would not like it to stand on the record as i heard it <e> <s> i seem to understand from his words that he gave more priority to the commercial possibilities of waste recycling than to the urgent necessity of a proper control of hazardous waste <e> <s> that is how it came over to this side of the committee <e> <s> i should like the minister please to explain that point <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords as the gregson of the gregson report i think it is very sad indeed that your lordships house finds itself once again discussing this issue <e> <s> i cannot really believe that the government should be so ill-advised as to pursue such an unsatisfactory course of action <e> <s> after the reports of two select committees of this house the report on waste disposal of harwell the premier research centre in europe and in the past few weeks the report of the governments own hazardous waste inspectorate i should have thought that the government would see the error of their ways <e> <s> i find it unbelievable that they have been advised to follow their present course <e> <s> i can only conclude that somewhere along the line dogma has somehow intruded but this cannot be a political issue because the issues involved are surely far too serious and important <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can explain how that will help co-disposal which means operational activity both in the disposal of hazardous and domestic waste together <e> <s> what he has described is an advisory body but that does not seem to meet the case at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord stockton for proposing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i am also delighted that a man of the stature and eloquence of the noble earl should raise this subject which i consider to be of absolutely crucial importance to the future well-being of this country <e> <s> unfortunately due to a long-standing previous engagement and the long list of speakers tonight i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will forgive me for leaving early <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of this debate i should simply like to thank all noble lords who have <e>", "<cs> my lords i first add my congratulations to the noble lord lord dainton for what i should describe as an engineer as a class a maiden speech <e> <s> it is indeed a measure of the value of this <e>", "<cs> my lords we are once again in debt to the noble lord lord sherfield for initiating a debate on science and technology in the house <e> <s> now that the froth has been blown away from the financial sector it has exposed the extent to which we as a country depend on the manufacturing sector to support our underlying economy <e> <s> although that underlying economy shows some of the short-term manifestations of strength in the medium long-term there are already danger signals strongly indicating the potential disasters that lie ahead <e> <s> the most important danger signal is the drastic deterioration in our overseas trade figures as demonstrated in the excellent report of your lordships committee chaired by the noble lord lord aldington <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all add my tribute to our chairman the noble lord lord shackleton on a difficult job well done and also to the clerks and expert advisers who served the committee so well <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there are now reports of imported hazardous waste going to landfill with co-disposal <e> <s> is the noble earl also aware that a committee of this house strongly recommended that imported hazardous waste should not go to landfill <e> <s> further is he aware that that waste will now have to be monitored for at least years by local authorities at the expense of the ratepayer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that landfill sites for waste disposal are becoming scarce in the most critical areas of the country where there is a maximum amount of waste for disposal <e> <s> is it not the case that the vast increase in such waste from overseas means at the end of the day that british industry and the british taxpayer will have to pay considerably more for the disposal of waste by the more expensive means of incineration and other methods of disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has recently announced details of legislation to be introduced by the government to amend the waste disposal law which is important for the control of imported waste <e> <s> is the minister aware that some of those amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first pay tribute to the noble earl lord cranbrook and the noble lord lord nelson for the excellence of the reports that we are discussing <e> <s> their opening speeches covered the matters of concern in the reports and i should certainly not wish to duplicate those remarks <e> <s> however there is one issue on which i should like to reinforce what the noble lord lord nelson said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this private members bill was sponsored in another place by the member for lewisham and deptford ms joan ruddock <e> <s> we should all be grateful that she used her early place for private members bills in that way <e>", "<cs> duty of care <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank the minister for confirmation of the communication that we had earlier this week from the department <e> <s> secondly i thank him for his good wishes for the passage of the bill that is now before the house <e> <s> i also thank the noble baroness and my noble friend for their support <e> <s> i look forward to future co-operation and support from all parts of the house in getting this bill through its further stages and back to the other place for final clearance <e> <s> therefore i ask the house to give the bill a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i confine myself to two points <e> <s> first the minister replied explicitly but this is only an enabling amendment <e> <s> it does not cause the government to do anything if they do not want to do so <e> <s> secondly i can see no reason if someone is qualified under the transport acts to carry special substances why that endorsement cannot be entered on the list of carriers <e> <s> i can see no reason unless the department of the environment and the department of transport actually exist in two different countries with very poor communication <e> <s> in my opinion there is no reason whatever why that endorsement cannot be transferred across to the carriers list to give those small companies that have to deal with the burden of the duty of care which i fully endorse some very good information with which to find a carrier with confidence because that is what the law requires <e> <s> therefore i must press my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in his speech to the conservative conference the chancellor of the exchequer stressed the importance of the manufacturing sector above all others <e> <s> is he aware that the chancellor of the exchequer also stressed that reducing our overseas negative trade balance was the most important way of steering this countrys economy <e>"]
