try my best to enlighten him from these benches and hope that he will be happy at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> during the debate many questions were raised and some very fine speeches were made if i may say so and i felt that i should take into my brief a little more just to keep members opposite waiting a little longer for their next debate <e> <s> i certainly endorse the select committees concluion that the existing mfa agreements should be implemented effectively and speedily <e> <s> it has been suggested that this is not happening in that imports from some low-cost sources are running higher than the agreed quota levels <e> <s> it is however misleading to compare the level of a quota with import statistics for any particular year <e> <s> the latter figure includes certain elements such as the previous years shipments imports re-exports and imports allowed under free circulation which do not count against quotas <e> <s> in the case of formal quotas the united kingdom authorities will not issue import licences in excess of agreed levels and there have been no breaches of united kingdom quotas <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the department of industry <e>", "<cs> my

withdraw the order because it was not quite right <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace asked me one or two questions in particular where the views and ideas originated <e> <s> the industry as a whole was informed about the changes <e> <s> the order stems from a request made to the department by the scottish knitwear council in mid- for the revocation of the order owing to the high cost of their knitwear <e> <s> they felt that they needed that revocation as i understand it in scotland there are many more smaller firms than there are in england <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are now very happy to allow the industry to adopt this voluntary method of raising the levy <e> <s> that is what <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are eventually looking towards lifting them <e>", "<cs> my lords

hosiery receive money for research <e> <s> it is vitally important at this stage because of the vast competition which this country faces with the rest of the world <e> <s> i think that i have answered most of the questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the propellants explosives and rocket motor establishment westcott is involved in a large number of continuing defence research and development projects and there are no plans to change the use of the site <e> <s> the noble lord will however be aware that the functions of the defence research and development establishments as a whole are

my noble friend <e> <s> i have a feeling though that he is going a little wide of the original question <e> <s> it is difficult to draw any comparison between the pay of british and russian soldiers and their conditions of service since the structure of the two armies is very different <e> <s> moreover the official exchange rate does not give a realistic reflection of the purchasing power of the rouble <e> <s> if however the noble lord pressed me for a figure i should have to say that at present rates of exchange a field marshal is paid almost double the salary of a marshal in the soviet army and that the lowest paid british private earns approximately times more than a conscript in the russian army and times more than a russian soldier who has volunteered for regular service <e> <s> but i must emphasise that such direct comparisons should be treated with caution <e> <s> with regard to the international labour organisation i must inform my noble friend that this organisation is outside military matters and that therefore i am unable to answer that particular part of his question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with the noble lord in what he says about those days but not about the

overlap <e> <s> they enjoy many privileges including free medical services and free housing and special prices for consumer goods in the shops <e> <s> this is on top of the wage they get <e> <s> that

british military equipment on a case-by-case basis <e> <s> we are willing in principle to supply some items of equipment subject to our international obligations <e> <s> it is not the practice to

been taking place for some months <e> <s> the next step is to await the outcome of these negotiations <e> <s> we have no political reservations about the sale of the harrier to china and the chinese

harrier sales and sales of other defence equipment <e> <s> we shall not allow other countries to dictate the terms of our relations with china <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can take the noble lords last question first and say that i cannot answer it <e> <s> i have no idea whether the soviet union has been against the sale of arms or defence equipment to china <e> <s> it is now some three years since the chinese came to us for arms and equipment and the situation is now entirely in their court <e> <s> we have given them the details and demonstrated equipment to them <e> <s> it is now up to

lord has gone clean off the question at the moment <e> <s> from my brief i am dealing with the sale of arms for defence purposes to china <e>", "<cs> my lords it is like selling any product to any buyer if they do not want to buy no matter what the quality or the price there is no way that they will buy it <e> <s> there is an old saying that you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it

to the noble lord lord blease for what he has said and contributed to this important order <e> <s> i noticed that he was a little alarmed about the way the redundancy money was being raised only slightly <e> <s> i think he really wanted a much higher figure <e> <s> the new limit if he had heard me earlier contained in these draft orders follows the terms of the order agreed by both houses last december amending the redundancy payments provisions of the employment protection consolidation act <e> <s> there is a well established practice of raising such limits by sums as is convenient

not discount the possibility of improving the pelican crossing and have indeed authorised before receiving this report experiments to test whether some minor changes in the timing and phasing of the signals would be beneficial <e> <s> these experiments will take place at pelican sites in greater london <e> <s> but i must emphasise that pelican crossings are already a valuable aid to pedestrians wishing to cross busy roads and the elderly should certainly not be discouraged from using them <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree that we are all in danger at times not only the elderly but the young

oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords our investigations show that the capital costs of second-hand vessels including the costs of refitting and conversion tend to be somewhat less than new construction <e> <s> however the experience of much higher support costs and greatly reduced life expectancy of second-hand ships greatly outweighs the initial cost advantage and leads to higher through-life costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord lord shinwell has said but the cost of second-hand vessels would depend upon their age condition and other relevant factors <e> <s> clearly the older and poorer the quality of the second-hand ship the greater would be the cost of conversion <e> <s> however we would expect the combined purchase and conversion costs of secondhand vessels to be a little less than the capital cost of new purpose-built minesweepers <e> <s> many of these trawlers that unfortunately and regrettably are now lying idle in ports around the british isles are fairly

must ensure that the basis for vehicular use of a cycle track rests on there being clear lawful authority for that use <e> <s> we shall therefore assist if i may say so my noble friend in the drafting of his amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to come in at this point because there is some difficulty about who is going over whose land and what path it is <e> <s> the subsection as drafted seeks to give an additional protection where a footpath crosses agricultural land that is crosses farmers fields and could disrupt agricultural activites <e> <s> if one finds a path going from left to right across a field and one deals with it that way one will find that it is disruptive to a farmer <e> <s> therefore the government fully accept that the additional protection is needed for agricultural activities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could try to help the noble lord lord beaumont <e> <s> the government are very serious about this bill as it affects the safety of cyclists the blind and the partially sighted <e> <s> we are trying to <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble kinsman has it two ways <e> <s> first there are already tracks that go into what he knows as the forest for recreation and there

not the exact power to do it <e> <s> therefore i think that we must go on as we are in this particular instance <e> <s> i do not think we have lost the point <e> <s> i think it is essential that we look at the highway code as well <e>", "<cs> i did hear the noble baronesss speech at second reading <e> <s> it is considered at this stage of the bill that it is unlikely there will be many claims under the new procedures or that substantial sums will be involved <e> <s> under the clause as drafted disputes go to the land tribunal and section of the highways act is applied <e> <s> none of the sections of the highways act to which section is applied place time limits which is what i think the noble baroness was asking about in relation to the submission of compensation claims and it would be considered appropriate to err in favour of a possible claim rather than specify a time limit in respect of claims made under clause <e> <s> we have been advised there would be no great difficulty in assessing compensation in case of retrospective claims <e> <s> i wonder whether that helps the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> having listened to the noble lord lord wedderburn speaking to this amendment i should like to say i am glad <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord howie for voicing his anxiety over what is a new member <e> <s> i think that what he is worried about is a member who has recently joined <e> <s> it is deliberately flexible <e> <s> union rules will be the test unless they are manifestly absurd <e> <s> it is flexible in that regard <e>", "<cs> i can help the noble lord because i think that a great deal of common sense has to go into the rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the government fully accept these amendments <e> <s> it would be wrong to take away peoples existing legal rights without compensation or to appear to condone unlawful use of a cycle track <e> <s> my noble friends amendments ensure that the bill does neither of these things <e> <s> i commend them to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the explanation given by my noble friend <e> <s> the government accept the need for this amendment and support it <e> <s> it was never intended that the cost of conversion or maintaining a cycle track should be borne other than by the highway authority <e> <s> we also accept the need for consequential amendments and will give my noble friend whatever assistance he needs in the drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove for if i might say so ploughing his way through this amendment because in many ways it is a sensitive and tricky situation <e> <s> there are two points i wish to stress <e> <s> i have to go fairly quickly and i hope that i shall alleviate or obliterate some of the problems that have arisen <e>", "<cs> if i may come to the assistance of my noble friend the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my

cycles and so on this bill is indeed very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry but this is an unstarred question <e> <s> may we hear the noble lord lord dunleath <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are mindful of the unemployment projections and policy prescriptions of all major forecasting bodies but attach no special importance to those of any single body <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord hatch for reading all these articles because i notice that gradually the writers of them are believing more and more that the government are on the right course to try to help ease unemployment <e> <s> the recent budget maintained a consistent approach of a medium-term financial strategy and a resolute anti-inflation policy which is the only way to secure sustainable growth in output and in jobs <e> <s> it abolished the labour tax on jobs and the national insurance surcharge <e> <s> it reformed corporation tax to the benefit of industry and investment in a way which removed the existing arbitrary discrimination against labour <e> <s> it also raised tax thresholds per cent <e> <s> in real terms which i am sure the noble lord will agree will improve incentives and ease the unemployment and poverty trap <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not actually see that report but i heard about it <e> <s> the most important thing is that we must keep the rate of inflation under control <e> <s> in so doing we must invest in industry and in the end and it is a long-term policy the figure of unemployment will gradually we hope come down <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the report to which the noble lord refers relates to a number of countries in addition to the united kingdom <e> <s> if we are going to try to control the unemployment position we really must contain the situation <e> <s> i congratulate the government though i am a member of it on doing so <e> <s> as it is all we have to do now is to make sure that investment in industry and the economy is right and then the unemployment level will not only be contained but will eventually come down <e>", "<cs> my lords a few years ago we inherited quite a number of problems from the party opposite <e> <s> the idea then was that we were going to have seven eight or million unemployed <e> <s> in fact i congratulate the government on three million at this stage <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a genie <e> <s> i gather that the noble lord lord hatch is going off on holiday to africa and if he cares to leave his address with me i shall write to him and let him know <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> i have a strong feeling that it is not necessary <e> <s> this amendment is similar in some respects to amendment no <e> <s> which has been debated already during the committee stage <e> <s> i think that i can therefore be very brief <e> <s> again the concern is to protect unions from liability where breaches of balloting requirements in clause are occasioned by a third party <e> <s> although the third party in question in this case is an employer rather than a trade union member the test of reasonable practicability provided by the bill as originally put before your lordships operates to protect the union in the same way <e> <s> any requirement in clause as originally drafted which could possibly be hindered by an employers behaviour is qualified by the test of reasonable practicability <e> <s> in the context of a postal ballot which the noble lord has mentioned and which was envisaged by the amendment of the noble lord lord beloff it is of course very difficult to envisage how any act or omission of an employer could possibly hinder a trade union in carrying out that ballot <e> <s> nevertheless i certainly repeat the assurance that my noble friend mentioned to the noble lord in the context of amendment no <e> <s> namely that we shall bear fully in mind in considering our response to the amendment of the noble lord lord beloff the need to ensure that unions are not liable for the acts or omissions of third parties outside the union <e> <s> on that basis i hope that the noble lord lord mccarthy will agree to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> may i come back to the noble lord because we are on a very important amendment <e> <s> there is of course an underlying thread running through the amendment of the noble lord to this part of the bill namely that clause imposes requirements concerning the conduct of union elections which are too severe and which are thus unjustifiable <e> <s> in moving the government amendment which we have just debated my noble friend referred to the specific instance where the bill as originally drafted might have been too onerous on trade unions and where we have accordingly made a change <e> <s> however i have to say that beyond this change we see no case at all for the relaxation of the requirements of clause <e> <s> as has been explained many times these requirements do not constitute whatever the noble lord may assert a detailed catalogue of rules and regulations rather they constitute only the basic democratic principle which should always exist in any free and fair election <e>", "<cs> we seem to be getting more interested in this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord has asked me to repeat the second part of my speech <e> <s> i can only say i repeat the whole paragraph so that it makes sense that in the context of the postal ballots envisaged by the amendment of the noble lord lord beloff it is of course very difficult to envisage how the act or omission

am here leaning rather heavily on the advice of my legal advisers and thus perhaps he will forgive me if my response owes more-to the language of legal textbooks than to the cut and thrust of debate <e> <s> subsection ensures that the application to the courts under clause is the sole remedy available to a person in respect of a failure of a trade union to comply with one or more of the bills provisions on union elections <e> <s> this has the effect of preventing any possibility of a union member obtaining redress in the courts for a common law action for the tort of breach of statutory duty and thus obtaining a separate remedy and possibly an award of damages for his unions infringement of the legislation <e>", "<cs> this would be a convenient moment to break off the committee stage of the trade union bill <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords consideration of the trade union bill will be resumed at pm <e>", "<cs> one fact which has emerged clearly from the amendment moved by the noble lord lord dean of beswick is that he and i are too old to get our call-up papers so we can settle down to the trade union bill <e> <s> i noted the noble
