tordoff in thanking the noble lord lord strabolgi for raising this important matter in your lordships house tonight <e> <s> like him i think it is a tribute to the minister for the arts that he has managed to get an extra per cent <e> <s> this year <e> <s> he is a distinguished minister of course but there have been other distinguished ministers including one sitting behind the noble lord lord strabolgi tonight lord jenkins of putney who i think was a very distinguished minister indeed and who i am glad to see is taking part in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is the convention that even if the chamber is almost empty conversations are carried on outside <e> <s> the brilliant speech of my noble friend lord stewart of fulham was almost ruined by antics at the beginning and it would be a great pity if this particularly serious case which i am bringing were also ruined by the same people <e> <s> the question which i am raising today is not about that individual grievance but about a piece of bureaucratic nonsense <e> <s> all bureaucracies generate absurdities and thank heavens <e> <s> we have a free parliament where they can be called to account in this case in the person of my noble friend lord cullen of ashbourne who is jolly noble because he has given up his dinner in order to answer this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether she is aware that although the analysis of the problem caused no dissent there is considerable disagreement about the action that needs to be taken and that some of us on the committee or indeed one of us on the committee actually took the governments side <e> <s> it might seem perhaps unusual in the circumstances but it might perhaps be desirable in press releases to refer to the fact that the report was not in fact unanimous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that somewhat dusty answer may i ask her three further questions <e> <s> is she aware that judgments of this house in its judicial capacity often contain notes of dissent <e> <s> why is this right not extended to back-benchers whose interests the leader of the house is traditionally supposed to protect <e> <s> secondly is she aware that in recent years select committees in another place have contained many notes of dissent and that <e>", "<cs> thirdly is she further aware that the ecclesiastical committee report both to the other place and to this house on the th march contains the following passage which indicates that notes of dissent are permissible members of the committee say such-and-such members however consider the other case <e> <s> in other words could the minister please explain why she is giving us out-of-date and not very helpful information <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind my noble friend that this is a short debate and that if he has not put his name down to speak it is very unfair to those who have done so for him to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply briefly to the debate <e> <s> your lordships have been commendably brief <e> <s> we have not reached the end of the allotted time even although we have had a statement made by my noble friend about the royal college of nursing <e> <s> i should first like to thank my noble friend lord coleraine for what was truly a remarkably impressive and very helpful maiden speech <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord bellwin for his knowledge his enthusiasm and his warmth <e> <s> the affection in which he is held in the house is clear to everybody <e> <s> he has made a very helpful contribution as has everybody who has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord beloff for asking this question tonight <e> <s> there seems to be some doubt as to the pronunciation of the noble lords title <e> <s> i can say that it is buluff i have it from the horses mouth <e> <s> he is an old and valued colleague in the university of oxford <e> <s> i must say that the topic of social science has never been conducive to brevity and that all too common apothegm applies to your lordships debate tonight <e> <s> nobody not even an experienced man like the noble lord lord robbins has so far spoken for less than minutes <e> <s> however i shall do my best <e> <s> i have not hitherto spoken for longer than minutes in this house but it is a subject which tends to rhetoric <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would do me the honour of listening to the remainder of my speech i shall be addressing myself to that very question <e> <s> i had been speaking i think for only two and a half minutes and i was hoping to confine my remarks to but unfortunately i shall have to take a little longer on this question <e> <s> the particular characteristic of the social sciences to which the noble lord lord young of dartington quite rightly has just drawn attention is that just like the natural sciences only with respect more so they have this particular popperian quality of more often proving a negative than proving a positive <e> <s> it is not that they are concerned exclusively with humanity compared with the natural sciences it is because they are the kind of question the kind of theory which is much more open fundamentally to question than has in recent times been the case with the natural sciences <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the house <e> <s> i have a charitable trust meeting at six oclock to which i must go <e> <s> i shall try to come back for the end of the debate <e> <s> i would have scratched from the list but for the fact that i think it is important for those of us with experience of anglo-irish affairs to say why we support the noble earl in the measure which is before us today <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity since i am following my noble friend lord brooke-borough to try to deal in some ways with the points he has made <e> <s> this perhaps arrogates to myself some of the rights of reply which my noble friend on the front bench will have at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> i tend to dissent from the noble lord lord monson in his lengthy peregrination around the world seeking qualified majorities <e> <s> but i with great respect suggest to the committee that this is a good idea for letting sleeping dogs lie <e> <s> there is not any parity between the parliament of the united kingdom and the assembly <e> <s> the assembly is acting in the difficult and particular circumstances of northern ireland and therefore the whole argument about widespread consent throughout the community is highly relevant to the day-to-day proceedings of the assembly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to welcome the bill <e> <s> no matter how difficult attempts must be made to see that the government of northern ireland proceeds from its present impasse and i believe that the bill certainly offers the best opportunity in this decade for a substantial measure of progress to take place <e> <s> i should like very briefly to make only two observations which i think are fair <e> <s> neither stormont nor local government in northern ireland has in fact quite deserved the terms in which it has been painted <e> <s> when i was an academic i had occasion to look closely at one major aspect of government and local government in northern ireland <e> <s> i found that the level and quality of provision in northern ireland was certainly as good as if not better than anything else in the kingdom and was certainly better than that which prevailed in the republic at that time for both the protestant community and the nationalists <e> <s> it would be unfortunate if that particular poor reputation were automatically tied around the neck of representative institutions in the north <e> <s> personally i hope that as the new representative institutions come into being they will be able to achieve as high a standard of provision as prevailed before direct rule was undertaken <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think i would if you served in a conservative cabinet <e> <s> of course i am not quite sure what the present state of the noble lords party may be or which sector he belongs to <e> <s> he may well be a militant <e> <s> i have just reviewed one of his books in which he speaks in favourable terms of all members of your lordships house and particularly all sections of the labour party <e> <s> but i quite honestly feel that if you serve in a conservative and unionist cabinet and as a minister of state or under-secretary in a conservative and unionist cabinet it would be two-faced to say that you did not support the nation of the united kingdom <e> <s> that does not mean to say that you have always to serve in the united kingdom government it is a free option you can refuse to accept the prime ministers invitation i assume but personally i would take that to be a matter of conscience <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this practice grew up in the s that it is a contractual arrangement which has very little to do with academic freedom and that while many would agree with him that it is proper for the government to adopt an arms-length hands-off relationship to the universities the present position whereby young men and women find it almost impossible to find a university post because of the blockage at the top is really not conductive to the health of our universities <e> <s> it would be helpful if the government could engage in constructive discussions with the universities on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other members of your lordships house in congratulating the noble lord lord gormley on his maiden speech <e> <s> if that was an example of his non-controversial speeches i am very much looking forward to his controversial ones <e> <s> the noble lord lord kaldor has made a most powerful case a case which underlies much of the oppositions thinking and one which deserves a serious answer <e> <s> following as i am it is difficult to give such a serious answer immediately without replying in detail point by point <e> <s> but i am rather surprised at his reference to informal self-censorship by the press since i have certainly read sir kenneth corfields speech in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the simple solution would be for the noble lord lord kaldor to set up his own newspaper in which he could print the censored parts of sir kenneth corfields speeches <e> <s> that might well be a very good remedy for censorship and perhaps earn him a substantial profit <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has his name down to speak in this very long debate my lords <e> <s> perhaps he will allow me to finish my argument and then i will sit down <e> <s> trade union leaders are after all in business to protect their individual members and i should have thought to help raise the productivity of the industries and firms in which their members work <e> <s> that way lies real wage rises <e> <s> so long as the inflationary expectations are there they are bound to be in the business of getting annual wage rises because that is the only way they can keep up with other groups in the labour force <e> <s> but if inflation is over i think we can reasonably expect the trade unions to take a positive and constructive role in the reconstruction of the british economy which i submit is very painfully and slowly what we are now about <e> <s> it will be a very painful and slow process and it will go on for quite a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to repeal the rent act the rent agriculture act the rent act and other enactments restricting the freedom of tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lady carnegy of lour on her maiden speech and i must also express my admiration for the noble baroness lady seear for her chairing of the committee <e> <s> it was indeed a marathon <e> <s> one remembers that the good abbe sieys when asked what he had done during the revolution replied <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a general truth that manufacturing industry in this country not only pays comparatively little corporation tax of course i may be quite wrong in saying that but that is my judgment but also attracts very substantial subsidies of one kind or another <e> <s> we also have a rather higher proportion of manufacturing industry than many of our richer neighbours such as the united states for example <e> <s> so i do not see any contradiction in that as a matter of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord glenamara for introducing the debate <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord pennock on a notable maiden speech <e> <s> i should also like to take the opportunity of saying from this side of the house how much the educational world must appreciate the services which have been given over the years by that notable marital couple lady stewart of alvechurch and lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> i always think that the departure of lord stewart from the department of education to higher realms as they might be thought was one of the great losses of the first wilson administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly aware that the right reverend prelate was not speaking exclusively about west sussex <e> <s> indeed he is of course representing the entire panoply of the bench of the church in this house and it would be quite wrong of him to push the particular interests of his own diocese <e> <s> but with great respect if he regards his wife as a typical case then i point out that the laws of arithmetic show that that cannot be she must be at the extreme of the distribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble baroness lady david could give the source of that projection of per cent <e> <s> i myself have never seen it and i am sure it is not a des figure <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord who has just sat down to some extent i think that he has overstated the problem <e> <s> he spoke about depriving ourselves of international exchange in the universities and so on <e> <s> perhaps i could give some actual figures <e> <s> in there were overseas students in britain in higher education in there were and this year there are between and but the figures have not yet been firmed up <e> <s> i do not think that a drop of between or on a total of is depriving ourselves of international students <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gladwyn has spoken at great length <e> <s> it is a short debate <e> <s> i think it is a convention of the house in these short debates that one does not on the whole interrupt all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords that was precisely the point i made <e> <s> we cannot just categorise students by where they come from <e> <s> we do not categorise students in this country by where they come from <e> <s> we categorise them by parental income or their own personal income <e> <s> that surely is the sensible way to conduct a policy unless we are going to say to the entire world for goodness sake all come to the united kingdom because all students who land at the ports of our country will be educated for nothing <e> <s> so far as i know nobody has yet advocated that particular policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful reply <e> <s> although authors are grateful to parliament for the scheme is he aware that the extreme complexity of the arrangements which have been made for registration are such that the number of authors actually to have registered is disappointingly small <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend possibly say what the cost of administration is as a proportion of the total amount to be expended because he must be aware that many of us believe that the complexities of this administration are entirely designed to benefit those who administer the scheme and not those who are intended to benefit from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would accept for a moment that the volatility of the exchange rates of some of the countries who are full members of the ems has been considerably greater than the volatility of sterling <e> <s> how would she reconcile those two facts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness made great play at the beginning of her speech with the fact that the minority of the population voted for the conservative party <e> <s> will she not agree that the labour party was bitterly opposed to an incomes policy as was the conservative party also and that by her own parity of reasoning only per cent <e> <s> of the population voted for an incomes policy <e>", "<cs> my lords following the speech of the noble viscount <e> <s> i urge your lordships to vote in exactly the opposite direction on the motion standing in the name of the noble baroness lady seear on the order paper <e> <s> it is to that amendment that i wish to devote the greater part of the few remarks with which at this late hour <e> <s> i shall detain your lordships <e> <s> it is not right and proper in the present sad condition of the labour party to address ones remarks to the amendment standing in its name on the paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great delight to find the noble baroness and myself on the same side <e> <s> i am delighted that the alliance now declares that it would not reintroduce exchange controls in any circumstances <e> <s> that is an important statement if the serious debate is to be between the alliance and the conservative government as i think it will be increasingly in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an enormous respect and affection for the noble lord lord molloy but he is completely and utterly wrong <e> <s> the great majority of the people of this nation are actually housed in houses which have been built privately by speculative builders and <e> <s> given the chance anybody who can buy a council house in which they happen to live will do so as soon as he possibly can in the face of the opposition sometimes of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i was amused because if you galvanise a delicate plant it will inevitably die <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the rise in unemployment benefit which was anticipated was in anticipation of a rate of inflation that never occurred and therefore talk of a per cent cut in the rate of unemployment benefit is absurd <e> <s> it is a per cent cut in an unanticipated increase because the rate of price increases was much lower than had been expected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to repeal the rent act the rent agriculture act the rent act and other enactments restricting the freedom of tenants <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a short and indeed a pithy bill and your lordships may be tempted to think it is a sweeping bill <e> <s> in an almost literal sense it is because in one way it is a product of the all-partyrepeal group chaired by the noble lord lord spens which is going through the statute book bit by bit not merely to look at obsolete statutes after all that is the function of the law commission and a job that it does efficiently and very well but to look for areas of statute law where in our opinion there is either regulation for regulations sake or the whole initial purpose of the legislation has become self-defeating <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is correct <e> <s> it is like the defence study group in that it brings together people who are interested in a particular question <e> <s> in this case it is the study of legislation where we think it has become self-defeating <e> <s> the group has been going for some time and includes noble lords across the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing on earth i want to do is to upset the noble lord lord mishcon but i think he would agree that the rent acts give a substantial volume of work to many solicitors <e>", "<cs> my lords ours has been an interesting debate and i will not follow the usual winding-up procedure of going through each speech in great detail <e> <s> i must however refer to the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> not being her inland revenue inspector i am not as expert as perhaps i might be on the subject but in the first of the noble baronesss five speeches this evening she argued that this measure was monumentally irrelevant <e> <s> i believe we had hoped that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will contain herself from making a sixth speech this evening there would of course be an acute shortage of kippers you would have to go into sainsburys and bribe the checkout girl to get you some kippers if the law said that the price of kippers should be the same as it was in <e> <s> if the noble baroness despite her intelligence beauty cleverness and wit cannot appreciate that point at this stage in the evening i somewhat despair <e> <s> what a view she has of her fellow citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords while not being a member of sub-committee a i have had the privilege of sitting in on its meetings and in particular the opportunity of listening to the witnesses and reading the evidence submitted <e> <s> it has been an especial privilege to watch lord obriens chairmanship <e> <s> i regret that odd years ago when i was offered a job with the bank of england i chiefly knew of him because he was signing the bank notes at that time they offered only a year so i took my services elsewhere to my cambridge college <e> <s> i only hope they have improved the pay since then perhaps the noble lord will tell us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> however the central point is not whether the dollar is labelled education but where the dollar is spent <e> <s> of course the dollars are not spent in botswana and places like that they are spent in paris producing enormous documents and i have a large number here from which i could read <e> <s> it is totally incomprehensible <e> <s> that is the criticism <e> <s> it is as though the entire education budget or the entire national health service budget were spent in the headquarters of the ministry of health or the ministry of education <e> <s> that is the point i am making <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> will he agree that the improvement which has endured throughout this period of economic difficulty and which has continued a trend established under governments of different complexions for the past years is a remarkable achievement of the education service <e> <s> will he further say whether or not he thinks that the outcome of this substantial increase in expenditure per child has been effective in terms of reading writing and mathematical ability <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the question directed to him from the alliance benches was based on a false premise <e> <s> the pupil-teacher ratio in the inner cities is considerably more favourable than that in the rest of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a convention of your lordships house that the speaker who follows a maiden speaker offers his or her congratulations as did the noble baroness lady lockwood to my noble friend lord forte <e> <s> thereafter each of us tends to say much the same thing <e> <s> i am going to venture to break this convention this evening because i was going to mention the noble lord lord forte anyway whether or not he had made a maiden speech <e> <s> he has been a very generous benefactor to a charity with which i am connected the king george vi and queen elizabeth foundation which is one of queen elizabeths charities in windsor <e> <s> that charity and i was there this morning welcomed the chairman of the berkshire county council who had come to inspect two teams of the berkshire youth action group who were there under the auspices of the youth training scheme of the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i also want to address myself to the amendment which was so ably moved by the noble baroness lady birk and i want to follow the noble lord lord spens in speaking a little about constitutional issues which seem to loom very large in the amendment <e> <s> as this house is a defender of the constitutional freedoms of our fellow citizens it seems to me right that we should address our minds to that particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords in examinations it is always a good practice to question the question and i would with the permission of the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx question the question which he has put down on the order paper today <e> <s> we have a paradox a paradox which has endured certainly for all the time that the select committee on unemployment sat under the noble baroness lady seear and which has endured indeed for a considerable number of years now <e> <s> it is that not only is there high registered unemployment there is also extremely high registered employment <e> <s> the number of people in work is going up at the same time as the number of people out of work is going up <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who have seen the stained glass in the burrell have ample reason other than the maiden speech itself to welcome the noble earl lord munster among us and those of us who for long have been friends of my noble friend lord mcalpine of west green also welcome him and his brilliant maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although nationally there has been an increase in the resources devoted to the health service because of the operation of rawp there has been a quite disproportionate run down in greater london <e> <s> is the minister further aware that among the teaching staffs of the great london teaching hospitals as well as among other members of staff there is widespread worry that centres of excellence will be run down <e> <s> it is urgent that the minister should make some kind of statement that this question will be looked at in a broader perspective <e>", "<cs> i have a fundamental difficulty with the argument put forward by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> judging by the great pile of papers which the noble lord has brought with him we shall hear the same argument frequently <e> <s> he asked why should not the unions have a choice <e> <s> the fundamental difficulty which i have concerns the question what is the union <e> <s> until they have had proper elections there is no possibility of saying who the union actually is it means i take it the present body of people who say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay my tribute to the noble lord lord jenkins who is an old friend of mine <e> <s> he introduced this debate with a series of extremely telling arguments <e> <s> he put my wife on the arts council from which august body she was removed by the saintly leader of the social democratic party <e> <s> i have therefore taken a long and detailed interest in arts policy and the arts council at secondhand and i should like to concentrate my remarks on the arts council and its role in the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady lockwood for introducing this motion this afternoon and particularly for doing so in such a moderate and interesting way <e> <s> despite my distinguished place on the list of speakers which shows a charity on the part of the chief whip after the affair of last night i am not speaking to defend the government but rather to continue to ask some of the questions which the noble baroness has asked <e>"]
