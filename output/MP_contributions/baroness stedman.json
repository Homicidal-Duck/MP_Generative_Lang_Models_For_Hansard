["<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for the way in which he has repeated the statement <e> <s> may i also take the opportunity of welcoming him into your lordships house on the occasion of his first speech from the dispatch box <e> <s> i am sure that he will be happy in the department which he has been allocated and i hope that he will also enjoy his work in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to ask her majestys government the question of which i have given private notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for replying to the private notice question <e> <s> i accept that in so far as this country is concerned there are only nine planes involved six with laker airways and three with british caledonian whereas in the states there are something over dcs <e> <s> the caa and some of the european countries have agreed that theirs are airworthy subject to more regular and perhaps slightly more stringent tests from time to time <e> <s> despite that can the noble lord confirm that according to the press reports japan has rejected the swiss application to land dcs in japan and that yugoslavia have still grounded the two dcs from their national airline <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord able to give an assurance to the house that while we expect british rail and the national bus corporation to play their part in saving fuel in so far as they can it is essential that our rural services should be kept going and that areas of the country should not be deprived of all kinds of transport <e> <s> is he prepared to give an assurance to the house that if the situation becomes worse he will see what he can do and what efforts he can make to ensure if necessary that extra fuel is made available to british rail and to the national bus corporation in order to maintain services in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house i should like to say how much we welcome the opportunity in the near future of perhaps having a rather wider bill than this one and at the same time i should like to offer my regrets to the noble lord lord skelmersdale after all the work he has put into this bill that he is not going to have the credit for it <e>", "<cs> my lords we all remember the maiden speech of the noble lord lord buxton of alsa on conservation and i am delighted and i am sure the house is that he is giving us the opportunity this evening of talking more about conservation particularly so far as the north sea is concerned and the effects of oil spillage and the importance of protecting our environment from marine pollution <e> <s> one of the first trade questions i had to answer in your lordships house from the dispatch box opposite was on the tragedy of the amoco cadiz and i am deeply conscious of the amount of time and thought that this incident has provoked even among various government departments trade environment and maff and now with the north sea oil being such a major industry in scotland the scottish office are also deeply concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i compliment the noble lord on the exposition he has just given us about sleeping policemen and so on <e> <s> referring to the question of the right reverend prelate surely the government will not be complacent and say yes we shall do some educating we are mounting a publicity campaign <e> <s> we are being urged to save per cent <e> <s> in our petrol consumption which could very easily be achieved if there were only some means of making people drive a little slower than they do at present <e> <s> one way of doing this would be to have much better enforcement of the present limits if the government are not willing to lower the limit altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord cannot anticipate what is going to be in the bill can he make an educated guess as to whether it is likely to include in the widest sense of the countryside some of the recommendations of the sandford report the porchester report and the cripps report <e>", "<cs> my lords on this side of the house we can join with the noble lord and tell him that his hopes are quite right and we have no objection whatsoever to this order <e> <s> we deplore the reasons and the behaviour of some people which have made it necessary to consider strengthening the by-laws <e> <s> we think it is eminently sensible that ships and hover-craft should be treated alike and we raise no objection whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i thought we had exhausted over the years all the things there were to say about dogs and the working party on dogs <e> <s> i confess that the noble lord lord de clifford has raised some new points today <e> <s> i shall look forward to the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton in his reply from the dispatch box and see whether he is able to satisfy him more than i was able to in the last four years <e> <s> i am sure we are indebted to the noble lord for bringing to the attention of the new government the need to implement all or part of the recommendations of the working party on dogs <e> <s> this working party was set up in and there were eight different government departments involved and represented together with representatives from the local authority associations and the various police associations and their very comprehensive report was published way back in <e>", "<cs> i am sure i shall my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give an indication whether we are likely to know what is the ministers decision on the inspectors report when we return in october <e> <s> i accept that it would be foolish to go ahead and build this stretch of road if we are going to be in a position at long last to go ahead with the proper m motorway <e> <s> secondly can the noble lord say whether the present government are endorsing and continuing the view of the previous government whereby it is not necessary to cut great swathes from the countryside for new motorways but we can alleviate the situation where possible by by-passes <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether the government are giving any encouragement to local authorities to set up schemes for collecting bottles <e> <s> i know that i argued from his side of the dispatch box that it was not economic so to do <e> <s> however there is a danger <e> <s> there are a great many of such bottles around now and some authorities are starting to collect bottles and establish bottle banks <e> <s> what encouragement is the department giving them <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for repeating the statement <e> <s> there are one or two comments that i should like to make <e> <s> first quite early on in the statement he says in effect that the white paper gives the details of all the proposed controls and that he will enable them to be debated before the new rules are laid <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord when replying will give us an assurance that time will be given for debate on those rules to take place in this house as well as in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will indeed be grateful to the noble lord for explaining to those of us who do not come from north of the border exactly how the scottish highlands and islands development board works and the advantage that this will be to great and little cumbrae <e> <s> again it is presumptuous perhaps for an english person to speak on behalf of her scottish colleagues but from this side of the house i am delighted to welcome this very small extension to the duties of the board <e>", "<cs> my lords the previous government and indeed successive governments have had on their plate for a number of years this problem of the number of people who do not licence their vehicles and who therefore penalise all other people who are trying to obey the law <e> <s> the previous administration were considering the abolition of ved and perhaps an increase in petrol charges in order that everyone would at least pay his share towards the roads <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm that this is one of the points that his right honourable friend is still considering and if so can he say when that report is likely to be available <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for his explanation and for going over the historical background and the reason why we have this document before us this morning <e> <s> he has confirmed that we have only about calibration stations available at the moment and some <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for the very able way in which he moved the motion but i must confess that the very competent ministerial brief from the noble earl lord gowrie did nothing to allay my perhaps unworthy suspicions that these sudden price increases in gas and electricity are mainly because the government are having difficulty in balancing their books because of the overgenerous tax concessions to the better-off in their last budget and that they are perhaps hoping that this penal increase will help to pay for those concessions <e>", "<cs> my lords the points that i have raised come within the terms of the motion that is before us today which is looking at the rises in gas and electricity charges in the light of the local authority cuts that have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in april is to meet inflation and then in october it is to go up by another per cent <e> <s> which makes per cent <e> <s> in this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the trade unions would be delighted i think to hear that wages are going up as much as that <e> <s> the steelmen would be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> perhaps i did not make myself as clear as i should have done <e> <s> i said that the per cent <e> <s> increase now in the gas price could be likened to the tremendous increase that the opec countries introduced <e> <s> we did not complain about that we had to accept it <e> <s> but we are now complaining about this <e>", "<cs> my lords first i owe the house an explanation <e> <s> for some reason perhaps a temporary lapse of memory on someones part on the way here i seem to have got myself on the list of speakers as a front bench spokesman <e> <s> i want to make it quite plain to the house that i am now footloose and fancy free on the back benches and therefore anything that i may say this afternoon is my idea and my suggestion i am not necessarily speaking for all my colleagues <e>", "<cs> i am sure you are <e> <s> we welcome this bill <e> <s> it has had general welcome and will have general welcome from all sides of the house <e> <s> that is evident from the list of speakers and like the noble lord opposite i am delighted to see that there are to be two maiden speeches to which we are all looking forward with interest <e> <s> the two noble baronesses will know that they will have the support of the house in its usual friendly manner when they make their maiden speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of that but i was choosing my words with care because there has been no public announcement about it and as far as i know the actual contract has not yet been signed so the negotiations are proceeding <e> <s> i hope the department are going to look back on baddesley to see what happened how it was all dealt with and who was involved in order that they can learn some administrative lessons from that and make life easier for the trustees and for future applicants in similar cases <e>", "<cs> that really is not good enough <e> <s> when this matter was debated in the other place some reassurance was given albeit in a half-hearted way that these sums would be paid over each year and would not be subject to cuts <e> <s> we have a right to ask for a firm assurance from the noble lord that these sums which are small enough heaven knows when one thinks of what we might have had if it was what was put into the national land fund will be paid in each year and will be absolutely inviolate from cuts <e> <s> not only have we a right to ask for that at this time but the minister should be in a position to speak at least for the period when his government will be in office we will do our job right when it comes to our turn <e>", "<cs> how can one expect the trustees to do their work if they are not certain there will be any money in the kitty for them next year <e>", "<cs> i hestiate to intervene at this stage because i realise that the noble lord lord mowbray has rather a lot on his plate this afternoon <e> <s> however i hope that he might be in a position to give the committee some information about the guidelines that will be laid down for the trustees <e> <s> on two or three occasions this afternoon he has said that this or that will be covered by guidelines <e> <s> i asked a rather long series of questions for ideas of the sort of things that might be used as guidelines for the trustees <e> <s> the noble lord did not reply on second reading and i have not heard from him in writing <e> <s> if he is not in a position to reply this afternoon may i ask whether he would write to me between now and the report stage <e>", "<cs> am i to take it that the noble lord may know the whole before the report stage and will write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie in offering our thanks to the noble lord lord sandford for giving us the opportunity to debate this report this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord on his very clear presentation of the report and his committee on producing such a readable report which we can understand and find so interesting <e> <s> i want to deal with only two particular aspects but in rather general terms <e> <s> for my sins i happen to be one of the vice-presidents of the association of district councils and they have asked me to say how much they warmly welcome the report because the conclusions which are expressed in it are in accord in so many ways with the views which they expressed in their evidence to the committee <e> <s> they wanted that to be on record that they warmly welcome the report of lord sandford and his colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply but does he not accept that the strutt report recommended that maff should take much wider responsibilities for protecting wildlife and promoting landscape conservation <e> <s> does he accept that these proposals in their present form only imply the need to be concerned for conservation and designated areas such as the national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene again does the noble lord accept that the real point of contact for discussing conservation is the point when plans are submitted and when investment programmes are being made <e> <s> if the need for prior approval is being abolished have we not lost that point of contact with the farmer from the point of view of conservation of wildlife and better landscape schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that when this reservoir was first contemplated there was considerable local opposition to the size of the reservoir and the fact that round its edges it was so shallow that there was likely to be a considerable loss from evaporation <e> <s> is he aware that the same opposition is now being aroused locally at the thought of having the mudflats referred to by his noble friend <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend with regard to these amendments <e> <s> i was privileged in the last government to pilot through this house the experimental areas bill and also to sit in on some of the working party meetings before that bill was prepared for the statute book <e> <s> when we were in government we increased the number of people in cars from four to seven which this bill is now increasing to eight <e> <s> however we brought in the car-sharing provision which was largely to meet the problems in the rural areas within our trial areas <e> <s> with hindsight and we can all be wiser with hindsight we feel that perhaps five would have been a more practicable number and a more realistic number for the normal carrying capacity of cars at present <e> <s> under the previous act seven was agreed to in order to encourage the social sharing of cars and the amount of money to be paid by each passenger was something that would be decided among the participants in the car-sharing <e> <s> the proposals before us this afternoon go much further than that <e> <s> they will allow and we shall come to this later more advertising <e> <s> they are also to be free of any control by local authorities and the commissioners and could very well have the danger of turning car-sharing or small minibuses used for that purpose into a business operation <e>", "<cs> if i may support the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth he and i had rather lengthy i hope usually friendly correspondence on this subject a couple of years ago when the earlier bill was going through <e> <s> we thought that we had gone as far as we could to meet the point he so adequately described today <e> <s> now we have a new bill it might be sensible if it is written into the legislation <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has certainly given reassurances so far as the regulations arc concerned but he has referred specifically to the fact that the local authorities the county and district councils would know what was going on and would have the information sent to them <e> <s> but they are not the only people who are concerned <e> <s> the general public are concerned about what is happening to these licences they are the people who are going to benefit or otherwise if a licence is granted <e> <s> the trade unions are concerned because their members are involved if there is a change in plan or a change in routes <e> <s> all these people are concerned and surely it would be much better to have it written into the act that they shall be published and let them have as wide a circulation as possible <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord say how the general public would know that these were available at the offices of the commissioners if there was no publication about them <e>", "<cs> my lords what action is the department taking to encourage local authorities or by alteration of or amendment to the building regulations to ensure that insulation is included when domestic and business premises are being built <e> <s> it is very much cheaper to include insulation then than to build it in at a later stage <e> <s> why cannot building regulations be altered to ensure that every building built today is built to the requirements of insulation standards <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said in an earlier reply to my noble friend that cuts were being made in the training of instructors <e> <s> surely most of the people doing this work are volunteers and therefore the cost of actual training must be very little on the instructors part <e> <s> could the noble baroness not put pressure on the east midlands advisory council to use the money and use it for the purpose for which it was intended <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for presenting this bill to the house may i say that many of us on all sides of the house in spite of what he said will sympathise with him in having to do this job <e> <s> the noble lord has a very long record of local authority service and the major parts of this bill ought to cause him as much concern as they do the rest of noble lords who have been involved in local authority work <e> <s> we also look forward to hearing the noble lord lord grimston of westbury in the course of this debate <e> <s> he had such a long association with the association of urban district councils and will i am sure have something extremely useful to say to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a matter of great importance which i should like to raise at this stage before we go into committee and that is to question the value of going through the charade of a committee stage in this house when the secretary of state has already acted on clause before this house has even considered let alone accepted it <e> <s> i make no complaint about the conduct of the noble lord lord bellwin in the proceedings on this bill he treats this house with consideration and courtesy and with a due regard to its function as a second chamber but i must protest about the affront to the house by his secretary of state <e> <s> in utter disregard of the function of this house and its part in parliamentary procedure and constitutional rights the secretary of state has announced that councils will have their grant cut for overspending <e>", "<cs> i accept that this is a fairly substantial step to take and i accept that compulsory purchase orders are not very popular <e> <s> but if the compulsory purchase order is not objected to if there are no objections at all why is it necessary to waste ministerial time and to waste staff in going into it with all the costs involved at present <e> <s> if the noble earl will say that he will take the matter back look at it talk to his advisers and perhaps consult with us before the next stage of the bill to see whether it is possible to include it in the present bill then i think that perhaps we and the associations might be a little happier about it <e> <s> but to leave it rather in the air and to say that when there is a proper legislative timetable we might do something about it is really not very much of a promise <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord sandford i am not completely happy with the ministers explanation and i cannot quite see the point behind it <e> <s> i shall certainly read what he said in <e>", "<cs> in that case i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> consultation is right and proper with the scottish authorities whether you get agreement at the end of it or not <e> <s> who are the people who have been consulted about ilea <e> <s> why have not the representatives of ilea been consulted about ilea <e>", "<cs> forgive me if i am wrong but is the amendment necessary <e> <s> like the noble lord lord evans of claughton i spent many years in local government most of them before we had any allowances <e> <s> indeed i remember in my earlier days in the mid-s the officers having a good trade union negotiated first-class train fares and daily attendance allowances and if the chairman of their committee went with them the chairman went second class and had to claim his or her expenses <e> <s> i am glad <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend in his opposition to this clause <e> <s> the major objection to it and indeed to the whole of part v of this bill is that clause absolves the government either from having a regular five year revaluation or from presenting reasons to parliament why there should not be such a regular revaluation <e> <s> if this were so then the government could seek to justify their contention and if they could carry the resolution in parliament <e>", "<cs> we have strayed somewhat wide of the original amendment <e> <s> i had not anticipated that we would be discussing keeling schedules and so on on what had seemed to be a simple and reasonable amendment <e> <s> but it has been an interesting five or minutes <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his reply <e> <s> i should like to look at it tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i am sorry to interrupt him he said that the government looked at the ones which were over the p and introduced the waiver where they felt that the traditional high-spending authorities had done something about it they could not perhaps reduce it in the one year <e> <s> did the government also make any direct contact with the local authority representatives of the authorities that are on the list to be penalised to find out what they had done and if they had not done it the reasons behind why they had not felt that they could reduce it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i accept that he was asked a lot of questions and i am quite sure that with him the committee does not want wearying at this stage with all the detailed answers <e> <s> there was one question that i asked which i think is of some importance <e> <s> what right of appeal have authorities got and to whom will they have a right of appeal if the secretary of state decides that they are on the penalised list <e> <s> they ought to have some right of appeal <e> <s> they ought to be able to make their case as to why their rates are high why they cannot reduce their spending <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> i share the view of the noble lord and think it might be appropriate to put the amendment formally and test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for putting this point right <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord feels that he cannot go further <e> <s> perhaps he could take it back and have a look at it <e> <s> i think that it would clear the air considerably for local authorities who get themselves on the hit list by one means or another if within the notice to them that they are above the rate and will lose some money they could be told more than just the fact that they are over the rate limit <e> <s> i think they would want to know about it in more detail and have it demonstrated that they were acting unreasonably <e> <s> perhaps they would take it more kindly if they were told that they were acting unreasonably because they were doing this or that or spending too much say on their social services and so on <e> <s> that would open the door for them to come to see the minister <e> <s> i do not think that a right of appeal is quite met by the fact that the authority might say to the minister may we come and talk to you <e> <s> that is not quite what is normally meant by a right of appeal <e>", "<cs> i welcome the tone of the noble lord opposite <e> <s> i am glad that the government are thinking about it and that the noble lord is concerned about the various documents which have been circulating <e> <s> i too am grateful to the noble lord lord evans of claughton for having introduced some new thinking into the bill <e> <s> we accept that the argument is fairly widespread that the rate support grant is becoming increasingly complex and less and less comprehensible to both members and officers <e> <s> the proposals before us today suggest a much simpler method by distributing the grant on a <e>", "<cs> we are disappointed at the noble lords reply <e> <s> we have three amendments saying the same thing in different ways and we thought he might have an opportunity to change his mind or say that he preferred one to <e>", "<cs> we are beginning to discuss now the introduction of an entirely new rsg system which again has united all the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> i accept all that the noble lord says <e> <s> but heavens do not let me get down as being a supporter of block grants and a believer that it is all that is wonderful <e> <s> i have been moaning about it for years and hoping that we can get something better in its place <e> <s> i would also say to the noble viscount lord ridley do not be quite so despondent that we cannot possibly win a division if we have one <e> <s> if i had waited until i was in a majority on a local authority i would not have been on a county council for years because i have never been in a majority but i have managed to survive and love local government <e> <s> i think this is perhaps our last place in this bill where those who are concerned about local government who have been fighting for delay in the implementation of this who have been fighting for more and more consultations with the local authority associations can work together <e> <s> it is time for them to stand up and be counted and i am not prepared to give way <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i will read very carefully in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has lifted my heart at last <e> <s> at last he is beginning to give <e> <s> i wish he had given something a little earlier <e> <s> i am delighted and i accept that this may not be the right place to put this amendment <e> <s> we had a lot of heart-searching before we were helped to find a place where the amendments could go in <e> <s> perhaps i could use south kirkby and moorthorpe as an example so that the committee realise what the problem means in these days because they are the ones who have done most of the work about it <e> <s> their parish has a lot of unemployment <e> <s> they have infrastructure problems which they have had for decades <e> <s> they have an active parish council and this is instanced by the fact that they are here tonight apart from dunning both the noble lord and myself through the recess <e>", "<cs> i should be most grateful to the noble lord if he will take the matter back and look at it <e> <s> i shall also make him a present of a document which i received from my county treasurer which goes into much greater detail than i wanted to bore the committee with tonight <e> <s> if he will look at it then perhaps we can get in touch with each other before the next stage of the bill and see whether anything needs to be done <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that the noble viscount and i both withdraw our amendments at this stage think about the matter in the perhaps clearer air of morning and come back at the report stage possibly with something that we can both agree which might be acceptable to your lordships <e> <s> we might also ask for some assistance from the noble lords advisers in the way of drafting if he is not happy with the drafting as it is at the moment <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure it is his intention that they should know on time <e> <s> taking his assurances in good faith i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on this amendment particularly on paragraph <e>", "<cs> the minister says his noble friend will have the right to use his allocation as he wants <e> <s> that is all right if his allocation is big enough to start with <e> <s> in counties like cambridge-shire where our population is going up and our allocation is going down we need the sort of help this amendment would give <e>", "<cs> perhaps the second of the noble baronesses from cambridge may now have a say <e> <s> i think that most of the county councils support the secretary of states attempts to speed up and simplify the planning system and i think that since most county councils have accepted that district councils are the right level at which to be clearly responsible for almost all the development control decisions <e> <s> but i <e>", "<cs> we have not reached that yet <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> i think that that is one of the most unsatisfactory answers with which we have ever been presented <e> <s> the noble lord says that this is not an attack on new towns <e> <s> you could have fooled me because it goes right to the heart of the new town philosophy <e> <s> he says that the powers of the secretary of state are permissive and that he is not saying that he will take them <e> <s> but the secretary of state has already tried to take them illegally and there is no guarantee that he will not go on trying to take them and putting this tremendous burden on the new towns <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether in the interval in voting he has received replies for my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> has he been briefed and is he now in a position to give satisfactory replies <e>", "<cs> in that case i must advise my noble friends to vote against the clause standing part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not very happy <e> <s> i do not think that expedient means the same thing as to the advantage of the town <e> <s> there are problems problems have been made now for us in peterborough where we accommodate the numbers that are still to come into it in the two existing townships <e> <s> we shall have no room for the natural expansion of population that will follow from the increase in the normal population of the new town for which we had reserved part of the township <e> <s> i will ask my noble friends to come into the lobby with me because the words to the advantage of the town are much better than just expedient <e>", "<cs> no i do not think i can <e> <s> i think we should still have the prime concern of the new town area which is being made smaller and the problems that will follow and this de-designation of part of the area should not be allowed unless we are absolutely satisfied that it is to the advantage of the town <e> <s> while expedient may have been used in other acts i do not think that necessarily makes it right and i do not think it necessarily means that we should follow it in this one <e> <s> i think the words to the advantage of the town would be infinitely more preferable and i must ask my noble friends to follow me into the lobby <e>", "<cs> just one question before the noble lord puts the question <e> <s> it is said that the udcs shall take over the functions of the fire authority <e> <s> how are they going to do that <e> <s> are they going to work in conjunction with the london fire brigade <e> <s> where are they going to get the personnel and the machines to do it <e>", "<cs> it may be a reserve power but i think we have the right to know which personnel they are going to use <e> <s> are they going to come to an arrangement with the local authorities to use their fire prevention officers their fire precaution officers or are they going to set up their own empire within the udc <e>", "<cs> i do not think it is sinister but i just think that there are the services of the london fire brigade there with all their fire prevention and their fire precautions department <e> <s> why <e>", "<cs> we appreciate the help that we have received from the noble lord <e> <s> he has been very good he has provided us up until today with notes on clauses and notes on amendments <e> <s> i appreciate that these amendments went in late and we have not had the notes <e> <s> we would appreciate them <e> <s> but i should like to express our appreciation for notes that we have had <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in her amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury has referred to the comments made by him and by myself when the previous governments bill was before the house <e> <s> we only got to the second reading stage and then had an election <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord lord avebury was sufficiently of a realist as i am to know that it does not necessarily follow that a succeeding government has the same views about a subject in exactly the same way as the one that went before it <e> <s> i think my noble friends are to be congratulated on the consultations that they have had with the department to see how far they can get along the lines which we had hoped to go along but for heavens sake <e> <s> let us if the government are willing to accept it get something on the statute book and then build on it in the future <e>", "<cs> i am sure we would not like it at this time of the night and at this stage of the bill <e> <s> i yield to no one in my admiration for what my noble friend lord northfield and his board have done in telford <e> <s> they have done a fantastic job <e> <s> the land reclamation they <e>", "<cs> my lords at the beginning of his statement the noble lord said that a circular had gone out to local authorities today <e> <s> is he aware that my own district council in peterborough received a telephone call from his department earlier this afternoon giving them the gist of the statement and saying that it took effect from the time of that telephone call <e> <s> is he further aware that local authorities will not take very kindly to this form of instant government by telephone <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are talking about not spending money but they are spending their time making these calls to all the district authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage we put down an amendment similar to this from these benches <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin undertook to write to me afterwards because we had not got it in quite the right form and had stretched it far too wide <e> <s> his courteous and long letter has convinced me that he was right and we were asking too much in the amendment as it stood <e> <s> i am happy not to have put my amendment down now and i hope that the noble earl will withdraw the one he is dealing with on behalf of the noble lord lord sandford <e>", "<cs> i should like to give general support in principle to the noble lord opposite but i can see that there are some difficulties <e> <s> as an ex-member of a police authority i share his frustration about the time it takes to get decisions and the avenues one has to follow before one can get any decision when one is dealing with the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard throughout the debates on the bill from this side of the house about the lack of consultation with the local authority associations <e> <s> to start with we tried to tell the government that for once in their lives all the local authority associations were united in opposing the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> we dealt with this matter at some length in the committee stage and we are still concerned that while this clause remains in the bill parliament will hear about rating revaluations only as and when the secretary of state sees fit to order such a revaluation <e> <s> we all know that if revaluations are not carried out at regular intervals the tax base is held at an artificially low level and it becomes unfair and out of date which in turn affects and distorts the distribution of government grants to the local authorities <e> <s> that in turn gives rise to substantial injustices between individual ratepayers in the size of the rate burden that they are all asked to bear <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am a little disappointed that the noble and learned lord will not go a little further <e> <s> last time we had complaints that we were being rather too limiting in just restricting consultation to the local authority associations <e> <s> as he said we have widened it a little now and left him a great deal of discretion as to which other bodies he should consult <e> <s> but i am sure that the local authority associations will read <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i shall stay the course until oclock if the noble and learned lord becomes so generous <e> <s> i am most grateful to him and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always courteous when he replies to criticism of the government and we appreciate that from these benches <e> <s> no i shall not divide the house tonight <e> <s> i should like to do so but i do not think that we are likely to convince any other people to come with us than those who came with us before and at this time of the night it may be rather unproductive to try to divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we tried and it did not work <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in passing i think the noble duke is right we have got this in the wrong place but we obviously all know what we are talking about <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> i understand the difficulties we found it difficult enough to find an amendment that might be <e>", "<cs> my lords my chief whip says that the noble lords sweet smile is irresistible and therefore i must withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord has taken that attitude <e> <s> i too have the national interest at heart <e> <s> i am concerned about the hundreds of thousands of people who are unemployed at the moment <e> <s> i am concerned about the construction firms and those associated with them who are going bankrupt and having to get out of business <e> <s> although it may not be a cutback with the moratorium we have had industry and local government cannot proceed with these series of stops and goes <e> <s> they must have a programme which they can carry out and know that they will be able to carry out <e>", "<cs> we do not give up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support i have received from the benches opposite <e> <s> i have conflicting advice whether to take noble lords into the division lobby or accept what the minister said but i think i owe it to the counties which are still concerned about the matter to test the feeling of the house <e> <s> i assure the minister that if i do so i shall not return with regulations on third reading <e> <s> some of the counties and their planning departments are still extremely worried that while the amendment of the noble viscount lord ridley made things better than they were it did not do all the things that some of the counties wanted and i therefore believe i should be letting down my colleagues in local government if i did not ask the house to divide on this issue <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house my lords the noble lord is trying his blandishments on me but i shall remain firm <e> <s> this is a long-stop position not something that will happen every day <e> <s> a little more paper in and out of marsham street will not make all that much difference so far as i can see and therefore while the minister has made a valiant attempt i must ask the house to divide on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords our concern now as at committee stage is that the payments demanded by the secretary of state from the sales of assets should be devoted to completing the mark and the mark new towns and not go into exchequer funds for other purposes that before any instruction is given to development corporations to sell any of their assets the secretary of state ought to be satisfied that such sales are in the interests of the new towns specifically and generally and that they will not interfere with the programme of planned development and will also be consistent with good financial management <e> <s> this is why we put down the amendment which the committee accepted a week ago <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i remind him that we are not suggesting that the secretary of state still does not have the last word <e> <s> what was agreed to during the committee stage was that the secretary of state should satisfy himself that such payment does not undermine the programme of planned development of the town and is consistent with the principles of sound financial management <e> <s> if he satisfies himself of that and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that from this side of the house we accept the ruling of the government chief whip but other speakers have been quite correct the noble viscount tried to get in several times <e> <s> he was unlucky but i think that the house might be satisfied if the noble viscount were allowed to make his points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is aware that one of the things which troubles us is not the careful way he has explained the clause and the subsections today implying that nothing is different from what goes on in new towns today but that that has been altered by the circular which went out in july where the minister said that where disposals were being made they should be on a freehold basis <e> <s> at the present time it is always difficult for the development corporations to get agreement from the department of the environment that they should sell a freehold <e> <s> most of them are leaseholds for years <e> <s> we are concerned that it is the freeholder who benefits in the end from the appreciating value of the land or building <e> <s> we think that it is imperative that the government maintain and control the activities of the development corporations so that in due course the increasing value of the land or property accrues to the community and not to the freeholder <e> <s> it is the question of unrestricted freehold selling that worries us <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to press the amendment but having read through the debates in the committee stage and reinforced by the comment of the noble lord lord inglewood this afternoon on the fact that we ought to keep the appointment of the chief constable in the hands of the home office or under very strict supervision from the home office because of corruption i fail to see why a chief constable is any more likely to be corrupted than say a county planning officer who is appointed by the county council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted at this late stage that we have had one of our amendments accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point that these are two of the options that may be open to the secretary of state when he is considering the rate support grant and something about which he will no doubt have to consult with the local authority associations <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly accept all the safeguards and i am grateful to the noble lord for his patience in spelling these out again to us <e> <s> the trouble is that you cannot write safeguards into an act of parliament and we have to accept them on face value <e> <s> we do accept what the noble lord said is the intention but it is again giving very wide powers to the secretary of state even though he has to come to parliament for them <e> <s> there are misgivings and i thought it only fair to raise this matter today <e> <s> however in view of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once or twice from the dispatch box opposite the noble lord has reiterated his personal commitment to new towns and we do not question that at all <e> <s> he has also reminded us of the hundreds of millions of pounds that have been ploughed into new towns <e> <s> we take that point as well and we also look on the other side and see the benefits that the country has had from the new towns <e> <s> i accept that the noble lord would like to see new towns continued and i also accept that he would like to see some perhaps a major part of the money that is coming from the sale of new town assets ploughed back into the mark and mark new towns so that we can have early completion of them and so as my noble friend lady denington has said we can have a reasonable portfolio of assets that will be worth considerably more as the years go by and the assets mature <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to offer thanks from this side of the house to the noble lord lord bellwin for his courtesy his very conciliatory manner and his equanimity at all times <e> <s> he has carried the heavy burden of this bill and at times we wondered whether he was going to stay the course but always he has remained good-tempered and kindly and we are grateful to him <e> <s> we offer thanks also to his officials for providing us with notes on clauses and on government amendments and heaven knows there have been enough of those even another today so many that our fears have been confirmed during the passage of this bill that it was ill-conceived and cobbled together in the first place <e> <s> it leaves this house with four additional schedules <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in somewhat of a quandary this evening <e> <s> yesterday i agreed to a request from the noble lord lord sandford who cannot be here today to ascertain what were the views of the association of district councils since i am one of the vice-presidents of that body <e> <s> i now find having put my name down to speak that that association having discussed the matter decided a decision by the association on this issue is not appropriate which does not help me very much this evening <e>", "<cs> for export my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for the very lucid and easy way in which he has explained this very difficult bill to the house this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to say that with her usual customary common sense manner the noble baroness lady denington with both feet on the ground has suggested what i consider and i believe my colleagues on this bench also consider is a very useful new clause and i am sure that when the time comes we shall find ourselves able to support her from this bench behind her <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> i also welcome the attempt in the bill towards improving road safety hut like other noble lords who have spoken i believe it would have been much better if there had been a separate road safety bill as such rather than include these matters in part iv of this bill <e> <s> road safety is not a question of party politics but of life and death and it is not something that should be included in a highly controversial bill dealing primarily with denationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench we should also like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> i wish that he had paid some tribute to the way in which councils have made really strenuous <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the very full reply that he has given <e> <s> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls and i have been on opposite sides of the fence for something like years <e> <s> we are on opposite sides again today because while he says that the incentive to keep a clean licence would be a deterrent i would argue that it might be an even greater deterrent if after disqualification one had back a licence which had a few points on it in order not to build up to another disqualification from that situation <e> <s> i think that one can argue both ways as the noble lord and i have done for many years on many subjects <e>", "<cs> i should first like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for the very long reply he gave to the points about the totting-up procedure which i raised on second reading <e> <s> however i am afraid that the noble lord has yet to completely convince me that the discretionary points will not turn out to be somewhat confusing for magistrates and the courts to deal with <e> <s> i know that the automobile association has also put forward the view that a simpler approach to the points system would make life a lot easier for all those concerned with the administration of justice at the time <e>", "<cs> i should be most grateful to the noble lord if he will take a look at this and perhaps write to me before the next stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge is unable to be with us this evening but has passed on a sheaf of papers to me copies of which i understand he has sent to the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> he is concerned because they were received from one of the major motorcycle manufacturers and although they contain no criticism whatever of the provisions of clause they do raise some doubts as to whether it will be possible to do the testing in the time allowed which i think was one of the points that the noble lord opposite was making <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the explanation he has given <e> <s> i am glad i was not the only one who found it difficult to frame an amendment and that his department are having the same difficulty in trying to get to the right solution <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to withdraw my amendments and leave it to the noble and learned lord to see whether he can come up with something <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer so far as it goes following our long discussions on the local government bill <e> <s> will he not agree that the parish councils which are already under stress are suffering even more financially because of the present financial stringencies under which the districts and other authorities operate <e> <s> therefore will he consider when he is producing the penny rate rules which i understand are anticipated later this year whether he could define the calculation of a penny rate attracted by a parish expenditure the rsg attracted by a parish expenditure and try to cure this way of dealing with the concurrent powers thus making sure that they are operated properly <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we would also like to give a somewhat cautious welcome to the statement and to the consultative document which we have seen briefly <e> <s> the noble lord looks surprised <e> <s> i am sure there is no reflection intended on the integrity of the present district audit unit staff or indeed of lamsac i hope there will be the widest consultation with the local authorities particularly with regard to the work of lamsac and as to how much of that ought to be taken over properly by the new commission <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to have another look at the date by which the reflections of the local authorities have to be in to him <e> <s> the date given in the statement this afternoon and in the consultative document is th september <e> <s> most local authorities like parliament have a recess in august <e> <s> that only gives them a bare two weeks to make up their decisions and to make their views known to their local authority associations <e> <s> i hope the noble lord is not going to be too hard and fast on the th september and that he will if necessary lengthen it to get proper consultations with the local authorities <e> <s> we also welcome the fact that the commissions annual report is going to be laid before parliament and if it is necessary there will be an opportunity for either or both houses to discuss it <e> <s> we would applaud anything that takes away the powers from the secretary of state in the local government act even if it puts them on to a new commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it is exactly one year ago today that we concluded our deliberations on the local government planning and land bill <e> <s> i argued then that that was a bill which fundamentally restructured the relationship between central government and local government and that it gave too much power over local government to the secretary of state to any secretary of state <e> <s> i argued further that it had gone a long way towards destroying the mutual trust and confidence that existed between local authorities and central government trust and confidence that had taken many decades to build up <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter for giving us the opportunity today to consider the government green paper <e> <s> i have listened carefully to what he said and to what was said by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i would go a long way with the ideas of both noble lords on how local government ought to be accountable and i would agree with many of the points put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> however i must correct him over peterborough <e> <s> peterborough was a labour council at the time the report to which he referred was commissioned <e> <s> it is now a hung council and the balance of power lies with the alliance <e> <s> perhaps that is an omen of things to come <e>", "<cs> my lords that remains to be seen <e> <s> local government expenditure today is a very hot potato and there are heated arguments everywhere as to where the money is to come from to pay for what local government rightly has to do or feels it ought to do <e> <s> i make no apology for once again stating my belief that central government in order to manage their economy do not need to control local government expenditure <e> <s> it needs two controls only central government should determine the amount of the grant that they give to local authorities and how much they are able to borrow <e> <s> within those two constraints local government expenditure can and should be left to the local authorities to determine so long as that expenditure is financed by local authorities own taxes for which they have to he accountable to their own electorate <e> <s> on the question of accountability i would agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to give a general welcome to this bill because it will take away from local authorities the need to spend money on raising their own private bills <e> <s> may i take up two of the main points which were raised by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> the first is the licensing of music and dancing <e> <s> there seems to be a growing objection to the provision which will transfer the licensing of public music singing and dancing to local authorities <e>", "<cs> when we had a working party on pop festivals it split down the middle as to whether we ought to be asking for legislation to license or whether we should leave things as they were <e> <s> for my part i can see no difficulty whatever in licensing for the genuine commercial pop festivals <e> <s> but the problems will arise with the so-called free festivals when they invade some farmers land without asking permission when there is no one person against whom one can issue writs or against whom one can put out summonses or with whom one can negotiate <e> <s> once the negotiations become a little difficult that person vanishes and one has to find another person <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for offering to take this back and have a look at it <e> <s> i could not possibly refuse the invitation to withdraw my amendment and let him do that <e> <s> i hope that perhaps we may get together before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i said in the light of earlier discussions that at this stage this was a probing amendment to find out the governments views and whether they had progressed any further since second reading <e> <s> therefore i shall be withdrawing my amendment at this time <e> <s> i shall read <e>", "<cs> i too should like to welcome the amendment <e> <s> a little bird has been very busy twittering around and i hoped that we might have had a song from the noble lord opposite which indicated whether those twitterings were on the right lines <e> <s> but obviously that is not to come yet <e> <s> i should like to follow the noble lord lord northfield about the difficulty in getting any economic regeneration in the smaller districts where they have only the p rate <e> <s> i should like to refer to corby which is very near to my area <e> <s> unemployment there is at the rate of per cent <e> <s> and a p rate would bring them in just over <e> <s> in east lindsey which is also very close to me a p rate would produce only yet they have an unemployment rate of per cent <e> <s> fenland which is adjoining my area have written to me to say that they would be in an impossible situation since the training centre which they are operating with manpower services commission money would have to count against their p expenditure entitlement under the local government act <e> <s> if they were limited to a halfpenny rate they could not even support the training centre let alone undertake any other industrial projects <e> <s> the noble lord lord northfield referred to chesterfield <e> <s> there they have an unemployment rate of per cent <e> <s> something like will go nowhere in an area like that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord bellwin has said in his courteous introduction to the bill part i provides for the abolition of the supplementary rates and precepts and requires local authorities to make their rates and precepts for a complete financial year <e> <s> i believe that most noble lords in the house would accept the governments right to control the overall spending of local authorities but frankly this second attempt at legislation though different from the no <e> <s> bill is really no better than the first <e>", "<cs> the debates today have ranged wide and over many subjects but i feel that we cannot let this part of the bill pass without reminding noble lords opposite that there is still considerable disquiet among local authorities and their members about the effects of the bill and the fact that although very few of them have used the supplementary rate there has always been that safety net there <e> <s> i and my colleagues in the sdp and the alliance want to see local authorities budget carefully and prudently <e> <s> but governments do not always interpret what they see in the crystal ball in the right way <e> <s> they do not always get their answers right about what will be the level of inflation what will be the possible salary and wage rises or what will be the material costs in which local authorities must deal and until now the local authorities have had the safety net of the supplementary rate albeit very few of them have had to use it <e> <s> the bill as drafted allows the government to get their sums wrong but if the local authorities also get them wrong through following the governments advice they no longer have the guaranteed safety net of a possible supplementary rate under them to get them out of difficulty <e> <s> i believe there is still a case for the availability of the supplementary rate to be retained <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the minister has said and i am grateful to the noble baroness lady birk for her support <e> <s> i really consider that i must test the feeling of the committee on this amendment <e> <s> members on the other side of the committee know of the disquiet that there is on this side about the effects of the bill and the clause <e> <s> surely it is not too much to ask that the government come back in a years time with a statutory instrument and i should be delighted if i were able to be the first to say to them it has worked we were wrong and you were right <e> <s> i now say please let us have one more chance let the committee agree that the government should come back with a statutory instrument for affirmative resolution in both houses <e> <s> then we can be quite sure that we have got it right <e> <s> i am sorry but i must ask the committee to vote <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord in his amendment <e> <s> i should also like to express my thanks to the noble lord lord bellwin for the care he has taken to try to meet this point <e> <s> but my mind goes back to and the passage of the local government planning and land bill when we spent a long time late one night discussing this <e> <s> we got a lot of sympathy and a lot of good words from the noble lord opposite who promised to take it away and have a look at it <e> <s> nothing was able to come out of that <e> <s> we had a further go by means of questions and suggested a possible way out which was not found to be acceptable <e> <s> there have been discussions in the course of considering this bill in another place with no successful result at all <e>", "<cs> i hope the minister will not mind me quoting this paragraph from his letter <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendments of the noble viscount <e> <s> when we had <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his lucid explanation <e> <s> i understand it a bit better myself now i have heard him and i am pleased to ask the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his reply and it being a rather detailed one i will certainly read it tomorrow <e> <s> i am quite sure that my friends in scotland did not intend it to be taken in the rather rough way that it might perhaps be taken but rather more as a question of drawing attention to what was happening and it is quite obvious that there are defects in the drafting of it if we have not made that plain enough <e> <s> but with the permission of the committee i will withdraw the amendment and take further advice and i will take up the noble lords offer if necessary to come back to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble baroness has said about the effect of these regulations and the fees on the local authority finances <e> <s> the present situation is that the local authorities collect the charges and retain the income then central government make the adjustment through the total rsg to allow for the additional income the authorities have had <e> <s> but as the noble baroness said this has not worked out fairly in so far as the local authorities are concerned and the reduction takes place before the income has been collected <e> <s> it should be based on a best estimate of the income for the next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i would also like to thank the noble lord for the work he has done on this <e> <s> we are very grateful <e> <s> he has gone somewhat wider than we wanted in some places and we are extremely grateful to him <e> <s> i am sure what he has done will be appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord kilmarnock for giving us the opportunity to debate the report this afternoon <e> <s> i should like to go a little wider than the report itself though i believe that the proposals in the task group report are a very considerable improvement on the governments white paper <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kilmarnock has said the msc report recommends a traineeship programme for all school-leavers and wants the programme to be ready to be offered in september to all the -year-olds leaving school or full-time education and not just the unemployed as the governments own youth training proposals envisage <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench we should also like to thank the noble lord for the way in which he has presented the statement though whether we or the local authorities will be quite so happy with the contents of the statement is another matter <e> <s> we fought for a long time on the local government planning and land act against giving <e>", "<cs> my

arguments rehearsed at least three times when i was sitting where the noble lord the minister is now and i have been convinced throughout the whole of our discussions over the years that this is a proper course of action to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the minister for the care with which he presented this bill to the house <e> <s> from this bench we see parts i to iii and vi to viii more as tidying up measures which were expected and are probably based on many of the earlier consultations that have gone on <e> <s> we have some reservations and some suggestions t

no <e> <s> which is really on the same subject <e> <s> we feel that it is important that the mental health officers <e>", "<cs> i beg your pardon <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble earl has said and in the absence of my scottish friends i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to follow a fighting speech from the noble baroness lady bacon when she is really in form as she is this afternoon <e> <s> i think we all accept that the minister made it plain this afternoon that the origin of this bill followed the fiasco of the glc fares fair policy and the ruling given on it when on th july the secretary of state announced that he intended to introduce legislation to clarify the position and to determine the future of revenue support for the local transport operators <e> <s> according to the secretary of state and this was repeated by the noble lord lord bellwin this afternoon the purpose of this bill is to bring stability to the public transport in our cities and to ensure that there is a fair balance between travellers and ratepayers by establishing guidelines for the payment of subsidies <e>", "<cs> my lords i said nothing of the kind <e> <s> i did not refer to a tory vote-catching exercise at all <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is concerned about ministers taking power away from local authorities <e> <s> that is what we are getting at in our amendments to this part of the bill because power is being taken away from local authorities and given to the secretary of state <e> <s> we believe that local authorities should decide what level of transport subsidy they should give to their transport executives <e>", "<cs> i am arguing that the local authorities know better than the secretary of state in whitehall <e> <s> they must account to the electors for what <e>", "<cs> what i said was that the local authorities were the ones who should decide the levels of expenditure and of the services they needed because they are accountable to the electors <e> <s> if the electors do not like what they are doing within three years they have the chance to get rid of them <e> <s> but they are accountable to their electors and they are the ones who know what their electors need what they want and the sort of level of services which should be provided within any locality <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the two maiden speakers on their contribution to our debate this afternoon and as other noble lords have said i hope that we shall hear them in our deliberations and debates in

lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord beloff for giving us this timely opportunity for the discussion we are having this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to welcome in advance the speech we shall hear shortly from the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> he and i worked together very closely on the local government planning and land bill and while our paths have diverged

repeating the statement <e> <s> i share almost entirely the sentiments expressed by the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> is the minister aware that many of the welsh local authorities believe that their rate bills will have to rise by at least twice the rate of inflation since the total cash available for local authority services according to the statement is only up by per cent <e> <s> on the

factors that are disregarded for one part of the rates should continue to be disregarded now that we are setting up this new procedure <e> <s> that seems to me to be a fairly logical suggestion even

statement from the minister that cambridgeshire is not for rate capping i thought that the councillors would be jubilant <e> <s> they were not half as jubilant as i thought they would be because they said ah yes we may not be rate capped but remember we are still above our target and they will get it back in penalties <e> <s> it seems to me that one cannot win <e> <s> we get satisfaction on one score but not on another <e> <s> perhaps when the minister is looking at this and trying to work out ways and bearing in mind that nothing is for always he will remember counties such as cambridgeshire who are very low spenders <e> <s> i put in a special plea for them <e> <s> meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i said it was only a probing amendment to try and find out the governments view <e> <s> we are still not happy about the fact that more than one authority can be debated and perhaps not have time for proper

<e> <s> it seems to me that we are still as confused at least i am and i would like to read what the noble lord has said <e> <s> at this moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for reading the statement made in another place <e> <s> i should also like to say thank you for the fact that we have something about the structure of the rate support grant earlier in the year than is usual <e> <s> but there i am afraid my thanks must cease <e> <s> is the minister sure that the named authorities can maintain their services and meet their statutory obligations with the severe cuts that have been imposed <e> <s> this is a very sad day for local democracy with the arbitrary announcement of a formula that takes no account of the local authorities concerned of their bad housing of their high unemployment of their social deprivation of their large ethnic populations and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement in this house <e> <s> like the noble baroness i can see in it no tidings of comfort and joy for local authorities <e> <s> this has been another sad day for local authorities <e> <s> throughout the time this government have been in office local authorities powers have been whittled away their finances have been cut and now their rates are to be controlled by government and in some cases even fixed by government <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement but i am afraid that it will make life even more difficult for local authorities <e> <s> the minister referred to the fact that last year there was an over-spending of million by local authorities over and above their cash limits for capital expenditure <e> <s> can the minister tell the house what is the excess of government spending as a whole this year and what percentage of that amount is present local authority over-spend <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl and the noble baroness have said this order is one which is seeking approval to cancel the glc and the metropolitan county elections on the basis that some time in the coming months the metropolitan counties and the glc will be abolished <e> <s> that is presupposing that the abolition bill survives its passage through both houses and that the government back-benches will also show some sustained enthusiasm for it in both houses <e> <s> the minister has said he thinks that all will be well that there will be no hiccups on the way <e> <s> but i would remind him that in the final form of the local government interim provisions act under which this order is tabled there is little relationship to the bill which came to your lordships originally on nd may <e> <s> that paving bill was changed out of all recognition by your lordships and while it is still far from perfect we did achieve the concession that this order would not be tabled until after second reading of the bill in another place that the period of office of the present glc and metropolitan councillors would be extended for one year and that both houses would have a chance to discuss this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend for giving us the opportunity to discuss the pirate radio stations tonight <e> <s> i should like also to declare my interest as a director of hereward radio <e> <s> i want to see increased opportunities for the broadcasters for the listeners and for the advertisers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that this bill is not entirely unexpected but neither is it wholly acceptable at this point of time <e> <s> those of us who have been involved with new towns knew that at some time or other those new towns would be wound up when the development corporations job was completed and that the town would then be handed over more or less to the local authority <e> <s> in the early days we thought that we were being practical and realistic not idealistic when we believed that as a general rule it would be right for the commercial and industrial properties to return to the community because it would have been the community the community activities and the amenities that would have played the major part in increasing the value of the leasehold properties <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put the record straight in one respect <e> <s> i did not want to interrupt the noble lord while he was in full flood <e> <s> the agreement to which i referred was not concerned with help for repairing defective properties that had not arisen at the time <e> <s> i was referring to when the six counties concerned came to the department to make the case for population coming in in advance of grants when we had to supply all the facilities and services for them <e> <s> we had an agreement with the labour government for additional help taking those points into account in preparing the rate support grant in one of its many evolutions <e> <s> we managed to get help for the six counties but it had nothing to do with defective property <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we would broadly welcome the setting up of the inquiry and i hope that all local authorities and their associations will play a proper part in it and will give their full co-operation <e> <s> like the noble baroness my only regret is that the request made so often from the benches on this side of the house for a proper inquiry into the function structure and finance of local government was not quite so readily accepted as this present one <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him whether this committee of inquiry will receive evidence from other bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments proposals in this bill to abolish the glc and the metropolitan counties have not been properly thought through neither have their consequences been realised <e> <s> i believe that they will very seriously damage local government in london and in the metropolitan counties <e> <s> what is vital when there are any changes like this is that the new arrangement shall endure <e> <s> there is so much opposition to the proposals in this bill that it is highly likely that any future government will feel they have to undertake even further reorganisation <e>", "<cs> this group of amendments seeks to keep important town planning and environmental services together <e> <s> without these amendments the town and country planning responsibilities of the metropolitan authorities would pass either to the secretary of state as with the strategic planning guidance to be fragmented between district and borough councils as with the unitary plans or be neglected and probably lost as with countryside and other environmental work <e> <s> if they are approved then the county wide town and country planning responsibilities would be placed with passenger and transport authorities in each metropolitan county area and with the london residuary body in greater london which is why we are proposing that they should be renamed as the metropolitan county planning and passenger transport authorities and the london planning authority <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the kindly and courteous way in which he expounded <e> <s> it was rather a long and detailed speech <e> <s> i should like to read it carefully in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given some reassurance by saying that there is some money or there will be some money allocated through grea <e> <s> is he also able to tell us how the royal boroughs grea and target act one against the other because there are occasions in the counties and the boroughs throughout the country where their grea is much higher than their targets and they then come to be rate capped <e>", "<cs> there is an opportunity of working on the proposition put forward by the noble lord lord sandford but i agree with my colleagues on this side of the committee that we need to know more about the organisation and how it is to be funded <e> <s> although the minister does not want to get into local government finance we need to know how it is to be funded and staffed and what sort of powers it will have <e> <s> it is no good just setting up another voluntary organisation <e> <s> it is a mandatory organisation which needs to have the necessary powers and it needs to have the means and the strength to carry out the powers given to it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give the house an assurance that the peacock committee will also examine the high cost structure of independent local radio <e> <s> if more advertising is to be allowed on the wavebands this will lead to many more failures in independent local radio unless their cost structure is amended considerably <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord and also to the other speakers who have intervened and particularly the noble viscount lord colville of culross <e> <s> i am also rather surprised and shaken that the government front bench have said that they will take this back and look at it <e> <s> they obviously think that we have a point in this amendment which i thought was quite a modest one <e> <s> i certainly do not claim to be a parliamentary draftsman and perhaps strategic plans are not things which are normally included but i should think the parliamentary draftsmen could probably get round that if it was felt necessary to have it in <e> <s> in the light of the assurances given and the points which were raised by the noble viscount and because this was only intended to be a probing amendment i would beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is at times like these that i wish that i was as well versed in planning law and procedure as the noble lord lord colville <e> <s> i too am enjoying the tutorial exercise and i hope that i am benefiting from it <e>", "<cs> i accept that what the noble lord the minister said he said in good faith but that does not put it into the bill <e> <s> we accept that he is repeating things in good faith as to how he sees it will work <e> <s> i would ask leave of the committee to withdraw my amendment in favour of amendment no <e> <s> because i think that that strengthens the position considerably <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls was my member of parliament for years and i did not take much notice of him in all that time <e>", "<cs> the mistake is mine <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord skelmersdale was quite clear and that it was i who lacked comprehension at that time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to paragraph of the schedule which enables a joint authority to be set up under part iv of the bill <e> <s> if it is agreed that there shall be such a joint authority will that authority have precepting powers or will it only be able to do the work by agreement with the other authorities <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment which has been moved so ably by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment perhaps i may also say that it is only a probing amendment at this stage and we do not propose to divide the house <e> <s> with my noble friend lord esher i put down a series of amendments to clause earlier in the committee stage <e> <s> we listened carefully to the ministers reply before we withdrew them to decide what we would do on report <e> <s> this amendment is really designed to elicit more information from the government to help us to make that decision <e> <s> i hope the minister will accept that we are genuinely worried about the planning situation after abolition <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for the clear and able way in which she has put forward the case for the bill <e> <s> like her i hope it will have all-party support in this house and go through fairly quickly <e> <s> throughout england and wales too many things are being or have been discussed in private raising serious questions about local democracy and about accountability <e> <s> when electors are denied access to information themselves they expect that their elected representatives will be informed and will be able to advise them accordingly <e> <s> but this has not always happened <e> <s> in some places like liverpool and bromley the majority parties have made use of the denial of information to weaken their elected opponents <e> <s> even more scandalous is the position where the largest single partys representatives are systematically denied the necessary facts by a coalition of the minority parties acting together <e> <s> in hammersmith for example the largest single party does not have one member sitting on the leaders co-ordinating committee because of an alliance between the peoples elected second and third choices <e> <s> this inevitably means that a large number of electors are not really represented when the council meets in closed session <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it may have escaped the noble lords notice that we are at report stage now and we are not supposed to have comings and goings across the floor of the chamber as is happening now <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful to the noble lord for his very full reply to our amendments <e> <s> i am also grateful to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support what the noble baroness has said regarding london and to give notice in effect that if the house accepts this amendment for london then we anticipate coming back at third reading with something similar for the metropolitan counties because it is just as important for there to be co-ordination in the metropolitan counties as it is for there to be co-ordination in london <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say what happens to the unapproved structure plan alterations <e> <s> a lot of work has gone into those and they have not all yet been approved by the minister <e> <s> will the work done on that also be taken into consideration as with the structure plans proper <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has not convinced me about his argument for not giving similar treatment to the metropolitan counties as to london <e> <s> indeed as noble lords on the other side have been talking my mind has gone back to my fire service days during the war when i used to lecture recruits on the history of the fire service and tell them about the early days of this century when fire insurance was introduced <e> <s> fire appliances attended a call and if the right plaque was not on the wall they went away without putting the fire out <e> <s> indeed after the last war fire appliances did not cross county boundaries until it became compulsory under the act for them to work together and to give cross-boundary support <e> <s> without a proposal for the metropolitan counties similar to that for london we shall be back to that kind of position on planning issues which cannot be dealt with in an overall fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has said amendment no <e> <s> is designed to give the joint planning committee a real job of work to do <e> <s> at the moment as i see it the committee is to perform a useful role as a kind of forum within which views about the area can be expressed and analysed <e> <s> however there is no requirement for that body to commit its views in writing or for the local planning authority to have any proper regard for those views <e> <s> in short the boroughs can agree to disagree and very little will have been gained in the process <e>", "<cs> my lords we are being asked tonight to pass a bill which has not been supported by any of the independent or professional bodies and one which gives a major increase in central government control over local government <e> <s> it is a bill which has not set out any coherent framework for a new system of local government in london or the metropolitan counties or for the transition to it from the existing system <e>", "<cs> my lords before the position deteriorates may i from these benches as one of the signatories to the original amendment say how much we appreciate what has happened the tidying up that has been done and the fact that the amendment has been accepted by the government <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his full reply <e> <s> i hope i was not implying that the audit would be any less effective if it were not done by cipfa people <e> <s> what we are arguing is that it would be a duplication of costs and there is obviously a difference of opinion between us as to what that cost is whether it is to per bus company of to per annum overall <e> <s> that is something i should like to take back as the noble lord has offered to do and check on those figures as well <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has me quite worried as to whether my authority will end up in jail or something <e> <s> my district authority in a shire county allows people to get a british rail senior citizens ticket <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply and for the fact that he is going to look at dial-a-ride and things like that <e> <s> perhaps at this stage the less i say about other concessionary fares the better <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness referred to buses which one can get wheelchairs on <e> <s> i perhaps did not make myself plain <e> <s> i meant them for the people who were sufficiently mobile even with their handicap to be able to get on to a normal bus if the steps up to it were low enough for them to be able to get on to the first step and if there was a handrail to help them on <e> <s> that is the sort of help that we should insist on so that more elderly and infirm people can be assisted <e> <s> it is the infirm rather than the severely handicapped who are likely to be able to use the buses if they have the kind of fixtures that will give some help in getting on and off <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> i understand the difficulties that he is in <e> <s> having stood in his place and been chivvied by the noble lord lord teviot some years ago i know exactly the problems that he is facing in trying to please everyone and do what he thinks is right <e> <s> i am happy that he is taking the amendment back to have a look at it <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should also like to say that we had a copy of the statement rather earlier than usual so i do not know what happened to the one for the labour front bench <e> <s> i am sure that this statement will not receive a very enthusiastic welcome in local government service <e>", "<cs> one of the factors most appreciated by wheelchair people is british rails willingness to accommodate them on trains <e> <s> this has opened a completely new world to many people who have been confined to wheelchairs and not able to get about <e> <s> british rail has given much publicity to the help it gives the wheelchair people and indeed to cyclists who wish to take their cycles with them <e> <s> these services have been used and they are very much appreciated by those who have had the opportunity to use them <e> <s> i am concerned about what happens to a person like the noble viscount lord ingleby who is travelling from london to yorkshire at the weekend when engineering works mean that the train stops and passengers have to proceed by bus <e> <s> what happens to the noble viscount in his wheelchair if he cannot get on to the bus <e> <s> is he stranded a few stations from home <e> <s> surely there is an obligation upon british rail if it stops services for whatever reason to ensure that the transport provided can take those people that it has contracted to carry from a to b <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to support the amendment <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord belstead for the time the thought and the consideration that he has given to the many problems that we have raised on this and associated issues during the passage of the bill <e> <s> but we are still concerned about the set up of the new statutory advisory committee to take the lead in developing the code <e> <s> if as i understand it that committee is to be based on the present rather informal arrangements for an advisory committee certainly those people are extremely knowledgeable on the mobility aspects and issues and the needs but they do not necessarily have the professional expertise of the transport operators and those kind of experts cannot be brought in and made to work overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i had not expected to get so much accommodation from raising what appears to be quite a small amendment <e> <s> i think he is probably right that the limit of will cover most of the present community bus schemes <e> <s> in the light of what he said

be included in the general scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement to us today but i cannot refrain from commenting that it is once again very late <e> <s> the government do not seem to appreciate that local authorities start their budget procedure about september and aim to get it finished and finalised by the end of february or the beginning of march <e> <s> not to know what the rate support grant is until the christmas vacation is pushing it a bit fine <e> <s> it shows a reduced amount of money available and has ignored inflation <e> <s> those two parts we would deplore <e> <s> but it may have switched a little more money to the inner cities and that we support <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join the noble baroness lady lockwood in expressing my thanks to our chairman for the very able way in which he introduced our report today and also for his very wise guidance throughout the many sittings of the committee <e> <s> i certainly appreciated the opportunity given to me to serve on that committee and of meeting the witnesses and visiting local authorities <e> <s> but as our chairman has said the local authority associations did not appear to see it as their duty to disseminate information <e> <s> that appeared to be left more to the officers societies and at the time your select committee felt that the individual authorities and associations ought to be setting up these special sub-committees for science and technology which have already been referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know there was no discussion on the rate support grant and the committee did not know of the proposed changes <e>", "<cs> my lords we too thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i also congratulate him on at least the look of the document which i collected only a few moments ago <e> <s> it certainly looks readable and well illustrated and i hope that it is something we can easily understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am accustomed to skipping pages while taking in something <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for repeating the statement to which we give a rather cautious welcome now having in mind that the original rate support grant settlement was a bad one especially with regard to the shire counties which had a reduction in grant because of the switch to the metropolitan boroughs the london districts and the inner cities <e> <s> i hasten to say that we are not against more resources going to the inner cities but we think that that should have been a national charge and not done at the expense of the shire counties <e> <s> the recycling that is proposed today does not seem to be affecting that <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the minister in a written answer to me last week said that some of the district authorities were not willing to continue financing this scheme <e> <s> however it is not just the district authorities from merseyside and greater manchester which are concerned <e> <s> has there been any consultation with the county councils of cheshire lancashire and cumbria and the three welsh counties which also take part in this scheme which is funded up to a twelfth of a penny rate by each of the authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord bottomley for initiating this debate today because i believe the situation facing the voluntary organisations in the metropolitan counties and the glc is extremely serious <e> <s> all that <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are also grateful to the minister for repeating the statement which seems to be trying to establish the secretary of states legal position in setting the multipliers and to spell out as it were the governments legal position in an attempt to prevent a legal challenge by birmingham and a few shire counties <e> <s> in a very simplistic way as i understand it the multipliers are set so that where an authority has increased resources it receives less grant and where it has reduced resources it gets more grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for the clear way in which she introduced the bill <e> <s> i welcome the intentions behind the bill because i believe that we need to have a balance between the interests of the owners of the goods and those of the public at large and that we have to ensure that neither an innocent trader nor the trading standards authority acting in good faith should be penalised by anything in this bill <e> <s> if legislation is to be enforced it has to be based upon a reasonableness of action by the enforcement authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> does he recall that in a written answer he told me initially that women were considered out of the people who were considered for nomination and appointments were made as he said this afternoon subject to availability and suitability <e> <s> is the minister really suggesting that there are only women in this country who might be considered for such a job with all the expertise that we have among women in local government and ex-local government <e>", "<cs> under governments of two parties my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that most encouraging reply and for accepting that libraries have a part to play in the curricula of schools <e> <s> however will he be able to ensure that the role of school libraries in the curriculum is promoted in the schemes of in-service training which are presently being undertaken through specific grants <e> <s> will he or his department urge local education authorities to use the falling rolls in schools to make sure that libraries are completely available for general use and do not as in many cases just remain part of a classroom used for teaching <e> <s> will they also encourage local education authorities to appoint more chartered librarians on to their school staff <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene in this debate <e> <s> i have no landed estates and no itinerant tinkers at the bottom of my garden i have no trouble with poachers and there are no warning notices about the dangers from agapanthus <e> <s> however some years ago for my sins as a junior minister i was the chairman of the working party on pop festivals which now seem to be very much a thing of the past <e> <s> one of my first experiences was with a young man who was a very avid pop festival attender who complained to me that the police were overbearing and domineering <e> <s> i said in what way <e> <s> he said when i went to the last festival they frisked me <e> <s> i replied i suppose they would <e> <s> if you come to the palace of westminster you will be frisked for your own safety and that of other people <e> <s> he said yes but they took away my axe <e> <s> i replied i hope that they did because it is an offensive weapon <e> <s> what were you doing with an axe when you were going to a pop festival <e> <s> he said you just dont understand <e> <s> when we congregate at pop festivals we do not go to hear the music <e> <s> we go to sit around a camp fire and commune with nature and we need an axe to chop down the trees in order to have a camp fire <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am delighted with his assurance that the government are still looking at the act and perhaps trying to modernise it <e> <s> i hope that while that work is being carried out there will be consultation with the local authorities so that they will have some say about the payment and how it operates within their areas <e> <s> on the basis of the assurance from the minister that the matter is under review and that the government hope at some future time to be able to modernise the riot damages act i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also thank the minister for the statement <e> <s> we look on this as a non-political subject and hope that it will have the support of all parties in the house and all organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should also like to thank the minister for repeating the statement which he thinks ought to be welcome on all sides of the house <e> <s> we do not quite take that view and i doubt whether many local authorities will agree with the minister <e> <s> i should also like to join the noble baroness in complaining about the length of the statement and the short time we have had to consider it <e> <s> i know that that is no fault of the minister but it is something that might be taken account of <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we too should like to thank the minister for the way that he has explained the bill and for the assurances that he has given regarding amendments and the timing of them <e> <s> i speak as a somewhat inadequate substitute for the late lord crawshaw who was going to handle the bill from these benches <e> <s> i lack his housing expertise and knowledge <e> <s> i shall however do my best to fill the void <e> <s> on a happier note i look forward to hearing the maiden speeches of the noble lord lord hesketh and of my noble friend lord davies who brings to the house a lifetimes experience in civil engineering and the building industry <e> <s> we welcome his intervention in our deliberations and we look forward to his taking an active part in the bill as it proceeds through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the minister for introducing this bill much as we dislike it and i also take the opportunity of thanking him for the answer to my question of some weeks ago when he promised the correction at a later date <e> <s> it would seem to be a satisfactory way of dealing with the error though we regret that it had to operate in that way from the start <e>", "<cs> as i have said these are probing amendments to find out the thinking behind the legislation <e> <s> i note what the noble earl has said and at this point in time i beg leave to withdraw the amendment and i will take further advice before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> in view of what he says i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has certainly come forward with some suggestions and has obviously been concerned about the amendment which the noble baroness has proposed <e> <s> it is a little difficult at this stage from just hearing them by the spoken word to know exactly what will appear at report stage and therefore what we ought to do about this amendment this afternoon <e> <s> but i hope that the minister and your lordships committee appreciate the concern that there is among the local authorities as to how this matter has been handled up to this point in time <e>", "<cs> on these benches we are not against the right to buy council houses flats and so forth we are against the selling of old peoples dwellings as we have just demonstrated <e> <s> we are concerned that if houses and flats are to be sold there should still be an adequate pool of rented accommodation for those people who need to rent be it from a housing association a trust or a local authority <e>", "<cs> the councils receive only to start with <e> <s> they are not left with very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i first thank the leader of the house for responding so positively to my pnq this morning and the noble viscount lord davidson for making the statement <e> <s> last evening i received a letter from the right honourable gentleman the secretary of state telling me of the announcement on the lines of the statement today <e> <s> i congratulate the leader of the house on ensuring that the statement was made to this house in parliament and not from the conference platform in bournemouth <e> <s> will he ensure that other statements from bournemouth are also made to this house first either by the appropriate minister or by his junior minister in this house <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> the printing appears to be a bit higgledy-piggledy <e> <s> are we speaking to amendment no <e> <s> or amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am completely ambivalent at the moment about both the amendment and the amendment to it <e> <s> it was always understood during my time on the peterborough development corporation in its early days that rented accommodation would come back eventually to the district council and that any benefits would accrue to the city and citizens in general <e> <s> that was always understood <e> <s> that was why the arrangement was entered into a couple of years ago as the noble baroness has described <e> <s> i am concerned about the phrase any person <e> <s> i would prefer to see houses handed back to district councils to manage <e> <s> they have set up machinery for managing their own stock and that of the development corporations <e> <s> on the other hand i would not be completely against some of them being taken over by housing associations in a proper set-up <e> <s> i would be concerned if they were to be sold off in batches to private landlords for letting without any certainty that they would remain as houses to rent <e>", "<cs> may i give the minister just one piece of advice before he meets the district councils concerned with the new towns <e> <s> i do not want to teach my grandmother to suck eggs or anything like that but i was on the county council in huntingdon and peterborough when we were asked to become one of the partnership authorities in the new town <e> <s> i think one of the reasons for the success of the peterborough new town has been its close association throughout the last or years with the city council or the county council <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why it works so well and has been one of the success stories that we are very proud to boast about <e>", "<cs> it will not make the noble lords meeting any easier if he takes away what they were promised in the first place <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> in putting my name down to support it i was clear in my own mind that it referred to council tenants and not to tenants of dolphin square though i am delighted that there is an independent residents association there and more power to its elbow and to other organisations like it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he give us some indication about the compensation that may be payable to staff <e> <s> as i understand it in the case of peterborough and presumably milton keynes will be the same where the agency agreements are going the staff have been transferred from being new town staff to being district council staff <e> <s> i understand that they had rather better prospects for compensation or redundancy terms if their job ceased as a new town employee than they have as a district council employee <e> <s> if the minister cannot give us that information now perhaps he will let us have it before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister anticipates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that lengthy reply <e> <s> it is obvious that my powers of persuasion are not at their best at this hour of the night <e> <s> that being so i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord foot who is unable to be here this evening has asked me to express his thanks to the minister and to say how pleased he is that these amendments are to be part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like from these benches to support the noble baroness <e> <s> we have had long discussions concerning the sale of accommodation that has been specially built or adapted for the elderly <e> <s> we had them in again in and again during the passage of this bill and similar legislation for scotland <e> <s> the situation today is more urgent than ever before since the demand for such rented accommodation is growing much faster than ever before <e> <s> with cutbacks in local authority expenditure authorities are unable to increase very significantly their stock of this specialist kind of housing <e> <s> we are also concerned that the arrangements for assessing whether or not to agree to the sale have not been working as we had hoped <e> <s> until recently the exclusion rate of cases submitted to the secretary of state was only per cent although surprise surprise i suppose since this bill started its tortuous passage the exclusion rate has gone up to per cent <e> <s> there are still far too many being excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord hanworth i beg leave to ask the question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for the answer she has given <e> <s> i am sure that will go some way to satisfy my noble friend <e> <s> but surely it is possible to introduce into building regulations the need for including requirements for the insulation of floors in new buildings <e> <s> is that one of the matters being taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge is indisposed <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that for some years i was a student a lecturer and eventually a governor of the fire service college <e> <s> i learnt to <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we also thank the noble lord for repeating the <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the minister says some beaches are being monitored by his department at the moment and we are spending something like million a year in order to try to clean up our beaches what rate of improvement does he expect over the next decade <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we also should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we accept that what he is doing and has done is illegal until the new act is on the statute book and that he told us in the statement in december that he would be giving early notification to the authorities for the next financial year <e> <s> we were told in the summer that we were going to have an earlier rsg settlement yet this is the third lot of proposals that have come forward and the actual settlement is going to come later than ever <e>", "<cs> my lords are the users of metal detectors required to have licences <e> <s> if so what sort of information or advice are they given when they apply for the licences <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we also are grateful to the minister for the way in which he has explained this instrument to us <e> <s> we are not opposed to the increased payments or the exemptions and remissions <e> <s> they are in line with what was always uderstood were to be the phased increases and this is one of them <e> <s> i understand that the instrument has had a more or less non-controversial acceptance in another place <e> <s> all parties were agreed on it <e> <s> i hope that that applies tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome the statement from the minister as a very progressive start to some new policies <e> <s> we all support the small-scale enterprises and the diversification in the use of buildings and such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> last evening the noble lord lord belstead his colleague parried my queries concerning planning in regard to the statement that we were discussing by saying that the environmental aspect of planning is not really affected by the statement <e> <s> i accepted those comments in good faith but now that i have seen the department of the environment circular i have considerable doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord answer the questions i asked about what influence people in the communities concerned are to have on proposed developments within their area <e> <s> he does not seem to have dealt with any of my questions at all <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept that if the government did more about home insulation there would be much less need for energy conservation and for the building of nuclear power stations <e> <s> if our homes were properly insulated less energy would be used and therefore we could do away with some of the proposed power stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble baroness lady david in her condemnation of this bill <e> <s> my background as many of your lordships know is in shire counties <e> <s> i have felt for many years not only with this government but with the preceeding one that the shire counties got a very raw deal <e> <s> it seems to me that the only certainty about the proposals in this bill is that local authorities as a whole are going to receive less in block grant than they do in the system of flowback which we have at the moment <e> <s> i believe that the total abolition of block grant recycling and the other technicalities in the bill can only produce a new kind of mechanism which will restrain local authorities spending which is every bit as unfair and severe particularly on the shire counties as the discredited system of targets and penalties which we abolished in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not <e> <s> however after bills no one can remember what was said on any one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he tell us what form of consultation there will be with local authority associations <e> <s> at the moment when the minister is making his decisions about rate support grant and block grant some consultations go on with the consultative body <e> <s> will that continue or will the minister make the decision arbitrarily without hearing what the associations think <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the archaeological pressure group rescue suggests that as many as sites were lost under the bulldozers last year and that there is or has appeared to be a delay in the processing of applications for grants <e> <s> is the reason for such delay when it occurs that we do not have sufficient qualified staff to process the applications <e> <s> if so is he satisfied that there are enough such staff in training who are likely to be available to enable the job to be done expeditiously in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in our debate on th april at col the noble lord lord plummer with his great experience of what happens in london said that the period laid down for the transfer of certain responsibilities was much too short <e> <s> is not that now becoming apparent in the fact that we started postabolition with people in place and the present proposals mean i understand a reduction to <e> <s> is not all this rather too hurried <e> <s> would it not be better to make up the shortfall from the london residuary bodys revenue income for another year and so allow time to sort out this centre of excellence by the best possible means <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to bring this debate to a close <e> <s> i think that we are very fortunate that it has survived the turmoil of the past couple of days and we have been able to discuss this topic <e> <s> the justification for the debate is the number of people who have taken part <e> <s> it is not for me to wind up on the occasion of a short debate <e> <s> i should just like to assure the noble lord lord campbell of croy that the alliance would not dare take anything away from the scottish office <e> <s> i shall let him have a note about how we see it working there but i shall not bore the house with those details now <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to associate ourselves with the comments made by the two noble lords <e> <s> we express our good wishes and thanks to all members of staff in every department who have served this house so faithfully and so well <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and to other members of the committee who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> when drafting amendments from the opposition benches it is always unfortunate to be told afterwards that they are defective since one does not have at ones elbow the skill of the parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> i accept that perhaps my amendment is not plain enough and that the speech in support of it was not clear enough <e> <s> all kinds of disability are covered we need to look at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am shattered <e> <s> i had not expected to have the first amendment of the day accepted so readily <e> <s> i am grateful the the noble lord <e> <s> i accept that my amendment may be defective in drafting and i accept his invitation to withdraw it now and to look at his proposed amendment tomorrow <e> <s> i am most grateful and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we come back to this question for the third time <e> <s> both i and those helping me to prepare the case appreciate very much the ministers gesture <e> <s> we are satisfied with the amendment that he has offered in place of mine which was wrongly drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should like to give a general welcome to the statement <e> <s> at this point in time of course the costs are still unknown but we are all aware that they will be extremely high <e> <s> we all regret the loss of life and property and extend our sympathy to those who have suffered <e> <s> assistance is needed and government help <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord belstead on his new appointment and wishing him well <e> <s> i should also like to say how much we look forward to dealing with the noble earl lord caithness on local government and environmental matters in the future <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> a problem also arises in respect of retained fire stations in remote rural areas such as parts of bedfordshire suffolk cambridgeshire devon cumbria and yorkshire <e> <s> there are many retained stations and the authorities are dependent on their manning for the maintenance of fire cover in the area <e> <s> at such stations the duties of caretaker are usually performed by a local person at a time mutually agreed with the stations chief officer <e> <s> most of the stations are unmanned except on a drill night or during a fire call <e> <s> the stations are therefore kept locked and the cleaners must have a key in order to obtain access <e> <s> in most cases there is not a great deal of cleaning to be done <e> <s> however the question of security arises because at the station are kept the fire service vehicles containing various equipment and security devices <e> <s> i think that such counties would be helped if they could continue to use locally based labour <e> <s> therefore the issue falls into the same category as village schools <e>", "<cs> i understand that we are discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and with this particular amendment according to the groupings list <e> <s> i believe it is important that the authorities should have a residual capacity to undertake work in an emergency <e> <s> as a noble lord said on an earlier amendment how can an authority discharge its statutory responsibilities and deal with a situation of emergency such as a civil disaster flood bad weather a contractor defaulting or one who reaches the position of a local monopoly <e> <s> no one else can do anything about it <e> <s> as the bill stands at present any authority which fails to win any tenders within the defined activity will no longer have any residual labour to use in this kind of emergency <e> <s> the government think and they may be right that the private sector is capable of responding to this kind of emergency and that emergency response <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is right when she says that it does not matter if the grass is left for two or three weeks <e> <s> it may take a little longer to cut it when you get back to it but at least that is not doing harm to anyone <e> <s> it is the same if a contractor defaults on a building <e> <s> if eventually the building is a month late being delivered to the authority so be it hut if the meals-on-wheels service breaks down or the delivery breaks down you cannot ask elderly people to wait a month until somebody brings them their dinner <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that members of the reserve force would be sitting on their backsides doing nothing <e> <s> we were suggesting that per cent <e> <s> of the work that is to be put out to tender by the local authorities should be retained by their own direct labour organisations and not that those men should be sitting there doing nothing and waiting for an emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his introduction of the code <e> <s> i do not have the expertise or the accounting qualifications of the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> i can only look at the matter from the point of view of one who has spent almost a lifetime as an elected member of local government <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the group of amendments <e> <s> this is not an old comrades association of the national fire service it is purely fortuitous that the noble lord lord underhill and i were both in the service at the same time <e> <s> i also have a slight connection with the service now through its benevolent fund <e> <s> it is important that fire service vehicles should be exempt in the same way as are police vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble baroness lady phillips in her moving of the second reading <e> <s> for an innocent abroad i think she showed a pretty commanding understanding of what the bill was about <e> <s> i welcome the instruction proposed by the noble lord lord jay though i hope that it might prove to be superfluous <e> <s> i should have thought that the issues he raised are ones which one would expect a select committee of your lordships house to have in mind and to take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness give way <e> <s> i said that i thought that the instruction was superfluous because these were the kind of matters at which a select committee would look <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench we should also like to be associated with the tributes being paid to lord ramsey <e> <s> he and i came into this house as life peers at about the same time in <e> <s> he had a brilliant mind and on his day he was an extremely good communicator <e> <s> he did not intervene often in our debates some of us felt not often enough but he was always listened to intently <e> <s> we always enjoyed his command of the english language and his philosophical and at times somewhat radical views <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to associate ourselves with those remarks and wish sir john a very speedy return to health <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should very much like to congratulate the two previous maiden speakers <e> <s> we hope that we shall hear much more of them <e> <s> we also offer our good wishes to the noble earl lord carnarvon expecting that we shall have an equally competent contribution from him <e> <s> we hope that we shall hear all three noble lords regularly in your lordships house in the coming months <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i accept that for the most part we would not have any problems with the local authorities <e> <s> i think there is still a possible danger that there might be the odd cowboy getting in <e> <s> but i should like to read what he has said consult my advisers again and if necessary come back to it <e> <s> but for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i speak to my amendments nos <e> <s> za and zc which narrows the field somewhat for me <e> <s> we are still within the small business area but concerned with village shops and post offices <e> <s> i raised this matter with the noble earl at second reading <e> <s> he assured me then and i believe he hoped to allay my fears that only the business part of those premises would be revalued <e> <s> he implied that it might not make very much difference <e> <s> i have been making some inquiries and i find that within my own village the community charge is likely to approximate the present rates and the shop keepers will still have the business rate to pay on that part of their property which is used as a shop <e>", "<cs> the point which the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has raised is worrying the rural village shopkeepers <e> <s> what the government do not seem to have grasped at the moment is that the rural rate poundage on the whole has been lower than that in the urban area <e> <s> therefore it will be a burden on those who have village shops particularly those in the more remote rural areas <e> <s> they will now be faced with paying their community charge on the domestic part of their property having their shop valued and paying the national business rate at the same level of rateable poundage as those people in the city <e> <s> we want some concession or some guidelines so that the valuers are able to take account of the fact that in our remote rural areas there are not the same services nor the same facilities provided for the ordinary residents and particularly for the village shopkeepers as there are in our conurbations and bigger areas <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the ministers reply and like my colleagues on the other benches i am becoming fed up with the continual disparagement of local government that we hear from the benches opposite <e> <s> i should like to see us return to the day when local and central government consulted each other and worked together in the same frame of mind as they enjoyed or years ago <e> <s> that will not happen if all the time central government are picking on local government and making them the scapegoat for everything <e> <s> salaries comprise the biggest part of most local authorities budgets <e> <s> when central government fix the salaries of a very high proportion of people then local authorities have very little money left in the kitty with which to fund projects <e> <s> i see that the noble lord wishes to say something <e>", "<cs> perhaps after four interventions i may continue <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson is quite right <e> <s> many of the counties are running very tight ships <e> <s> i was in local government before i came to this chamber years ago <e> <s> in cambridgeshire which is the county of the noble baroness lady blatch we were even then making considerable savings and beginning to reduce our expenditure <e> <s> that has gone on year after year <e> <s> i think that it is very unwise and unfair of the government benches and perhaps the minister will listen to what is being said <e>", "<cs> i think it is very unwise and unfair of the government continually to blame local government as a whole for what a few authorities have done and done badly <e> <s> all we are asking in this group of amendments is for the government to base their returns on the real practical considerations of local government <e> <s> local authorities are given statutory duties to do a job but there is not enough money left in the kitty to do that job without considerably putting up charges to the community charge payers <e>", "<cs> it will indeed put up the costs tremendously and we do not know who will met them <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for giving us such a comprehensive reply so late in the day <e> <s> it was rather much to take in <e>

should like also to express my support for the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> having made the exceptions on caravans it is perfectly proper that we should also make exceptions on the grounds proposed <e> <s> the government are asking the farming industry to take some land out of farming and to use their buildings to good effect and thus help to create more leisure industry

as long as this <e> <s> having raised the matter may i also have a copy of the letter <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is to look at figures again will he also look at some of the briefing which many of us have received which puts a very different complexion on the matter <e> <s> we are told that the projected community charge in greenwich to which residual rating will apply is <e> <s> we are also told that there are other authorities around london with projected community charges higher than and yet they are not to be subject to residual rating <e> <s> we are furthermore told that hammersmith and fulham has a projected charge of and yet there are other authorities with a higher figure which are not to be subject to residual rating <e> <s> perhaps if those are the figures and they are substantiated the minister will understand more easily why some of us are so concerned about these nine or <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> it is rather late at night to take in all that complicated reply <e> <s> i have a feeling i am supposed to be saying thank you because the noble earl has gone some way towards meeting us as promised by his colleague in another place <e> <s> i should like to read the reply again and i shall convey my thanks personally if i have the right idea <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems to be my night for saying thank you to the minister <e> <s> i have done it twice in succession on amendments <e> <s> i am delighted that he is taking the amendment back and having discussions <e> <s> i hope that they are successful and look forward to hearing from him in the future about the kind of arrangements that he has made and how the parishes will benefit from them <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support all that the noble lord lord mcintosh has said in moving his amendment and to speak specifically to the amendment in my name amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we have been arguing in committee for more than six days about the question of accountability in one form or another <e> <s> many of us have argued that it is under threat from three different specific provisions in the bill <e> <s> in earlier amendments to schedule we tried to deal with the fact that the inflation rate for increases in non-domestic rates does not reflect the actual cost met by local government <e> <s> we argued a couple of days later that the arrangements for billing and accounting for the community charge do not clearly state the true position for county councils as set out in clause <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord mcintosh and share some of his concern about this point <e> <s> i am delighted that the wilful misconduct part has gone but as he says i think we are in for all sorts of trouble with the rather wide and loose wording of subsections b and c <e> <s> i ask the minister whether he will take the matter back and have another look at it <e> <s> it is very wrong that officers should be given policing duties of any sort <e> <s> it is the responsibility of the members the council and ultimately the courts if something goes wrong <e>", "<cs> whether the authority accepts the judgment on a particular issue is a matter for the authority <e> <s> the elected members and ultimately the council must decide whether or not they accept the advice of their treasurer <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right to say that our amendments run in parallel <e> <s> the same results would be obtained by accepting either amendment <e> <s> we wish to see the responsibility for the level of resources and costs made a matter for the elected members of a council as a whole <e> <s> it should be their job to decide such matters as part of their overall duties <e> <s> i shall be happy to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord underhill and to withdraw my amendment in due course <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that i was probably only talking about those people who live in areas where there are very high spending councils and who may have to pay an extra a week over and above what they receive from the government towards their community charge <e> <s> those are the people in the deprived inner city areas <e> <s> there are a great many of those people and we are just as concerned about them and the effect that these regulations will have on them as we are about the few people at the other end of the scale who may well get back a little more from the dhss than they need for their social services <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply although i cannot agree with very much of it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i said thank you to his colleague on monday night and i say thank you to him this afternoon <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is pleasing to come to one of the final amendments in this great schedule of amendments we have had over eight days on such a happy note from the minister <e> <s> i am delighted as i know that people who asked me to look after this point will be <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we too wish to add to the unanimity which appears to be present around the house this afternoon <e> <s> we give the white paper a cautious welcome <e> <s> we are delighted to know that ministerial certificates are being abandoned <e> <s> we have always doubted them <e> <s> we have always taken the view that a judicial committee of the privy council should make these decisions rather than ministers <e> <s> but we are delighted that the white paper appears to have taken on board a lot of the points that were raised in the shepherd bill and is certainly an improvement on the bill <e> <s> we shall of course study the white paper <e> <s> we hope like other noble lords that it will be possible in our present rather heavy legislative programme to find time to have a debate in this house and to make our views known <e> <s> but for the time being without having read the white paper completely we offer it a cautious welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may from this bench also thank the minister and echo what the noble lord lord graham has said <e> <s> we are extremely grateful for the announcement that was made earlier today <e> <s> we appreciate it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the ministers response <e> <s> i did not expect that he would accept the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been very persuasive <e> <s> i am still not completely convinced by his argument <e> <s> i am still not sure that the charge payer will be able to see from the bill he receives exactly who is providing what and what he is paying for <e> <s> in the light of having tried three times i mentioned it at second reading i had a go at the committee stage and again now i had better give <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should also like to endorse the sentiments expressed in the humble address and to offer our thanks to the noble lord lord pym and his colleagues for the excellent arrangements that they have made <e> <s> as a nation we owe so much to the events of and our constitutional monarchy our democracy our religious tolerance and the parliamentary rights safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the citizens of this land <e> <s> for all those things we have every reason to be grateful and to have cause for celebration <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my appreciation to the minister for the way in which he has handled the bill <e> <s> he has been very good tempered throughout these long days and nights <e> <s> he has been very courteous to us all <e> <s> he has been extremely helpful and meticulous about writing to those of us whose points he took away for consideration <e> <s> for that we are grateful <e> <s> a number of concessions have been made but unfortunately the principle of the bill still remains intact <e> <s> like other speakers this evening we still feel that this is a bad bill and people will realise just how bad it is as time goes by <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we also wish to join with the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord jenkins of hillhead in <e>", "<cs> my lords while we on the sdp benches are not prepared to give a fulsome welcome to the statement made by the minister we give it a rather low-key approval <e> <s> it seems to us that the measures proposed are the same as are being produced in ireland itself <e> <s> therefore i do not think that we shall commit any damage to ourselves internationally and it may just bring some comfort to the victims of terrorism if they do not have to see and hear the iras statements on tv and radio <e>", "<cs> my lords from the sdp benches we would also like to support the motion proposed by the noble lord lord cledwyn in his usual engaging manner and express our thanks to the two noble lords who have proposed the motion for the address this afternoon <e> <s> we congratulate the noble lord lord colnbrook and the noble lord lord henley on their contributions today <e> <s> the noble lord lord colnbrook failed to mention that he had a naval history as well and that came out in the bristol and shipshape manner in which he delivered his address to us this afternoon <e> <s> the distinction with which he served in another place particularly in his job as chief whip must have given him a feel for parliamentary procedure and a feel for this house which was also evident in what he had to say to us today <e> <s> all those qualities were evident and we are grateful to him for sharing them with us <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i regret that my noble friend lady burton is not present to hear such a satisfactory reply to her pleas on behalf of the consumer representatives on the committee <e> <s> i am sure that she will be delighted to read the ministers reply in hansard <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we also wish to thank the noble earl for the statement which he has made <e> <s> however we regret the reasons why he had to make it <e> <s> i wish also to extend our sympathy to the bereaved and injured and our appreciation to the emergency services and to the spectators who behaved so well when this happened <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout my years membership of your lordships house very few bills have aroused so many fears and doubts among so many organisations as this bill <e> <s> many of the environmental organisations want to be sure that there are enforceable measures in the bill to secure the permanent protection of the landscape and our countryside <e> <s> they want to be sure that the existing provision for public access will remain <e> <s> they want to see the code of practice made mandatory and areas of really fine landscape importance vested in some kind of public body or a voluntary body managing those areas in the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench we should like to offer our thanks to the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> one of our national papers described the result as neither a fiasco nor a triumph <e> <s> but we welcome the much more flexible approach of the prime minister and we support the decision to accept the first stage of the delors report as a basis for further work <e> <s> we believe that it is right to take more time to consider the further stages of the report in order to bring in other ideas and other approaches <e> <s> we believe that it is right to use this time for a very full investigation and consideration of all the aspects of the delors proposals but not as a delaying tactic to prevent great britain from playing its proper role in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his exposition of the bill and what is in it but it did not give me very much satisfaction or confidence in the bill <e> <s> i should also like to apologise to the noble lord and those who will follow me that i shall have to leave the chamber at about half past four for a meeting <e> <s> no discourtesy is intended and i shall be back as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the debate with great interest <e> <s> i served for years as a member of the local authority <e> <s> indeed i was a local government officer before that and a secretary of nalgo at that time <e> <s> i also had four years in government as a junior minister <e> <s> i yield to none in my admiration for the impartiality and professionalism of those who served me both in local and in national government <e> <s> i resent the implication made by some noble lords opposite that local government officers are somewhat less careful about their impartiality and advice than are civil servants <e>", "<cs> i support this group of amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh has explained the difference that a modest salary increase can make to the number of people who will be affected <e> <s> he spoke of the absurdity of the involvement of fire service employees <e> <s> many people who receive london weighting will earn that amount <e> <s> technically it is not their basic salary but they are drawing that amount or more including london weighting and various locally agreed salary incentives <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkin referred to the fact that these people do not have to be on local authorities in order to put something back into the community <e> <s> i agree that there are many voluntary organisations in which people can help and which are glad to have people help them <e> <s> again however that raises a question in the minds of some local government officers as to whether they are doing political work for those voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell us whether the codes of practice applying to civil servants here apply also to civil servants in europe <e> <s> if we are going into a single market in there will be freedom to move around from one country to another <e> <s> will the government take any note of what happens to civil servants in other countries and in the european commission <e>", "<cs> i feel some disappointment and draw some encouragement from the ministers reply <e> <s> i accept the point that the noble lord lord mcintosh made it is good and valid and one which i had not considered too deeply <e> <s> i shall certainly consider it again <e> <s> i am worried that some who have spoken in the debate say that if this does not work we shall have to go for enforcement <e> <s> that would go on and on and we should have to find another bill or another means of including that enforcement <e> <s> however i accept that it is a difficult problem <e>", "<cs> i support these amendments so ably moved by the noble lord lord hayter <e> <s> in many parts of the country the new proposals to replace section money will not create problems for voluntary organisations but some authorities particularly the inner-london boroughs and some of the shire district authorities who fund a large number of voluntary bodies will have problems <e> <s> there will be problems especially when one tier of local government decides to fund projects which are the responsibility of another tier of local government <e> <s> i am thinking for example of some cases of sheltered housing some aspects of transport and indeed crime prevention <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that it may be possible for the government to allow local authorities at the end of the year which <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said is their busiest time the time they are fixing a rate to draw on the proceeds for the next year <e> <s> has that been discussed with the local authority associations <e> <s> it seems to me that to draw on the next years allocation will only exacerbate the position in that year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the reply <e> <s> i had hoped that in the light of the evidence we have brought forward today the noble lord would at least agree to take the amendment away and have another look at it to see whether it is possible to do something in the rest of the united kingdom to make the system work as it does in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to also to express my support for these amendments especially amendment no <e> <s> which was referred to by the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood <e> <s> the peterborough development corporation the city council the dhss and the local builders federation joined together in the early s <e> <s> they agreed that it was much more sensible to give a grant to the builder who was building the house so that he could install the facilities needed for the disabled person who would live in the house rather than build the house and then give a grant afterwards to enable doors to be widened bathrooms and kitchens altered and so on <e> <s> it was agreed that the city council would give to the builder the same grant as it would give to someone to alter a house after it had been built thus enabling the builder to install the right kind of facilities from the beginning <e> <s> that was done quite happily with consent all around for a couple of years <e> <s> however the district auditor then came in and drew the attention of the department to the fact that the city council was acting illegally <e> <s> he said that the money being used for the grant was money which was meant for the alteration of existing properties and therefore could not be used to make new properties right in the first instance <e> <s> he ruled that the council was acting illegally <e> <s> therefore the scheme had to stop <e>", "<cs> my lords from the sdp bench and also as one of the five much referred to women peers from cambridgeshire i also support the motion of the noble lord lord cledwyn and offer my congratulations to the noble lord lord holderness and to the noble baroness lady blatch <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said in introducing the bill consultation has been taking place for some time <e> <s> therefore it is not a reaction to the recent food safety scares although we must accept that there have been a large number of scares <e>", "<cs> my lords elwyn jones will certainly be mourned on all sides of the house <e> <s> he was always so kind and courteous and his extrovert and friendly manner put everyone at their ease <e> <s> he was a superb raconteur with a very wide range of humorous stories <e> <s> i remember the long nights and the all-night sittings on the devolution bills when elwyn could be relied upon to dispel any tetchiness on the front bench in the early hours of the morning with a humourous aside or a whispered anecdote <e> <s> he will be remembered for his service as a member of the war crimes executive and for his handling of the nuremberg trials <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of croy for presenting his motion in such a competent way this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to be associated with the words of the government chief whip <e> <s> i think that he covered almost everyone <e> <s> i have a list as well which includes the cleaners <e> <s> they look after our offices and leave them spick and span when we manage to make them untidy every day with our voluminous amounts of discarded papers <e> <s> we are grateful to the staff and to all those who help to make life so pleasant for us here <e> <s> they look after us and as the noble lord lord graham said they look after our visitors as well <e> <s> we wish all noble lords and all members of staff a very happy christmas and a good new year <e>", "<cs> i am terribly disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> having tabled only two very small amendments in the whole of this bill i was hoping to be the lucky one to hear the words yes we accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble and gallant lord not only for the report which his committee has presented but also for the very clear way in which he introduced it to the house <e> <s> it was completed very soon after the report of the house of commons energy select committee on the same subject and is extremely complimentary to that report <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the minister for the clear way in which he introduced the bill this morning and also for sending out copies of his notes on clauses which have been most useful to me <e> <s> i have been making a second venture into matters to do with coal my first being some years ago <e> <s> for a brief period at the same time as the noble lord lord ezra i was a member of the national coal consumers council <e> <s> however i speak purely as a lay person today without any great knowledge of the industry or what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> as i said i am a lay person in these matters <e> <s> far be it from me to try to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for that reply <e> <s> it has given some clarification and i am satisfied that by regulations he will be able to cover the points which i made <e> <s> i beg to leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i wish to deal with the problems already caused to local authorities which i raised on second reading <e> <s> there are problems for local authorities where sites are not properly regulated and restored and where the environment is damaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount for the courtesy which he showed us when we met him the other day and for his willingness to consider the reframing of this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that the amendment which we now have is acceptable to all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the restructuring of the finances of the coal industry even though as the noble lord lord ezra said it has perhaps been dealt with a little belatedly for some <e> <s> however it is necessary and it will be a good thing for the industry <e> <s> i am also pleased that we had the co-operation of the minister in regard to the environmental amendment to the bill and that the government were happy to accept that <e> <s> i know that restoration of opencast sites has not always been of the highest standard but there are a considerable number of places around the country where it has been carried out well and has rendered the areas much more enjoyable to those who live in them <e>", "<cs> my lords the attention shown to this debate and the number of speakers justify my colleagues and i in choosing this subject for our one and only debate this session <e> <s> i am grateful to all those who have taken part in it <e> <s> i did not derive much joy from the ministers reply although he covered the points very fully <e> <s> if the noble lord will not heed pleas from this side of the house i hope he will accept the concern of his own friends <e> <s> he said that the government will continue to look at the matter <e> <s> i hope that he will do that and that he will urge the secretary of state and his colleagues in the cabinet to reconsider before the whole way in which the poll tax is working <e> <s> the government should make the tax relate to ability to pay and above all get the ssas right to begin with <e> <s> these should be based on up-to-date population statistics and a realistic figure for inflation <e> <s> we might then not have quite the problems that we have had this time <e> <s> i hope too that the noble lord and his colleagues will think of the pensioners people on low fixed incomes one-parent families and those who were encouraged by the government to buy their own houses and who now in addition to high mortgage rates face even higher poll tax demands <e> <s> the government must remember that when they place duties on local authorities that have to be paid for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords we share the revulsion felt by the noble earl and all members of the house over what happened and the disgraceful scenes which we all witnessed on television <e> <s> many of us in this house do not approve of the community charge but we accept that it is now the law of the land and therefore we must abide by it <e> <s> but we also accept that we still have the right of peaceful demonstration and opposition as i hope we always shall <e> <s> it was quite obvious that a few hundred people decided on
