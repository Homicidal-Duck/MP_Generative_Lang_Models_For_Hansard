["<cs> my lords i ask for the forgiveness of the house for rising not having put my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> however not only do i want to endorse what the noble lord lord de clifford and the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood have said but i want to ask the noble earl to consider and give us an answer on one further point <e> <s> as your lordships know i am the chairman of the land settlement association <e> <s> our people of course operate a lot of glass <e> <s> they grow horticultural crops cucumbers lettuce tomatoes and that kind of thing <e> <s> they are absolutely dependent on the supply of oil in order to heat their glass <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble earl and to be able to say that in comparing our old deficiency payments scheme and the scheme operated in the common market i entirely agree with him <e> <s> unfortunately we went in too late to influence things very much in that direction and of course it is very difficult to overturn something which has now been operating for a number of years <e> <s> i understand that there is also a problem about costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am obliged to the noble lord lord spens for introducing this debate <e> <s> it is worthwhile pointing out that it is very precise in its wording <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad indeed that my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby has asked this question and with him i sincerely hope that the government will be able to give us some kind of answer <e> <s> like him too i should like the proposition which was initiated by the late prime minister to be the proposition which is accepted <e> <s> if this government have other <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard it as a privilege to follow my noble friend lord taylor of mansfield whose services to this house and to the coal industry are so well-known <e> <s> he has had so much practical experience and this afternoon we have listened to words of wisdom from him which we are all pleased to have had the opportunity of hearing <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord armstrong on his maiden speech <e> <s> i found it particularly interesting because he dealt with tourism and agriculture <e> <s> i see tourism as an aid to agriculture because it helps to bring income to farmers particularly small farmers in the tourist areas <e> <s> of course my interest in agriculture is well-known <e> <s> i was particularly interested in what he said about the northern harvest <e> <s> indeed i shall say very much the same when i deal with this question in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not intervened in the debate before <e> <s> i have listened carefully to everything that has been said and it would be quite dis- <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise because of my interest in the strutt report and of course i want to support the prayer moved by my noble friend lord melchett <e> <s> some of your lordships will remember that on st march last year i introduced a debate on the strutt report <e> <s> a large number of members of your lordships house spoke in that debate and with only minor exceptions the proposals made by the strutt committee were widely accepted and indeed welcomed <e> <s> i can only say in opening that i entirely agree with my noble friend lord melchett when he says that the proposals which are now being put to us by the government drive a coach and <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too congratulate the noble earl on his first appearance on the front bench opposite <e> <s> is he aware how well received the strutt report was <e> <s> it was recognised as being a very useful report by all sides of the industry and those interested in the industry <e> <s> does the noble earl understand the satisfaction which was expressed when the previous government accepted in principle the main recommendations of the strutt report <e> <s> is he aware however that there is now a certain amount of disappointment that a large number of the recommendations have not been taken up and that there is no indication that they will be taken up <e> <s> it is true is it not that the report affects not only agriculture the interests of which it protects but also the interests of amenity and conservation about which other noble lords have been so concerned <e> <s> is it possible for the minister to give an assurance that all the recommendations of the report apart from adas and i appreciate what was said about adas will be properly and fully considered with a view to their early implementation <e>", "<cs> may i say a brief word on this amendment <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend that i was called to the telephone as he was moving it <e> <s> as one who has been interested in industrial relations for many more years than i like to think about i have always had two strong convictions <e> <s> the first is that joint consultation is of vital importance and secondly that to enable workpeople to participate on the board of industries is going to make it possible for a greater understanding to take place between what have been called the two sides <e> <s> i hate this expression the two sides of industry and the misunderstandings which that creates <e> <s> i am convinced that misunderstandings suspicions and some-times even deeper feelings are generated because too often workpeople are not taken into account and not taken into the confidence of the employers and the boards that they do not act as a team but as people going their separate ways with separate interests when the basic interests are the same both for the particular firm and i hope for the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell us whether proper consultation took place before the decision to close these mills was taken <e> <s> were there consultations with the trade unions concerned in that aspect of british industry and were the trade unions in the home-grown timber trade properly consulted the trade unions representing the forestry workers that is the national union of agricultural and allied workers and the transport and general workers union <e> <s> and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords the strutt committee considered this problem of footpaths in relation to the running of bulls in fields and the diversion concept was mooted because it would be easier and better for a farmer to divert his footpath around a field or into another field at least temporarily in order to avoid the responsibility for any harm which might happen to a pedestrian or rambler who walked across the field <e> <s> in that sense there is an advantage to both sides and i am not arguing for one side or the other but simply pointing out that the strutt committee considered <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in a few brief words add my support to this amendment <e> <s> i am concerned with agriculture as your lordships know and fish farming is a new development in the industry <e> <s> i can well remember the first time that i went to india and i saw what was being done there by way of providing fish for human consumption and in this country too this developing industry could do so much more than it is doing <e> <s> it deserves support <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support all three amendments but i understand that one can speak to them all at the same time <e> <s> i was going to direct my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it also seems that nearly every time i get on my feet i drag in the strutt report <e> <s> i am doing so again because the strutt committee took a great deal of evidence both from individuals and organisations and the view was repeatedly expressed to us that not enough was done to safeguard the agricultural interest <e> <s> it was felt by many people that the urban interest was given priority in far too many cases <e>", "<cs> my lords may i offer my thanks to the noble lord lord bellwin for the time and trouble he has spent explaining all this <e> <s> however a number of things have been said which cause me unease <e> <s> in fact it has been said that all was well under the old regulations <e> <s> i can confirm that the strutt committee having taken evidence knew very well that all was not well <e> <s> now we have this new promise if i may call it that but already as my noble friend lord davies of leek said and as i said myself in my speech there has been an agricultural objection supported by the inquiry inspector which has been completely ignored <e> <s> so one can well understand that we still feel very uneasy about this <e> <s> i am not sure what the noble lord lord stanley of alderley will do but in order to make our view clear without any disrespect to the minister indeed reiterating as i will our thanks for what he has done i shall follow the noble lord into the lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly say a word about this amendment and express the hope that it will not be pressed by the noble lord lord digby and if it is pressed that we shall not support it <e> <s> i do this for a simple reason again an agricultural reason <e> <s> the land drainage act gives the authorities that can carry out land drainage works which include main river improvements flood alleviation and sea defence work <e> <s> we all know what happens when the floods occur <e> <s> we have seen it happening in the last few days and it happens more or less every year <e> <s> land is damaged sometimes permanently cattle are lost and i believe that it is important that enough money should be available to enable the necessary drainage work to be undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the tremendous struggle hill farmers are now having in order to keep their heads above water and to remain in operation <e> <s> other noble lords have already asked whether the noble earl recognises the importance of hill farming <e> <s> it is of course a most <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord and the right reverend prelate in thinking my noble friend lord ritchie-calder for introducing this short debate <e> <s> as we know it is concerned with britains role in the united nations and its specialised agencies <e> <s> i will devote the short time at my disposal to saying something about one of the agencies that is the international labour organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord will be aware that under the new supplementary benefits arrangements regulations are being formulated to avoid discrepancy in payments in other fields <e> <s> would not the noble lord think this would be equally advisable for local authorities and that clear directives after consultations with local authorities ought to be issued in order to clarify this point and to create uniformity one would hope on the basis of a zero payment <e>", "<cs> i have not spoken before in this debate as much as i should have wished <e> <s> i have stayed behind this evening briefly to give my support to this amendment moved by my noble friend lord melchett <e> <s> your lordships will be aware because i have spoken of it before that i was a member of the strutt committee <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that its report was well received by all sectors of the agricultural community and indeed by the amenity environmental and conservationist interests as well <e> <s> as my noble friend has mentioned one of its main recommendations was that adas officers should be used to advise farmers and landowners on conservation environmental and amenity matters <e> <s> the object was of course to try to achieve a fair balance between the needs of agriculture and the desirability ofconserving and treasuring our natural and wildlife resources <e>", "<cs> i want to say something in this debate <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall fall out with my friend the noble baroness opposite and the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> i am concerned about this matter on two fronts one as a member of the strutt committee not the town and country committee but a special committee which was set up to consider this problem of bulls and foot paths and secondly because of my association with agricultural workers through the national union of agricultural workers of which i used to be general secretary <e>", "<cs> my point is not that <e> <s> my point is that bulls are clearly dangerous <e>", "<cs> let me tell noble lords of a personal experience that i had when i worked on the land <e> <s> if the noble viscount wants to say something i will sit down <e>", "<cs> i repeat my point that bulls are in fact dangerous <e> <s> i have had personal experience of the danger involved <e> <s> when i worked on the land on the next farm i had a very good friend who was a cowman and who was working with bulls for beef production <e> <s> on the land of that farm they had a bull which was normally quite docile and no danger to anyone <e> <s> my friend was not feeding him or cleaning him out or doing anything of that kind <e> <s> he was walking across the field where the bull was when it suddenly turned vicious and attacked him <e> <s> this can happen <e> <s> i have seen this happen from time to time <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i make the point again that it is not only a question of people being charged and damaged by bulls when crossing land <e> <s> we had evidence to show that bulls alerted themselves when people were walking on paths and came towards them <e> <s> perhaps the people were too frightened and did not know much about bulls <e> <s> there was one case were a bull actually ran for a person <e> <s> he had to jump the stile and he damaged himself in so doing <e> <s> it is not only a question of people being hurt or injured by a bull <e> <s> it is also a question of the fear that the bull inspires in townsmen in particular and sometimes in mothers with their children <e> <s> there is a real fear which we on the strutt committee were told about and which we accepted as good evidence and as a good reason for banning bulls on footpaths <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen what can happen when dogs are let loose in a field <e> <s> they can do enormous damage <e> <s> i have seen sheep and lambs killed by dogs <e> <s> i know too of the damage caused when lambing is on and when the sheep are chased by dogs <e> <s> one cannot always be sure how dogs will behave <e> <s> i have a vivid recollection when i was a boy of taking for a country walk a collie a breed often used as a sheep dog which was bred in town <e> <s> the dog went berserk when he saw a field full of sheep <e> <s> he went mad and chased them around <e> <s> we tried all ways to train him <e> <s> i am afraid that we used the strap on him to make him realise that he ought not to do it but we never succeeded <e> <s> we were never able to take that dog for a walk and let him loose in a field <e> <s> it is a painful thing to the owner but i think that the restrictions which the owner is called upon to place on a <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather difficult to put what i wish to say in the form of a question to the minister <e> <s> however he will i am quite sure be aware that while we all thank him for his statement we all regret that it had to be made <e> <s> we all agree with every word that has been said about the damage that it will cause to the industry the distress that it will bring and the cost that will be incurred by the farmers involved <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> your lordships would expect me to do so <e> <s> i know that this is scotland and not england and that there are <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble baroness lady phillips has said <e> <s> obviously any number of people must work on sundays to provide electricity gas and water and all the other things which go to make up a decent civilised life <e> <s> i do not want to get into theology but i cannot see that people who are prepared to do those jobs on sundays are acting wrongly in terms of the christian faith or any other faith <e> <s> i intervene because i think that what has been said so far applies to farming where we have a responsibility for animals which have to be fed milked and looked after <e> <s> one should think very carefully i believe before agreeing to something of this kind which other people would claim should be extended to their operations <e>", "<cs> i think i am in order in speaking now i had been hoping to rise before my noble friend on the front bench got to her feet <e> <s> i would like just to comment that when the noble earl lord listowel mentioned that this matter had been discussed a number of times before in this chamber i well remembered speaking myself on this subject several years ago <e> <s> i spoke on it because although i know the figures that have been given to us by the national farmers union i have also experienced the effects of sheep worrying myself on farms where i have worked <e> <s> of course it is not a pleasant thing to observe or try to deal with when you see a dog with a sheep to get him off takes some doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that this debate was going to take place very much later <e> <s> i am glad that arrangements have been made to bring it on earlier but because of that anticipation i went upstairs and the writing room is littered with paper which i have thrown away <e> <s> therefore my speech may appear to be a bit staccato and i hope <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on this amendment because of my interest in agriculture <e> <s> it is the fact that at harvest time there are large numbers i cannot give the figures without reference elsewhere of people who work for just a few weeks or perhaps only a few days <e> <s> they are very often the wives of farm workers who turn out to help their husbands employers at this time <e> <s> this amendment would particularly refer to them and it is a matter of interest to me <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there has been concern in some places with regard to the safety factor <e> <s> is he aware also that when sub-committee b dealt with this matter a copy of the proposals was sent to the national union of agricultural workers now a section of the transport and general workers union and that they raised no objections to it and that from the workers point of view they seem to be quite happy and accept this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the explanations which have been given <e> <s> however before this decision was taken had the government consulted the tuc who obviously have a great interest in this particular convention and also of course the ilo with which i was connected for many many years <e> <s> if the government did not consult the tuc can the minister tell me why they did not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl and minister will understand that we are all pleased to learn that the safeguards against importation of foot and mouth disease are going to be extended in this country for a further year <e> <s> i am concerned with the long-term future <e> <s> what are the prospects of the other countries of the common market accepting similar restrictions on the importation of cattle as we are now enabled to do under our special arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister mentioned the code of practice issued by the nfu may i ask him to say how successful the department believes the code has been in preventing not only this nuisance but other dangers which can emanate from straw burning <e> <s> all the industry is anxious that the code should be supported but we are not clear how successful the government feel or for that matter how successful the nfu feel the code has been <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord ask the people doing the survey to take into account the possible danger involved when a person is wearing a seat belt and there is a collision not head-on but when the car is struck amidships and the belt prevents the person from being able to swing free <e> <s> whiplash can cause accidents and indeed i know of a death from that cause <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will appreciate that i am not against the use of seat belts in fact i voted for them <e> <s> but i think a statistic of that kind showing how many accidents involve these side-on collisions would be useful and informative <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to congratulate the noble lord lord northbourne on his maiden speech <e> <s> i enjoyed it very much and quite obviously he is going to prove a very great asset in this house like others i hope we shall hear him often <e> <s> i would also if i may apologise to the noble earl lord ferrers because i was a few minutes late in taking my seat when he opened the debate i am awfully sorry <e> <s> the amendments on the previous bill went through much more quickly than i expected <e> <s> i am sorry to have done that with the great regard and respect i have for the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords in all my time with the lsa i never gained the impression that the tenants thought that they were being dictated to by government <e> <s> they saw the land settlement association which was of course the governments agent as an entity in its own right and therefore they did not say that the government were interfering though sometimes they criticised the lsa for doing certain things or for requiring certain things that they did not like <e>", "<cs> before anyone else speaks may i just endorse what my noble friend has said about the lsa <e> <s> i know that a number of settlements are busily creating their own co-operatives and there are quite a number of them already on the stocks as it were <e> <s> they are going to need some assistance with regard to packing sheds and maybe machinery and the leasing arrangement which has been mentioned would help them <e> <s> so perhaps the government can give some assurance or assistance on the leasing-out side <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord davies of leek is unwell i am sorry to say <e> <s> in his absence and with his permission i beg leave to ask the first question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> i should like to ask one or two supplementary questions <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl would agree that there are too many accidents in agriculture and that some of the machinery used is not used properly and ought not to be used at all and therefore demands constant inspection <e> <s> while i am grateful to the noble minister for what he has said can he explain to me why the number of safety inspectors has decreased from in to in which is a reduction of approximately per cent <e> <s> i have consulted the union about the situation and they are very disturbed and they have asked me to ask these questions <e> <s> i am told by the union <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the union has ascertained that there are only inspectors in the field which means that the number of visits has about halved <e> <s> in view of the seriousness of the situation and the harm caused to people and the distress caused to their families can the minister give us some assurance that the number of inspectors will <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that slightly encouraging statement can he give us the target figures for the inspectorate which the government have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware as i am sure he is that the co-operatives are still being set up or tenants on some of the holdings are still seeking to set them up <e> <s> the problem that they are encountering is that they cannot find money to take over the packing sheds and the propagation departments and they are suggesting and i have letters to this effect that the prices are much too high <e> <s> in one case there is a figure of for a packing shed and for the propagation facilities <e> <s> that is too big a sum for the tenants to find and i wonder whether in addition to what he has already said the minister will check back to make sure that the facilities are being offered at a proper price and to see whether the aspect of depreciation on the buildings is also taken into account in fixing the price <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to ask another question in order to avoid my getting up again <e> <s> i too have been informed that the prices being charged for the holdings are in excess of the real value and are in excess of the prices at which they would be sold on a tenanted valuation <e> <s> should not the members of the staff be offered the opportunity to buy their homes on the same sort of terms as are offered to certain local authorities which are at considerably reduced rates <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> i entirely agree with what my noble friends have already said <e> <s> of course i too have an interest in the existence of smallholdings to which people can go after they have worked in agriculture maybe for years <e> <s> i am speaking in terms of agricultural workers <e> <s> they want to find smallholdings and we want them to be there for them <e> <s> in fact the stock is not very large although as we have heard per cent <e> <s> of the people who go into agriculture go into these smallholdings <e> <s> it is important that we make sure that they continue to exist <e> <s> everything else that could have been said has already been said so i shall merely say that i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must say at least a few words about this amendment <e> <s> as your lordships know i come from an agricultural background and for most of my life i have represented the interests of agricultural workers and indeed others in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble earl mentioned solar energy <e> <s> is he aware that a great number of householders have now installed solar panels to supplement their other heating for domestic purposes and that these have proved quite successful <e> <s> the noble earl may be aware that i have spoken on this subject previously <e> <s> is he aware that i have installed a solar panel in my own house and it is showing me some considerable savings in terms of energy consumed in heating water <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for what he has already said and have listened to his replies particularly about the agricultural workers wages <e> <s> but would he not agree that this is a great success story in agriculture which could well set an example to the other industries <e> <s> would he not agree that the agricultural workers together with the farmers have played a magnificent part in achieving such a good record <e>", "<cs> i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> i want to support the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord dean of beswick <e> <s> i do this because as i think your lordships know i have been a life-long trade unionist and a past member of the general council of the tuc and its chairman too long ago now in <e> <s> it is essential that we should have trade union representation on these panels <e> <s> i know that the tuc feel this to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a very simple but important question <e> <s> if the agriculture wages board is to be considered for abolition or otherwise and if it is to be looked at in any depth will the minister give me the assurance that the agricultural section of the transport and general workers union will be taken fully into consultation <e> <s> the agricultural wages board is of some considerable importance and concern to that union <e>", "<cs> may i make one comment <e> <s> it is a long time since i was chairman of the agriculture apprenticeship council and a long time since i had any close relationship with the agricultural training board but is this not the situation if the agricultural training board takes this as one of the items of training given to its candidates they would receive a certificate at the end of the training indicating that they had been trained in this direction would they not <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain your lordships very long at this late hour but i want to say a word about this amendment which i strongly support <e> <s> perhaps i am the only one in your lordships house who has worked as an agricultural worker but it is certainly true that for many years i was general secretary of the national union of agricultural workers which is now the agricultural and allied workers national trade group of the transport and general workers union <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord the minister aware that his reply will give cause for concern to many people not only those in research <e> <s> this is because the work of the survey team is of such importance in classifying the soil <e> <s> surely it helps in agriculture to ensure that the right crop goes into the right kind of soil <e> <s> it also helps the environmentalists and those who are concerned with planning including the local authorities <e> <s> would he not agree that it would be disappointing to learn that this help is not going to continue in the longer term <e> <s> would he not agree that in view of the importance of the work which is being done by the survey team it should be allowed to continue with help into the more distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us whether the transport and general workers union agricultural section have sent in a reply and if so can he tell us what is their attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness mentioned the long waiting list for the hip operation which gives great relief to people who suffer i know this because my next door neighbour suffered for years <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell us on average how long people have to wait for this service at guys <e>"]
