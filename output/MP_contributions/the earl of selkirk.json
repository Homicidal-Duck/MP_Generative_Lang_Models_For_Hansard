we all recognise the tremendous amount of trouble that the noble baroness has taken and this has been a considerable strain to her <e> <s> nevertheless i think we should remember the stage we have reached and how we have reached it in this bill <e> <s> at the report stage the noble baroness brought amendments which virtually constituted a completely new bill <e> <s> i agree that half of it was largely redrafted but an entirely new area was brought in affecting scotland <e> <s> i invited the noble baroness to re-commit the bill and she declined to do so <e> <s> i invited her to omit the scottish clauses and she declined to do so <e> <s> so the noble baroness accepts full responsibility for what the bill stands for <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think the position is as

very much <e> <s> one really is subjective and the other is objective <e> <s> the purpose here and i understand this is true of the act as of this act is that it is intended that agreements about access should be voluntary on both sides and there should be the use of compulsory powers only when it is not practical to make voluntary agreements <e> <s> there are certain things where it is not practical <e> <s> there is the question of where the landlord is obstinate and refuses to take part <e> <s> that would be suitable for what the noble lord said <e> <s> but there are other things <e>

because it is not really necessary for them to do so <e> <s> they will be managed by the regions that is the purpose of the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord really has an ulterior motive to change the management of the parks then he is dealing with quite a different subject one which we have already discussed at considerable length and at that time the noble lord did want to change it <e> <s> if he

grateful to my noble friend because i suspect that behind the scenes there has been a battle royal of a major character <e> <s> i do not know who the belligerents were whether they were those higher in the pecking order or perhaps the draftsmen <e> <s> what i do know is that it aroused the utmost fury in the scottish law commission who burst into print on the subject <e> <s> i wrote an admirable reply but for some reason the editors of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for this amendment <e> <s> there is a great deal of work which has to be done certainly by building

should like very much to thank my noble friend for this clause <e> <s> it is a very important clause indeed <e> <s> i am afraid the truth is that when this bill was first introduced the position of third parties was completely omitted <e> <s> if noble lords care to look at the explanatory clauses in the bill as it was originally presented to the house they will see that there was no mention whatever of the position of third parties <e> <s> that is of the utmost importance <e> <s> anyone buying a house must be sure of getting a clear title <e> <s> as the bill stood originally that was not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock is perfectly correct <e> <s> when you buy a house today you must have one of two things either a renunciation from the wife as well as from the husband otherwise you cannot sell the house alternatively you must have an affidavit saying that when the security was made there was no spouse at all <e> <s> this must become an absolutely routine matter in conveyancing everywhere <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i cannot go into all the conceivable details <e> <s> his intention is perfectly clear and his recognition that what is required is essential for the wellbeing of the householder <e> <s> he said that and i am extremely grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am relieved that my noble friend is taking this clause out <e> <s> it would be putting cohabiting couples in very nearly the same position as married couples <e> <s> i believe we still have a certain respect for the institution of marriage and in my view this would be going too far <e> <s> i also believe it would enormously complicate the whole conveyancing of properties <e> <s> we were talking about building societies but of course this applies to banks insurance companies and every individual <e> <s> when one buys a house one is well advised always to get either an affidavit under the new clause a or alternatively a renunciation from the wife if one does not get that one could be in trouble <e> <s> that is a further complication and therefore on pure grounds of conveyancing and simplicity and certainly of ownership it is desirable that the provision should be removed and i am therefore grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not expect me to follow him in the interesting remarks that he made though i viewed with great sympathy what he said about window cleaners <e> <s> i am very glad that both the noble lord lord campbell of croy and indeed the noble lord lord stodart have said that we should look at all licences with care and see whether they really perform a function and are necessary <e> <s> i think it is a price we probably have to pay

replies <e> <s> i should like to support lord monsons bill for this reason <e> <s> i think that this subsection as it stands is a reflection on this house <e> <s> that we as an amending chamber should

prided ourselves on being the mother of parliaments and on having had a form of parliamentary government for years <e> <s> we have tried to copy that form of constitution and send it to or countries all over the world <e> <s> they have adapted it in many ways and on the whole they have wanted to copy the way in which we conduct our affairs <e> <s> indeed i would say that we are still regarded with envy <e> <s> yet here we are worrying about how we should govern ourselves <e> <s> it might therefore be worth casting our minds back rather further than even the government of lord attlee when

original holder <e> <s> if consent is given and if consent is required presumably that provides some advantage and if there is an advantage then it is probable that somebody will pay for it <e> <s> i did not know that these licences were intended to be on the market <e> <s> perhaps they are <e> <s> i would be obliged if the minister would tell me <e>", "<cs> my inclination is to support my noble friend in i think the very sympathetic approach which he made to what is undoubtedly a problem because this is an integral service in a modern city today <e> <s> the noble lord has just given an example of where it might well fall down <e> <s> i also know that the taxi drivers work very hard at least many of them do and they certainly deserve to get a full and reasonable living for so doing

part-time taxi drivers <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord suggesting that the transfer would be for money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> first how do you pay for a gallon of petrol which costs p <e> <s> if it cannot be met by a coinage is it improper to advertise it as such or is it even illegal <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble lord whether he is now envisaging a coin <e> <s> have we reached that stage and is this in the governments mind <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i was going to make one or two remarks of a similar character concerning metal dealers whose situation is very complex <e> <s> but could not some of these provisions be made in subordinate legislation <e> <s> the trouble with a bill is that it will not be amended for many years but sub-ordinate legislation can be changed and more easily adapted when certain items prove difficult to handle <e> <s> i do not know whether it is necessary to go into all these details but surely it would be better to have a procedure that could be more readily adapted when some of these items become too onerous <e>", "<cs> i have great difficulty in seeing how flexibility can be worked into this <e> <s> the words of the statute are concrete <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i expected that answer and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i let the noble earl know that i should like to say a word or two about clauses to which deal with metal dealers and which as the noble earl said are not optional but compulsory <e> <s> i know nothing about this industry whatsoever but i find it difficult to understand the effect of this clause and what it is trying to achieve <e> <s> the noble earl has quite rightly said that it is a mixture of crime prevention and individual freedom but it is also of some substantial importance to the steel industry <e> <s> i do not know how far what one might call major dealers are included here that is far from clear <e> <s> but i want to make two points <e> <s> one is that there is an enormous amount o detail and i would like to draw attention to some of the quite remarkable pieces of detail which exist in the bill <e> <s> first of all one has to keep a record and that record has to be serially numbered <e> <s> it has got to be kept in one book and if it is not one may be fined <e> <s> i would have thought it quite possible that metal dealers would want to keep separate books for ferrous metals non-ferrous metals and for what they call sintered metallic carbides <e> <s> i do not know but it may be that dealers may want to do that <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one question <e> <s> is it an obligation on behalf of the farmer if i may use the expression to give a receipt <e> <s> is he liable for a punishment of if he refuses to give a receipt <e> <s> i think that we should be clear on that and i do not think that it is quite clear from the bill at present <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> i must say that i thought that all scrap was in fact used <e>", "<cs> what is a pool room <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if my amendment does not meet the purpose which i intended though i think that a narrow interpretation of it would give it that meaning

cleaning those windows by a policeman he might be fined <e> <s> i say that this is unnecessary <e> <s> it should be perfectly possible to give a man a small tip and say clean my windows <e> <s> that

would make that employment <e> <s> i am not going to carry the argument any further <e> <s> if the noble earl and the committee do not like it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand the point that my noble friend is making <e> <s> i want to put it the other way <e> <s> supposing somebody is in your property whom you do not want there and is drunk and incapable <e> <s> can you apprehend him as is stated under clause and hand him over <e> <s> this is the point that i have in mind <e> <s> if someone is in your property however he got there and makes himself drunk and incapable what do you do with him <e> <s> the remedy provided under clause is a perfectly satisfactory remedy which one can deal with otherwise one can hand him over to the police and get rid of him out of the house <e> <s> that seems a rational step to be able to take <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely happy with what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i hope that he has taken the point and i hope that he will consider it further <e> <s> if someone forces his way into your house that is private property and is drunk and incapable what do you do <e> <s> i am not wholly satisfied that the noble earl has answered that <e> <s> perhaps he will think about it <e> <s> this is an offence <e> <s> in a sense for a non-invited guest a private house is a public place <e> <s> he has wandered in and should be dealt with as if he had been outside the house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i just make one point <e> <s> supposing a man is drunk and he is with a girl of i should think it is very improper to go around with a girl of that age but i think that a girl of with a drunken father if that is the case is improper and should be curtailed <e> <s> i should have said that was certainly not too high <e>", "<cs> i should like to underline a point that has been made by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and by the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> supposing someone wants to hold a procession in the lothians <e> <s> one would not hold it in dunbar or north berwick or bathgate one would want to hold it in edinburgh because that is the place if one wants to make a noise <e> <s> the same would be true of dundee if i may say so or elsewhere <e> <s> it does seem to me that the local district are the people who would be much more immediately involved and concerned at what could or could not happen in their immediate area <e> <s> i am not all that familiar with the workings of the new arrangements in scottish local government but it does seem to me that the local people particularly in edinburgh glasgow inverness or elsewhere should be personally concerned at the way in which processions are conducted <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am not satisfied with that answer <e> <s> the noble earl speaks of having reasonable cause to infer and he says that that is proof beyond reasonable doubt <e> <s> i do not accept that <e> <s> i think that the burden of proof for this is very much lighter than is normally shown in a criminal case <e> <s> i would readily accept that my amendment may not be correct it practically never is so i am not in the least bit surprised about that but i think that the noble earl should undertake to look at this matter more closely <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i raised this matter on second reading and i had great hopes that my noble friend <e>", "<cs> since the noble earl has brought in the renton report to leave no doubt about what the noble lord lord renton recommended the words of that report in paragraph were <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> can we be told whether street lighting is a district or a regional

were done <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> there should be an improvement in the naming and actual inscribing of street names in certain places <e> <s> the situation varies greatly from place to place and the amendment would do no more than offer a slight encouragement to local authorities to do their job slightly better <e> <s> as drafted the bill simply refers to name and i quite agree that the name has to be selected by the council itself <e> <s> but i think that the council should be under some obligation to see that the public are properly served in regard to street names <e> <s> there are places that are very often not easy to find <e> <s> i shall not say that this is a generality probably they are less important places <e> <s> but i think that the amendment would give councils an encouragement to see that the public interest is better served <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the words political parties are not a trifle too wide <e> <s> there is no definition of a political party <e> <s> two people can set themselves up as a political party and can go straight through clause as they like <e> <s> when one considers the ordinary political parties who are acting in a normal way that is straightforward <e> <s> but as the amendment stands is it not a little wide <e>", "<cs> may i express the hope that my noble friend will find ways and means of putting near to each other this clause and clause and giving further consideration to placing both of them in a textual form which a normal individual can understand <e>", "<cs> i asked my noble friend what this bill is likely to cost <e> <s> he said that the cost will not be borne by the treasury <e> <s> i think he went a trifle far by saying that <e> <s> i understand from the explanatory memorandum that there is sufficient loose cash in the scottish office to pay for any small matters which may arise from time to time <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could give us some idea of whether or not this is a totally insignificant sum <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble earl for what he has said <e>", "<cs> i think the noble earl has missed one very important point <e> <s> what is civic government <e> <s> it is local government <e> <s> are we some other body called the civic government as opposed to the local government <e> <s> we are using a word which is totally inaccurate <e> <s> is there such a thing

leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand that taxi cabs are approved in every detail by the home office <e> <s> if so and bearing in mind that back pains which make them incapable of driving from time to time are virtually an occupational hazard for taxi drivers may i ask my noble friend to agree that it is the duty of the home office to see that they are able to drive their taxis for maybe hours a day without suffering that hazard <e> <s> would he further agree that we in this city have probably the finest taxi service compared with any other city in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that more comfortable seats can be purchased by the taxi drivers but will a comfortable and suitable seat be available in the new cr in the future as a standard fitting for all taxis <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say who really is in command in ethiopia <e> <s> is it the cubans the russians or the ethiopians <e>",

community <e> <s> these arguments about the police and the post office having immunity are different because that would be immunity against the public so this is quite different <e> <s> i feel we are greatly indebted to the noble lord lord hacking for his extremely able exposition of the very real problem <e> <s> it is a question of decision <e> <s> i think that every one of the syndicates in lloyds is subordinate to the quality and image of lloyds itself <e> <s> that is the approach we have to make because after all the syndicates themselves benefit by the high integrity of lloyds as it stands <e> <s> therefore you have to have pretty powerful discipline <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very real privilege to follow the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> the robust directness with which he addresses himself to the subject is refreshing <e> <s> let us not forget that there are men today who will be suffering hardship danger and discomfort and doing so at the orders <e>", "<cs> my lords

commander in carrying out an extremely difficult campaign as well as of our profound assurance that they will be supplied with all they require in order to bring the campaign to a successful conclusion <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could thank the noble earl for this clause which i think is very valuable <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly withdraw this amendment but may i say that amendment no <e> <s>

to do without doing that <e> <s> i am asking the government whether they will have university degrees <e> <s> if they will not what certificate will they get <e> <s> the word competence means nothing or everything <e> <s> will they have something to say what their standing is <e> <s> will that be the case and if so why not put it in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> what he has said in fact is that they have studied at a university but they do not have a degree <e>", "<cs> but there will be something or other which will be produced <e> <s> i do not attach importance to these pieces of paper but they help <e> <s> the bill as written gives us no clear assurance on the matter <e> <s> however i shall not press this amendment and i am grateful to my noble friend for meeting me as far as he has <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for coming as far as he has <e> <s> we have got a lot more out of my noble friend tonight than we did before <e> <s> we have some idea of what is intended <e> <s> as originally drafted the bill was entirely vague on this subject but we now have a clearer picture <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for being willing to insert this provision <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the noble earls bill not mine <e> <s> i believe my words are more revealing and more relevant and that they tell what the story is <e> <s> but if the noble earl does not want my words i shall not press him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> there is a difficulty here <e> <s> it arises from section of the principal act <e> <s> if a person has not seen the patient within the -day period he can hardly be described as the nearest relative <e> <s> then one goes to section for a priority order <e> <s> if one has a priority order i believe that one may be able to take any of those relatives <e> <s> i see no particular reason why we should put the emphasis on the nearest relative if it is convenient for the other relatives to do it <e> <s> in that section they are all close relatives and to be quite frank i should have thought that in those circumstances the word nearest was redundant <e> <s> i will not press this point but i bring it to the attention of my noble friend and am quite happy to leave it in his hands <e> <s> i personally believe that this could be done by a relative and left at that but i will not press this matter tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend but i did not go into the other points in detail <e> <s> it makes it quite clear that the relative is free to do it if he will <e> <s> if the noble lord says that the nearest relative must do it then it is not so very different from saying that a relative must do it <e> <s> i am not asking for the relative to be compelled to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for accepting in principle that what is in this bill is wrong that is what he said that the compulsion of a mental health officer to make an application in which he does not believe is wrong <e> <s> i have made my suggestion and my noble friend does not like it but i cannot help that <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock will make his suggestion but i doubt if it will get any better reception <e> <s> nevertheless i wish the noble lord every bit of luck in what he does <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend <e> <s> that is exactly what i wanted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may explain this was part of my earlier amendment to make quite clear what i had in mind that is to say that either the mental health officer or a relative could make this recommendation as the bill stands <e> <s> however i shall not move the amendment as we have had this discussion <e>", "<cs> not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask which one <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps foolishly i spoke to this amendment when i spoke generally on the first amendment <e> <s> i had assumed that my noble friend had turned them all down but that was due to my lack of clarity of expression for which i deeply apologise to the house <e> <s> i am delighted to hear what my noble friend says <e> <s> what i suggested in my first amendment was that if the mental health officer did not want to do it then a relative could do it and that seemed to me to be quite sensible <e> <s> if no relative wanted to do it and there are quite a number mentioned in the clause and the mental health officer did not want to do it then i must confess that the situation is rather questionable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble earl has undertaken to have a look at it <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to press the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to say that the duty of the staff is to look after patients and that the sole reason why i have moved the amendment is because i believe this to be in the interests of patients <e> <s> i do not care a tinkers hoot about the recipients of these letters <e> <s> if they do not like it they can lump it <e> <s> i concede that patients may write letters saying they are distressed but the staff can perfectly well decide whether it is in the interests of patients to let them go on writing or whether they should warn them by saying steady up or this is just a bit of a row which is going on <e> <s> try to modify your letters <e> <s> this is a judgment which is well within the capacity of most competent staff <e> <s> i shall leave it at that <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will make a wise decision <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great honour to come after the noble lord lord bancroft who speaks with unique authority of a department which quite clearly he knows upside down <e> <s> there is no speaker in this house who is regarded as having greater authority and who is a greater pleasure to listen to on the many subjects upon which he speaks with wide wisdom than the noble lord lord bellwin but today he was not quite up to the form which we have long expected of him <e> <s> he said that he had cleared up the situation but i have to admit that i did not learn one thing about why the government want to do this <e> <s> there was no answer to the question why muck it about <e> <s> all we got were promises <e> <s> governments are very honourable and never break their promises but what is needed here is something a little more concrete <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene may i say that it comes directly from the statement made by the secretary of state for the environment in july <e> <s> if you turn the percentage given into money that is what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the director general will go to the pac <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank my noble friend for this amendment because it represents an enormous improvement on what went before <e> <s> we are at a difficult point of a very difficult legislative decision <e> <s> the problem of mental health rests on the question of compulsory detention <e> <s> that is the big problem and it is quite different from physical health <e> <s> it is the element of compulsory detention about which we are all a little nervous the big question being how it can be done fairly without the possibility of abuse <e> <s> it is very difficult to get that right but i think the amendment goes a long way to making it right <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says that the mental welfare officer would be heard by the sheriff <e> <s> is that not already quite clear in the principal act <e> <s> i think it is clause but i cannot quite remember <e> <s> the sheriff certainly has the right to ask for evidence <e> <s> i doubt whether any sheriff would refuse to hear a mental welfare officer if he asked to be heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am distressed to hear that lord winstanleys intervention in a scottish bill is objected to in the liberal party <e> <s> i think that i can assure him that the rest of the house are always delighted when he contributes at any time on scottish bills <e> <s> heaven knows <e> <s> scotsmen take enough part in english bills <e> <s> so we have no possible grounds for complaint <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that an increasing number of craftsmen working on their own account do not today appear to take on apprentices <e> <s> is the government assistance extended to men working on their own account who find it unprofitable or at least not worth while to take on apprentices <e>", "<cs> my lords when we were taking the divorce bill through this house in a certain amount of pressure was then exercised to extend the jurisdiction of the sheriff courts to include divorce <e> <s> i resisted that and it was resisted very diliberately because the breakdown of marriage was an entirely new basis and it seemed to me that it was a matter which frankly needed to be decided in the first place at all events at the highest level <e> <s> i felt that if it were put in the sheriff court and i have no criticism of it it would be wrong for it to go there for the initial period <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i ask him this <e> <s> i mentioned the subject of records <e> <s> i wonder whether he can give me any information on that <e>", "<cs> one has the general impression from this part of the bill that the object is to save government money <e> <s> is that really the object or is it to obtain justice as the parties want <e> <s> bearing that in mind the question is whether the legal aid system will be so adjusted that it will be impossible to employ counsel either in the sheriff court or if permission is given in the court of session <e> <s> i have an amendment down on that very point <e> <s> is that the way it will be organised <e> <s> very substantial economic problems arise from the situation and they affect what i believe we all want to see namely a strong court of session supported by a strong bar <e> <s> if that is not the case it will cut fairly deeply into part of the whole system of justice in scotland <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord can say whether legal aid is to be so framed that counsel cannot be engaged <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble and learned friend for the very forthright statement that he has made which covers the major issue i had in mind <e> <s> this is the sort of matter that is of a somewhat fundamental character and in the remote almost inconceivable situation in which the noble lord lord hughes is concerned with a criminal court it is possible that he will be grateful to me for drawing attention to this <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i could ask the noble and learned lord a question <e> <s> this amendment raises the question of informing the other party in regard to the affidavit <e> <s> are there any rules about the time period within which that affidavit should be made available to the other party <e> <s> it does seem to me important because a witness you can cross-examine but an affidavit you cannot <e> <s> there may be rules on it <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend could tell us <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for what he said and i think he has brought out what i hoped might be the case that the secretary of state will make such provision as seems to him appropriate in respect of fees <e> <s> therefore if the fees are not paid properly it is because the secretary of state has not thought it appropriate <e> <s> in other words he carries a clear responsibility to see that the fees are paid appropriately and that is exactly what i thought might be the case but i proposed the words in my amendment to make sure <e> <s> my noble and learned friend took up the point that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway made about part payment <e> <s> he mentioned criminal cases he did not mention civil cases <e> <s> that is the point which is really worrying at the present time <e> <s> i only hope that he will be able to include that when the arrangements are made <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a somewhat simpler amendment amendment no <e> <s> but perhaps it would be convenient if i were to make my observations at this time <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has really raised a fundamental point in this issue <e> <s> it has long been the practice as has indeed already been said that litigant pursuers can select the court to which they want to go <e> <s> i think this is extremely important <e> <s> if someone loses an action and says oh if only i had brought it in another court i might have won he may be quite wrong but the importance is that he should be reasonably satisfied that he has made the selection and that he has lost or whatever the case may be <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i think it is important that whoever is the pursuer should be perfectly free to choose the court for good or bad which he thinks can resolve the problem he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for emphasising the importance to industry that a step of this character could have <e> <s> does he understand that unless the government take some steps progress in this field will be very slow <e> <s> can he at least give a full assurance that bank accounts are private between the depositor and the bank and cannot be seen by spouses whether male or female <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to copy the noble lord lord orr-ewing and congratulate the noble lord lord harris of high cross for drawing attention to this subject which after all has hung fire since the karmel report some years ago <e> <s> clearly successive governments have hesitated about dealing with this subject <e> <s> it is a complete anachronism and it is almost entirely obsolete <e> <s> indeed it might almost be said to be spent in many respects <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many speakers and i will try to be as brief as i can <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord bellwin on his st bill <e> <s> he has earned the respect of this house for the knowledge of a variety of subjects which he can with such great ability command <e> <s> however i notice in the financial memorandum that there will be increased staff at the department of the environment <e> <s> inevitably that follows every bill we pass <e> <s> somebody has to administer the bill and i doubt whether the department really know how many more men or women they will have to employ <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that clause be omitted from the bill <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that clause be omitted <e> <s> i think it is fairly widely known that lord boyd of merton was extremely anxious to speak on this clause <e> <s> his very sudden death has robbed us of his long wisdom and experience in high office both at home and abroad <e> <s> i can only express my most profound sympathy with lady boyd <e>", "<cs> i beg your pardon yes <e> <s> i do not want to carry this much further but i want to ask do we want to see a case where there is no option between owner-occupation or a council house <e> <s> if you think that this is wise for this country and that we shall benefit by it then i ask you to vote against the motion which i have moved <e> <s> if you think it is a very dangerous situation both for the social and for the economic evolution of this country then i ask you to vote with me against the clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank noble lords who have supported the amendment which we have put down <e> <s> i should like to say only two things to my noble friend <e> <s> i dare say that much of his speech was <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord most warmly for making that statement this early on <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house is grateful to him for doing so <e> <s> i know that there were some genuine and sincere differences of opinion on this <e> <s> i should like to express the hope that whatever the future may be the decision of this house will be shown to be wise and that it will be a success <e> <s> i am confident that the government will do their utmost to see that it is a success <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words before the noble lord replies <e> <s> there is a slight danger here of making the relations between landlord and tenant worse than they are at present <e> <s> this is a delicate matter which the noble baroness lady birk explained to us just now <e> <s> we want to watch that aspect <e> <s> the words in the bill are rather too wide <e> <s> let us face it if a tenant repairs his house and it does not fall within the amount allocated by the local authority what would happen is that the rents would have to go up and the local authority would be perfectly justified in putting up the rents of all the houses in order to meet the requirements of some of the secure tenants <e>", "<cs> is the minister taking the proposals by the nhbc as standard insurance proposals that is that they will normally be for a period of or years <e> <s> i mentioned the continuance of premiums but surely in the nhbc scheme there is only a single premium <e> <s> so there is no question so far as i know of the premiums being continued over the years <e> <s> roughly speaking is this going to be the standard which will operate for all authorised inspectors <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord will carry matters further <e> <s> this is one of the most important developments in the bill <e> <s> we are possibly in two minds about how it will work out <e> <s> the noble lord says that the great professional bodies will carry out this task <e> <s> it is a long drawn-out course <e> <s> the secretary of state appoints a body the body appoints an inspector and the inspector can delegate the work to someone else <e>", "<cs> may i push my noble friend a little further <e> <s> like myself he is very anxious that everybody should operate to the highest professional standard and i hope that they will do so <e> <s> but one must conceive a situation where that is no longer so <e> <s> there is no provision here for getting rid of somebody <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for not withdrawing this question because i believe that there is here something which needs clarification <e> <s> in scotland it is felt that whatever happened did not happen in scotland and so far as i know that is perfectly true <e> <s> i am very glad that my noble friend lord cockfield is answering the question because i am quite certain that he will make the position quite clear <e> <s> i am told that a review not an inquest is taking place on what is going on <e> <s> in scotland we have had two reviews in the last few years <e> <s> one review was carried out in by the department of trade and industry and commission services <e> <s> in there was another review by staff inspectors for the department of industry and trade commission services of the establishment management services manpower division <e> <s> both of the reviews were carried out at the request of the scottish association itself <e> <s> we wonder whether another inspection is necessary at this time or whether the matter refers only to england <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether there is an overall commander and if so what nationality he is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> i agreed with the noble baroness lady birk and i very greatly suspect that the government draftsman would not find the terms of this bill wholly congenial <e> <s> but there is a really major principle involved in it and i should like to speak to that for one moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness realises quite well that poverty is a separate question from housing and should be dealt with by social legislation <e> <s> if you told ici to operate a social policy rather than a profit policy they would go bankrupt in no time <e> <s> the housing market should be able to work on its own and where there is hardship and severity that should be dealt with as a social problem <e> <s> that is the point i am making and it is quite wrong to upset the whole market by turning it into a form of social subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for the clarity and the brevity with which he introduced a very long bill <e> <s> it was quite impossible to go into all the details but he emphasised those of great importance <e> <s> it is of course correct procedure to amend a bill first and if necessary to consolidate it afterwards because consolidation gives extremely little liberty to change matters and i am certain that that is right <e> <s> i am not quite certain that the word codify is correct <e> <s> i believe that it is a question of amendment and re-enacting and i do not know whether any of the clauses stand exactly as they did before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is correct

us when the next road will be physically started <e> <s> it is a disgraceful situation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e> <s> if you are talking about an edinburgh by-pass surely that will include lorries <e> <s> special roads very often may not always include lorries but i assume that all lorries and such traffic could go by them <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purposes of clarification may i ask the noble lord whether there is to be any fundamental change in the position of the scottish tourist board <e> <s> there have been suggestions of one sort or another but in some cases they lacked precision as to what was intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to have said to my noble friend lord soames if he were in his place that regretfully i shall not be here at the end of the debate <e> <s> i had not counted on it taking quite as long as it has done <e> <s> i too should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord <e> <s> lord peyton on his speech which i thought brought a sense of realism which slightly countered shall i say <e> <s> the easy enthusiasm of some of the earlier speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords during the late war we dominated the intelligence field

authority say but you never consulted us about this and the secretary of state has given his consent he is technically in breach of the law <e> <s> is this really a very sensible burden to put upon the secretary of state <e> <s> i know that this is the very old controversy about the words shall and may but i should have thought that the word may would have been quite enough to cover all that is required <e> <s> i fully recognise that there must be co-ordination but it seems to me that this is putting a burden on the secretary of state which is not necessary and which might land him in quite a lot of difficulty <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend before he replies whether he would be good enough to confirm that under the act the chairman of the scottish tourist board is a member of the british tourist authority <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> if so does that in fact mean that all that the british tourist authority is doing will necessarily be known to the scottish tourist board

meant by a special road <e> <s> it is referred to rather obliquely throughout the bill <e> <s> it means nothing to me except traffic control <e> <s> is there any distinctive difference between a special road and any other road or is it simply a question of the continuation of a name because it is simpler <e>", "<cs> then are the rules for a special road different from those for m roads <e> <s> then are special roads marked as such <e> <s> personally i have never seen such marking <e>", "<cs> that means that the rules for the traffic are precisely the same <e>", "<cs> may i as does this

easy to see the distinction <e> <s> do the government have a clear distinction in mind between the two duties which are very similar <e>", "<cs> i must admit that my noble and learned friend gave me the answer that i expected but i do not think it answers the point which the noble lord lord hughes made with great force and clarity <e> <s> the ministry of transport is responsible for safe driving but they do not help me to get to little puddleton-on-sea <e> <s> they do nothing to help me in that way at all <e> <s> it is nothing whatever to do with them on that side <e> <s> this is a matter which concerns the convenience of the public and particularly the value to the tourist trade which we must not underestimate <e> <s> as the noble lord said with the variety of one-way traffic today and with bypass roads you can make mistakes which cause you to take hours longer to get anywhere besides missing points of particular interest in certain villages which may be off the bypass roads

that point is covered and i should like my noble and learned friend the lord advocate to look into it to see whether a duty can be imposed on the local authority to ensure that it does not restrict or obstruct vision in this way <e> <s> i have down an amendment which roughly covers the point though as i say i am not sure that it is in the right place and i should like my noble and learned friend to

another point that my noble friend makes <e> <s> the associations must apparently let as flats and not as houses <e> <s> without any doubt at all most people prefer houses to flats <e> <s> it is imposing a definite disadvantage which i think is wrong <e>", "<cs> in the two or three years concerned has the tenant to be resident in his house or does he just have to have the lease in his name

an extremely impressive speech <e> <s> if the noble lord has these ideas i think that a conference might be of some value <e> <s> as he has pointed out this is a difficult problem <e> <s> it will be much to our advantage if we can find something that we are fully agreed on <e> <s> i am worried about what the other place will say to some of our amendments <e> <s> i must say and i should much

about public schools when one really means private schools one talks about public limited companies when one really means private organisations <e> <s> the words in this clause really mean very little <e> <s> i do not want unduly to press my noble friend at this time but i should like to have a better idea of what it is he has in mind <e> <s> after all every joint stock company is entering under statute <e> <s> as i read it this clause to a great extent leaves the department completely free to do what it wants to do <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue this matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with great respect i do not think that my noble friends reply was very impressive <e> <s> the point i was making is that i have no objection to the clause as it stands but i have objection to the implication that it could extend hatred to any other subject <e> <s> my noble friend says that it does not matter we have no law against hatred <e> <s> one can stir up hatred on hyde park corner or on the mound in edinburgh or in other places <e> <s> i hate cruelty and i hate the bomb do not stir up hatred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> my own feeling is that a prosecution under this clause would be extremely difficult <e> <s> however it is the principle of allowing hatred to go through public channels like this that i find personally offensive <e> <s> i will only say that i am grateful for what my noble friend has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill for two reasons <e> <s> first it is infinitely better drafted than the english bill one can read it very nearly with pleasure which one certainly cannot do with the english bill <e> <s> secondly one of the gravest weaknesses in scotland is the very low percentage of owner-occupation <e> <s> it must be one of the lowest percentages in western civilised countries <e> <s> the general feeling in this country is that something of the order of per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of the population want to own their houses <e> <s> in scotland the figure today is something in the region of per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> which is not very much more than half the level existing in england at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon for what he said <e> <s> there is a major problem in reading this <e> <s> i make only one further point <e> <s> for over half a century we have completely ruined rented property by the sheer volume of legislation <e> <s> let us not do the same with owner occupation <e> <s> this kind of legislation which has such complexity is not in the interests of anyone <e> <s> if the government cannot make it more simple they will damage houses rather than improve them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it a let must be written <e> <s> that should not lead to too much confusion <e> <s> it is being suggested that a licence is what is in mind but a licence need not be written <e> <s> someone may say very well you may cultivate my bit of land here and one may have done so for or years <e>

tell us whether this new clause is necessary at all <e> <s> i do not quite understand the philosophy behind it <e> <s> if anyone wants to buy a house surely he would inevitably take advantage of section of part i of the act <e> <s> i do not see what would induce him not to do so <e> <s> in any case if he did do so what is wrong with that <e> <s> he will be making a mistake no doubt but i do not see why it should be so circumscribed <e> <s> there may <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> if he is to look at this matter will he consider who will bear the expense of a disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can explain to me what is meant by the words in amendment no <e> <s> which read <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to be content with that answer though i should have liked to be sure that when this matter is put before a court the words are reasonably comprehensible <e> <s> i personally find it extremely difficult to understand how far they go but i readily accept what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness winds up i wonder if i may say a word <e> <s> i find it difficult to disagree with quite a lot of what the noble baroness said <e> <s> the clause is a very clumsy one <e> <s> its drafting is difficult i certainly would not have understood it if i had not known what it was intending to do <e> <s> it refers to about eight clauses and four acts which are not there and that does not make it very easy to understand <e> <s> i agree with particularly one point the noble baroness made and that is that it would be much better if the housing association houses had been left completely out of this bill <e> <s> as i understand the noble baroness she is quite happy that council houses should be sold and i am sure she is right <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make just one observation <e> <s> surely the local authority or the housing corporation is under a legal obligation to provide a mortgage <e> <s> that is an unqualified obligation with no exceptions relating to the quality of the person to whom the mortgage is granted <e> <s> am i not correct in saying that that is in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the auxiliary air force will be given pilot training <e> <s> can my noble friend give some idea to what stage it is intended to take them <e>", "<cs> my lords one point that has worried me about the independent inspectors is this <e> <s> supposing there are inspectors who are a little easier than others as i understand it that is the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord say that the consolidation could be submitted to the joint committee in december of this year <e> <s> if that is the case may i say that the joint committee works very quickly and would not take very long to complete its work <e> <s> was that not what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> then perhaps the noble lord could tell me what he did say <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that consolidation is desirable <e> <s> i would say that it is very urgent <e> <s> he described it as a vast problem <e> <s> anybody who has to interpret the law and tell his client what it means finds it to be a vast problem <e> <s> to begin with anybody who wants to act under the bill will take a long time to prepare for it so there is no need for immediate action <e> <s> no immediate action will follow from the point of view of the clients <e> <s> the point at issue is this unlike a finance bill or a company bill which are interpreted by experts this is something which as the noble and learned lord has said has to be interpreted by every single person in his own personal life <e> <s> on the most personal basis they will want to know the answer to how they are to act <e> <s> can the noble lord indicate when he believes consolidation will be available <e> <s> if he cannot do so may i ask him to say what he can about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will wait eagerly for the comments of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor of great britain <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend for one word of clarification <e> <s> in the course of his remarks he used two words tenancy and occupation <e> <s> which is it <e> <s> does the provision mean that someone has to pay rent for two years or actually has to live in the house for two or three years <e> <s> i am not very clear which of those it means particularly in view of subsection which i think repeals certain words in the previous act <e> <s> i am afraid that i have not checked exactly what those words are <e>", "<cs> i find it rather difficult to become emotionally aroused either by the amendment which was put forward by the noble lord lord ross or the amendment which has been put forward by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> what are we trying to do in this bill <e> <s> we are trying to do something that is absolutely essential for scotland <e> <s> roughly per cent <e> <s> of people in this country want to own their own houses <e> <s> to a great extent after the first world war councils were called on to build big housing estates and <e> <s> by and large i agree that they did a magnificent job <e> <s> but today after the second world war people want their own homes and they are less keen on council houses <e> <s> the government have quite rightly put emphasis on trying to help people buy their own houses <e> <s> i honestly do not feel wildly excited about whether it is to be two or three years or per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> what i am concerned about is that it is successful and that people get their own houses to live in <e> <s> that is what matters <e> <s> with great respect i am unable to get highly emotionally excited about either of these two amendments <e>", "<cs> no i do not <e>", "<cs> can i ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> how does a house become a sheltered house <e> <s> who does that <e>", "<cs> he has not given me the answer though <e> <s> what is the answer <e>", "<cs> and they can make any house a sheltered accommodation can they <e>", "<cs> sheltered property is all very well for towns <e> <s> it is much more difficult to get such property in the country partly because with sheltered accommodation you need maybe houses or more <e> <s> in the country you do not have that <e> <s> as i understand it in many cases there are houses which would be sheltered if there were enough of them together <e> <s> special consideration has been promised to us in the english act <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord has referred to this at all here <e> <s> there are places which are obviously suitable for people working in the country to retire to <e> <s> if these homes are sold off the retired people will have no option but to go and live in the towns which they will not want to do <e> <s> can the noble lord give us some indication of whether he is prepared to reserve certain cottages or places habitually used by retired agricultural labourers for this purpose <e> <s> can we have any indication whether this is in the minds of the government at all <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has just said <e> <s> my noble friend the minister has made an unfortunate remark when he said that country areas are no different from town areas <e> <s> they are fundamentally different in a number of ways <e> <s> he made a great mistake <e> <s> frankly unless my noble friend can show that he is giving some consideration to this which if i may say though perhaps irrelevantly to some extent is in the english act i must ask him to take it away and think about it again <e> <s> this is not good enough <e>

unless some other form of housing is available there will be no alternative but for them to go to the town <e> <s> this is a considerable hardship for people who have lived all their life in the country so there should be some degree of protection for these people when they reach pensionable age <e> <s> it would be quite wrong if they were not cared for <e> <s> therefore i must ask my noble friend to think a little more about this before turning it down flat <e>", "<cs> could we please have the section <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say whether rural areas have been designated <e> <s>

merely outlining the type of regulations <e> <s> he says <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the predominant reason why the russians retain hess is in order to have a periodic visit for many purposes to west berlin <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what has been said by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> this wording is rather schoolboyish and we could do better <e> <s> the word things could be left out altogether <e> <s> i humbly suggest that we use instead the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that an electric light is not always turned on <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether this includes the duchy of cornwall for instance which i gather does not belong to her majesty <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble and learned friend the lord advocate very much for this <e> <s> i think this is an extremely good amendment <e> <s> whether it was intended to be covered elsewhere i do not know but it now makes it quite clear that the word obstruction is not necessarily physical it can also be visual <e> <s> i believe it is of quite far-reaching importance and i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the first one would be paragraph of schedule <e> <s> wondered why is not included or a i imagine it should be included in that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a draft bill which was drawn up by the scottish law commission during its study of family law in scotland <e> <s> i think i can say that it comes from the other place with all-party support and indeed in a procedure which we can perhaps regard as remarkable the second and third readings were taken on the nod without one word being spoken <e> <s> but what is perhaps more important is that this bill removes certain inconsistencies between scottish law and the terms of part iv of the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women <e> <s> we have already signed this convention but apparently we have not yet ratified it

downhill to some extent inevitably because the tenants have no common interest in their equal well-being <e> <s> to my mind the proposed new clause would lead the way to developments which might be of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for what he has just said <e> <s> one point on this matter is that the grant to the housing corporation was fixed and then this proposal was put in afterwards <e> <s> so this is a new obligation on the corporation which was not taken into consideration when the housing grant was fixed i have forgotten exactly when that was but it was some time towards the end of last year <e> <s> i suggest that in future there should be a distinction between what is to be paid under the clause and the general duties of the housing corporation each should be shown separately <e> <s> in other words special consideration should be given for this additional obligation that has in fact been thrown onto the housing corporation <e>

corporation is fixed <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not help the manpower position if cars were licensed for two years with perhaps some small incentive instead of for one year <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask whether we recognise the karmal government <e>", "<cs> the noble lord described very well the procedure under sections or of the act but what he utterly failed to do was to tell the house quite frankly that it has never been carried out at any time <e> <s> what has happened is that the secretary of state has granted the covenant but that covenant has never been fulfilled and all these tenants-cum-freeholders can according to the noble lord at any time be turned out by compulsory purchase <e> <s> the noble lord asked why universities should be privileged <e> <s> he said it is anomalous <e> <s> they already stand in the act sections and <e> <s> they are treated quite differently <e> <s> therefore the argument which the noble lord makes is vacuous and has no weight whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not suggest that my noble friend was wrong in

would take <e> <s> that is the essential part and it was not mentioned by my noble friend <e> <s> i really think there is no alternative but to ask your lordships to divide <e> <s> my noble friend has not met the points we have made <e> <s> they are serious <e> <s> they are not large but they are extremely important for them to carry out <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> i hope so <e>", "<cs> my noble friend uses the word unreasonable but that does not appear in the bill <e> <s> i do not know how the local authorities can prevent people being unreasonable <e> <s> i just wonder if they need some degree of authority to do that <e> <s> if a person is thoroughly unreasonable he can sit about in the office all day watching the people working while making copies <e> <s> i wonder whether some word is not required of a slightly restrictive character <e>", "<cs> my lords i expect that the government will be only too glad to get this bill out of its parliamentary phase <e> <s> it has been before us one way or another for the best part of two years <e> <s> i should like straight away to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for

should be to see that the text is readable and understandable <e> <s> i bet that no noble lord in this house understands amendment no <e> <s> unless he has the act in front of him <e> <s> it is not comprehensible whereas this amendment makes perfectly clear a statement which cannot be misunderstood by those who read this bill <e> <s> with respect i do not object to what the noble and learned lord has done in this clause but it is our duty to try to get the drafting as good and clear as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with fascination to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble and learned friends explanation but it is an astonishing revelation that there is to be a transference from an act of parliament to rules to be governed i think by the lord chancellor <e> <s> is this the way we are to proceed in future in the government of this country <e> <s> are we to abolish the statutes and all that we do in this house and replace them with rules which will be substantially drawn up in the department of trade and industry <e> <s> is this really to be the consistent policy of the government <e> <s> if so it is one that will need a great deal of examination by this house and if i may say so by another place <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i do not see why we should corrupt the law of scotland because it suits practitioners in england <e> <s> i can see no reason whatever why that should be carried out <e> <s> this is what is wanted in scotland <e> <s> there is nobody who wants this clause which they consider totally unnecessary <e> <s> may i also say that i do not understand how the english practitioners welcome it <e> <s> if accountants are not paid their fee they will not do their job <e> <s> if they do not do the job the receiver will not know what is in the accounts <e> <s> it seems to me that to think that you can get away without the accountant being paid for preparing the accounts means that you are crying for something you will not get <e> <s> i do not know how the english act works <e> <s> i will engage myself in trying to find out about the acts quoted by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> in the meantime i am grateful for what he has said and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for amending what really is clause which i thought was quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> i should like to ask two questions <e> <s> first i agree with what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said <e> <s> i cannot understand subsection <e> <s> it starts by saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> is there any use in asking him whether that clause could be clarified a little <e> <s> it is quite simple to say that when an individual is disqualified under this section the disqualification shall cease when he is discharged <e> <s> i think that that is what is meant <e> <s> the other matters are to me extremely complicated <e> <s> i do not know what recalled or reduced means if it does <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words <e> <s> insolvency takes very different shapes and forms but there are many cases when the small tradesman who perhaps has not been paid by the insolvent person is very hard hit <e> <s> insolvency is not only a tragedy to the individual it is a tragedy to those who through no fault of their own are caught up with it <e> <s> they deserve a consideration which is superior to that given to our great national treasury with the billion or billion which it collects every year <e> <s> it may be a matter of only a few pounds perhaps or but it may be quite a severe blow to the tradesman <e> <s> there is an element of sheer generosity here which should have received much more consideration than the traditional line of crown preference <e> <s> i do not believe that this was meant to hit small tradesmen who have not been paid or who are brought into difficulty through no fault whatever of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> he has very frequently used the word trust <e> <s> if my noble and learned friend goes into a shop and buys say a pair of shoes on credit does that not create the element of trust or is it only a question of morality <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and the noble lord lord lucas for the amendments affecting scotland which were carried <e> <s> i know that the scottish law society will be very grateful to them for what they have been able to do <e> <s> i should like particularly to congratulate the noble lord lord lucas on his manner in conducting an extremely complicated bill about which i expect he knew nothing whatsoever six months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord grimond said that he agreed broadly with the tenor of this bill and i fully agree with him <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne no doubt did a very fine job at the treasury in getting this going <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> but it is a very seriously wrong trend <e> <s> it is all very well to talk about bankers and depositors but does anyone look at money from the point of view of the scottish economy <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not right <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very nearly that <e> <s> i shall again quote from the monopolies and mergers commissions report <e> <s> in conclusion they refuse the standard bank the possibilities of going there and <e>", "<cs> my lords the government could quite well introduce an additional bill to put the matter straight <e> <s> we agree that the tenor of the bill is good <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question <e> <s> as i read it that is a very important statement <e> <s> will this be a separate joint stock company <e>", "<cs> my lords could the holding company dissolve the company in edinburgh at any time it liked <e> <s> the noble earls statement is interesting but nothing is in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that a good many firms in fact observe the per cent <e> <s> rule <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord kinnoull for raising this question <e> <s> i regard this as a general preliminary discussion of what is quite a considerable subject <e> <s> of all the developments which have taken place since the war none is more impressive than the building societies <e> <s> they have gathered money i never quite know why and they have provided a social service which in my opinion is second to none <e> <s> unless the people of this country are properly housed all the rest of the social services are of a minor quality <e> <s> i therefore think it is of no less importance in what we do next <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it my noble friend says that the rates have risen by an average of two-and-a-half times <e> <s> if that is the case why is the poundage not reduced <e> <s> is this a matter of delay or is it for some other reason <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend endorse the view expressed by a very senior doctor in this house that it is not the duty of a doctor to prolong the process of dying <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is a friday and there are still another nine or speakers due to take part by which time our proceedings will have advanced fairly far into friday afternoon i shall seek to be as brief as possible <e> <s> i should like to congratulate most warmly my noble friend lord sanderson particularly for his mention of the north-west highlands <e> <s> it is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of air services for the people who live there <e> <s> there is no hospital in the north-west highlands to speak of <e> <s> anyone who is ill is brought by aircraft to glasgow <e> <s> this is a great social service of enormous importance <e> <s> it is impossible to exaggerate the change that it has brought to the area <e> <s> i also much enjoyed listening to the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester <e> <s> he said what is fundamental that the whole economy depends upon transport <e> <s> that element if i may say so with great respect is underestimated in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend really contemplating closing prestwick in <e> <s> may i also ask him why it is that for years no station has been put beside prestwick although the railway runs right past the aerodrome <e> <s> those are two questions to which i should like to have some kind of answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble and learned friend the lord advocate on getting one judge though i suspect very much that what my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson and the noble lord lord morton said is perfectly true that is probably inadequate <e> <s> i recognise that there may have been quite a big contest even to get as far as this <e> <s> i should like the lord advocate to remember that this house so far as understanding it recognises that there is probably an inadequate number of judges sitting at the present time <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that there has been something like a per cent <e> <s> increase since before the war <e> <s> my memory is not as good as it was but the figure is in that order <e> <s> all that does is to reflect an extremely sad situation which perhaps will require other solutions but at the moment this is certainly necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend what effect this will have on apprenticeships <e> <s> one of the most serious problems today is that self-employed people very rarely have apprentices and this will raise serious difficulties in the future <e> <s> the reason that they give is that apprentice wages are demanded which are higher than they can afford to pay <e> <s> i should like to know whether the noble lord can say whether this would have any effect on this aspect of our work <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend the minister say whether or not there was a covenant between the national bus company and their pensioner <e> <s> if so does he have any idea of what were the terms of that covenant <e>", "<cs> my lords may i presume that the navy will have similar access to both repair work and the building of ships to what they have at present in a private yard <e> <s> that is to say will naval officers be there from a very early stage in the carrying out of the work <e> <s> if i may say so i hope that this development will be successful and i am sure it is necessary <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble and learned friend whether the experience is that section of the matrimonial homes family protection scotland act is not working well <e> <s> we had considerable discussion on this in as i think the noble and learned lord lord wilson will remember and from the remarks which he and my noble and learned friend made there appears to be a suggestion that there is something wrong with the way in which it was eventually framed <e> <s> this is an extremely important matter because among all the troubles in the world rows between husband and wife are just about the worst and is some cases they positively have to be prevented by physical force <e> <s> i do not want to comment on whether the amendment of the noble and learned lord is right but i think that the police should have ample ability to prevent wives or husbands from interfering unduly with the family or with the children <e> <s> i should like to know whether there is any evidence that the police have inadequate powers or inadequate status to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave this clause altogether perhaps we could draw the noble and learned lord the lord advocate a little on what he proposes to do under the powers he has of making an instrument <e> <s> while the noble and learned lord has been extremely sensitive to parliamentary wishes i think we should be very grateful to him for that my experience is that people do not learn what is in an act of parliament until about three or four years have gone by <e> <s> therefore if this is to be successful and i hope it will be people should get an idea fairly soon as to what exactly these new courts which i think are an imaginative and interesting development are going to be <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it a new profession is being set up <e> <s> one wonders whether clause is necessary at all <e> <s> i am not aware whether if anyone tries to act as a barrister when he is not qualified he is liable to summary conviction and a period of imprisonment <e> <s> i should have thought that if this profession were being properly set up these words would be totally unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend this <e> <s> the point i am really making is why should a licensed insolvency practitioner deal with a case which involves no question whatever of insolvence <e> <s> that is what i cannot quite understand <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible to persuade people not to go to london in the first place <e> <s> the present state of traffic in london is a major problem <e> <s> it is going to cause great economic difficulty if we are not careful <e> <s> there are other airports from which people can start and from which they can visit london but there is no need for them to come to london in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to congratulate the noble viscount lord allenby most warmly on an interesting and extremely well expressed speech <e> <s> i am certain that everyone in the house heard without difficulty every word that he said <e> <s> i wish that that could be said of every noble lord <e> <s> the noble viscount is a soldier of distinction <e> <s> as a cavalry officer he spoke of horses and made the interesting point that animals show pain in quite different ways <e> <s> i shall not go into it but anyone with experience knows that <e> <s> the point that he makes about horses is of great value for all to know <e> <s> i hope that he will speak to us more often <e> <s> the trouble that he has taken indicates that he wants to make his point very clear <e> <s> i thank him warmly for what he said <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont for having taken these two amendments together <e> <s> i would agree with him and i do not really mind which one is adopted <e> <s> but i want to make the point here that the administration of an anaesthetic is a compicated matter <e> <s> there are some very powerful anaesthetics available and they need to be understood <e> <s> i have a relative who was engaged in medical anaesthetics and it involves a five-year course <e> <s> that is dealing with human beings of course but we may take it that the conditions today laid down which are in article include the stipulation that the licensee must be and otherwise it is open to the home secretary to make up his mind as to whatever conditions he considers appropriate <e> <s> the noble lord may wish to put it in the guidelines or he may wish to put it in the bill <e> <s> what i would say is this it is essential that it should stand somewhere <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether it is implicit in the words in the guidelines that whatever conditions are considered appropriate are brought into consideration when the home secretary is giving a licence where necessary <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out to my noble friend that we are not talking about sixth forms we are talking about secondary schools which is totally different <e>", "<cs> i have an amendment following which i think has substantially the same objective but it is badly drafted and i accept that the amendment of the noble lord lord melchett is much more to the point <e> <s> i have very little doubt that this amendment will put a thought into the mind of the home secretary indeed i have little doubt that it is there already <e> <s> but i believe that there is considerable advantage in letting it be seen in the statute that where things can be done by other means they should be done by other means and that the government accept that that is the right principle <e> <s> i have no doubt that the home secretary is aware of the matter and will take it into consideration and i think that substantially it is covered by the conditions laid down in the guidelines <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i apologise if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i said that my amendment was badly drafted and i was trying to support the noble lord lord melchett in what he said <e> <s> if i have said something amiss i apologise <e> <s> let us be frank <e> <s> we want the bill to be accepted <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for being so confusing <e> <s> i was seeking to be as clear as i could be <e> <s> what i said was that i was not moving amendment no <e> <s> because it was badly drafted for various reasons and i was trying to support the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> if i have failed to make that clear to the noble lord i deeply apologise <e> <s> i was explaining why i thought that it was useful to have the provision in the bill so that it could be seen that that was the intention of parliament <e> <s> i doubt very much whether in his decisions the home secretary will vary from that but i think it is worth putting it forward clearly <e> <s> to many <e>", "<cs> i have tabled an amendment which is substantially the same as that of the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said this is an extremely important point <e> <s> many of these animals may be going through a procedure <e> <s> it may be that the situation covered in clause will arise and that their lives will have to be terminated <e> <s> as i understand it it is fairly common for some of these laboratories not to carry out any observation between friday and monday <e> <s> that is not a satisfactory situation <e> <s> there is no reference to this particular subject in the guidelines <e> <s> i think that we must insist on this provision <e> <s> however i am not quite certain to what extent it is covered by the amendment which the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is about to move <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord will think that the matter is adequately covered <e> <s> if so i shall not press the matter any further <e> <s> however i should like to be certain that the principle enunciated by this amendment is fully operative and obligatory <e>", "<cs> may i point out that we had many arguments about the words may and shall but this is quite a different one <e> <s> this is not putting an obligation on the government which the government intensely dislike it is putting a clear-cut obligation on someone on duty which as we have explained already is a very serious duty <e> <s> he should have a clear obligation in the circumstances defined to make a report as stated in the bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord halsbury disturbs me <e> <s> he thinks that the examination of pain is to be part and parcel of the medical examination which takes place in a laboratory <e> <s> i very much hope that that is not the case <e> <s> i very much hope that the home secretary would not regard the examination of pain as a proper matter to be examined in this way <e> <s> this is the deliberate causing of pain which i should have thought would in any case be against the rules of this bill <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend this <e> <s> if someone steals a dog and sells it to an establishment does that in fact constitute an offence which can be dealt with under this bill <e>", "<cs> what i was getting at was this <e> <s> does the establishment commit an offence by buying a dog from a thief <e>", "<cs> i wonder how this provision works in with paragraph of the code where it states that there will be a new sort of chap who so far as i know is not mentioned in the statute as such <e> <s> but it states <e>", "<cs> i agree that this is a most cumbersome amendment which i do not think we ought to impose on the home secretary <e> <s> there are those who think vivisection should be abolished and those who think we should not waste too much money on anaesthetics <e> <s> there are the two groups which are violently opposed and you will never find out who they are <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> i do not think that we should tie the home secretarys hands too closely <e> <s> indeed i rather think that they are too closely tied already <e> <s> i would be inclined to modify the position <e> <s> one obvious source which i suggest should be brought in is say a professor of animal behaviour or people in that class of work <e> <s> they do not readily fall into either of the categories <e> <s> i ask the government to look at this seriously to see whether too much has not been specified already in this regard <e>", "<cs> subsection states <e>", "<cs> there must be a secretariat a telephone and an office otherwise it will be a useless body <e>", "<cs> will the committee have access to and see the inspectors reports <e> <s> i do not differ from what the noble lord said <e> <s> the clause is fairly clear but i should like to know the answer to that question <e> <s> secondly to what extent will they have access to laboratories and elsewhere should they so desire this <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord lord melchett has said <e> <s> speaking as a total non-scientist i believe that we have seen science turning itself over in the last or years and we are left wondering about the next step it will take <e> <s> it seems to be perfectly fair to take the view that much that is now done with animals will be done by other means in the next years <e> <s> this matter should be borne in mind and should be mentioned somewhere in the bill <e> <s> that is all that i ask <e> <s> i am sure that it is important <e>", "<cs> my lords under section of the act there are various licences product licence animal test certificate clinical trial certificate <e> <s> are these issued by the ministry of agriculture or do they come under the same general category as they do in the rest of the bill that is to say the home office <e> <s> can my noble friend tell us who issues these certificates and under what circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords now that we are not using poison gas which was extensively used on animals for some time there does not seem to me to be the same need <e> <s> my noble friend says as i understand it that because this is not permitted under clause it is therefore excluded <e> <s> if that is so we really have in principle the amendment that the noble lord lord melchett moved <e> <s> in fact it would add nothing to the bill if it was inserted <e> <s> if that is correct why does not my noble friend do it <e> <s> it makes clear that anything not contained in subsection of clause would not be permitted <e> <s> if that is the case then licences for this purpose that is the performance testing of any weapon are already excluded <e> <s> is that the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to follow the noble lord lord houghton in what he said <e> <s> i was shaken by the words of my noble friend lord glenarthur <e> <s> the original amendment said that the committee should know about the infliction of pain of substantial severity <e> <s> the noble lord said that that was not possible because there were so many it went into hundreds and hundreds <e> <s> but this is a bill for the protection of animals used for experimental and other purposes <e> <s> animals are subjected to substantial severity of pain i think that must be known by the committee but there was no assurance from my noble friend that it would know anything at all about it <e> <s> i take it that that is what is wanted and i do not think it would complicate the issue <e> <s> it may be that the secretary of state will refer it but he may not and we should see that cases of severe pain are examined by an outside authority which is put there for that express purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this amendment very much <e> <s> i think it is admirable in every way <e> <s> i wonder whether i may take a liberty with the noble lord <e> <s> i made two suggestions in the course of the committee stage and i should like to refer to them if i may for a moment <e> <s> the first question i asked was this what exactly do the words biological subject include <e> <s> do they include for instance a professor who studies animal behaviour <e> <s> i think they probably do and i only ask that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have all very much enjoyed hearing the right reverend prelate speaking with knowledge as he does of an area where this subject is of the gravest concern as we all know <e> <s> the views on this have been pretty sharply divided indeed they reflect to some extent what came out in the papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> i made a suggestion concerning clause perhaps rather improperly without putting down an amendment <e> <s> i believe that the proposed arrangement is a great improvement <e> <s> i hope that the home office will find that it is more useful because the qualities of a chairman are so different and so unique <e> <s> they do not apply to everybody in any category <e> <s> it means that the chairman does not need to be in any one of the three separate categories that are laid down in clause <e> <s> i hope and believe that that will be a useful change <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether i have understood him correctly <e> <s> the code of practice will in fact be public information <e> <s> i understand that he will not lay the code before parliament but i take it that he will make it available to the stationery office <e> <s> so that document is available and while it cannot be used for a prosecution it could be used for relevant evidence in the course of a prosecution <e> <s> do i understand that correctly <e> <s> if so that seems to me to cover the major issue that we are discussing today <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider letting the house have a picture of the design before coins go into production <e> <s> does he realise that colour is no use and thickness is no use <e> <s> what is wanted is shape <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i am looking forward very much to hearing him in a very short time <e> <s> i was impressed by what the noble lord lord foot said <e> <s> there must be a basic similarity between england and scotland in this field <e> <s> i have very little qualification to speak on this subject except that i was present when the noble and learned lord lord wheatley first explained to the faculty of advocates his proposals in regard to legal aid <e> <s> it is very encouraging to hear the enthusiasm with which he still speaks and his objection to allowing this to become a semi-nationalised system which is pretty near what we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is unable to provide additional housing association property is he aware that year by year the number of tenanted houses is falling and that it is absolutely essential in the public interest to restore them <e> <s> if he will not take this course will he arrange for those who have money that is mutual associations to build houses for rent without liability for rent control <e> <s> they will not build houses unless there is freedom from rent control <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the law reform parent and child scotland bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord advocate for supporting this bill from the government bench <e> <s> i also agree with the compliment that he has paid the law commission which i believe has done a very great job <e> <s> i recall that when the commission was first set up which was when the noble and learned lord lord gardiner was lord chancellor i was critical as to how it would be used but i think that the very best use has been made of it and it is an extremely valuable instrument to assist parliament <e>", "<cs> i never said that <e> <s> i said that there might be eight but not more <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his answer <e> <s> i am fully aware that it is not his department <e> <s> i should not like to say that he is embarrassed because that is something that i am sure he does not understand but it is difficult to gauge this matter <e> <s> may i say straightaway that i have the highest regard for the secretary of state <e> <s> however one must remember that he is not going to go on for ever <e> <s> there will be changes as there always are <e> <s> i think that nominations by the secretary of state are always too numerous <e> <s> i wonder whether he could say how many nominations he makes <e> <s> it must literally run into hundreds <e> <s> i think that is taking it very far <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lord not to take offence at anything i said <e>", "<cs> i am always grateful to hear from the noble and learned lord the lord advocate but if i may say so it was a particularly uninspiring answer which he can normally put some life into <e>", "<cs> my name is linked with this amendment and i should like to add one word <e> <s> what is guidance <e> <s> conversations over the dinner table <e> <s> guidance can be absolutely anything <e> <s> it is certainly not necessarily written <e> <s> this means that the board has to have regard to anything which the secretary of state says <e> <s> if that is the case it is impossible to say that it is an independent board <e> <s> i cannot see the point <e> <s> the subsection states that it will not affect the consideration or disposal of applications <e> <s> it would be intolerable if it did <e> <s> i find the last sentence quite superfluous unless the board is completely an instrument of the secretary of state otherwise it would be totally unnecessary to put this wording in at all <e> <s> it means that any guidance given whether in writing or in words has to be given very careful attention <e> <s> when one says the secretary of state one means any officer of the secretary of states office who speaks on his behalf <e> <s> any civil servant can make a statement if necessary which the board would have to observe <e> <s> i believe that this is an otiose subsection and i hope to see it removed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we are not dismissing this a little cursorily <e> <s> it is sometimes complained that in england there is no minister of justice but there is a lord chancellor <e> <s> in scotland we do not have a lord chancellor and the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is the only person who resembles a minister of justice <e> <s> as long as he is able to get on with the secretary of state it does not matter <e> <s> but there will be secretaries of state who inevitably will carry much responsibility for judicial affairs because we will not have a minister of justice <e> <s> i should have thought that the secretary of state would be in a stronger position if he had not too formally certain advisers on this enormously important matter <e> <s> we have managed pretty well largely through the quality of our lords president and our lords advocate who have held a high position and have been held in high regard but they are doing a job which is outside their responsibility <e> <s> i wonder whether we should not give further thought to the possibility of strengthening the position of the secretary of state and to help him to have some official assistance beside him in this task <e>", "<cs> can my noble and learned friend tell me whether this will be based entirely on supplementary benefits and not on the cost of living <e> <s> is this to be the permanent basis on which it is decided <e> <s> after all there are a lot of people without supplementary benefit who are concerned here <e> <s> if this is to be the basis on which the secretary of state sets the limits let us be clear how we stand <e>", "<cs> does this mean local boards <e> <s> if everything has to go before the board in the centre it will mean enormous delay <e> <s> is this a provision to allow local boards to give a more immediate answer <e>", "<cs> clause begins <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend is saying property of whatever nature <e> <s> this means that one could collar all the tools and housing materials <e> <s> i find that very hard <e>", "<cs> i must say frankly that to me the words look stupid <e> <s> i do not know whether they have appeared in previous acts of parliament or not <e> <s> but there must be some way in which under the control of legal aid those requirements that are necessary can be met <e> <s> if they do not exist they should be put in <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord morton of shuna has said that means that the employer has counsel and the other man does not <e> <s> if a trade union is involved it

about this and particularly the point which the noble and learned lord lord wheatley made which is very relevant and economical which i believe is of significance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel very unhappy <e> <s> we are leaving the review entirely as a matter for subordinate legislation <e> <s> that is a matter of principle to most people and i believe that we as the committee should be entitled to put it in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord says wait and see i have something else to show you but this is subordinate to it <e> <s> it is one of the things which i object to very much in this bill <e> <s> i say again that we are expected to wait until the minister has made up his mind about some regulations <e> <s> we are supposed here to be dealing with the principles of the bill <e> <s> the regulations should be entirely subordinate <e> <s> that is not happening <e> <s> i feel very unhappy about this even if what my noble and learned friend has said is true <e> <s> i do not doubt that <e> <s> but it really is something that should be in the bill instead of evading the issue by putting it into regulations <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether this regulation would be under clause or clause <e> <s> i ask that because it is of some importance <e> <s> in clause you have a draft laid before the house which has to be approved and therefore can be amended whereas in clause you do not <e> <s> the noble and learned lord may not be able to answer that offhand <e> <s> i am sorry but i think that it is important that we should know whether we shall have a proper opportunity in draft of seeing whether there is a satisfactory way of answering the points which have been put forward today <e> <s> i do not know what it is <e> <s> perhaps my noble and learned friend can tell us some time or another <e>", "<cs> i do not need to add much to what the noble lord has said but in the consultative paper there were certain suggestions which were generally regarded as highly offensive <e> <s> one was that small fines did not matter <e> <s> to many people conviction matters more than the punishment <e> <s> if you are convicted in certain circumstances it is very serious <e> <s> in certain fields it may affect your whole reputation <e> <s> the fine or imprisonment may not add anything <e> <s> it may be only a small fine or a short period of imprisonment <e> <s> but this is something ridiculous produced by the office of the secretary of state for people to consult and that is clearly in the minds of the people who are dealing with this <e>", "<cs> i understand that the decision on disposable income is being taken over from the dhss by the board <e> <s> is that right <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend can give us a slight indication of how a persons disposable income is determined <e> <s> i doubt whether any noble lord here has the slightest idea of what his disposable income is <e> <s> is there a means test or how else is it worked out <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or indeed to speak in committee <e> <s> unless therefore any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend is right in saying that this bill will help housing in scotland and i wish him every joy <e> <s> but i must confess that this is one of the most complicated bills that i have tried to understand for a long time <e> <s> practically every single clause is amending some other section in two or three other acts <e> <s> i am quite certain that nobody will understand this bill unless it is explained by professional advisers <e> <s> whether people are on legal aid or not they will need such advice or they will not understand their rights under this bill and that is a matter of regret <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> it is very difficult amid these complications to know exactly what is the right-to-buy <e> <s> if my noble friend was able to say which brands of houses have an exemption that would help a great deal <e> <s> there are many ways in which special houses are acquired <e> <s> i should like to know whether my noble friend can explain at some time which types of houses are exempted <e>", "<cs> my lords does not money from houses sold by housing associations go back to the housing corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords if a house is sold surely the housing association has to pay the money straight back to the corporation <e> <s> is that not correct <e> <s> it is important to know that <e>", "<cs> may i say one word about this <e> <s> there is very little more to add to the distinguished statements which have been made <e> <s> this means that the secretary of state has no confidence in the board at all <e> <s> these are essentially the kinds of decisions that the board which he himself is nominating should make <e> <s> this is not a political decision <e> <s> it is essentially a decision in regard to the administration of legal aid <e> <s> that should be made by the board and not by the secretary of state however wise however great a sense of justice he may have <e> <s> this is not his function <e> <s> if one does not trust the board to do this then the board must be changed to something else <e>", "<cs> are the government wise to say that no advice is needed before pleading <e> <s> one of the most important decisions in any case is whether to plead guilty or not guilty <e> <s> in many cases it would be in the interests of justice to encourage people to plead guilty <e> <s> it shortens the process and in many cases it is the wiser course to take <e> <s> one is leaving this entirely in the hands of an accused person who is uninformed as to the processes of law or what they mean <e> <s> often <e>", "<cs> may i ask for clarification <e> <s> what do the words subject to regulations mean <e> <s> does that mean that any article in this bill can be changed by regulation <e> <s> that is what it appears to mean <e> <s> the clause reads <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble and learned friend whether i am right in saying that in solemn procedure legal aid will be automatic and in any case coming before the high court of justiciary <e> <s> i understand that this bill is very complicated marred by masses of regulations and it is extremely difficult to know how far this goes but i understood that that position at least was clear <e>", "<cs> may i draw attention to this aspect <e> <s> you appoint a board to look after matters <e> <s> you then have regulations explaining what the interests of justice are <e> <s> is that not precisely what the board is set up for <e> <s> if the board does not know what are the interests of justice then you want another board <e> <s> i feel that subsection goes a little far in demonstrating the complete domination of the board by the secretary of state <e> <s> that is a criticism which runs right through this bill and i must say that i find the position unacceptable <e>", "<cs> i am looking forward with much interest to my noble and learned friend explaining why in some cases children will not need some kind of professional representation <e> <s> i find it intolerable that children should have no representation at all and yet be expected to take an intelligent part in the proceedings <e>", "<cs> that is not what the bill says <e> <s> there is nothing about the paramount interest of the child <e> <s> it appears that you have to prove that the child has an interest <e> <s> to my mind the child always has an interest and in most cases is unable to express that interest personally <e> <s> i would much prefer to see the word interests taken out <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one question <e> <s> according to clause no payment must be made except through the fund <e> <s> however if you look at clause you see the following words <e>", "<cs> that means that payment direct from the client to the solicitor or counsel is not cut out entirely by clause <e> <s> this is an important point because it almost looks as though it is an offence to do that and i understand from my noble and learned friend that that is not true <e>", "<cs> i think it is noteworthy that in subsection <e>", "<cs> does that mean that it will be made public <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has not said that <e>", "<cs> may i add one word <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord ought not to include clause <e> <s> clause is far-reaching and i shall have something to say about it presently <e> <s> it undoubtedly should be brought in draft before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i must admit i am not satisfied with this <e> <s> this is a form of means test <e> <s> we ought to have a precise definition of what is meant by disposable income <e> <s> this is the definition of disposable income and it goes back into various stages before that <e> <s> does that apply to other cases for example clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> can he say how many post offices have been closed during the last months two years or any such convenient period <e> <s> do i understand that he is now saying that any retailer is perfectly free to sell stamps should he so wish <e>", "<cs> my lords have i understood my noble friend correctly <e> <s> can any retail shop sell stamps if it so wants or does it require a licence to do so from the post office <e> <s> i understand my noble friend to say that hotels can sell stamps <e> <s> can all retail shops also do so if they wish <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question on this amendment and the other two amendments taken with it <e> <s> is it understood that there will be consultation with the faculty of advocates and the law society when these nominations are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the highest regard personally for the secretary of state <e> <s> i should have no doubt whatever that he would make good appointments <e> <s> but we are making law today <e> <s> there will be dozens of future secretaries of state at least i hope so <e> <s> they may vary a great deal <e> <s> it is not unknown for politicians to make political appointments <e> <s> it is not absolutely without precedent in life and this may happen <e> <s> appointments may be made on personal grounds and that has happened too on occasions <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill to say that the people appointed must be people of quality <e> <s> it is curious that there is no suggestion of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble and learned friend a question which i asked earlier and to which he did not refer in the course of his previous reply <e> <s> am i to understand that it is going to be clear that there will be consultations with the faculty of advocates and the law society in regard to the appointments which are to be made there <e> <s> i say frankly that it is in the interests of the government to do that to show that there is at least some degree of independence in these bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i ask my noble and learned friend what future secretaries of state are to be bound by <e> <s> if that is to be the normal procedure let it be clearly stated in the act that it is to be the normal procedure <e> <s> that is all i am asking and i think it is very reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what really is intended by this subsection <e> <s> what is the guidance which is to be given <e> <s> it is not to do with the disposal of applications for legal aid <e> <s> legal aid is out altogether <e> <s> what is in <e> <s> it is not to do with property <e> <s> that is already perfectly controlled at the present time under subsection <e> <s> it is not finance because that is wholly under the control of the secretary of state already <e> <s> it looks to me as though the only thing we can talk about is staff <e> <s> is it really needed to give guidance about staff <e> <s> if that is not the case what is the guidance required <e> <s> there is a slight suspicion that this is a method undermining the independence of a board which i would have thought was not only unfortunate but wholly contrary to the intentions of the government themselves <e> <s> can we have an explanation which would justify this subsection <e> <s> what exactly is the purpose behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a peculiarity of this country that we have no minister of justice <e> <s> we have a lord chancellor who more or less fulfills that duty and his name is the lord chancellor of great britain <e> <s> but in practice i think he does not operate very much if at all in scotland <e> <s> in fact i think he is always rather shy about taking any part in scots affairs so we cannot call on him <e> <s> practically every country in the world has a minister of justice <e> <s> justice is a tender plant <e> <s> it is one that can go astray very easily indeed <e> <s> i suggest that this is something which should be considered extremely carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> i think he should take note of what the noble and learned lord lord denning said that it causes great difficulty in england <e> <s> why should we write a new act in scotland which will cause equal difficulty <e> <s> surely it is for the intelligence of the draftsman and the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to write a better clause which would not cause so much difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords on the supposition that my noble and learned friend will not accept the amendment that the noble earl lord perth and i have down following this amendment i should like to support what has been said by the noble lord lord morton <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i ask one question <e> <s> does the power in subsection not permit as it stands the exclusion of solemn procedure from legal aid altogether <e> <s> is that not technically within the power of the statute as it stands <e> <s> that is what my noble and learned friend is at present justifying and i find it very hard to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what my noble and learned friend has said so far <e> <s> i should like to ask him this question <e> <s> my noble friend said that the secretary of state would consult the board on all regulations which affect them <e> <s> does he mean that <e> <s> why does he not put that in the bill <e> <s> i have heard this for years <e> <s> why does my noble friend say these things when he cannot speak for more than one secretary of state <e> <s> we are passing a law <e> <s> my noble and learned friend is not giving his opinion which i respect enormously as i respect the secretary of state <e> <s> but this is the law of the land <e> <s> it gives the secretary of state power <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that i am not overwhelmed by the force of the noble and learned lords argument here <e> <s> what he is saying is that a person who has been to prison at any time in his life is not entitled in these circumstances to legal aid except as i read it in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> it is rather hard and it is wrong to say years later to a man who may have recovered his character from when he was quite a young man in borstal or in any form of detention oh but you were in borstal my dear chap <e> <s> you cant have legal aid <e> <s> i say that this is unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords i should put on record that the law society has a complaints committee of which a distinguished layman is chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an extremely small request which i am making <e> <s> i am completely unconvinced by the manner in which the noble and learned lord has dismissed it <e> <s> we are supposed to be reforming the law in regard to legal aid <e> <s> all we get are quotations from previous acts which we are not allowed to change <e> <s> i think this is a power of an extreme nature <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend knows that from the time this bill was put before the house it has been heavily criticised for the volume of regulations <e> <s> they are in fact decrees in many cases because they are so difficult to change <e> <s> i do not want to push this too far but i do not know any bill which has been so full of regulations to be laid before the house as this has <e> <s> i do not want to exaggerate this but i was in germany a little while before hitler came to power <e> <s> the parliament was making government by decree <e> <s> i think that we have got to be very careful about the long-range consequences and the precedent we are setting in this bill <e> <s> i know that the professions will be greatly relieved and i know that many people in the house will be too if something of this character is accepted if a larger number of these regulations can be submitted to the board appointed by the secretary of state specially for this job a board which is now being bypassed almost universally through this bill <e> <s> i have great sympathy with the view of my noble friend lord perth that he would not be a member of a board which could be bypassed so extensively by statute <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i think that the noble and learned lord is missing the whole point <e> <s> he has emphasised that this is an independent board <e> <s> the secretary of state by sole fiat says get out you arent following my instructions <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> in this particular case it may not apply to east kilbride or the highlands boards but it is the form in which the secretary of state has complete control over any membership of the board <e> <s> that i think is the real point of this and i hope it will not be entirely lost sight of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble and learned friend how exactly he interprets the meaning of paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i find my noble and learned friends answer very unsatisfactory <e> <s> i should like to explain why <e> <s> my noble and learned friend pointed out that it is integral to the bill that the board be independent <e> <s> that is to some extent a small step in the bill to show that it is independent <e> <s> without this there is no indication whatever that the board is independent <e> <s> i should like therefore to ask this question <e> <s> let us suppose that the board disagrees with the regulation is it entitled publicly to say so <e> <s> if it is not entitled publicly to say so it is not independent <e> <s> it is the poodle of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like in a few words to congratulate my noble and learned friend on the courtesy with which he stood up to bombardment from every part of the house <e> <s> i have come to admire him greatly for his knowledge and the understanding which he has shown in many of these things <e> <s> i confess that i have been very brave in taking part in this at all because the last time i appeared at the bar there was no legal aid at all so that i have no practical experience of this whatever <e> <s> but i am very conscious of the great financial problem which legal aid presents to governments <e> <s> it is a problem which will not be solved by this bill entirely and there will be other bills i am sure to deal with it <e> <s> i do not know the answer but i do not believe that it is a simple answer <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for saying that one or two of these things are being taken elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords is the distribution of money the decision of the housing corporation or is it directed by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mulley said that he had been engaged in examining the dockyards years ago <e> <s> i was looking at them about years ago when i had the honour of being associated with the royal navy and when we were engaged in a penetrating study in depth of the whole of the dockyards <e> <s> everything was to be turned upside down though we could not do anything until the plan had been put in <e> <s> i have subsequently found from inquiries that i made that the plan did not succeed <e> <s> this was endorsed by the noble and gallant lord lord lewin who said that there had been a series of subsequent plans none of which had really worked <e> <s> one is left with the impression that some drastic change really must be made <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give the house some picture of the nature of conductive education <e> <s> it is a subject with which i am not very familiar <e>", "<cs> at the outset i should like to thank my noble friend lord gray for the care with which he has provided us with notes on clauses <e> <s> also he has fully answered two or three very penetrating letters for which i am extremely grateful <e> <s> he could not have done more <e>", "<cs> this is a terribly important point <e> <s> housing associations have had land provided to them at low cost <e> <s> they have also had public money <e> <s> the noble lord has said any public money and they must and can sell <e> <s> does he really mean that <e> <s> many of these houses have had a mixture of grants i think the noble lord knows this and public money <e> <s> as i understand it under this bill as it stands they are obliged to sell on request <e> <s> the noble lord must try to clear up that point <e> <s> there are many unsatisfactory matters <e> <s> i do not want to attack the noble lords speech but i cannot accept one or two of the things that he has said <e>", "<cs> that is the whole point <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend this question <e> <s> i again take the words of mr crosland <e> <s> it would be intolerable if citizens of this country had only the choice of a council house or owner occupation <e> <s> what is required is a substantial rented area <e> <s> that is the purpose of the act and that is the point i am emphasising <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord realise that the rented sector has practically halved in the last years and is going down steadily <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply to one point that my noble friend baroness carnegy of lour has made <e> <s> i wonder whether the committee realises the seriousness of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> any public money given to a house leaves the right to buy <e> <s> that means that never in future will the government help rented property never <e> <s> we are denying such help completely and yet everybody knows that rented property is the weakness of all the housing propositions <e> <s> the proposal that has been made is a very dangerous one <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say whether there is any sign of improvement in the training of apprentices by self-employed craftsmen <e> <s> this has very nearly dropped out altogether but it is a vital part of the training of certain types of craftsmen <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a few comments <e> <s> i am perhaps not surprised to hear what my noble friend has said <e> <s> there was a striking lack of novelty in the remarks which he made <e> <s> however what is being put forward is an effective suggestion <e> <s> the general view is that unless there are about houses the cost of management is excessive <e> <s> indeed that is recognised in england because extra allowances are provided for the management costs of the smaller associations or societies <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that allowing the societies to have up to houses was an economical way of using public money <e> <s> indeed the noble lord has an advantage in this respect <e> <s> if any society goes above they will be free to purchase <e> <s> however as it is we are undermining to some degree the efficiency which those organisations can achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord that in the autumn of the then secretary of state stated that the voluntary code was working very well indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> i believe that long leases are not very common in scotland but does my noble friend have any idea how many there are <e> <s> i imagine that the number is pretty small <e> <s> may i continue the point which the noble lord lord carmichael raised <e> <s> i see in one of the many useful pieces of paper which my noble friend has been good enough to send me these words <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what has been said on this subject by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> i think that there is someone in the scottish office who has a gift for insulting housing associations <e> <s> people have written to me and said that they are greatly insulted by the words of this clause <e> <s> i really do not see why it is necessary <e> <s> it is common knowledge i think my noble friend knows it that members of a committee have resigned because if they did not do so some relative of theirs could not get a house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i should like to be quite certain of what i heard my noble friend say that there is no report of abuse in the housing associations in scotland <e> <s> can i be quite clear that that is what my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord has said <e> <s> if we look back years to when for the first time the government of this country began to make themselves responsible for housing i think we should not regard this programme as very successful <e> <s> i think that most of us would be disappointed that during the whole of that period we were not more successful in clearing out the debris from the centre of our cities <e>", "<cs> my lords we must try not to be emotional about this <e> <s> it worries my noble friend <e> <s> we must be very matter of fact and down to earth when we are talking about this <e> <s> the most interesting thing was something that my noble friend did not say <e> <s> he did not mention the fact that the housing corporation had been turned upside down

is going ahead extremely well <e> <s> what we need is rented accommodation <e>", "<cs> i make one observation <e> <s> of all the arrangements in our country today apprentice training is one of the greatest lacks there is a terrible lack of apprentice training <e> <s> my noble friend the minister says that it goes into the contract and the noble and learned lord said the same <e> <s> but would it not be worthwhile saying that parliament regards this as an integral and essential element <e> <s> that would give it a status <e> <s> as was said what happens if they do not do it <e> <s> will the ministry break off the whole contract because there are too few apprentices <e> <s> i can see that there is a perfectly good answer in that it is all in the contract but people do not always fulfil contracts <e> <s> there is a status in this <e> <s> apprentice training is of vital importance and it is deeply lacking at present <e>", "<cs> the amendment seems particularly to satisfy the noble and learned lord but one aspect is not mentioned <e> <s> what about the royal corps of naval constructors <e> <s> where do they stand in all this <e> <s> they serve the ministry of defence they serve in bath in the dockyards and sometimes at sea <e> <s> will they be transferred if they have an appointment in the dockyards or how do they stand <e> <s> they are probably the most highly educated people

them <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us something about them <e>", "<cs> may i ask what that means <e> <s> does it mean that if they are working in the dockyards they will be transferred or that they are excepted from transfer <e> <s> i think that we really ought to know that <e>", "<cs> the dockyard workers of course are also civil servants <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> in the list of duties of a dockyard he did not mention the construction of ships <e> <s> in future is it the intention that dockyards should never construct ships <e> <s> i am not objecting to it i am only asking for information <e>", "<cs> i must express the view that until quite recently ships have been constructed in dockyards <e>", "<cs> may i ask one question <e> <s> my noble friend the minister used two phrases <e> <s> he referred to private company and to public limited company <e> <s> the returns from these two types of company are very different indeed <e> <s> the publicity for the accounts of a public limited company is much wider than for a private company <e> <s> does my noble friend intend that it should be a public limited company or a private company <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the letter of explanation which he sent and with which i fully agree <e> <s> he says that there are complications which might arise <e> <s> they are not the only complications which might conceivably arise under this bill <e> <s> there are a great many cases of <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this is an improvement to the bill <e> <s> there is a curious situation with this complex arrangement between this act and the housing associations act where some of the clauses belong to scotland and some to england <e> <s> one thing done by the bill is to bring clauses and into the scottish act where they were not before <e> <s> i believe that to be an advantage because it brings in more definitely the question of improving houses with repairs and maintenance <e> <s> that is an important and in many ways unique part of the housing associations <e> <s> it brings in the point which i had omitted to notice that if one has a charitable association one wants to use the hotcha system <e> <s> i believe that is right <e> <s> therefore i welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that he could not accept the amendment <e> <s> i can readily understand that because we are dealing with a narrow and difficult subject <e> <s> in the past years if i may take one word from the amendment what has been regarded as tolerable has obviously changed greatly <e> <s> what we were prepared to tolerate years ago is probably different now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all warmly to congratulate the noble

believe that they exist <e>", "<cs> it is only in recent times of course that building societies have gone to the wholesale market at all <e> <s> this is a new development which i think came up about or years ago <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am not absolutely certain what these words mean but it is suggested and i think the suggestion is right that building societies should not lose their local contact with individual people <e> <s> i do not agree with the noble lord lord houghton that we have entirely to give way to the government on personal savings <e> <s> this is one of the ways that savings have been undertaken and it is liked by the public <e> <s> it is merely a suggestion or not very much more than that that building societies should continue in this way and should not go into a purely city business borrowing money as if they were joint <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether the statutory instrument is laid by the commission and not by the treasury <e> <s> am i correct in thinking that it is laid before parliament but that parliament does not either approve or disapprove of it <e> <s> i just want to be clear about what precisely is the position of a so-called statutory instrument <e>", "<cs> have i understood my noble friend to say that supposing there is a comment on the liquidity of a building society or something of that sort he would not want this to be mentioned in the report <e> <s> is that the point that he is making <e> <s> in other words there would be some point at which the building societies were getting near a margin of some sort

years he will find that every building society will say that each office is worthwhile <e> <s> if anyone knows enough to deny that then let him say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to apologise to my noble friend if i do not stay to the end <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend what is his intention in the structure of the commission <e> <s> is it intended that the

question of succession <e> <s> will that be included in the lease or will it be left out <e>", "<cs> my lords i raise this matter because many tenants will not have read this statute and have no idea what is an assured tenancy <e> <s> i believe that that should be communicated to them and the place in which to do that is either the rent book or some other document which is to be drawn up <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot add much to what the noble lord lord morton has said except to say that i have throughout this bill sought to establish clarity <e> <s> i believe that it is of the utmost <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will consider the point further <e> <s> there is a conflict <e> <s> it is no good getting away from it because it is as clear as crystal <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend warmly for this improvement <e> <s> it greatly adds to the ease of understanding by many people of this very important bill <e> <s> i believe that the bill is richer and nobler for what the minister has done <e> <s> i thank him sincerely <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that schedule of the act is a pretty full schedule <e> <s> i should not have thought there was any complaint about that <e> <s> but a point was raised earlier by the noble lord lord carmichael on how the tenant enforces the provisions of schedule <e> <s> i shall not say that they are all ill-tempered landlords or ill-tempered tenants but such landlords and tenants exist on both sides <e> <s> what means does the tenant have <e> <s> has he got to go to the sheriff or will scottish homes help the enforcement of such repairs as may well be absolutely necessary and necessary in haste <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that my noble friend should refer to disraeli as having been the first parliamentary counsel <e> <s> he was a jolly good parliamentary counsel <e> <s> i wish i could say exactly the same at the present time <e> <s> disraeli as a parliamentary counsel was a man of outstanding ability <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> however the schedules were very brief and to the point then <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am rather sorry to hear the somewhat disturbing report which the noble lord lord addington gives on this matter <e> <s> i have a much more hopeful outlook that these boards will serve a useful purpose <e> <s> there are difficulties with this and i believe that my noble friend realises the delicate position of a school board <e> <s> it lies between the education authority the school and the parents <e> <s> there may be trouble from all three so that they need to conduct themselves with a great deal of understanding and i hope that will happen <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one question of my noble friend how long do the criteria which are laid down continue <e> <s> suppose that a landlord sells his property do the criteria continue as a real burden on that property indefinitely in the future or at what time can anybody get rid of it <e> <s> as i read the bill at the present time this is something which could be regarded as a continuous obligation resting on the proprietor of a certain property <e> <s> the criteria will remain indefinitely on that property <e> <s> is there any way of removing that burden which very much affects the value of the property <e> <s> is there any intention on the part of the government that it should remain absolutely indefinitely on the property for all time <e>", "<cs> obviously it applies to the original landlord but the question i put was whether in the case of another landlord taking it on it will apply indefinitely in the future to all landlords who own that property in other words is it a real and continuous burden <e>", "<cs> i too wish to thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i also wish to thank the scottish office for the very clear note that it has issued explaining what the bill seeks to achieve <e> <s> the bill contains a mixture of scots law and english law in a manner which is extremely complex <e> <s> the bill is a reflection on the manner in which this chamber carries out its work <e> <s> to understand the bill one must have access not only to a library of english law but also to a library of scots law <e> <s> if one does not have at least some training in law one simply cannot understand the bill <e> <s> my own feeling is that we are going too far in not making bills readable to the general public <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend will explain it much better than i can <e>", "<cs> i asked whether the criteria which scottish homes laid down would be made public <e> <s> normally they would be made public in the register <e> <s> is it the intention that that should he so or will they be publicised in some other way <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask one other question with regard to private owners <e> <s> when ownership has changed once scottish homes will remain an owner when it has changed twice it will remain under scottish homes <e> <s> if ownership changes three times what happens <e>", "<cs> i too should like to add my support to the argument of my noble friend <e> <s> i think it would throw doubt on how far we were convinced that school boards were a good idea at all <e> <s> we would be saying that we are uncertain whether it was a good idea <e> <s> frankly in voting there is no eternal wisdom in every majority <e> <s> one cannot assume that it is a profound and deep judgment it may be purely personal <e> <s> the main issue here is that we are trying to put something in the bill about which i think we all agree <e> <s> it is worthwhile <e> <s> let us therefore not be halfhearted about the matter <e> <s> should such an amendment be carried it would give completely the wrong impression <e>", "<cs> i must confess to being totally unexcited by this amendment in any form whatsoever <e> <s> it rather assumes that a committee of seven eight or nine people will spend all the afternoon voting against one another which means that they will never get anywhere <e> <s> unless there is a high degree of agreement on these committees they might as well be abolished <e> <s> above all their object is <e>", "<cs> other than denominational schools how do schools know that there is any such thing as religion at all <e> <s> is there any introduction to religion for those on the board who as nondenominational <e>", "<cs> the reference is to nondenominational schools in general <e>", "<cs> there is one aspect worrying me <e> <s> if a member of the board is the secretary he does not receive any money <e> <s> i do not know whether school boards will spread minutes all round the place to the education authority and goodness knows who <e> <s> there must be a competent secretary <e> <s> this will be vital for the whole of the work of the board <e> <s> the board would be very lucky to have a member who is a competent secretary <e> <s> competent secretaries are rare and important people and in order to get a good one the board must pay <e> <s> to expect someone to do it for nothing i think is outrageous <e>", "<cs> is the cheque signed by the education authority or by a member of the board <e>", "<cs> i may be being foolish but i was not clear whether the boards had a legal personality or not <e> <s> i had the impression that they had not in which case i do not know how they make a contract <e> <s> no doubt the minister can explain it <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether there is any form of kurdish authority <e>", "<cs> my lords is there really a change in meaning here or is this purely a drafting amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can tell us what the principal act says on this matter <e> <s> i much regret that i have not read section <e> <s> i wonder whether it is relevant to the point <e> <s> i cannot deny that there is a considerable force in what the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> i can see the situation arising but i cannot form a judgment unless i know what is in the principal act <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend can help us on this <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make one observation <e> <s> to me the most important matter here is to teach people how to handle guns with safety particularly shotguns <e> <s> i believe that people at the age of or are much more amenable to learning than they are at the age of or <e> <s> nothing is more frightening than seeing someone who has never learnt how to handle a gun with safety <e> <s> i think that this matter should be covered perhaps not in this clause but during the course of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords what does my noble friend mean by disqualified <e> <s> there are certain kinds of criminal offences which i should have thought would have been highly inappropriate for someone to have committed who was in this position <e> <s> i do not know whether or not we are referring to such offences <e> <s> an offence may not be apparent but perhaps that does not matter <e> <s> how far does the word disqualified extend in this matter <e> <s> i should have thought that certain kinds of offence would be highly undesirable <e> <s> it may be that those offences were unknown <e> <s> perhaps the pretensions of those people were not known <e> <s> therefore this rule would be no bad thing <e> <s> it would make certain that such persons could be evicted from their position if their offences became known <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is important to buy goods manufactured in this country can the minister say how one can discover where a motor car is built <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for a very interesting speech in which he underlined the main points at issue <e> <s> i shall not repeat them <e> <s> he has brought out very clearly the points which were so forcefully raised by the report <e> <s> i agree with much of what the noble lord lord tordoff said but i cannot endorse his remark that although safety is never absolute it can remain the objective <e> <s> i think that absolute safety must be the objective <e> <s> certainly we do not achieve all our objectives in life but they must remain absolute <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what my noble friend said and i appreciate the <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw my noble friends attention to this point <e> <s> it is a question of crime <e> <s> the proof therefore has to be beyond reasonable doubt not a balance of probability <e> <s> if the noble lord made this the balance of probability that would be more sensible <e> <s> perhaps as the noble lord said he will look at this point in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords what about the cuban forces <e> <s> have they been entirely withdrawn from the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble viscount was referring to the situation in england <e> <s> did he give a figure for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords why does my noble friend not bring in the word religion at this point <e> <s> it is in clause already <e> <s> it seems dangerous to use the word racial without associating it with religion <e> <s> many people of the same race are of different religions <e> <s> i can quote a very violent example in singapore <e> <s> it took place before my time there <e> <s> a christian family brought up a moslem child and because he was being christened the crowds in singapore rose up in rebellion <e> <s> that went on for some time <e> <s> i should have thought it was dangerous to use the word racial without bringing in the word religion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that prestwick has the finest weather record for aviation of any airport in the country and is used by not only glasgow airport but by airports all over the country when fog is about <e> <s> therefore it is a fundamental safety factor in aviation at present and i ask the minister to bear that in mind with baa which is anxious to lower its costs possibly by selling off prestwick <e> <s> it should be deterred from doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether my noble friend has read the north report which specifically says that our economy and society depend overwhelmingly on the motor vehicle and the motor vehicle depends on having somewhere to stop and let its passengers out <e> <s> does the noble lord really think that for a hospital with beds and with a staff of perhaps to parking places are enough <e> <s> one has to allow too for persons to go daily to hospital to get treatment and for visitors to patients whom i am sure the noble lord would welcome as being good for morale <e> <s> has the minister gone into that question <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether there is a limitation of money or has a direction been given by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is parking at the new charing cross hospital good enough <e> <s> has the noble lord tried recently to park his car anywhere near there <e> <s> i ask my noble friend to consider very carefully the situation of a hospital in dorset with a staff of people all of whom will want parking space <e> <s> all young nurses will have cars by the year <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that it will be very difficult to increase parking space after the hospital has been built <e> <s> it is something that has to be laid out at the very beginning <e> <s> will the noble lord consider whether he is grossly underestimating the national requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords who makes the decision in these matters <e> <s> is it the secretary of state is it the region or is it the district <e> <s> if noble lords want information they can get it from all these sources and it will differ from what the noble lord is saying at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend also take into account the unpleasant behaviour of the romanians towards the hungarians within their territory who i understand are attacked obsessively by the romanian government <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say how many houses in the private sector have been finished for rented purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether those entitled to some reduction in payment have completed their forms in the correct manner and in the correct number <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any simple way of saying whether a car either in part or in whole is manufactured in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i support very much what the noble lord said <e> <s> i very warmly welcome this bill <e> <s> i believe that it is an important step forward <e> <s> i congratulate the government perhaps not my noble friend in person for the considerable skill they have shown in bringing this matter about <e> <s> it is a flexible arrangement of the kind which i am sure that the sultan of brunei will like <e> <s> i was in brunei when the revolution broke out in december so i know a little about what was happening there at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my knowledge that bankers both in scotland and in england very strongly support what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may rather boldly add a few words to what the noble and gallant lord has already said <e> <s> the gurkhas have one quality which is quite extraordinary and that is their social quality <e> <s> they can settle down in any community with any race and they seem to be entirely at ease <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and gallant lord will agree entirely with me in that regard <e> <s> they do not chase women and they do not drink <e> <s> they may have a glass of beer occasionally and play a little football <e> <s> they have none of those attributes which make armies of occupation utterly unacceptable <e> <s> for those reasons they are a quite unique body of people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord ross has raised this extremely important aspect of housing <e> <s>

do not know why is it that the family bond is becoming weaker <e> <s> is it that divorce is too widely indulged in <e> <s> is it that mothers go out to work and leave the house empty and dull <e> <s> all these factors may play a part i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords does that cover worked and raw ivory <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that means japan can import from hong kong <e> <s> can the noble earl say anything about hong kong or india <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say who initiates trading estates today <e> <s> is it the government <e> <s> or are local authorities

bagpipes is popular and may require some extra payment <e> <s> as i understand it there is no objection to that in principle provided that the charge is reasonable <e> <s> to all intents and purposes the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> it is covered by the existing law is it not <e>", "<cs> i wish to support what the noble lord has said <e> <s> this is an extremely important amendment <e> <s> i do not wish to go into the details of what it does but the whole crux of this experiment in education turns on the understanding and support given by the families the mothers and fathers to the scheme

with the amendment subject only to subsection c <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> it has been said that there should not be too many regulations <e> <s> this is another regulation <e> <s> the need

like to ask my noble friend whether he will consult again with the british bankers association <e> <s> the points made by the noble lord lord mishcon particularly as regards the significance of the banking system on the economic side of our life in this country cannot be ignored <e> <s> the bankers have not made these comments because they wish to evade anything they say that this protection is a matter of great importance <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend tell the committee whether solicitor advocates will work under precisely the same discipline which exists for members of the bar or will it be entirely different <e>", "<cs> does the noble and learned lord mean different rights of audience <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend how far the word conveyancing goes <e> <s> what is it proposed to include in that <e> <s> for instance is there an element of negotiation is there an element of testing of prices or is this purely the writing of a document on which a complete decision has already been made <e> <s> is there a definition or is it left vague for the conveyancers to make up their minds <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord hughes who was chairman of a distinguised royal commission whose quality has been greatly underestimated <e> <s> i should like to emphasise what the noble lord lord macaulay said <e> <s> the inclusion of a clause dealing with what i call constitutional issues in a miscellaneous bill is utter nonsense and unworthy of the scottish office <e> <s> i am sorry that it has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords

they are totally unsuited for this office <e> <s> i believe that the secretary of state would be unwise to do this <e> <s> it will not be too easy to find an ombudsman <e> <s> it is a difficult task <e> <s> one needs to have as free a choice as possible <e> <s> i should have thought that the director general might be involved here <e> <s> one does not want to inhibit people from doing the right thing <e> <s> i suggest that the matter should be considered very carefully before we exclude those who may be of value in this office <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend what paragraph d of subsection means <e> <s> it speaks of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest that there should not be a five year period at all perhaps it should be wiped out <e> <s> i agree that it is a question of quality <e> <s> i doubt whether anyone would gain the respect of the court of session unless he had served slightly longer than five years <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend said that advice and assistance should be available <e> <s> i referred to that at an earlier stage of our proceedings <e> <s> ease of access to where one can obtain assistance is extremely important <e> <s> the suggestion is that it should be the licensed conveyancers or conveyancing practitioners <e> <s> i do not see where that comes in <e> <s> i do not suppose that there is anything that my noble and learned friend can do about it but perhaps he can tell me where this advice can be most easily obtained <e> <s> it is a cardinal point which until now has been omitted from the bill <e>", "<cs> is the advice to be given free gratis and for nothing <e> <s> i want to know because i am thinking of a person who has never been to a solicitors office <e> <s> he thinks it is a terrible place and that frightful people work there <e> <s> he is frightened of going <e> <s> i am not exaggerating <e> <s> it is important to get some guidance <e>", "<cs> are these words new or are they in the act which set up the office of director general <e> <s> on the other hand are they a new statement of his tasks and duties <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that but are these words new or merely copies from the earlier act <e>", "<cs> some people think that sunday does not matter at all but others disagree <e> <s> i believe that it is important that sunday should be different to the rest of the week <e> <s> to allow for licensing arrangements to be the same every day of the week would be quite wrong <e> <s> however i have other reasons for stating that <e> <s> if public houses are open at lunchtime on sundays families are less likely to have sunday luncheon together <e> <s> it is extremely important that families should have that meal together <e> <s> we should encourage them to have lunch together on at least one day of the week <e> <s> that is of considerable significance in itself <e>", "<cs> at this time of night i shall not press my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government engaged in encouraging the development of small trading and industrial estates in rural areas where they can be of very great value and opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords has any progress been made on reaching the same standards in europe as those which we have already established in this country <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna has said <e> <s> i was responsible for bringing in the act which introduced the principle of the breakdown of marriage <e> <s> i am sure that that principle is right and that we all accept it today <e> <s> the scottish law commission has gone a little too far <e> <s> i have great respect for that body <e> <s> i recall that when the late lord gardiner introduced this system i was very critical of it <e> <s> i did not know the form that it would take <e> <s> i now regard it with the greatest respect <e>", "<cs> my lords does the common market imply complete free trade throughout the european community <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend whether the age limit applies merely to scotland or whether it also applies to great britain <e> <s> to my knowledge this subject has never been discussed before in the chamber <e> <s> of course i may be wrong in that assumption but i do not intend to hold a debate on the matter <e> <s> i entirely agree with what my noble friend said <e> <s> i think that is absurdly young <e> <s> if a man is not sensible at he never will be <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that important work was carried out by private organisations that is non-governmental organisations in the south of russia following the severe earthquake which took place there last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disturbed at what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> he suggests that people will be thought to hold themselves out as competent professional people when they are not <e> <s> that is what he suggests in making this provision <e> <s> it seems to me that from the point of view of the public that could be extremely dangerous <e> <s> i do not know how the noble and learned lord will confirm that people are competent to do their job <e> <s> this proposal will do so within limits but here are people who do not fall within this provision who may hold themselves out to be competent <e> <s> they could be a great danger to the public <e> <s> what does the noble and learned lord have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to follow what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> there is nothing whatsoever in the bill about repayment <e> <s> one is left with the proposition that government money may be provided to assist those competing with independent people on the same ground <e> <s> i do not understand where the director general of fair trading comes into the matter <e> <s> this would be regarded as a very peculiar proceeding in the commercial market and it is a very odd proceeding here <e> <s> i do not understand why it has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords should that not be in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords where does the lord president come in <e> <s> in the rules in the book the council should make these rules under this section <e> <s> does this override that section or is it primarily a matter for the council to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone looking at the matter from the outside i believe the amendment to be much more sensible because it is practicable <e> <s> if something is possible that means that one goes to almost any lengths to do it which is not what is intended <e> <s> i believe that what is intended is what is most practicable and satisfactory for solicitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the same problem <e> <s> i have never understood what the provision meant why it meant what it did and who was gaining or losing <e> <s> it does not make sense <e> <s> i thought that it referred entirely to solicitors and that they must <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for raising this question <e> <s> it is most astonishing that this propositon about divorce should appear in the bill <e> <s> there are all sorts of things in the bill including charities and prisons <e> <s> all kinds of things are mixed up <e> <s> the first two occasions on which i read the bill i did not even notice the proposal <e> <s> i found it only recently <e> <s> it is a matter of the utmost seriousness <e> <s> there may not be enough members in the house to try to take a decison about it today <e>", "<cs> my lords is it necessary to maintain the provision for desertion if there is a two or three-year period <e> <s> is desertion a separate matter from living apart <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may mention that i wrote to the church of scotland and did not receive a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords if someone wishes to start an industrial estate to what government office should he apply <e> <s> is it a matter for the department of the environment or the department of trade and industry or is it left entirely to the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords where does one obtain such planning permission <e> <s> is it from the local authority or from the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble viscount lord tonypandy <e> <s> one readily recognises that he will always be known as one of the great speakers of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the position of the dalai lama is not wholly different from that of mandela <e>", "<cs> if you are running an enterprise one of your prime duties is to look after the welfare of your employees <e> <s> it would not be important if this matter had not been mentioned <e> <s> however if it is included for one part of scotland and left out for the other that is an obvious suggestion that money must not be spent on it <e> <s> i find that quite insufferable <e> <s> one of the prime purposes of developing economies is to raise the standard of living of the people who are living there <e> <s> that is ordinarily regarded as a social convention <e>", "<cs> the point that the noble lord made is very true <e> <s> i have received a number of letters on the subject <e> <s> i should like to know what will happen <e> <s> it is said that one can choose ones home or ones landlord <e> <s> however what will happen to local authority housing <e> <s> i shall be grateful if the noble lord will explain that <e> <s> it will be a great relief to people to know that consideration has been given to this issue <e> <s> people are worried about it <e> <s> i shall be happy to know the governments proposal in respect of local authority housing <e>", "<cs> i speak with great ignorance because i have not seen the white paper <e> <s> i did not realise its significance and i know that i have a duty to the committee to read it carefully <e> <s> however perhaps i may ask one question <e> <s> to whom is the development corporation going to transfer the habitations of the people in the corporation <e> <s> the noble lord has spoken about the success of the new towns <e> <s> that is splendid <e> <s> but nothing is more important for success than the good habitation of the inhabitants <e> <s> we must know who is to have these properties whether now or in the future <e> <s> we all attach great importance to that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has put the case extremely well <e> <s> the purpose of the measure is to treat a dog not as a toy but as a privilege <e> <s> in other words the status of the dog in this country should be raised <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in scotland the system of buying heritable property has virtually put an end to gazumping <e> <s> has that method been carefully considered by the committee that is looking at the point at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that there is a peculiar situation here <e> <s> in one half of the bill the word social occurs whereas in the other half it does not <e> <s> social is an extremely difficult word to define <e> <s> it means absolutely nothing until one puts a noun next to it <e> <s> then one can understand that the word as it comes from the latin simply means friendly <e> <s> the word friendly is a nice word but it means nothing until one puts it next to another word <e>", "<cs> my lords what action should be taken as regards someone who was present at this explosion and who subsequently died of cancer <e> <s> further what type of cancer would bring such a person into the pension range either for the benefit of his widow or indeed any of his relatives <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> one awkward point with regard to industrial courts is the question of perjury <e> <s> there is no way of stopping perjury because no record of any kind is taken <e> <s> i wonder whether the attention of my noble friend has been drawn to that fact <e> <s> i know of cases where matters have gone sadly astray <e> <s> i wonder whether any departmental attention has been given to the point <e> <s> i realise that it is a matter of economy and it is a simple matter nonetheless there is no record and therefore there can be no action with regard to perjury <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether this working group is concerned solely with the south east <e> <s> does it also recognise the value and importance of airports throughout the whole length of these islands <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the tax falls on houses rather than people at what stage in the building of a house does liability for community charge arise <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present time is there any sign whatever of a settlement taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend how people will know when a religion has been recognised <e> <s> will that information be officially made public so that we know what is on the list and what is not <e>", "<cs> my lords is it intended to have an advisory committee on this matter or will it be a decision which is purely and simply for the secretary of state <e> <s> it is an extremely difficult decision to make in some circumstances <e> <s> it is not necessary for it to be in this bill but it might be helpful to have some kind of an advisory circle <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult not to support what the noble lord lord macaulay has said on the subject <e> <s> this seems to open a channel which is undesirable for everybody <e> <s> one might hate a lawyer and present a first-class case against him <e> <s> that case may be unproven but nevertheless it is made public <e> <s> the lawyer could be damaged quite unreasonably <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the position now <e> <s> can the minister tell us in two sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a most extraordinary schedule <e> <s> it came into existence last wednesday and previously had never seen the light of day <e> <s> i am quite happy with the proposal which i think is sound but the matter needs very delicate handling <e> <s> i think that it has been handled in a heavy-handed way <e> <s> t has been made possible in a criminal case to accept single witness evidence that is uncorroborated <e> <s> that runs contrary to one of the main principles upon which scottish law is founded <e> <s> one can go back years to stair <e> <s> he states quite frankly where he stands <e> <s> he does not stop there <e> <s> he goes on to quote from the second epistle to the corinthians st matthews gospel deuteronomy and the early writings of the bible <e> <s> that is what he based his faith on <e> <s> it is not a narrow issue relating to scotland it touches the basis of justice in all parts of the world and that is what we are cutting out of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is a most extraordinary occurrence that we should be in the process of having a constitutional discussion on dogs <e> <s> the real answer if i may interpret the working of parliament is that both houses have agreed that we must do something about this matter <e> <s> that is more fundamental than the points made by the noble lord <e> <s> the strong point made by my noble friend lord stanley is that it would be for the minister to work out how best this can be done <e> <s> we are all doubtful about how it should be achieved <e> <s> there is only one way of settling a doubt and that is to do it we should try it out and see what happens <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the view of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham but i do not necessarily think that it will be the way that the secretary of state whoever he may be and whatever party is in power goes about solving the matter <e> <s> i am told that practically all countries in europe have rules on the subject of dogs <e> <s> we stand pretty well alone in not having any <e> <s> most people will agree that we have got into trouble because of the situation trouble as regards dangerous dogs and trouble in respect of trespassing dogs <e>", "<cs> my lords can
