["<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might ask my noble friend to clear up what to me is becoming steadily a more complicated and difficult issue <e> <s> i can easily understand that it could be put on the driver to take all reasonable care that alcohol is not carried on to the bus <e> <s> that is something which if he is not expected to search people he can do with reasonable confidencebut it is not impossible to imagine that certain enthusiasts for one side or another might slip a number of hip flasks into their pockets and would therefore be carrying alcohol on to the bus <e> <s> that seems to me to put an intolerable burden on the driver but if i understood my noble friends last explanation of the situation it was that provided the driver had taken all reasonable care to prevent alcohol coming on to the bus if alcohol was found to be there he would not be held responsible because he had in fact taken all reasonable care to see that it was not there <e> <s> if that is so are we not all barking round a considerable number of different trees <e> <s> because in spite of all the problems about what a driver does when he sees that somebody has got alcohol he is not then responsible because he did take all reasonable care to see it was not there <e> <s> he does not have to stop or to do anything at all <e> <s> he is perfectly free to drive the bus until it gets to its destination <e> <s> am i wrong <e>"]
