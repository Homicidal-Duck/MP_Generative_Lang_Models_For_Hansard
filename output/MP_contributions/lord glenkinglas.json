["<cs> my lords the part of the gracious speech to which i should like to draw your attention is the phrase <e>", "<cs> paganism was possibly a little too far south to come under the influence of saint columba and his marvellous emissaries <e> <s> it is an island of quite staggering charm and is completely undeveloped <e> <s> that perhaps is one of its most attractive features <e> <s> it consists of a few houses and these marvellous buildings which have been very carefully and tastefully restored since a duke of argyll about years ago gave them into the perpetual care of the church of scotland with a suitable number of trustees to see that they were properly looked after <e> <s> he also had the splendid idea that those buildings should be used by any part of the christian faith and they are to this day <e> <s> that was a very early example of an ecumenical idea and so far as i know it has been entirely successful <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to expand <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for the opportunity that he has given the house in what i believe has been an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> i say this with some hope that i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the point i was making was that more money must go into retraining people for skills in the engineering industry and that if one has not the money for both then that is where it ought to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not ask the minister to make another speech in view of the fact that he is obviously going to open the debate next week but may i inform him that i personally think he and the government are right <e> <s> is he aware that there was a very famous song from gilbert and sullivan <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree i am sure that he will that those of us who have lived beside the clyde all our lives share the deep regret of everyone in the house that the shipbuilding industry should have been so seriously in decline <e> <s> will he not agree that there are still one or two very high-class shipbuilding yards left in that area <e> <s> if there are to be redundancies will he ask his right honourable friends to consider very carefully the provision of that large micro-chip factory which was to be built at greenock which is exactly the right area for the regional policy concerned and will they do their best at least to bring that industry to this part of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add one point to my noble friend in addition to those made by the noble baroness <e> <s> may i urge the government to make up their minds rather soon <e> <s> most of us my family have been hill sheep farming now for well over years realise that we kept our stock alive last winter entirely at the expense of the banks because the cost of food rose to astronomical heights <e> <s> i was buying hay from england at something over a ton <e> <s> it is not a very happy situation to be in in the spring <e> <s> certainly if we get another year like that there will be no chance of my bank continuing to support the operation at that level <e> <s> the animals are alive because we were able to borrow money <e> <s> we shall not be able to do it again if the government take a long time to make up their minds <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept my congratulations on the stand he is taking but will he also indicate to the government that should these negotiations fail after the worst period of weather on the hills in history a period of months and the worst prices following on enormous increases in costs they ought to accept some responsibility for looking after their sheep farmers in the same way as the french illegally are trying to look after theirs <e>", "<cs> my lords may i correct my noble friend <e> <s> i was not asking him to act illegally in any sense at all <e> <s> however my noble friend and his colleagues have said that should other things fail matters like the hill sheep subsidy would be considered in the light of results at the end of the year <e> <s> the results have been disastrous but nothing has happened <e> <s> and that is not illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend explain to the house how under the trade descriptions act these items are allowed to be sold as shetland wool when there is not even enough shetland wool for the tiny production of the shetland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that problems of gatwick heathrow stansted maplin and the other airports have been debated at enormous length for years by the people and the governments concerned and that no new facts on any of them could conceivably come out <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept my congratulations on what he is doing to defend the farming community from sometimes rather unfair attacks by the other side that everything is being done for the farming community and not enough is being done for the consumer <e> <s> will he bear in mind that this winter has only just started <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may refer to the noble lord lord peart as my friend i was obviously not referring to him when i said that certain comments had been made <e> <s> his comments were very much more balanced as one would expect from a former minister of agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might ask my noble friend to clear up what to me is becoming steadily a more complicated and difficult issue <e> <s> i can easily understand that it could be put on the driver to take all reasonable care that alcohol is not carried on to the bus <e> <s> that is something which if he is not expected to search people he can do with reasonable confidencebut it is not impossible to imagine that certain enthusiasts for one side or another might slip a number of hip flasks into their pockets and would therefore be carrying alcohol on to the bus <e> <s> that seems to me to put an intolerable burden on the driver but if i understood my noble friends last explanation of the situation it was that provided the driver had taken all reasonable care to prevent alcohol coming on to the bus if alcohol was found to be there he would not be held responsible because he had in fact taken all reasonable care to see that it was not there <e> <s> if that is so are we not all barking round a considerable number of different trees <e> <s> because in spite of all the problems about what a driver does when he sees that somebody has got alcohol he is not then responsible because he did take all reasonable care to see it was not there <e> <s> he does not have to stop or to do anything at all <e> <s> he is perfectly free to drive the bus until it gets to its destination <e> <s> am i wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend first to give me pleasure confirm to a leading sunday newspaper that the penultimate letter of his name is n and not m <e> <s> after doing that will he bear in mind that in view of a great deal of experience the worst payer in the country is the treasury and the second worst and third worst bracketed are local authorities and government ministries <e> <s> since the government are committed to trying to help small local businesses will they do everything possible to see that credit is not extended for these very long periods <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl that in the old days rolls-royce were the worst <e>", "<cs> my lords like so many people who have already spoken i have to declare an interest because my family at least has an interest in trees although i do not believe i own any at all unless an occasional magnolia or embothrium count as forest trees <e> <s> like all noble lords who have spoken i have enjoyed listening to the many expert people who have been talking on this most important subject which was so ably introduced by the noble lord lord dulverton and so well responded to by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe as i think everybody in the house would have expected them to do <e> <s> they are both considerable experts in their own field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad to know that the noble lord has picked it up <e> <s> lastly there was at one moment an idea that in some way forestry could help crofting communities <e> <s> i do not know whether that has happened <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i could ask him to consider before report stage this point which seems to be a valid one <e> <s> most of us looking at the amendments so far have been considering single trees planted along roads and such places <e> <s> when we come to this particular amendment there are a number of local authorities that have quite sizeable parks <e> <s> in some of these they will be growing future stands of hardwoods <e> <s> it may well be or years before some of them need to be cut out in order to thin what will be a very fine stand of that particular variety of tree <e> <s> if every time they cut one out they have to put another one in the whole purpose of thinning the wood will have rather disappeared <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have intervened <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady elliot of harwood and at her request i beg leave to ask the question which stands in her name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the pulp mill at fort william was the first big manufacturing industry in the highlands for years <e> <s> while i welcome everything he says about trying to develop another one or some alternative i do not believe that shifting the timber elsewhere and particularly exporting it would be of very much value to the highlands <e> <s> secondly may i ask my noble friend whether the strengthening of the forestry industry which is a very long-term industry is not the perfect use for some of the oil revenues which are by nature rather short term <e> <s> lastly will my noble friend agree that it is remarkable that my noble friend lady elliot should have asked not about sheep but about timber <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl clarifies it would he not think it wise to take this back and look at it again because i think that three years is too short <e> <s> i am not sure whether eight years or five years is right i should be happier with five but frankly i am not happy with three <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers this short debate can he perhaps help me by letting me know how if his scheme is a success the valuations are in fact going to be achieved <e> <s> my experience has been that the district valuers are already enormously heavily pressed and sometimes take two or three years to come to value things <e> <s> if we are going to have a lot of houses then how are the district valuers going to cope and where are they going to get the staff to carry out the valuations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for referring to me in that way <e> <s> i think that in every case in which we brought in new big industries to scotland it was not the local authorities but the scottish local housing which built the houses <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend please accept that i really do not care too much about this particular argument about nationalisation but i have had the good fortune to live for years in a very charming village in scotland <e> <s> until the last two years we could post letters on saturday and on <e>", "<cs> it is going down my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened as best one can in this rather difficult chamber to my noble friends lord mansfield and lord melchett to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and my noble friend and ex-colleague lord craigton <e> <s> i am bound to admit that i find it a little difficult to understand most of the arguments that have been put forward <e> <s> may i start in reverse order as it were and refer to my noble friend lord craigton <e> <s> he and i were in the scottish office together and while he was mainly concerned with the town administration i was more directly concerned with the land <e> <s> that was perhaps quite proper because for my sins or for whatever reason for the last years i have had the pleasure the difficulty the frustration and the excitement of trying to develop a type of land very different from that owned by the noble lord lord melchett <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just add one word to what lord willis has said with which i very much agree there is a different problem also which comes into this and this is not responsible writers <e> <s> my noble friend lord drumalbyn described how an editor might turn to his reporters and say are you sure this is true and have you checked your facts <e> <s> i know having been in public life for a little while that once or twice the editor has said have you checked that the man is dead <e> <s> and having checked that the man was dead then produced stories which were really totally disreputable and absolutely untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the way in which he introduced the order <e> <s> likewise i thank the noble lord lord ross of marnock who as always has done a great deal of homework it is nice to see that somebody is learning about the sheep industry after so many years <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware my family have had an interest in sheep for a long time <e> <s> i entirely agree with the success of the negotiation <e> <s> as the minister said it is wonderful what time and goodwill will do but by golly <e> <s> it has taken a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> i am not in the least touchy about this matter but i can assure the noble earl that there are four or five million scots who are very touchy <e> <s> i did not say that the noble earl had not read his brief i said that he had not asked his friend the minister of state to check it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i think that the noble lord probably by mistake totally misled your lordships when he said that when a government changes the minister cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is of any comfort to the noble lord may i ask whether he is aware that the noble baroness was just as strict many years ago when i was in his position and exactly the same problems arose <e> <s> we did prosecute a number of people <e> <s> it made not the slightest difference and it is going on now in exactly the same way as it was in and <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that it is to some extent natural that at this moment there should be some people in the country who will be worried whether it is japanese or german industry coming into this country <e> <s> i have no doubt that at the beginning of the last century if there were american imports coming into this country after the war of independence there would have been resistance to that too <e> <s> would my noble friend not agree however that the vast impact of overseas investment whether it comes from america or any other place has had a terrific impact on this country not only on employment but on all sorts of trade union and management problems and has done nothing but good <e> <s> would he <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word or two about this bill because i think as in so many cases it is highly confusing and a great deal of what has been said so far this afternoon has merely added to my confusion <e> <s> i find it most extraordinary that we should be starting this bill in this house <e> <s> i know that we complain that bills far too often start the other end and then come up to us <e> <s> but here we are starting a bill in this house on people voting in general elections when not a single member of your lordships house has a vote in a general election <e> <s> therefore we are really fishing in waters which ought to be quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not make it right to change it <e> <s> what the noble lord is then saying is that what you have got to do is vote for a member of parliament and not for the government <e> <s> perhaps i am biased but looking back over the last years i think that the calibre of the candidates and therefore of the members of the other place has deteriorated quite enormously <e> <s> it might well be that i would want to vote much more for the party than for the local member who was standing for election and i see no reason why i should not do so <e> <s> for those reasons and indeed many other reasons which are mainly committee points i think that this is an ill-thought out bill and i certainly do not think that it should start in this place <e>", "<cs> i think every single member of this committee would agree that a snare is a nasty method of catching any animal and so indeed was the gin trap to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> he said that the gin trap had continued to be used in scotland for some time longer than in england <e> <s> that was for one reason and one reason only which was that at that time it was the only method by which you could keep foxes under control on your farming areas <e> <s> as many of your lordships know i happen to live in a farming area <e> <s> i suppose we have killed in the last or years an average of to adult foxes every year sometimes by shooting and in the old days by gin traps <e> <s> now a certain number are taken by snaring <e>", "<cs> may i just answer that point because the noble lord is perfectly right it is only a question of taking trouble <e> <s> as regards gassing we would need more gas than the whole of porton could produce in a year in order to deal with the kind of places that our foxes live in because they are not earths they are enormous falls of rock and no amount of gas would deal with them <e> <s> if the noble lord used his influence to see that we had a subsidy for about three men full-time every year then i could control the foxes <e> <s> but without that it is a human question and a cost question <e> <s> one is dealing with many tens of thousands of acres of hill land often with no keepers on at all <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being the third ex-secretary of state to say something about a firm with which we were all very deeply involved may i ask whether my noble friend would consider i do not expect an answer to this today that while the government are providing many hundreds if not thousands of millions of pounds for british leyland we should not consider some part of that money perhaps coming to scotland where with bad luck perhaps billy rootes started the original factory and with a little bit less than good luck citroen and peugeot took it on <e> <s> the workforce has done particularly well there and there is a very much better degree of co-operation between management and workforce than i think is true of any factory in the birmingham-coventry area <e> <s> will my noble friend bear that in mind in seeking to put more money behind the motor manufacturing industry in britain <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords when i opened this debate i said i was confident that there were enough <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with everything that my noble friend has said and much of what has been said on every side of the house may i ask my noble friend this would he please consider what would be the most appropriate oscar to give the national coal board for what must be the worst bit of public relations seen this century <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that during the past years i have had to visit almost all the big oil-producing countries in one official capacity or another and on almost every occasion i have been chided for the hypocrisy of succeeding governments in blaming the opec countries for increasing the price of oil when most of the price was in fact increased by the governments of the day in their own countries <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that i have to visit dubai on friday and i was hoping for a helpful reply <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that if the problem as the noble lord lord paget of northampton has said has been caused by people of his generation and of mine then there should not be too much problem about the birth rate <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that when the civil servants started this operation they assured the public that they would do everything they could to avoid disrupting the public <e> <s> although i fully appreciate everything that my noble friend is trying to do is there not some way in which the civil service could be brought round the table to discuss these problems in the very constructive manner that he has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support the noble lords amendment in this regard until we have better and further information <e> <s> owing largely to the operation of the hydro-electric board in the parts of scotland where i live there are very many miles of private roads and on the estate which belonged to my brother and myself there were something like miles of private roads <e> <s> they were used as the noble lord said by shepherds by people crammed into land rovers and so on <e> <s> it would be absurd and ridiculous if the regulations suitable for other roads were insisted upon in these areas <e> <s> what is more it would be even more absurd if the police had to come and check up <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend do everything that he can to assure senior police officers that the country is solidly behind them in trying to put an end to these riots <e> <s> i understood from the comment from a chief constable to which <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would consider rephrasing an expression he used just now <e> <s> he seemed to indicate that somebody who had been thrown out of a car because they were not wearing a seat belt and thereby it saved their life might be in such a mental state that they could get some sort of certificate for not wearing one in future <e> <s> i think if my noble friend had been thrown out of a car he would not want to wear one again and i am quite sure he would not regard himself in a mental state <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that during the period when i was responsible for the ecgd exactly the opposite to what the noble lord lord bruce suggested happened <e> <s> a very large number of companies complained that the ecgd was much too strict in making investigations in countries and in refusing credit to countries with which they wanted to do business <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard correctly my noble friend said to the house that the new heavier lorries would be no bigger than the biggest lorries at present in existence but would he not agree that the biggest lorries in existence at the moment are already far too big for a great many of the roads which they are using <e> <s> in my part of scotland they are creating very <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that there are <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend perhaps help the house in agreeing that agricultural machinery to which he has mostly referred in his answers is one thing but there are very few civilian machines that are used indoors <e> <s> therefore what applies to the agricultural machines also applies to the civilian ones <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to be the general pattern this afternoon not only to declare an interest but to declare any number of any other relevant or irrelevant matters which happen to occur to noble lords at the time <e> <s> i only declare that i was mainly responsible with the nature conservancy council the nfu and others at the time for drawing up the details for the act many years before it came in and then found myself in the rather curious position of having to help it through its passage in the house of commons a little later <e> <s> so i think i can say that i have at least some knowledge of the difficulties of what my noble friend lord glenarthur has so bravely taken on <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for his sympathy <e> <s> when we get to clause i shall look hopefully at his amendment and see whether it does what i hope it will do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble viscount lord thurso on this amendment one of the great dangers of the modern age is the proliferation of index-linked pensions <e> <s> if we are to bring all the quangos into it on the ground of uniformity before long the taxpayer in this country will be in a very miserable condition <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble viscount lord thurso that it is essential for a chairman of a deer commission to be fairly young because he has to be active get about and look in the forests and the hills and not just take everything for granted secondly it is highly desirable that the post moves around the different people concerned with deer <e> <s> therefore to my mind a five-year or a six-year appointment is perfectly adequate <e> <s> at the end of that time the person concerned may well be years away from being pensionable and the whole idea of index-linked pensions at that age is entirely abhorrent <e> <s> i shall not go on to my amendment which is rather more wide-ranging until we have dealt with this one but i entirely support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am against a pension <e>", "<cs> this is where we get into more interesting fields <e> <s> we have had the pleasure of listening to the noble lord lord houghton as a trade unionist saying that he wants to have a closed shop and we have listened to the noble lord lord ross of marnock warning my noble friend lord mansfield what happens if you have a money resolution in the house of commons <e> <s> having suffered on many dozens of occasions from lord ross of marnocks very detailed examination of money orders in the house of commons may i say that of course he is quite right <e>", "<cs> i would like to say a word or two in support of this amendment <e> <s> i know perfectly well that the nfu is very keen that we should not remove shotguns <e> <s> the reason is quite simple <e> <s> if one goes round the crofting counties and the areas where crofters are almost everyone has a shotgun but coparatively few people have a rifle <e> <s> they know perfectly well that they are not going to kill the deer in cases out of but it gives them some satisfaction if there is a deer in the field to go out and fire a gun at it <e> <s> this is purely a get off my ground attitude which they can take and get away with <e> <s> it is entirely cruel it is entirely ineffective and it should be stopped <e>", "<cs> if i may say so my noble friend who has just sat down got the problem slightly wrong <e> <s> it is not the poachers who are asking us to keep the shotgun it is the nfu <e> <s> they are asking for this for quite the wrong reason <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend is thinking about these things with his right honourable friend the secretary of state would he bear in mind that he is putting this house in a pretty difficult situation <e> <s> what in effect he is saying is that if we ban shotguns it infuriates the nfu and they will stop the bill at second reading in the other place whereas if we accept them all those people who feel very strongly about cruelty may well stop it in the other place also <e> <s> if that is the sort of situation we are in i think it is high time the government took over the bill as their own <e>", "<cs> i think i was the first person to put down an amendment on this theme amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list which we shall come to in due course if it is moved <e> <s> i think there was a definite gap the districts which have to license venison dealers would in many cases have extremely little knowledge either of how many ought to be licensed in their area or indeed whether the people were suitable <e> <s> i felt that the red deer commission could very easily give guidance as to the number which would involve extremely little work on their part and the police could give advice on the viability <e> <s> i rather agree that police is better than chief constable because the chief constable for instance for argyll is in dumbarton but presumably he has got somebody in argyll who knows something about it <e> <s> in general i support <e>", "<cs> i should like to correct the noble viscount lord thurso on one point and to suggest some alternatives to him on another <e> <s> the noble viscount says that the fact that deer are on low ground means that they are marauding <e> <s> that may be so in his part of the world but it certainly is not so in mine because the real problem for stags and indeed hinds too is that if we have the type of weather that we have been experiencing regularly this winter they are driven to the low ground for shelter and it is in those cases where they are not necessarily doing any damage whatever because the ground is covered with snow that under the existing regulations the occupier may shoot them and he may shoot as many as he likes <e> <s> however i put it to the noble viscount that the big difference between today and even to which the noble lord lord northfield keeps referring and much more when the act was brought in is that the price of deer has risen from a stag to anything up to a stag and that makes it a very different operation <e>", "<cs> we have had a good short debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie said that i had referred to this as a sport <e> <s> i did but immediately corrected myself and said that of course it is not a sport <e> <s> the point about my feeling so strongly is quite simply this <e> <s> in we had a considerable problem in getting the best consensus view <e> <s> we took it through the house of commons and had many excellent debates on the floor and in committee <e> <s> finally we produced the bill not perfect in its way <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that in a free society it is probably undesirable for a government to control advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind what my noble kinsman said in his supplementary that there has been a very large diminution in pilfering <e> <s> would he at least encourage the trade unions when they come back and do some work to follow the very good example of the volunteers <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that although i very much agree with what he is doing it needs a little care <e> <s> perhaps he will remember the gilbert and sullivan tag <e>", "<cs> my lords at this rather late hour it is extremely difficult to think of anything new or original with which to entertain your lordships if that is the right phrase <e> <s> i have to declare an interest <e> <s> i like my father and grandfather before me have been an underwriting name at lloyds <e> <s> i was brought up in the tradition of respect to what lloyds was doing for the nation and the country and in a sort of small way felt rather proud of being able to contribute at least my name and a little cash from time to time towards it <e> <s> my respect for lloyds i may say was often increased in the years when it made losses because it seemed to me it was the sort of operation which was able to meet overseas competition and overseas disasters quickly efficiently and as far as i could see with the minimum of loss passed on to the names and get back quickly on to profits soon afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend study the question of agricultural exports <e> <s> having had a great deal of experience in foreign posts may i say that this was the one failure in a good many of <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree while it is nearly years since we were at war or in some state rather like it that perhaps it is unfair both to himself and to his right honourable friend if this house while it enjoys the opportunity of having immediate contact with the ministers concerned does not impose on itself a self-denying ordinance by letting the ministers get on with their jobs and not expecting them to make statements to this house on every possible occasion <e> <s> would my noble friend perhaps also agree that there is a risk and i have seen it twice already today and i am not going to go further of his giving some operational information away which could be very damaging to our interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that slightly curious reply may i ask whether he agrees that it is not altogether fair when the scottish workforce has taken a number of years to come away from the reputation of the red clydeside to being the favourite investment point for almost all american industry in europe <e> <s> in those circumstances is it not rather unfair for the church of scotland at this moment to suggest that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to all three points and i agree in large measure with much of what has been said <e> <s> i agree that the proposed new clause is not a step towards a police state but it might very well be a step towards increasing greatly the number of people employed by the inland revenue <e> <s> if one gets this information and then has to sort out exactly what is wanted by a local authority on any particular point one just cannot hand over the file because that would completely vitiate what both the noble lord lord houghton and the noble lord on the liberal benches said <e> <s> therefore the proposal would inevitably mean a good deal more expense <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend also perhaps persuade the board of trade that in regard to agricultural exports we fall very far behind almost all of our european competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was put down to her majestys government <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench is always most courteous and keen to help the house but does the fact that he is unable to give any answers for scotland and wales suggest that my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for scotland and wales have left the government <e>", "<cs> my lords how do i do that <e> <s> because i have to put a question to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend when he is answering these points could tell me what it means when it says <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree as he has the good fortune to come from a better country than england that if you have to drink whisky in this country you can hardly see it at the bottom of a glass <e> <s> will he not agree that if we are talking about drinking high quality wines they are not drunk by the glass they are drunk by the bottle the magnum or the jeroboam <e> <s> we are talking about reasonable wine at a sensible price in a sensible measure a known measure <e>", "<cs> may i make one or two comments about clause standing part <e> <s> i have as some of your lordships know spoken on these problems at our second reading debate <e> <s> as i have studied it more carefully i find myself even more unhappy about some parts of it than i was at second reading <e> <s> the point that i find particularly difficult is that in signing these new conventions each country is allowed to make what reservations it feels likely and appropriate <e> <s> as i said on second reading the bill is unbelievably complicated and i am assured by my legal friends that the complication is owing largely to the extreme complexity of the treaties on which it is based <e> <s> when one is dealing with a very large number of some not too literate countries there will be many who do not understand what they have agreed to do and many who will be determined deliberately not to understand it so there will be a good deal of cheating <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind following the question from the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that in my part of the west of scotland per cent <e> <s> of the tourists come from the south by car and that the biggest disincentive is not interest rates but the price of petrol which is almost entirely under the control of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that having been on both sides of these debates the government side and the fishing side i think that the fact that all the fishermen have now agreed is a very clear sign that the negotiations have been successful <e> <s> the fishermen are not slow in saying quite firmly when they do not like something exactly what it is that they do not like <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend bear in mind that many of us on this side of the house are not particularly keen on apartheid but we detest the system of russian penetration through the cuban troops <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that out of my limited experience having spent a number of years in iran trying to promote agriculture there every single person with whom i dealt minister civil servant or others has been murdered <e> <s> will he please encourage the government to avoid sending anybody back who is in that danger <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that we all appreciate what he says about the security of this report <e> <s> does he not remember that in the old days there was a mr chapman pincher who had a direct line to the ministry of defence <e> <s> this now seems to have spread to every single ministry <e> <s> he may remember but i cannot one single report that has not been leaked to the press in some form or another in the past year or two <e> <s> it really is an insult to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that it is a matter not just of clothing or headlights it is the appalling nature of motor cycle riding such as that seen in london which is the cause of so many accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords like so many others i should like to congratulate my noble friend and his colleagues for a successful end to a very long negotiation <e> <s> it is true that we have got effective conservation within europe and agreement within the european countries but i should like to ask my noble friend whether in view of what he was saying just a minute ago he is convinced that we have the same sort of effective action within our own waters <e> <s> my noble friend lord stodart mentioned the damage that has been done by pair trawling and seine netting to stocks of fish all round the european coasts <e> <s> i yield to nobody not even to the noble lord lord boothby in admiration for his own inshore fishermen but when they come to the clyde and the minch and clear out all our herring then i am not quite so sure that i am keen on them <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will impress upon his colleagues the importance of conserving our own fish stocks as well as those of europe as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend suggesting that if a double decker bus was involved in an accident all the passengers should have their blood tested <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend bear in mind that the family of my noble kinsman who asked the question and my own family live in the same part of the world where the situation has been getting steadily worse with no easy solution <e> <s> would he agree that the only thing that would help would be for any government to stop putting up the price of petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend lady young remind the house that the highlands of scotland are extremely vulnerable because almost all of the polaris submarine bases are there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just a few words to the debate <e> <s> first i wish to express the hope that my noble friend will not follow the advice of the noble lord lord ross of marnock and get the secretary of state involved in anything except i would agree in the minor changes of names <e> <s> i say that because the one thing of which people in the country can become only too well aware is any attempt by parties of either side to gerrymander the results of the boundary commissions independent report <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have not been to the falkland islands will my noble friend agree that acres is likely to be quite useless to anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend remember that there are many areas in scotland and not only islay which depend very largely on the whisky industry and they are all in rather difficult rural areas <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that the only hope of developing many of the highland areas is the low price of petrol which is a fact which one of his noble colleagues did not seem to know about last week but it is true <e> <s> the distances in these areas are enormous and this budget has hit both whisky and petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords i use this route two or three time every day <e> <s> is my noble friend suggesting that what motorists have to do to improve it is to avoid it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that i think his ideas on cable television are very good <e> <s> will he also accept that before the debate takes place someone on the government benches should be prepared to explain why it is that all these new channels such as channel are splendid for people who live in towns but are absolutely useless to a comparatively small number of the population who have great difficulty in getting television at all <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend cast his mind back a few years to when he was at school and agree with me that hours a week spent in the classroom is remarkably little <e> <s> we have benefited enormously by the fact that my noble friend spent a great deal longer than that in the classroom <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend thinks that thickness is something that appeals to the government can he tell us why the thin and extremely dirty existing pound notes which are obviously preferred to the new coins because there are hundreds of thousands of them should not be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend thank his right honourable and honourable friends for the efforts they have so far successfully made <e> <s> will he ask them to bear in mind that it is not only the lack of herring which most of us feel rather strongly about but also the lack of a great deal of employment opportunities which have been created in aberdeen peterhead and fraserburgh to process the herring and give employment and pleasure to the people who work and to people who eat the herring <e> <s> would my noble friend ask his right honourable and honourable friends to do everything they can within reason to frustrate the danes who have already tried to ruin salmon fishing <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend seen an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not perhaps agree with me that one of the reasons why there have not been so many sales in scotland is because in some areas the houses are grossly subsidised from the rates which makes it much more attractive to be a tenant that an owner <e>", "<cs> my lords may i give my noble friend my congratulations on his good fortune in not being there at the time <e> <s> when the appropriate committee has made its recommendations will he ask <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend <e> <s> if i heard him aright explain to me how per cent <e> <s> of the market is not a monopoly <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill talked about the edwards committee <e> <s> it fell to my lot to have to bring about what edwards recommended at that time <e> <s> the main opposition came from british airways and from the noble lord lord beswick because british airways had a total monopoly and the committee was taking away that monopoly by giving it to british caledonian <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not realise that the government give the caa instructions in these matters <e>", "<cs> i understand that they do my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree with me that a statement which is as important and complicated as the one he has made and which some of us have not had the privilege of reading beforehand is difficult to understand at one go <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is certain that supporting the service industries which is something with which i very much agree will not to some extent conflict with the problem of getting enough jobs in many of these areas on the map <e> <s> is not one of the problems the fact that one does not want to back failure <e> <s> on the other hand the service industries which have been the great success of the last ten years have employed mainly women <e>", "<cs> i have a certain amount of sympathy for the mover of the amendment and for the way in which he moved it <e> <s> i shall listen carefully to what my noble friend has to say but my worry is how to get this off the ground and functioning <e> <s> one knows that if one tries to achieve the type of body which i believe he wants to set up consisting of six seven nine or more very distinguished people whom the minister has to consult only when he wants to do so and to whose advice he does not have to pay any attention it may well be that after months or so they will all resign because they find the occupation not very well worth while <e> <s> having thought about the amendment my only consolation is that these people will have the power to publish at fairly regular intervals the advice they have given and whether or not the minister has <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that the money expended on the burrell collection has been long overdue and is very worthwhile indeed <e> <s> my only regret having been able to see it for the first time is that it is for free whereas a small charge would be easily acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me whether this type of disease is common in europe at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind what my noble friend lord kilmany has said as i understood it the main thrust of the statement was as regards the air force <e> <s> i am quite certain that my noble friend the minister will agree that the scottish contribution to the territorial army has been much greater than that in the past and i hope that not only will the suggestions of my noble friend lord kilmany be accepted but that there may be other efforts that the scottish may make in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that while he says that the cost is not important there have been cases where considerable sums of money have been spent for people not to do things which were in fact impossible to do and they have had that information before they claimed the cost <e>"]
