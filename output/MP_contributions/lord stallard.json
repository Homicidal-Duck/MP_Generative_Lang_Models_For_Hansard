["<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that his reply to the noble baroness lady wootton will cause a great deal of concern among those people who are being disenfranchised or who will be if the glc and other metropolitan county authorities are abolished <e> <s> he seemed to be saying that in future a code of guidance will be sufficient or will provide a sufficient accountability for the new quangos that are to be set up in future in place of the democratically-elected bodies that we now have <e> <s> could he enlarge on that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept and i am sure he will the difficulty in digesting such a long and important statement particularly for those on the back benches who have not seen a copy of it beforehand <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will bear with me if i ask one or two questions which i have jotted down <e> <s> he has already touched on what i believe he called the substantial or comprehensive review of the beveridge report <e> <s> in view of the fact that this substantial inquiry into beveridge seems to be taking the form of five separate inquiries each one of which as far as i can see would merit some kind of input from thetreasury can the noble lord say how that input will be put into the five separate inquiries and how they will be brought together to make some sensible comprehensive review of the beveridge report which we would all welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the bill and i hope that the house will pass it in its present form <e> <s> i say that with some temerity because i accept the sincerity of the arguments to which i have listened throughout the proceedings on the bill <e> <s> i have the greatest respect and admiration for all those who have worked and who still work in the field of disablement <e> <s> i shall not repeat what i said at the second reading when in my support for the bill i drew on my -odd years experience of helping and working in the field of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i apologise to the noble baroness if she thinks that i got her wrong <e> <s> i was saying that employers and others who want to slide out of a commitment or a possible commitment to a disabled person still use in spite of improvements in legislation and codes of guidance access problems to get out of this position <e> <s> we know of many examples <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to take up the time of the house <e> <s> i gave instances on second reading and repeated or implied again tonight that i did not want to appear churlish because i am only too well aware from sitting with employers and voluntary organisations of the many examples that exist of conscientious and progressive employers who take the attitude outlined by the noble baroness <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> however it is not enough <e> <s> there are the others <e> <s> i gave statistics on second reading of the many thousands of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply although i am not entirely satisfied at the progress that has been made <e> <s> is she aware that those pensioners referred to in my question all of whom have qualified in the normal way for a united kingdom retirement pension will not understand why we have not been able to make more progress in reaching a reciprocal agreement with canada when we have been able to make agreements with other countries including non-commonwealth countries like austria bermuda the united states of america turkey and yugoslavia to name a few and commonwealth countries like cyprus malaysia malta and jamaica <e> <s> why do we appear to be discrim-inating against our kith and kin in canada in this dilatory approach to reaching a reciprocal agreement with the canadian government which has expressed willingness on a number of occasions to reach such an agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and for telling us of the information that he has received and is considering from the national right to fuel campaign <e> <s> is he aware that the poorest pensioners in our society that is those on incomes of less than per week spend a greater proportion of their income on fuel than the rest of us <e> <s> i think the figure is per cent <e> <s> as opposed to per cent <e> <s> or less for those in the more wealthy groups <e> <s> will the noble earl assure us that the informa-tion on the cost of warmth index that he has just mentioned from the national right to fuel campaign will be fed to his right honourable friend in another place during the consideration of the social security system so that the problems of fuel poverty can be given urgent consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister confirm the figures that i have received in written answers that the cuts in housing benefit announced last week will reduce the income of pensioners and about million other households that pensioners will lose more than a week that pensioners will lose more than a week and that pensioners will lose more than a week <e> <s> does the minister accept the views of the
