["<cs> my lords in rising to make my maiden speech in this house i find it difficult to define in precise terms exactly how i feel at this moment <e> <s> suffice it to say that if i knew what the term was roughly translated it would mean extremely nervous <e> <s> i am also very much aware of the established conventions on these occasions <e> <s> i respect those conventions and it is not my intention to offend them in any way <e> <s> having said that however i recognise the task that i have set myself by choosing to make a speech on the second reading of this bill <e> <s> so i hope that if i stray a little from my good intentions the house will forgive me and noble lords will continue to show me the same friendliness and courtesy i have experienced and appreciated since becoming a member nearly two weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that much of the confusion has arisen because the implementation of the supplementary benefit regulations and the changes to the heating additions made in the supplementary benefit regulations were introduced at the same time as the partial operation of the housing benefit scheme <e> <s> this has caused a great deal of confusion <e> <s> is he aware that that confusion has been made worse because many local authorities up and down the country put different interpretations on the regulations depending on their particular policy arrangements <e> <s> is he further aware that this has meant that many elderly people have lost heating additions of up to per week in some areas <e> <s> does he agree with me that the time is now right for the introduction of a comprehensive fuel strategy covering all fuels and all aspects including insulation and conservation and with a mind to the ever-increasing punitive burden of standing charges on elderly people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the noble lord back to the point that i raised in my first question about the different interpretations being put on these regulations by local authorities throughout the country <e> <s> may i ask him to reconsider sending out some notes of guidance for clarification to local authorities and publishing the information more widely than it is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl when he expects that her majestys government will be able to report on the latest report of hm inspectors on education <e> <s> also can he comment on some rumours that that report is being withheld because of its very favourable replies to some questions on comprehensive schools <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i should like to begin by congratulating the main sponsors of both these bills <e> <s> first i want to congratulate them on giving us the opportunity to discuss this important subject this morning and on the way in which both the main speakers introduced this very delicate and sensitive subject <e> <s> i should also like to add <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house what consultation the government have had with the tuc to advise employees of their entitlement <e> <s> what redress is there for an employee who thinks he has been underpaid <e>", "<cs> my lords what redress is there for an employee who considers he has been underpaid <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord cledwyn for giving us the opportunity to discuss this crucial and urgent matter <e> <s> crucial because our domestic business and commercial interests demand an efficient infrastructure for those who live and work in it and urgent because of discussions now taking place about the proposals to restructure local government and to centralise more and more of its traditional functions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that the consultative process he mentioned failed miserably and for four reasons <e> <s> first the low cost basis of the proposals pre-empted any real consultation process secondly the proposals would have disqualified national insurance contributors from an entitlement thirdly the benefit would have been insufficient to help those who would have qualified and fourthly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that fourthly it would not have been readily available to those who needed it most <e> <s> would he not now accept that the government and his right honourable friend the secretary of state ought to be discussing with the dignity in death alliance their very simple alternative proposal that the death grant should be up-rated in line with inflation and should be index-linked non-means tested and available to everyone including children and elderly people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i bring the noble lord back to his reply to the noble lord who asked the question about the abolition of the glc <e> <s> the noble lords reply sounded rather complacent to me when i understand that if the glc is abolished the biggest problem for the inspection of these unlicensed and licensed premises will be in inner london <e> <s> is the noble lord sure that sufficient provision will be made for the continued inspection of those premises <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that the standard of houses in multiple occupation certainly in inner city areas continues to deteriorate due to a lack of resources available to local authorities while the numbers and the needs of people who require such accommodation increase <e> <s> will the noble lord try to persuade his right honourable friend the secretary of state to look at two simple proposals which were in the bill referred to by my noble friend <e> <s> the first is the need for local authorities to inspect on a two-year cycle all houses in multiple occupation in their areas <e> <s> the second proposal is the need for a more simplified procedure of enforcement on landlords and others who do not keep up standards <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that his statement this afternoon will have done little to alleviate the fears of people up and down the country who know that this benefit scheme is in total chaos <e> <s> many town halls are struggling with reduced resources and reduced staff to come to terms with the original proposals <e> <s> we have now had this new package welcome though it may be and i understood from local authorities and the computer people who advise them that it was going to be impossible to implement the original proposals by this april <e> <s> therefore any further changes like this will only help to emphasise what we all said at the beginning that the scheme was ill thought-out from the start <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lord mulley on his maiden speech this afternoon <e> <s> i agree with almost everything he said <e> <s> i certainly know of his interest in this subject i certainly know of the tremendous record which sheffield has in the field of housing and of the homeless generally and i endorse everything that my noble friend said about that city <e> <s> i should like to say how grateful i am to the noble baroness for giving us the opportunity today to discuss this crucial matter <e> <s> the problems of homelessness as has been said have been with us for many years <e> <s> as chairman of the all-party group of char that is the campaign for the homeless and rootless for many years i have participated in a number of debates in the other place and have raised this question on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall the many speeches made by government spokesmen in the other place linking the rate of inflation to the rate of unemployment and saying that if inflation came down unemployment would also come down <e> <s> as inflation has come down but unemployment has gone up is there another explanation <e>", "<cs> i shall be exceedingly brief if only to support what my noble friend said about education and legislation <e> <s> this is not a bill about whether it should be education or legislation <e> <s> it is not one or the other <e> <s> my noble friend put that adequately and clearly <e> <s> the legislation is part of the educative process and the measures contained in this bill must be seen as part of that process <e> <s> all of us engaged in this debate will be against discrimination and as my noble friend rightly says that is what the bill is about <e> <s> all my adult life i have been involved with the educative process on the question of disablement and mental health <e> <s> there is now a need for legislation to support that educative process not to combat it <e> <s> both must go together <e> <s> we must have legislation if we are to make the educative process mean what it ought to mean <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that his reply to the noble baroness lady wootton will cause a great deal of concern among those people who are being disenfranchised or who will be if the glc and other metropolitan county authorities are abolished <e> <s> he seemed to be saying that in future a code of guidance will be sufficient or will provide a sufficient accountability for the new quangos that are to be set up in future in place of the democratically-elected bodies that we now have <e> <s> could he enlarge on that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept and i am sure he will the difficulty in digesting such a long and important statement particularly for those on the back benches who have not seen a copy of it beforehand <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will bear with me if i ask one or two questions which i have jotted down <e> <s> he has already touched on what i believe he called the substantial or comprehensive review of the beveridge report <e> <s> in view of the fact that this substantial inquiry into beveridge seems to be taking the form of five separate inquiries each one of which as far as i can see would merit some kind of input from thetreasury can the noble lord say how that input will be put into the five separate inquiries and how they will be brought together to make some sensible comprehensive review of the beveridge report which we would all welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the bill and i hope that the house will pass it in its present form <e> <s> i say that with some temerity because i accept the sincerity of the arguments to which i have listened throughout the proceedings on the bill <e> <s> i have the greatest respect and admiration for all those who have worked and who still work in the field of disablement <e> <s> i shall not repeat what i said at the second reading when in my support for the bill i drew on my -odd years experience of helping and working in the field of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i apologise to the noble baroness if she thinks that i got her wrong <e> <s> i was saying that employers and others who want to slide out of a commitment or a possible commitment to a disabled person still use in spite of improvements in legislation and codes of guidance access problems to get out of this position <e> <s> we know of many examples <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to take up the time of the house <e> <s> i gave instances on second reading and repeated or implied again tonight that i did not want to appear churlish because i am only too well aware from sitting with employers and voluntary organisations of the many examples that exist of conscientious and progressive employers who take the attitude outlined by the noble baroness <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> however it is not enough <e> <s> there are the others <e> <s> i gave statistics on second reading of the many thousands of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply although i am not entirely satisfied at the progress that has been made <e> <s> is she aware that those pensioners referred to in my question all of whom have qualified in the normal way for a united kingdom retirement pension will not understand why we have not been able to make more progress in reaching a reciprocal agreement with canada when we have been able to make agreements with other countries including non-commonwealth countries like austria bermuda the united states of america turkey and yugoslavia to name a few and commonwealth countries like cyprus malaysia malta and jamaica <e> <s> why do we appear to be discrim-inating against our kith and kin in canada in this dilatory approach to reaching a reciprocal agreement with the canadian government which has expressed willingness on a number of occasions to reach such an agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and for telling us of the information that he has received and is considering from the national right to fuel campaign <e> <s> is he aware that the poorest pensioners in our society that is those on incomes of less than per week spend a greater proportion of their income on fuel than the rest of us <e> <s> i think the figure is per cent <e> <s> as opposed to per cent <e> <s> or less for those in the more wealthy groups <e> <s> will the noble earl assure us that the informa-tion on the cost of warmth index that he has just mentioned from the national right to fuel campaign will be fed to his right honourable friend in another place during the consideration of the social security system so that the problems of fuel poverty can be given urgent consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister confirm the figures that i have received in written answers that the cuts in housing benefit announced last week will reduce the income of pensioners and about million other households that pensioners will lose more than a week that pensioners will lose more than a week and that pensioners will lose more than a week <e> <s> does the minister accept the views of the national association of citizens advice bureaux who have said that the scheme is inequitable and unworkable and that they reach this conclusion after long and careful study of over cases <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount accept that the per cent <e> <s> quota has been the subject of discussion ever since when it was first <e>", "<cs> i too want to support the amendment <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to the discussion as i listened to the previous debates on this issue <e> <s> i started by listening to both second reading debates here and in another place and i read many papers about the issue <e> <s> i began to get the impression that it would have been far better had the bill been referred to a select committee at that stage and not steamrollered through the whole procedure <e> <s> i have been strengthened in that view by the discussions that i have heard today <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with the views put forward by the noble lord lord sandford and some time ago i would not have dreamt that this would be the case that in the recent discussions that have taken place and in the recent papers that have been produced by all kinds of academic and parliamentary sources a number of constructive proposals have emerged about how the rating system could be improved <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would clear up a point for me <e> <s> i am becoming a little confused about the way in which the discussion is going on <e> <s> i understood maybe wrongly that the initial report would be presented to the house <e> <s> following that there would be discussions between the secretary of state the local authorities and so on and the reports would flow from those discussions <e> <s> they would be the subject for debate <e> <s> i am under the impression that the initial report will not be the subject of any debate at all in either house <e> <s> that is not debatable <e> <s> what will be debatable is the result of the discussions <e> <s> somebody will say that there is no point in having a debate until after the discussions have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give us any information about how many new pits have been opened in the period covered by the question <e>", "<cs> i will not detain the committee for too long but i move to support my noble friend lord wells-pestell when in reply to lord marsh he mentions information and advice <e> <s> while the noble lord lord marsh was speaking i was thinking about the excellent work carried on by an organisation like age concern who have produced a first-class pamphlet of information that lists all the available services or most of them to pensioners <e> <s> i was thinking of the excellent publication by the national federation of old-aged pensioners which does something similar but goes even further the specialist booklets and leaflets published by the organisations for the deaf for the blind for epileptics and a whole long list that would take another half an hour to mention who are not covered by anybody else other than the voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply and for his offer to discuss it <e> <s> i will certainly consider taking up that offer <e> <s> meantime i do not think that he has gone as far as i should have liked him to go <e>", "<cs> may i delay the committee for a few seconds longer <e> <s> i had not intended to speak until the noble baroness lady gardner said her piece <e> <s> it is true that i have not had any letters from any ratepayers saying please put my rates up <e> <s> but i have had many scores of letters and i dare say that most people active in local government as well as in national government have asking us to save them from the <e>", "<cs> it is not my intention to get involved in an argument between the noble baroness and the director general of the glc <e> <s> i am sure that he will be able to reply and stand up for himself as he has done in the case of this letter <e> <s> i thought he was perfectly reasonable in taking two paragraphs that were relevant to his arguments directly from <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i should like to ask him if he has had a chance to read the <e>", "<cs> my lords can i bring the minister back to the earnings rule <e> <s> why have his government failed to keep that earnings rule increased in line with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> does she recall that last week we were told that the death grant if it were increased in line with inflation would be instead of <e> <s> we know from a previous reply that the changes in the age allowance meant that a married couple lost a year in income tax <e> <s> from a reply given yesterday i learnt that the earnings limit to keep in line with inflation should now be instead of <e> <s> now the noble baroness tells me that the pension itself should be instead of <e> <s> does it not almost amount to a vendetta against the elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept the conclusions reached by both the social security advisory committee and the government actuary that unless pensioners receive an increase above the rate of inflation they will start to lag behind the rest of the population <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that that figure is quite unacceptable in these days when people are living at the standards at which they are living <e> <s> does he also agree with me that more information could be readily available to improve the situation <e> <s> for example the information contained in the pensioners payment book could be improved simplified and certainly written in larger print <e> <s> does the minister further agree that more interviewing visits could and should be made to pensioners who are old who are less mobile and who live in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak on the second reading of this bill and as was said by the minister in opening the debate i am aware that this is the latest in a long series of social security bills put forward by the present administration since the election <e> <s> what the noble lord did not say was that all those bills have had one thing in common which has been openly admitted by the government namely they have all been aimed at reducing the cost of the social and welfare benefits available to people in this country <e> <s> this has been openly stated in committee and i have had the privilege of sitting on a number of standing committees in the other place where in reply to debates on various amendments ministers have regularly said that the main purpose of this or that specific measure has been that it is a nil-cost provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that before the end of the committee procedure i shall be able to give the noble lord the minister lots of answers to that <e> <s> for the time being i shall not go too deeply into the history but i can assure the noble lord that the exact words nil-cost provision have figured in many ministerial replies from that side of the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his lengthy reply <e> <s> i must confess that i am not convinced that his replies meet the up-to-date situation as we know it in local authorities at this moment <e> <s> in boroughs like my own certainly in camden and many other inner london boroughs many properties fall into the category that i described <e> <s> they have not been reassessed or revalued for many years <e> <s> if they were revalued in the way that i have suggested they could be covered by the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down can he confirm which amendments we are now discussing <e> <s> i did not quite catch the list of amendments that he read out at the beginning of his remarks <e>", "<cs> may i say that i am not too happy about this procedure <e> <s> sitting behind on these benches i am a wee bit worried about whether this normal channels procedure is now taking place across the front benches rather than in the open <e> <s> if this kind of procedure is going to take the place of detailed discussion of bills i would be very concerned <e>", "<cs> i accept what my noble friend says and he has assured me part of the way <e> <s> i should certainly not like the discussion that ought to take place in public to be superseded by special meetings between members on various points <e> <s> although such meetings are useful as well there should still be the public discussion <e>", "<cs> i apologise i meant amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it raises a detailed and a precise point <e> <s> i am suggesting that the age should be raised from to for all <e> <s> this would cover all people affected by the bill <e> <s> i am not saying that it is the ultimate but that is what i am moving <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble minister for his reply <e> <s> he tempts me to go into another long speech about age and the major concession he mentions but i shall retain that for report stage <e> <s> i was a bit disappointed that he did not take the point about the disabled and that they go on longer before they get to the same point as others <e> <s> nor did he seem to be seized of the point about disincentive raised by the noble lord <e> <s> lord henderson <e> <s> as the noble lord mentioned youngsters can now go into the youth training scheme when they are and they stay for months <e> <s> the fact that this cut-off is where it is will be a disincentive so the sda provisions will be a disincentive to that kind of thing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i do not agree with all that he has said <e> <s> time is against me otherwise i should like to go into this discussion about million <e> <s> i could make many suggestions as to where we could save perhaps far more than that <e> <s> it would not be very difficult to think of some examples <e> <s> i stick to my view <e> <s> i rather think that this scheme admirable as it may be in parts was <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that any assistance is welcome but knowing how he likes to be fair and not selective may i remind him of how his government have deliberately increased fuel costs in the same period by the continued imposition of the fuel tax <e> <s> is he further aware that according to a report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very disappointing reply from the noble baroness <e> <s> with all due respect <e> <s> does she really understand the enormity of the problems that face these rd and th division clubs in the circumstances described <e> <s> has she ever in fact been to a football match and does she understand the game <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord wells-pestell for initiating this debate <e> <s> i have always known my noble friend to be a man of deep compassion and understanding and i think that the speech with which he introduced the debate today underlined certainly for me those qualities <e> <s> i should like to thank also my noble friend lord barnett for dealing in the main with the speech made by the noble lord lord cockfield from the government front bench because as i listened to that speech from the noble lord i was tempted to interrupt almost every few seconds and i thought that i may have to scrap my few comments and deal with some of the points that were raised by him in his outline of government policy and government thinking on these things <e> <s> but my noble friend i think dealt quite adequately with those points and i can now revert to what the noble lord lord cockfield scornfully referred to as the symptoms and i can do that now with a slightly easier conscience <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to go down that road and take this up with the noble lord but i do not accept his explanation <e> <s> whoever said it i believe my noble friend and i think the quotation as i read it is probably under the interesting title down with the poor which could be related to george bernard shaw rather than quotation <e> <s> but if he did say it he is still wrong as far as i am concerned <e> <s> if that is being repeated by the present minister of state for social services it is disgraceful that he went to that kind of source or quotation to use against people in these circumstances <e> <s> so i have no conscience whoever said it about saying that it is entirely wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to refer to the debate so far <e> <s> i should like just to say that although very few noble lords have spoken it does not necessarily mean that the house does not think that this is an important bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord sandford who has just spoken outlined that this is an important bill <e> <s> i take the view that the fact that the government have decided to slot it in albeit on a special day as far as this house is concerned underlines the importance that the government attach to this particular measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that further research is already taking place into <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not know the answer to that <e> <s> i am not too sure whether that is in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped from the excellent and constructive suggestions that have been forthcoming in the course of this short debate that the minister would have felt able to move in the direction of either one of them either the or the excellent suggestion put forward by the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> there was an absence of that kind of commitment from the minister <e> <s> in fact he almost wrapped up all of his reasons in the same old phrase that we get all the time the cost <e> <s> i was waiting for this the inevitable reason for the rejection of all the amendments that the cost is too high <e> <s> this is one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i delay the house for a few seconds <e> <s> i too should like to thank the noble lords who have been responsible for the passage of this bill so far through the house for the courtesy and gracious manner in which they have dealt with the various amendments that i and others have tried to have passed <e> <s> i also agree with those noble lords who have described the bill as a ragbag <e> <s> it is a ragbag and that is a reasonable thing to call it <e> <s> it was at least two separate bills if not more <e> <s> we were all sad that the government felt it necessary to roll them all into this one omnibus measure <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for his last statement <e> <s> until then i thought i had opened the committee proceedings on a reasonable note by saying that i thought i understood the governments thinking <e> <s> i obviously did not <e> <s> i had hoped i understood any reasonable governments thinking <e> <s> if they were saying the defects would not appear for or years why then erect a panic situation where people will be demanding their compensation long in advance perhaps of its being necessary <e> <s> would it not have been far more sensible had the government been thinking as i anticipated or accused them of <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord the minister and my noble friend have said <e> <s> we are at cross-purposes <e> <s> my amendment seeks <e>", "<cs> i am again grateful to the noble lord for his reply and i am glad to hear that this matter is being taken forward <e> <s> however i was a little worried by his remark that there may well be another or more types if necessary <e> <s> he said that it might be necessary to designate another types <e>", "<cs> that makes it worse <e> <s> the figure could be anything up to types or types necessary to be designated <e> <s> when the noble lord uses the words if necessary i assume that they mean if the treasury agrees <e> <s> in the previous amendment the noble lord seemed to pour cold water on the consultative process with local authorities and to reserve the right for simply the secretary of state and no doubt the treasury to deal with the question of further designations <e>", "<cs> i too am grateful for what the minister has said and for the remarks of the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> i can assure him that we are very conscious of the need to maintain this balance <e> <s> as my noble friend lord graham has pointed <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the minister <e> <s> we have repeated in a number of the amendments the question of the hip allocations <e> <s> i do not doubt that we shall return to that at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> i think that it represents one of the two most controversial elements the discriminatory nature and partiality of the bill and the lack of adequate resources <e> <s> the noble viscount lord hanworth underlined that fact perfectly well <e> <s> the government seem intent on introducing new measures at a time when local authorities are probably suffering the most stringent financial controls that they have ever suffered <e> <s> we have listed the restrictions cuts and restraints on local authority expenditure <e> <s> as i have said i have no doubt that we shall return to this issue at later stages of the bill <e> <s> for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly had no intention of sniping <e> <s> that is not our intention but i take the point the minister makes <e> <s> in the amendment that i shall be moving in a few seconds time the motive will perhaps be clearer <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> when he says that these will be exceedingly rare circumstances and therefore for that reason he cannot accept the amendment i would have thought that if they are to be that rare he could equally accept it <e> <s> i am prepared to read what he says and take advice on it because he has covered different ground <e> <s> perhaps we shall then come back to the matter at the next stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that explanation <e> <s> he will not be surprised if i say that i expected him to say that <e> <s> i daresay that all noble lords present will have understood completely and totally the burden of his reply <e> <s> certainly we will read with great care what the minister has said and no doubt as he will accept we will return to this at later stages of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first of all apologise for the absence of my noble friend lord dean who was called out of the chamber before he was able to hear the ministers full reply <e> <s> but as the noble lord the minister rightly says the noble lord was right in his survey of the problem <e> <s> he used leeds as an example and it was a perfectly good example to use because as i understand from the departments own figures of prefabricated reinforced concrete houses built during the s and s leeds still has in local authority ownership <e> <s> as my noble friend said are privately owned and those concern the people who will benefit from this bill and the concern those whom we have been trying to bring to the attention of the minister <e> <s> multiplied throughout the country that will be the size of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that those of us who are involved with the problems at the sharp end of this dispute i am particularly concerned about the effects on united kingdom pensioners living overseas who are suffering real hardship share his concern but do not share his complacency <e> <s> nor do we share the premise outlined in the question <e> <s> the questioner may i say with due respect does not appear to understand the situation <e> <s> it is not the case that those on strike will not do the work for which they are paid <e> <s> that is a gross oversimplification <e> <s> they are being asked to do extra work to accept different shifts and a different rota and to accept a number of other changes not included in the question <e> <s> will the minister take on board please the suggestion of my noble friend lady jeger that acas should be called in immediately to bring the two parties together to find an acceptable solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that in a few days time many thousands of british pensioners living in countries such as america spain turkey bermuda and many other countries throughout the world will receive the new amount of while many united kingdom pensioners living in canada after fulfilling the same qualifying criteria still receive no more than a week <e> <s> will the noble lord therefore accept that there is some urgency in the matter if we are to deal with this injustice <e> <s> is he in a position to give us some more definite timescale as to when the matter is likely to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord further on the financial arrangements <e> <s> is it not possible in considering draft proposals to discuss some phasing in of the increases in order to reduce the immediate financial implications <e>", "<cs> my lords having sat through almost all the debate this afternoon and this evening i am tempted to begin by responding or replying to some of the remarks that have been made by other speakers <e> <s> however since i am speakers from the beginning though i would only spend a few seconds on each it would probably take some time and far longer than i intend to spare from my own remarks <e> <s> of course it would also be totally unproductive <e> <s> so i will resist the temptation except that i think i must at least say one word in defence of those of us who have been criticised for defending london <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly give way in a second as the noble lord himself said when i have finished this sentence <e> <s> i shall defend the role and the need for voluntary organisations in much of our life today <e> <s> we owe them a great debt rather than besmirching all local organisations because there have perhaps been a few examples to which the noble lord has pointed <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that and that is the part that i shall probably have to come back to in later debates <e> <s> if the noble lord persists in his argument then i think i shall be able to reply in kind <e> <s> i believe that we are in danger here of destroying very many good things because as has been said we want to get rid of one or two things with which some people do not agree <e> <s> it is a danger of which we must all be aware and to which we must be alert <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount accept that i too in common with other noble lords welcome the dialogue that is taking place and that we understand will be taking place again in another few months <e> <s> can he tell me in relation to the intergovernmental council deliberations that are mentioned in the report apart from the issue of security which is important whether other matters of common concern between the united kingdom and the republic as well as northern ireland were discussed <e> <s> will the results be available in report form for members to read <e> <s> and can the noble viscount say whether the government will consider extending the membership of the intergovernmental council to include perhaps members of parliament and so widen the discussions <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble viscount to enlarge on part of the report <e> <s> i listened very carefully when he said that both the taoiseach and the prime minister agreed that the identities of the minority and majority communities and their aspirations should be recognised and reflected in structures of administration <e> <s> what does that mean in terms of the northern ireland administration <e> <s> are the government inferring that some form of power sharing is at the back of their mind and could that be a possibility in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join those noble lords who have congratulated the select committee on their report <e> <s> it has provided us with excellent material and has filled in some of the details we needed before we could discuss the matter any further <e> <s> my views differ from those of some noble lords who have already spoken but i respect the views of all who have so far taken part in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly how i read it although i did not snap out the words with the same emphasis as the noble lord put upon them <e> <s> but the meaning is the same <e> <s> the bbc could not justify televising the proceedings only of this house <e> <s> they say in paragraph that they need to televise the other place too <e> <s> we ought not to be in any doubt about that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may from here thank the noble lord for his statement this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point that the noble lord has mentioned i am still not satisfied that the minister has made out a case for freezing the limits and the payments on the basis of one or two abuses <e> <s> there is ample legislation and there are ample measures at the moment in existence to deal with those abuses <e> <s> it should not be said that the whole system has collapsed that everybody is on the fiddle and that they are all scroungers <e> <s> we know the people who are abusing the system and so does the minister <e> <s> we do not need this kind of approach <e> <s> we need an entirely different approach <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was as surprised as anyone when i read that local

involved in training all my working life first as an apprentice then as a craftsman training apprentices and finally as a technical training officer responsible for training technicians and craftsmen <e> <s> i am still a member of the institute of training and development so i have maintained an interest in the whole training field for a large number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the noble earl to say in reply to a question a few moments ago that he was delighted local authorities had been so successful in raising the amount of money they have and that it was because of that success that the government are taking the stance which they are taking <e> <s> is he saying in effect that we ought to be telling local authorities they have been too successful and that if they continue with that line of success they might lose even more than the billion <e> <s> that seems to be a very strange policy <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord orr-ewing i hope that i shall be forgiven if i do not spend too much time on the usual courtesies of the house except to say that i agree with the tributes already paid to the maiden speakers <e> <s> i should like to add my gratitude and congratulations to my noble friend lord beswick for giving us the opportunity to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble earl that his replies this afternoon will be of little comfort to the millions of unemployed out there who are worried about the possibility even in the remote future of finding work <e> <s> they will be of little comfort to the thousands of millions of home owners who are very concerned about the effects on their mortgages or to those people who are genuinely concerned as was the noble viscount who has just come back from america about the governments inability to settle the miners dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the governments fire statistics show that people living in houses of multiple occupation in the circumstances which have been mentioned face a risk of death eight times greater than those who live in normal circumstances <e> <s> does that not point to the need for some more urgency in dealing with this situation <e> <s> how can the government continue to maintain that local powers give people adequate safeguards when report after report into the tragic fires that have occurred in the last couple of years point to confusion irresponsibility uncertainty and very often the failure of local authorities to use their powers <e> <s> can the minister not inject some urgency into the actions of his friends elsewhere on the reviews <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to join in the congratulations to my noble friend lady jeger for giving us this opportunity to discuss these important health welfare and social services questions and to congratulate her on her opening remarks <e> <s> the motion before us refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i too apologise to the house for not having put my name on the list of speakers for similar reasons to the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> however having heard the speech of the noble lord who moved the motion i knew that i would be compelled to stay because of my lifelong interest in the problems of the disabled <e> <s> i shall not delay the house for more than a few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> will he concede that the vast majority of the submissions made came from voluntary organisations which are daily facing an uphill struggle against the ever increasing problems of our inner cities <e> <s> does he not think that the time has now arrived when we should drop these proposals await the outcome of the current social security reviews and then come forward with a much more sensible and long-term solution to the problems outlined in those representations <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord accept that the proposals as outlined will not deal with the abuse that he mentions <e> <s> indeed there are other regulations that can be easily amended to deal with that abuse <e> <s> does he not agree that what we really need is a broader long-term solution to the real problems and not this panic approach that the government seem to be adopting <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by supporting my noble friend lady jeger in welcoming the noble baroness lady trumpington to her new position <e> <s> i hope that she will bring to these massive problems a fresh mind and a caring approach that is sometimes no slur is meant against her immediate predecessor not evident in the documents that emerge from the department <e> <s> i have great hopes that this situation may now improve with the advent of the noble baroness <e> <s> i should also like to support those noble lords who have spoken so far <e> <s> it is quite unusual when one can agree with most of the sentiments expressed from whatever side of the house so early in the debate <e> <s> i hope that the significance of that is not lost on the noble baroness who has just taken over <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that rent and rates debts are not peculiar to that part of the united kingdom <e> <s> this piece of emergency legislation which was enacted originally to combat a particular emergency has been in operation for nine years following the end of the emergency for which it was designed <e> <s> is that not discrimination against a part of the united kingdom that would not be tolerated elsewhere <e> <s> will the noble lord also confirm that under this act child benefits can be reclaimed as part of the debt <e> <s> can he tell the house how much has been reclaimed from child benefits under this payments for debt act since <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back again but in the first part of my question i asked whether it was not a fact that under section of the original act at least that is my understanding this provision would only continue for six months after the emergency <e> <s> has that part of the act been repealed and if it has not when will it be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to be more specific on the alternative arrangements that are being made for women to be seen by women doctors <e> <s> does he recall that the principles were clearly accepted by his right honourable friend the prime minister in when we debated after many years the proposed closure of the elizabeth garrett anderson hospital which is now thankfully refurbished and flourishing <e> <s> will he be a little more specific about the alternative arrangements for women who desire to be treated by women doctors in the south london area <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lady fisher on providing this opportunity to discuss what i consider to be one of the most serious domestic problems facing our nation namely the increasing numbers of the homeless people of all ages single or married <e> <s> it is always a pleasure a daunting pleasure no doubt to follow the noble viscount lord buckmaster who never fails to stir certainly my conscience with his contributions <e> <s> i have heard him on a number of occasions in similar debates <e> <s> i am grateful too to my noble friend lord soper for filling in from his vast experience in this field some of the vital statistics that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords on both sides of the committee for their support of the amendments particularly the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> i admire the work that she has done in this field in london on the councils on which she has served <e> <s> but i was surprised and saddened when she said that she supported most of what we said but did not quite agree with the amendments and felt that they were not clear enough <e> <s> had she said that she would come forward with a clearer amendment of her own or help me to draft a better one if this one was not drafted properly i should have been only too happy <e> <s> it is disappointing if that is the only point of disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question of the noble lord lord ezra and the noble earls reply to it will the noble earl accept that there is a great deal of disquiet outside that these candidates as the noble earl refers to them are being fattened up prior to sale <e> <s> i give as an example the contract for ferrying troops backwards and forwards to the falkland islands which has been taken from the royal air force and given to british airways in a blatant attempt to fatten up british airways prior to privatisation <e> <s> will the noble earl explain <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to congratulate my noble friend lord fitt and thank him for placing this unstarred question on the order paper so that it can be discussed <e> <s> i certainly cannot claim to have the immediate contact that my noble friend has <e>", "<cs> i was almost tempted to apologise for intervening in this debate on the last day but i am going to resist the temptation because i believe that this debate is the most important that we have had for many sittings on this bill <e> <s> clause tucked away as it is under miscellaneous provisions in the minds of thousands of people deals with the most important and most sensitive area of the abolition of the glc in the whole bill <e> <s> i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls in some respects also with the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and certainly with the noble lord lord plummer who in a few minutes has given us much of the information that was necessary to understand what is happening in clause <e> <s> i think that he has taken a constructive and courageous stand throughout the bill in trying to put these issues in front of the government in order that they may be dealt with <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him this question <e> <s> is he aware that in his excellent analogy of the vehicle he dealt with most of the parts of the vehicle except the most essential part which is the engine <e> <s> the noble lord has totally underestimated the power that will be needed to propel this vehicle <e> <s> i do not say that he underestimated deliberately the functions of the glc in housing <e> <s> he certainly did not know about the role of the glc in homelessness <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first congratulate the noble baroness on what i consider to be her first major contribution on a bill from the dispatch box and on the way in which she cantered through this awful bill which is now before us <e> <s> in view of the statement on the future of the social security and welfare system generally which i had hoped would come before this debate started rather than in the middle of it and the discussion that will inevitably take place on that statement both here and in another place i have the impression that this debate and indeed this bill is a little unreal <e> <s> it seems a wee bit out of place that we should be discussing this in view of the awful things that are about to descend on us in relation to the whole scheme <e> <s> it is no surprise of course because i have been saying that on every social security debate here over the past few months and certainly since the reviews were announced <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as an ardent football supporter welcome the statement made by the government and the noble viscount this afternoon <e> <s> i thank the government and the football authorities concerned for the urgency which is being attached to the tragic circumstances which took place in brussels last week <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept that the availability or occupation of beds cannot be separated from the availability of doctors nurses ancillary staff and administrators in hospitals <e> <s> does she further accept that those people are not available to man and staff the beds that we need as a direct result of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the transport bill now before the house will exacerbate the position in central london and in other cities <e> <s> can he tell the house what steps he will be taking to ensure that the glc retains the powers that he has mentioned <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i leave it for the deputy speaker to decide when is the appropriate moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> together with the manuscript amendment amendment no <e> <s> a because the two amendments are linked <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord for the short notice of and the necessity for the manuscript amendment <e> <s> on thinking about the matter and reading the rest of the bill and having had discussions with professional colleagues it became clear that the original amendment had a slight drafting error <e> <s> it did not make very much sense <e> <s> the only reason for the manuscript amendment is to correct that drafting error <e> <s> i think that will become clear as we discuss the two amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i was not much encouraged by the reply from the noble minister <e> <s> it was in fact about the same as the previous reply <e> <s> i read his words quite carefully <e> <s> perhaps i may quote what caught my eye a number of times when i read through <e>", "<cs> my lords may i bring the noble lord back to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> in his reply the noble lord seemed to infer that norman shaw court is now deemed part of the palace of westminster <e> <s> when was that decided and how <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always extremely difficult to follow my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby

bricks was aimed at me but i am certain that some of them have found their target <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord the minister agree that this european decision may well have given us the opportunity to review the tragic human circumstances of many of those people who had to flee from cyprus following <e> <s> is he aware too and he must be getting the feeling of members of this house that there is a great deal of support from all strands of public opinion outside this house particularly for the case of mr and mrs nicola and for others like them <e> <s> the only difference between these and most of those who were already given leave to remain is that they spent some time after in refugee settlement camps in different parts of cyprus as has already been mentioned by my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> they then fled to this country <e> <s> we feel and many who have studied this case feel that there is merit in this case being reconsidered and that mr and mrs nicola should be allowed to remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the statement repeated by the noble baroness <e> <s> i was slightly surprised that the noble baroness expressed amazement that my noble friend lady jeger did not go into ecstacies of gratitude over the content of this statement <e> <s> i do not think the noble baroness should be surprised at that when one considers that we made all the criticisms some of which are now being replied to in the second reading debate and also in other debates in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i am abusing the standing orders

taken place in the social security act <e> <s> i suggested then that this clause was unnecessary <e> <s> in fact i suggested that this part of the bill was unnecessary because this restoration could have been done in the normal process in the same way that had been applied years ago to the unemployment benefit and to the invalidity allowance <e> <s> so there was another reason behind the necessity to introduce such a clause and such a part of a bill <e>", "<cs> anybody can quote statistics to prove a case <e> <s> i can prove that millions of people have lost as a result of the social security measures introduced since <e> <s> we know that pensioners and invalidity pensioners lost as a result of the two weeks that were added to the year in <e> <s> one week is added this year which

move them separately if it was necessary <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the noble baroness trying to explain this turn-about <e> <s> i want to read her remarks in detail before making any

for his reply and for the mention of the european court <e> <s> i deliberately omitted it because i was not sure whether or not i would be in order <e> <s> i am grateful for his reassurance or what seems to be a reassurance that if the courts judgment goes in favour of mrs drake the government will be bound to consider the matter favourably <e> <s> certainly that puts a respectable light on the amendment and on the reply the government have given <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that the government interfered at the beginning <e> <s> the government made some very strong statements about the proposed ban and in fact the prime minister herself was very voluble on this question <e> <s> does he agree with me that it was not the teams which needed banning but the spectators <e> <s> perhaps the government can do something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount accept that most of us thought that this experiment was to last for six months <e> <s> it would appear that this interim report is a device to extend that six-month <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady jeger and the noble lord lord

with him and i wholeheartedly confess to having a great deal of respect for what he said this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that the approach to the department of the environment has resulted in a complete negative <e> <s> is she aware that the department has simply repeated the reply that she has given today to the extent that it considers the scope and purpose of the international year of shelter for the homeless as being simply confined to the problems of homelessness in the third <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that not all the problems

assure him that the committee took the decision very seriously <e> <s> we were all much aware of the possibility of delay and the effects that any delay would cause <e> <s> in fact we included in our recommendation a mention of the delay and our concern over it though some of the delay had been the fault of the inspector originally and was unavoidable because of illness <e> <s> since then there has been a great deal of delay caused by government actions <e> <s> in fact the joint committee reported in april <e> <s> we are now in july so there has already been three or four months delay added

the noble lord the minister agree that supplementary benefit and social security are very complicated areas and cannot as it were be dealt with on ones feet in the form that this question suggests <e>

referred to the bodies looking at the reviews and then they can come forward with something that is properly thought out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the courteous way in which the minister has replied and the trouble he has taken to pick up the points that i made <e> <s> while i would accept what the noble lord has said in his explanation i am sure that that same position would obtain in two or three years time following the coming into force of the act and there is a different minister interpreting the act and reading this word solely and the guidance notes as well <e> <s> i am not sure that the position would be the same as the present minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not accept that the only conclusion being drawn by most informed opinion in respect of unemployment figures is that the government have failed miserably to begin to deal with this massive problem <e> <s> does he not agree that it would be far better instead of having the financial restrictions and penalties which are being imposed on local authorities if the government were to give back to local authorities the right to develop real jobs in the areas of genuine deprivation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i found if difficult if not impossible to join in the acclamation of welcome which he received upon his return to this house this afternoon <e> <s> i am one of those who believe that the position of secretary of state for employment should be held by an elected member in another place <e> <s> therefore i do not share the enthusiasm of other noble lords in welcoming the minister back and all the more so when the present secretary of state stated in a radio interview yesterday that unemployment in the london borough of hackney is not a problem <e> <s> the minister said then that unemployment is not a problem in hackney and that there are plenty of job vacanies <e> <s> that statement should be challenged and it can only be challenged by the elected members of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a statement that should be and can only be properly challenged by elected members in another place <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that there are people unemployed <e>", "<cs> in the london borough of hackney and only just over vacancies <e> <s> therefore his statement is not even factually correct and that is all the more reason why it should be open to scrutiny in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> has he seen the chart in the latest bulletin published by one of his departments the department of employment which shows that unemployment is up by about million since and vacancies registered at the jobcentres are down by about compared with <e> <s> i know that the noble lord is giving the governments latest and newest

readily identify myself with some of the situations that he has so graphically described <e> <s> through my work with char shelter shac and other organisations in this field i know of the problems in that part of london as well as in other parts of london <e> <s> i should like to emphasise everything that the right reverend prelate has said i certainly appreciate it <e>", "<cs> my lords in the normal course of events i would not dare to intervene in a debate of this kind <e> <s> certainly i would not dare to follow the noble earl who has just spoken particularly his last sentiments more particularly after listening to the noble and learned lord lord denning who always appears to me to be right and authoritative even when i think he is perhaps wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i was there and i listened to the noble viscount the leader of the house but i did not think that he replied to the points made by the noble lord lord foot and i certainly did not get the reply that i was seeking about when the decision was taken <e> <s> it was a simple question but there was no answer <e> <s> it was certainly not an attack on the noble viscount <e> <s> on the contrary i feel sorry for him if like me he is wondering whether he has been conned led up the garden path and did not know all that much <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper

deadline for claimants to apply for the pension was fixed at nd december this year which is only a couple of weeks away <e> <s> everybody else received months notice of application for claim <e> <s> is the noble baroness the minister in a position to give the house an assurance that the period of claim will be extended to british pensioners in canada so that they will have the months grace as well and that any claim will be made retrospective to the original date of the award <e>", "<cs> i should like to rise for a minute to support my noble friend lord jacques who voiced some reservation about the statement made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale who said that this amendment was an abuse of the procedures of the house <e> <s> he said it to fairly loud cheers from the government side of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who takes an interest in social security affairs i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness on repeating the statement which was made in another place given the length of it <e> <s> i should like to say too that unlike my noble friend lady jeger because i am also interested in the shops bill i did not even have a chance to read the white paper during the debate on the first amendment on the bill <e> <s> so i had to rely to a large extent on scribbling notes as the noble baroness lady trumpington was speaking <e>", "<cs> i want to support the principle of the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i do so with even more trepidation than the noble lord lord sainsbury because i was not even a shopkeeper <e> <s> but i was a member of a local authority for some years and i am very much aware of the problems in that same locality now because of the unruly expansion of sunday trading at present and the difficulties that that is causing the local authority <e>", "<cs> i can quite readily agree with much of what has been said particularly the remarks made by the mover and by the supporters of the amendment so far <e> <s> i have no difficulty at all in aligning myself with the noble earl lord lauderdale in his remarks <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that intervention because again the demands of the consumers are more in line with the amendment than is the point of view expressed by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> perhaps i may quote again from the small jubilee centre brief <e> <s> it is an excellent brief which to me certainly puts the case very clearly <e> <s> it said <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to follow the noble baroness lady seear because as usual she has encapsulated all or most of the arguments which have been put forward by the opponents of the amendment <e> <s> i share her concern about the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> i am well aware of his experience and that he speaks for the adc <e> <s> however i do not think that that body could be considered to be representative of every type of local authority in the country <e> <s> therefore the

commitments and we all have to leave from time to time <e> <s> none of us should object to that at all <e> <s> i certainly do not do so <e> <s> however the noble lord chided my noble friend lord graham for taking i think he said minutes to put his case and obviously he did not satisfy the noble lord in those minutes <e> <s> the noble lord then spoke for or minutes himself and did not say anywhere near as much as my noble friend had said in his constructive speech <e> <s> i venture to suggest that the noble lord repeated the arguments which he has made on hundreds of occasions and he said as much himself in various places <e> <s> i have certainly listened to those arguments in other places put forward by other authorities and bodies for almost years <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord but yesterday i mentioned the difference between his sense of humour and mine and i maintain that there is a difference <e> <s> this bill is no joke to those who are involved with the environmental and social problems which will be imposed if the bill becomes law <e> <s> local shoppers are worried about the extension of the everyday into sunday which will give rise to problems of pollution and noise which have already been mentioned there is the possibility that they will incur penalties for parking on a sunday which would not have been the case prior to the bill becoming law <e> <s> there will be more traffic wardens and more expense <e>", "<cs> following on the noble lord lord sandford i can see the weight of the argument about rateable values <e> <s> but i can also appreciate the principle behind all the amendments <e>", "<cs> the detail can be changed if we accept the principle that small shops need protection <e> <s> if we do not accept that principle then i cannot help it <e> <s> most of us accept that there is a need to protect small shops <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to give the minister that assurance <e> <s> i shall happily group amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mccarthy for dealing with that point <e> <s> on the point raised by the noble and learned lord lord simon i maintain that the new clause will simply bring the bill up to date <e> <s> it would insert minimum premia for sunday working <e> <s> we have introduced the -hour concept <e> <s> that is the reason for deleting subsection <e>", "<cs> until such time as we further discuss clause at a later stage in the bill i have to accept that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the courteous way in which he has dealt with this difficult amendment <e> <s> i concede that it was made more difficult because we did not move the previous amendments <e> <s> that perhaps made it more difficult to understand this amendment let alone move it <e> <s> i concede that that was one of the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble minister for that reply <e> <s> i have looked at the documents to which he has referred and the fairly puny reports of very important meetings <e> <s> can the minister consider to what extent he would agree with me that the most recent political developments in northern ireland are attributable to the near secrecy which has surrounded the anglo-irish agreement since its inception <e> <s> can he tell us at what stage his right honourable friend the secretary of state intends to come forward with a progress report that can be debated by both houses of parliament <e> <s> to that extent when can we expect fuller and more detailed reports of the meetings that take place so that we may come to reasoned judgments about progress or lack of it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that his replies to the questions seem to make the situation worse <e> <s> there have been questions here today from noble lords who were seeking information but there is not enough information available to members of this house <e> <s> the noble lord himself recommended that we should read the northern ireland press <e> <s> we do so avidly and i am sure that he will also have read the recent very comprehensive survey which was carried out by the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has said that he is prepared to listen to suggestions from members of both houses when making up his mind about the parliamentary tier <e> <s> to what extent can he improve the information that comes to members of both houses so that they can make a reasoned judgment <e> <s> at the moment we have to rely on what i termed last week puny press reports in the printed paper office and nothing else <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt on the question of camden because i know a little about camden <e> <s> has the noble lord any proof that all those organisations campaign in favour of the labour party in camden <e> <s> that is what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by apologising as i may not be able to stay to the end of the debate but i shall do my best to remain <e> <s> previous speakers have mentioned the bills produced by this government since aimed directly at local authorities <e> <s> in reply to a question by dr cunningham in another place the secretary of state for the department of the environment gave a list of pieces of new legislation involving local government in column on th december <e> <s> of those apply directly to local government finance <e> <s> that legislation has been produced by a party in government who most of us will recall made bitter attacks when they were in opposition against too much legislation and too much government interference <e> <s> it comes ill from them in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i entirely agree and i think i have said so on a number of occasions during debates as have many members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected so far as the noble lord is concerned <e> <s> i was not present in the house when he moved that amendment or i would have supported him <e> <s> i was certainly not present when all those other marvellous amendments which the noble lord mentioned were carried <e> <s> but even the amendments to the local government bill were not carried with any support from the government <e> <s> in no way would the government listen to any punctuation mark being moved on that bill nor will they on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to damage the noble lords reputation in the conservative party <e> <s> i am sure he can do that quite well himself <e> <s> i do not withdraw anything i said about the governments attitude to bills in committees that i have witnessed and sat on in this chamber <e> <s> there is no willingness there is no give there is nothing at all <e> <s> if amendments are forced through that is good but it is no good trying to get credit from a situation after the government have been forced into it by the weight of opinion here or elsewhere <e> <s> so in spite of that and because of the importance of the issues involved to local government and to our local democracy by this bill i shall do my best with others to try to amend and make it a better bill before it leaves this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> i very carefully noted mr bristows exoneration of the prime minister from any connection with this allegation <e> <s> however does the noble viscount accept that there is great public disbelief that a man of mr bristows background character and obvious and active support for the tory party could conceivably have fabricated such an allegation <e> <s> in view of the fact that two members of your lordships house have been mentioned in this inducement and the fact that that brings suspicion on all of us in this house will the noble viscount initiate an inquiry so that we may ascertain the truth and lift that suspicion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble viscount that it it not good enough to dismiss these statements as tittle-tattle <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that it is not good enough to try to denigrate mr bristow who i understand and my friend has mentioned is a regular contributor to conservative party funds and to dismiss the whole thing as tittle-tattle when we all watched the television bulletins and reports in which mr bristow clearly said that this was an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with some people from the house of lords who as he understood it made him a firm offer of an honour <e> <s> i do not think we can just dismiss it <e> <s> if there are offers of that sort we ought to know <e> <s> i ask the noble viscount again would he reconsider the decision not to set up some kind of inquiry to get to the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept that i am not one of those who think that this was simply an inspired question <e> <s> in fact we all welcome the good news that the minister has been able to announce this afternoon <e> <s> but is the minister in a position to put a breakdown of the figures district by district in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not of course read the circular or seen the notes on guidance but certainly we welcome the recognition by the department of the problems raised originally by child poverty action the citizens advice bureaux age concern care of the aged and others <e> <s> to that extent we should pay tribute to those voluntary organisations who waged that campaign because there were gaps in the old system <e> <s> we fear as do the organisations involved that there are still going to be gaps and we need assurances on some of the questions already raised by the noble lord and my noble friend who have already spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that nothing in his replies today will be of any consequence or certainly will be of very little consequence to the many thousands of unemployed youngsters and adults in the inner london area the area about which he said just before christmas that there was no problem <e> <s> since he has made that remark unemployment has increased particularly in hackney where it now stands at nearly per cent <e> <s> the noble lords complacency today and his attempts to gloss presentation over these figures will have made the situation much worse so far as those people faced with a really tragic situation are concerned <e> <s> as he said it is not a matter for playing about with words but we want to know what action the government are taking to do something about the situation in inner london <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that there are many reports in the inner cities particularly in inner london of abuse of the yts schemes <e> <s> youngsters are being taken in and given no structured training at all but in many instances are being used as cheap labour <e> <s> has the noble lord visited any of those establishments mentioned in the reports of many of the voluntary organisations who have also been monitoring the youth training scheme and receiving different results from those the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords as we accept the noble lords anger will he accept that there is also anger on this side of the house anger at these almost obsessive attempts by the present minister since he took office to doctor the figures to present the problem as being something less serious than it really is <e> <s> is he aware that his new presentational approach to every aspect of this situation has not added one single job <e> <s> in fact the figures for unemployment are increasing <e> <s> this latest presentational attempt is to take another off the total figures while at the same time the noble lord intends to increase the figures of the total labour force at the other end by including the self-employed and the armed forces <e> <s> such tactics will fool no one outside his immediate environs and certainly do nothing to enhance either his credibility or that of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i will change it to massage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness record that this side of the house also welcomes the change to april <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has rightly said it is a change for which many organisations have been campaigning for many years <e> <s> our welcome does not necessarily mean that we accept the arbitrary transitional arrangements <e> <s> that is a different matter <e> <s> the rpi figures that the noble baroness announced take no account of the post-budget increases that will inevitably occur <e> <s> pensioners will have to endure those budget price increases from now until april <e> <s> if the arrangements made are not arbitrary then that situation ought to have been reflected in the transitional arrangements but it is not <e> <s> we cannot therefore accept the transitional arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not accept that if industrial output is the key then the wholesale destruction of our manufacturing industry that we see all around us and that we certainly see on news bulletins and documentaries is not the way to go about improving the industrial scene <e> <s> will he not show some concern about the devastation to our manufacuring industry and at least give us some inkling that the government have some constructive proposals to halt this destruction <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to give the house a breakdown of the figures so that we may know how many jobs have been lost in manufacturing industry <e> <s> how many more unemployed are there in manufacturing industry <e> <s> is it not a fact that hundreds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> does the minister not accept that there is widespread acceptance of the proposition set out in the question of the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> many of us do not see it as an either or proposition <e> <s> it is not a matter of either housing associations or local councils it is both <e> <s> will the minister as a witness to some concern about the housing problem reconsider the governments decision not to release moneys that local authorities have accumulated from the sale of council houses so that they may begin again to build houses for renting <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house whether any reference will be made in any new legislation to the increase in standing charges which seems to be a continuing process <e> <s> when added to all the other standing charges particularly in the case of pensioners great difficulty is created when one considers that the standing charges amount to about a week before we even switch on a light bulb or a gas appliance or buy anything <e> <s> will anything be said in legislation about the need to reduce those standing charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i said that that was the sum when added to other standing charges like for example telephone gas and water <e> <s> if you put them all together you arrive at that amount <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord the minister and other noble lords would understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i did not intend to speak and i shall not delay your lordships very long <e> <s> but i am also concerned at the number of references to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but i have made the points that i wanted to make <e> <s> i am concerned at the trend of the discussion and argument this afternoon from some speakers <e> <s> my main point is that i would have advocated and would still advocate that all legislation should be scrutinised to make sure that it does not offend the race relations policy as enunciated by parliament in previous acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that partial reply <e> <s> is he aware that some of the figures he gave and other figures that he did not give have quadrupled since in an inner london borough which is part of the so-called prosperous south-east <e> <s> these figures are as high as anywhere else in the country or dare i say it before the minister does <e> <s> in france germany japan greece or ireland <e> <s> is he also aware that as well as the generally high level of youth unemployment in hackney per cent <e> <s> of the youngsters have been unemployed for over a year and there is a real problem among the black and ethnic minority groups of unemployed youngsters <e> <s> will the minister reconsider his decision not to include hackney in his tour of visits to parts of the country to look at these problems <e> <s> will he accept an invitation to hackney to see those problems and meet the people trying to deal with them who would welcome a chance to discuss with him the problems in hackney <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that his reasons for declining the invitation to hackney will not be welcomed by the voluntary workers and the local authority workers who are now working very hard to try to do something about the problems in that area <e> <s> i understand that the latest invitation was sent to him by the chief executive the town clerk on th march <e> <s> again can i ask him to reconsider that invitation in a positive manner so that he can see for himself rather than have to learn from hearsay what is going on in hackney <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor back to the original question that was asked by my noble friend <e> <s> since i raised the question on th february when i asked for an internal inquiry to take place into the allegations i was hoping that we would get some reply today which would tell us what has changed between then and now to convince the director of public prosecutions no less that it ought now to be investigated <e> <s> what has changed from the tittle-tattle position to it now being a serious issue which ought to be investigated by the dpp <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> she will accept that my arithmetic is not as good as it used to be <e> <s> i am not able to work out immediately how many homes at each that enormous figure of million could insulate but it is quite a tidy number <e> <s> that seems to confirm my view and that of many others that we are spending far too little on conservation and insulation and wasting scarce resources in the way that we did last winter and the winter before <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply but with some disappointment over the time it will take to produce a final report <e> <s> is she aware that the preliminary report already confirms at least two of the fears that were expressed by many people during the passage of the education bill first that nutritional standards of school meals have lapsed and secondly that for many school children fast foods and what are known as junk foods are taking the place of properly balanced meals <e>", "<cs> my lords as an interim measure will the noble baroness try to ensure that school heads are aware of the fears that have been expressed in the preliminary report <e>", "<cs> my lords if the governments housing policy is so good why are waiting lists all over the country and in particular in inner city areas growing at a fantastic rate <e> <s> why are thousands and thousands of people literally homeless <e> <s> the number of people sleeping rough in our inner city areas is on the increase <e> <s> why is bed and breakfast accommodation absolutely chock-a-block or unobtainable <e> <s> that which is obtainable costs fantastic prices <e> <s> in the borough that i know best the lowest rent is a week for any accommodation that can be found <e> <s> who can afford that <e> <s> how about all the other problems <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister boast about them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not accept that stripped of all the presentational procedures that he outlined in his statistical information the crucial point is the one that the minister mentioned a few questions ago the seasonally-adjusted figure still shows an increase <e> <s> that indicates that unemployment is still on the way up <e> <s> the trend is upwards how does the minister justify that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to join in the congratulations to my noble friend for initiating this debate and for his choice of subject <e> <s> he has given the house a useful opportunity to examine the effects of legislation enacted in recent years covering many aspects of our daily lives <e> <s> i shall resist the temptation to follow the previous speaker because that would eat up all the time that i have for what i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is not the governments policy to advocate bed and breakfast accommodation and if they are so concerned about empty properties why have they consistently refused to allow inner london boroughs like camden to spend money on rehabilitating short life properties <e> <s> for example it would cost somewhere in the region of to give a four-bedroomed house which would accommodate a family of seven a life of five years <e> <s> it costs the council something in the region of or to keep that same family in bed and breakfast <e> <s> therefore there is a difference of about <e> <s> the government refuse permission to allow such a house to be rehabilitated <e> <s> that is part of the answer to the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> what is the governments reply <e>", "<cs> my lords will the tuc be involved in the preliminary consultation process <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that disappointing and tired old reply the same reply we have had for many years now <e> <s> does she accept that the canadian government are prepared to put in the million dollars as soon as an agreement can be reached with the united kingdom government to pay the initial index-linked uprating that is necessary <e> <s> can she explain because i fail to understand it why it is possible to come to arrangements with austria israel turkey the united states yugoslavia cyprus the bermudas and other commonwealth and non-commonwealth countries and yet not come to an agreement with canada which is more than willing to reach such an agreement and has made such a genuine and generous offer in order to get this off the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i return to the original answer of the noble baroness when she mentioned <e> <s> that was the year when our prime minister agreed with prime minister trudeau that the matter was urgent and the government of the noble baroness had accepted the principle of the reciprocal arrangement <e> <s> what has happened since then <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness on agreeing to sponsor this bill through your lordships house and on the very full and comprehensive outline that she has given us of the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i should like to join her too in congratulating all those responsible both in government and in opposition for the passage of the bill through another place not an easy feat <e> <s> the sponsor in another place mr tom clarke and his advisers mr peter mitchell and mr john healey together with members and officers of the all-party disablement group aided by voluntary organisations many of them organisations like the spastics society mencap radar the forum on disability in glasgow and many others all played a part in achieving what to me at any rate is a real and quite unique bill and in getting it through the other place <e> <s> i hope that we shall be able to assist in the process of aiding it on to the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly join with the noble baroness who has just sat down in congratulating the noble baroness who opened this second reading debate on her comprehensive outline of how she sees the provisions of the bill <e> <s> but i cannot really go any further the noble baroness will not be surprised to hear that i cannot follow her any further down the road she takes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i am not one who wants to stop him making the kind of speeches or remarks that were attributed to him last week <e> <s> on the contrary i am one of those who think that those kind of remarks only serve to show how remote are he and many of his governmental friends from the real situation in the world in which we live <e>", "<cs> does he accept that <e> <s> i asked that when i rose but the noble lords noble friends did not hear me <e> <s> following his replies today can he explain to me why if we have learnt from all the mistakes of every country in the world that he keeps quoting we are in the mess we are in <e> <s> why if the world is as rosy as he sees it do we have today a report that long-term unemployment will be with us into the s on an increasing scale <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the weighting in the index must be seen to be fair as well <e> <s> as the noble lord lord campbell has said the present weighting does not reflect people on lower incomes and those who live on pensions <e> <s> it certainly will not reflect the worsening conditions of those people under the social security legislation which is now going through particularly in relation to their housing costs <e> <s> will all these factors be taken into account in the changing of the index <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to his reply last week when he predicted that long-term unemployment would be reduced by christmas or would be reducing in the next six months <e> <s> in his earlier replies today the minister seemed to be saying that that reduction would be dependent on the impact of the msc programmes <e> <s> do i understand the noble lord correctly <e> <s> is he simply saying that there will be a reduction in the number of long-term unemployed because they will all be on training progammes important though they are or is he actually saying that there will be more jobs for the long-term unemployed by christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord dean of beswick for giving us yet another opportunity to discuss the problems of housing and housing investment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her considered remarks and her tacit support for the implications of my amendment <e> <s> i am not entirely satisfied with the section of the disabled persons act that she mentioned <e> <s> it does not operate in the way that i would like to see it operate hence my reasons for putting down this amendment <e> <s> however in view of what she has said and i dare say that it will be brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has raised this question on many occasions in your lordships house as well as in the other place may i also congratulate the noble baroness on her statement <e> <s> i know that all the voluntary organisations for which i have spoken in the past and for which i have raised the matter on a number of occasions will also be pleased at the announcement <e> <s> we are also pleased i think as the noble baroness lady lockwood said that the noble baroness the minister has anticipated the european courts decision by agreeing to implement that part of the allowance for married women <e> <s> to that extent we are entitled to say that as that judgment is based on the fact that the united kingdom was deemed to have been unlawfully excluding those women from the benefit since its inception on th december the same judgment will apply and back pay will have to go to th december otherwise we shall be deemed to be continuing the unlawful discrimination that has <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply but it fails to meet the point <e> <s> the complexity of the existing scheme is not a reason for making the situation worse for people who live in homes that are hard to heat <e> <s> that is the point which the noble baroness failed to deal with <e> <s> in the proposals in the bill there is a one-off figure for everybody in the premium <e> <s> there will be anomalies <e> <s> people who live in homes that are especially hard to heat will not be dealt with <e> <s> that is what the amendment tries to cover <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment so ably moved by the noble lord and outlined by the legal action group <e> <s> when the new housing benefit system was introducted in one of the features which gave some cause for concern was that there was no independent right of appeal <e> <s> under the two separate systems which had preceded the new scheme the position in that respect had varied <e> <s> in relation to benefit for rent and rates paid through supplementary benefit there was a right of appeal to an independent tribunal but there was no such appeal right in relation to rent and rate rebates paid by local authorities <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which seeks to remove the provision that the cut-off for entitlement to industrial injury benefit should be a per cent <e> <s> instead of a per cent <e> <s> degree of disability <e> <s> it is a remarkable coincidence as the government confirmed at the committee stage in another place that the proposal will mean that about per cent <e> <s> of the people who now have awards under the industrial injuries scheme will no longer receive an award of any kind <e> <s> from my years in the engineering industry i know of the injuries to workers and the effects on their future employment prospects and most of those would be affected by the provisions in the bill <e> <s> the government have said that they want to simplify disablement schemes <e> <s> unfortunately whenever they propose any simplification it invariably results in worsening the existing position <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i believe that these two amendments are lumped together although this amendment has a slightly different approach <e> <s> the death grant was introduced by the national insurance act <e> <s> contributions under that act commenced in july and payment of the death grant commenced one year later <e> <s> originally the grant was designed as one of a package of benefits intended to introduce the cradle-to-the-grave security concept inherent in the philosophy of the welfare state <e> <s> the grant was the amount recommended in the beveridge report as a reasonable estimate of the necessary expenses of a decent funeral for an adult including cemetery fees and so there is no doubt that it was intended to cover the full cost of a funeral <e> <s> in moreover the national association of funeral directors agreed with the board of trade that their members would not charge more than for a simple funeral that is a hearse four bearers and one following car <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to support this amendment <e> <s> although the government and indeed the noble baroness herself expressed concern about this matter the noble baroness did not go far enough <e> <s> she did not accept that there would be a problem affecting people now <e> <s> she has repeated what was said at the committee stage of the bill in another place and told us not to worry because this measure will not take effect for a long time yet and because nothing will happen until we should not bother about it since it is not an immediate problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the noble lord lord banks on this amendment <e> <s> like him i can recall the debates we had on the board and lodging regulations and i was amazed i suppose i was amazed to find a clause in the bill that seems to undo or go back on all the concessions we were able to wring from the government on those regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendments moved so eloquently by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and since he has covered most of the points to which i would have liked to refer perhaps i can be brief <e> <s> the problem we are discussing is part of our own making as the noble lord rightly says and it is part certainly of the governments own making <e> <s> it was one of the governments main policy planks and one may argue whether it is right or wrong to encourage home ownership to sell council houses and council flats to tenants at cut-down prices or reduced prices <e> <s> many people went into that because so far as they were concerned it was as cheap or nearly as cheap as renting <e> <s> one can understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was moved at the committee stage <e> <s> as i recall it in reply the noble baroness gave the impression that she had not ruled it out completely but was going to consider the matter further between then and now <e> <s> i hope she has had a chance to consider it further because most of us certainly have and the more i consider it the more important i think it is that the noble baroness accepts this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment as i did when it was first moved during the committee stage <e> <s> like my noble friend lady turner i started my working life on the shop floor and as a trade union representative i can remember the difficult situations and the hardships caused by injuries on the shop floor both before and after <e> <s> i can also recall since going to the other place the number of attempts which have been made to try to change this legislation and the kind of resistance that that has created among people who are still working on the shop floor <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first reply which the noble lord made to my noble friend lord dean in which he mentioned the dangers of forecasting does he recall that a few weeks ago in reply to a similar question from me he in fact forecast that there would be an improvement by christmas in the unemployment situation <e> <s> the noble lord repeated that forecast a few days ago in a speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many individuals and organisations who are involved in these matters are not as full in their support of the document as the noble lord who asked the question <e> <s> one such criticism i read said that the form of the document betrays its content it is glossy showy and printed on non-recyclable paper and costs <e> <s> will he accept my criticism that i do not think the document gives any sense to the enormity of the task that has to be carried out or of the urgency <e> <s> indeed i had the impression from reading the document of much complacency <e> <s> if i may give a small example from page of the document <e>", "<cs> if i cannot give an example from page of the document may i say to the minister that the problem of the marine nature reserve which has been hanging about for a long time <e>", "<cs> i have asked the minister whether he is aware that that is happening <e> <s> i would ask the minister to tell his noble friend not to be so rude <e> <s> that shows to me the complacency <e>", "<cs> my lords i prefaced this remark by saying is the minister aware <e> <s> that is a question <e> <s> i then went on to show him of what he should be aware <e> <s> that is part of the question and i expect him to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords my question has been lengthened by the interruptions <e> <s> i asked the minister is he aware <e> <s> that is an interrogative <e> <s> that is a question <e> <s> then i went on to tell him of what he should be aware the delay in establishing the marine nature reserve which has been promised for a long time <e> <s> can he tell us when that marine nature reserve will be completed <e> <s> have the government any plans to introduce legislation to oblige british companies to consider the environmental implications of new projects when they are planned <e> <s> finally will the government initiate a debate on the whole question <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to support the noble lord lord henderson in the amendment he has moved and the other amendments he has put in as manuscript amendments <e> <s> i feel sad that we had to come to a position where we had to put in manuscript amendments <e> <s> i say that as a back-bencher because i have certainly had no time to consider or to consult on any of the issues discussed in the other place last night and which did not come from there until late in the evening <e> <s> there was no way that any back-bencher <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not seek any satisfaction from the noble viscount for whom i have the highest regard <e> <s> all i am saying is that the house has been confused <e> <s> if i and noble lords who have been involved with the bill since it started are confused how much more confused must be those dozens or scores of noble lords who have been brought in not to listen to the british council and commonwealth institute superannuation bill later tonight but to vote in what they think may be an early division on the social security bill this afternoon <e> <s> how much more confused must they be at this kind of procedure <e> <s> i hope that they may take the time while this debate is going on to read the debate in the other place and see something of what has gone on <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege as the speaker following the noble lord lord hesketh to congratulate the noble lord on his maiden speech <e> <s> i certainly do not think that he need apologise as he seemed to do at the beginning of his speech for lack of knowledge because as he developed his speech i certainly gained the impression that he has a great deal <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may ask the noble lord lord denham for some explanation <e> <s> i accept his answer about not having enough ministers and ministers speaking for the government and so on <e> <s> what i do not understand is why lord glenarthur who i understand is the minister at the home office or is attached to the home office if he has been moved to scotland is not here <e> <s> he should be here <e> <s> either way there is no reasonable explanation for his absence <e> <s> first of all if he is in the home office as he was when i last heard of him he should not have been involved in this bill <e> <s> if he is not now and he is involved in the scottish office then he should be here to reply to the criticisms and questions which have been raised <e> <s> i would certainly support the noble lord lord ross because this is not the first time that scotland has been treated as an afterthought and if there is no minister responsible then there ought to be for a very important part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord dean of beswick in his opposition to this amendment <e> <s> we are dealing here with some amendments which is a fairly large number and they are not all exactly the same <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves that point will he not concede that the onus is on the government <e> <s> it is not good enough for the government to throw the onus on the tenants to do all this and make their views known <e> <s> the government are saying we shall give them consultation we shall set up the consultative process between us and the council <e> <s> i say that the onus is on the government therefore to provide the resources and all the rest of it for the tenants to be able to participate in that consultation <e> <s> the onus is on the government to find <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said a few moments ago that the secretary of state is not the promoter here it is the local council <e> <s> he gave me the impression that there might be some discretion on the part of some local councils who may want to operate these schemes <e> <s> is that what the minister is saying <e> <s> is he <e>", "<cs> the minister has not replied surely to the point made by my noble friend lady david <e> <s> the procedure at the moment under section of the rent act means that a property owner who is contemplating carrying out improvements to a property can apply to the rent officer to discover whether this would be worthwhile in terms of rent income that he would receive <e> <s> the rent officer then issues a certificate of fair rent <e> <s> the property owner then goes ahead and improves or lets the property <e> <s> he applies within two years to the rent officer to register a fair rent <e> <s> the rent officer will then register the same rent that appeared on the certificate <e> <s> that is not what we are talking about here <e>", "<cs> i too want to support this public inquiry proposal <e> <s> indeed i mentioned this on a previous amendment last tuesday and my noble friend lord graham has touched on some of the points which i then made and which are worth repeating as he has just done <e> <s> i said then that the governments consultative procedure and this <e>", "<cs> i am saying yes a minority even of one <e> <s> how many times have we seen one tenant one resident or one occupier holding up a motorway holding up a bridge and holding up all kinds of things <e> <s> they had a right to do so <e> <s> we defended their right <e> <s> we might not have agreed but they had the right to be heard and they had the right to have an inquiry and after the inquiry the result was taken <e> <s> we have seen it many times <e> <s> what is the difference between a council tenants home because that is all he has as well and some of the others <e> <s> why should not he or a few of them have the same kind of rights <e> <s> we cannot just dismiss them because they are council tenants who will turn the whole world upside down if they object <e> <s> but others can object and they will be defended by the most expensive barristers in the land who will take their case and inquiries go on in some cases for months and for years <e>", "<cs> i must take up this point as i have raised it two or three times <e> <s> the minister has said again exactly what he has said on a number of occasions <e> <s> when i asked him what the machinery for that consultation will be and how he will be sure that every council tenant has been consulted as would happen in the case of other inquiries no answer was forthcoming <e> <s> it seems that a notice will be put out or there will be something in the local press <e> <s> how will it be done <e> <s> how can we be sure that all the tenants will be consulted <e> <s> there is no reply <e> <s> i have yet to get a reply to that very important question from tenants <e> <s> if some do not hear about it or if they do not read the right kind of newspaper then again bad luck that is the end of the consultation <e>", "<cs> he has to be able to write <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to participate in the debate since my amendment amendment no <e> <s> a is linked to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had a few reservations about amendment no <e> <s> when i first read it <e> <s> although i have no objection to the postal ballot and i have been participating in postal ballots for many years as a member of my trade union i had reservations about the efficiency and i put it no higher or lower than that of some local authorities to conduct a postal ballot of the kind that would be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i reply to that last point made by the noble lord who never gets his facts right about trade unions <e> <s> i said during my remarks that as a member of an engineering union i have been participating in postal ballots for many years <e> <s> i have participated in more postal ballots than has the noble lord and i say that without fear of contradiction <e> <s> i feel that he ought to get some facts right before he produces data in this authoritative tone as though they were facts when they are not <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> at the same time i should like to indicate my support for the initial remarks of my noble friend lady jeger when she protested about the way that these important statements are introduced into this house and particularly today when it is sandwiched in the middle of a debate on linked amendments <e> <s> that cannot be good for the best management of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says that she did not say that <e> <s> may i ask her to say it <e> <s> she ought to have said that there will be an early debate on such an important matter as this and perhaps she can say it <e> <s> the noble baroness will recall that in all the discussions we have had on upratings there has always been a great point made of the fact that the increase was announced in the budget for a number of obvious reasons but it was never paid until november by which time it had been gobbled up by all sorts of other increases and there were arrangements made to take care of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks me the question <e> <s> i do not think we have changed our view <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to make two short points on the ministers remarks in reply to the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> first he refuted the argument that the bill as it stands takes away the rights of people in other words we were trying to restore their rights and he contested that <e> <s> in support of the noble lords lord carmichael and lord pitt i have to say that prior to the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that anyone who claims benefit in this country be it unemployment sickness or any other benefit fills in a form and has to give all his family details his background and so on on that form <e> <s> what is different about this form from the form that we all have to fill in anyway when we claim benefit and how often will it be necessary to renew the answers in a follow-up to this form <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to the detailed reply of the minister for which we are very grateful <e> <s> in particular i was listening for the point which many of us raised before at committee stage about cases where the council decides to sell to a developer for refurbishment and further sale and we have been given some examples of cases by shelter in recent weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the noble lords statement about the survey and about the monitoring of the results of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that there will be a general welcome for some constructive approach to the problems outlined by the noble baroness who asked the original question and that i for one would certainly welcome an extension of training in that area <e> <s> can he give me some clarification on one point <e> <s> if a man or a woman who is long-term unemployed accepts such a course or any other course and there is no job at the end of that course i am assuming that during the period of the course such a person is under the new rules not available for work will he or she revert to the normal unemployment register as opposed to being long-term unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some trepidation that i rise from the back-benches to speak briefly in the short debate this evening because i recognise only too well the amount of knowledge and experience of the problems of cyprus that exist in your lordships house and the debate has already shown that <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister for not hearing the first couple of sentences of his statement <e> <s> can he confirm that local authorities will not get the cash to which they are entitled under the rate support grant proposals until the bill currently going through the other place has gone through its procedures there and here <e> <s> if that is so is it not an arrogant assumption on which to base the rate support grant settlement when that bill includes many matters other than the immediate issue about the illegality of the previous rate system which will be contentious when they come here <e> <s> can the minister confirm that that is what he is saying and allow us to draw our own conclusions from that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that the statement made in answer to a question in another place yesterday was generally welcomed by all the voluntary organisations throughout the country as a step in the right direction <e> <s> but inevitably and predictably the debate has now moved to another plane and other questions are being asked <e> <s> is what is being done enough <e> <s> will the assistance get to the right people <e> <s> how will they get it <e> <s> in particular how will those people who pay for their fuel by means of a slot meter as they go along get this extra allowance so that they can put it into the meter and when will they get it <e> <s> finally may i solicit the noble baronesss support for my motion which has been going around for a long time <e> <s> it calls attention to the need for a comprehensive strategy to end fuel poverty and this annual argy-bargy about who gets what when and why and calls for the introduction of a proper decent policy that all governments can pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords as probably the only other member of the clapham bus present here this afternoon on this short statement may i be allowed a couple of words and to ask a few questions on the subject under discussion <e> <s> although we accept the difficulty that the home secretary has obviously had in coming to any decision at all because of the complexity of the whole affair we are puzzled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank the minister for his introductory remarks on this draft statutory instrument and for the explanations that he has given on some of the complicated matters involved <e> <s> i am aware of the convention that abounds in the house on the question of statutory instruments and i certainly will not overstep the mark on that score <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister one or two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those councils which are struggling to make the best use of their existing stock are those which are suffering most from the financial cuts imposed by the government <e> <s> would it not be more positive if the government as a further contribution to the international year of shelter for the homeless were to review the finances of those local authorities so that they can deal with the empty council flats that he has mentioned and hand them over to the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord harris on initiating this debate and giving us his interesting and frank opening remarks <e> <s> it is not the first time that he and many other members of your lordships house have debated this crucial domestic question and i dare say it will not be the last <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy to accept the suggestion put forward by my noble friend lord northfield <e>", "<cs> if i said that this had been a fairly ragged debate i should be very kind <e> <s> it has moved a long way from the simple amendment that i moved to discussing retrospection and the date of implementation of the bill <e>", "<cs> i accept that because i said that i was not an expert <e>", "<cs> my noble friend implied that the figures could not be based on a study similar to one that had taken place in the dhss <e>", "<cs> the figures were not to be reckoned on the same basis as those of the detailed study i accept that there must have been detailed study in the dhss <e> <s> when challenged by the noble lord lord tordoff the minister could not produce a figure for the word significant <e> <s> if there have been detailed studies in the dhss the minister should be able to say something more than significant or the argument falls <e> <s> i am completely dissatisfied and almost disorientated by the replies and the cut and thrust that there has been <e>", "<cs> i accept that that is the ministers view <e> <s> significant or broadly neutral would mean much more if there were a figure attached <e> <s> i do not know what broadly neutral or significant mean in this context <e> <s> we must have a figure or it becomes doubtful whether the matter has been studied in the detail that it should have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that but in the context of my remarks i was trying to distinguish between fuel poverty and poverty <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank all noble lords who have participated in making this such an interesting and constructive debate <e> <s> there is urgent need to find solutions to some very serious problems that could affect millions of our people their well-being and their quality of life <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said quite recently we had a long debate on rent control and deregulation and it is not my intention to cover ground that we have already covered <e> <s> certainly we have no time this evening and as custom stands at the moment at the end of our short debate on these orders there is not much that can be done about them in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a much longer argument which i should love to debate with the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> that is a myth that has built up since <e> <s> there is ample evidence to prove that there are more reasons than the one he gave for the diminution of rented stock which has taken place not just because of the simple facts that the noble lord has pointed out <e> <s> there is a long list of reasons why rented accommodation is not as widely available as it was <e> <s> building and development have taken away huge chunks of it <e> <s> we know that the lodgings or digs in which many people used to live when they first came to london have disappeared <e> <s> a huge chunk of such rented accommodation has been taken away <e>", "<cs> i know edmonton and tottenham as well <e> <s> i know many parts of london where those things are true <e> <s> rent-income ratios are different in london <e> <s> such things do not happen elsewhere in the united kingdom <e> <s> of course the government responded to members of parliament mainly their own members representing london and they introduced this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not rule that out of any review <e> <s> these orders are not the way to review rent controls <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord harris would have agreed with that <e> <s> the matter needs review <e> <s> those aspects that the noble lord lord monson mentioned must come into that review <e> <s> we have to look at the possibility of attracting institutional capital from building societies and so on into that area where they will provide the funds and accredited housing associations will do the building or the renting <e> <s> these are all constructive and practical possibilities but they cannot happen in the atmosphere created by these two orders <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves that point i also mentioned that tenants in london are desperate <e> <s> i do not think the minister has grasped the situation of people looking for accommodation in london <e> <s> desperation will make them sign all kinds of bits of paper and accept all kinds of conditions <e> <s> they might understand some but sheer desperation will make them accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply although i wish it could have gone further <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree with what is said in the pamphlet that the aging population represents one of the greatest challenges to our modern society <e> <s> since it is predicted that there will be almost million people of years and over by the turn of the century is she satisfied that our existing framework of legal and social mechanisms is capable of meeting that challenge particularly when we already know for instance that abuse of the elderly is on the increase and the potential indicated by the predictions is worryingly frightful <e>", "<cs> my lords in her earlier reply the noble baroness mentioned local authorities and their responsibilities and that is exactly one of the problems <e> <s> there is no universal application or interpretation by local authorities of their responsibilities under the mental health act or under the national assistance act section which was mentioned by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> it is because of that <e>", "<cs> that i am asking the noble baroness whether she will reconsider her reply and recommend that the working party that exists at the home office should be strengthened by representa-tives from other involved departments plus voluntary organisations to see whether we can reach one coherent strategy for the care of the old <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is not suggesting that it was ever otherwise surely <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the debate with great interest <e> <s> i hope all noble lords will accept that no one on this side of the chamber and certainly not myself would want to interfere or hold up research and development in important fields <e> <s> that has not been one of our objectives <e> <s> as i have said before we accept the need for rd and the time and effort which is spent in it <e> <s> nor do i decry for one second the efforts of the trade union movement and the contributions which its representatives have made on numerous committees in looking after the interests of consumers and of their members in relation to all these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this survey is also reported as saying that the restart scheme is a way to fiddle the jobless figures <e> <s> does he accept that the sentiment has been expressed not only about the restart scheme but about the other changes that have taken place under the present government in the method of compiling the statistics <e> <s> is he aware that because of the widespread view about these changes which all resulted in a reduction in the <e>", "<cs> my lord i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that because of her departments rather clumsy attempts to stifle that report all available copies have now been sold <e> <s> will the new authority take over the report and ensure its widest possible distribution <e> <s> in the meantime would she care to comment on the reports conclusions that the health gap between the rich and the poor has widened under the present government and that because of material deprivation all major killer diseases now affect the poor more than the rich <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that i too am grateful to the noble viscount for his assurance that copies will be made available for the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that correction from the noble viscount <e> <s> is the noble baroness also aware that her replies have been extremely disappointing <e> <s> her attempts to rubbish this very important and well-researched document cannot disguise the fact that there is now an indisputable direct connection between the governments economic policies and the deterioration of the national health service and the nations health <e>", "<cs> i want to take only a minute of the committees time <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the previous speaker said that the proposed system was unworkable and had not been thought through <e> <s> i can only refer them to the layfield report <e> <s> it was probably never debated as a report in either house but it went into great detail about all the options including local income tax <e> <s> if anyone is interested it is dealt with in chapter of that report <e> <s> i shall not go into all the details but layfield and foster in another publication although he had some reservations concluded that local income tax was the fairest way of raising the money <e> <s> they had discussed the poll tax and all the other taxes <e> <s> they concluded that the fairest method would be local income tax because it would be accountable and the burden would be spread much wider than poll tax <e> <s> it is not regressive as is the flat poll tax <e> <s> it is linked to peoples incomes <e> <s> that system seems to be fairer and people can understand it as being fairer <e>", "<cs> i think that it is accepted that it would be a combination of both <e> <s> we cannot reject the idea <e> <s> it is all very well to chortle but i am exhorted by the prime minister and others to get into the th and st centuries and accept computerisation <e> <s> the noble lord lord young who is in charge of employment constantly tells us that there is where the new jobs are and that it is what is now happening <e> <s> we must forget all about the old manufacturing industries <e> <s> the governments whole ethos is based on computerisation <e> <s> the committee should not blame me i am just trying to work on what the government advocate <e>", "<cs> i want to support the amendment and the wording it suggests <e> <s> it is my understanding and i have listened to most of the debate that the governments reason for calling it a community charge was to bring about more accountability <e> <s> they took away the poll tax tag and the property tax tag and they called it a community charge <e> <s> people would be accountable to the community and therefore there would be some logic in calling it a community charge <e> <s> that is what they said <e> <s> in the case of the owners of second homes who might not even live in that community i understand that there are second homes in scotland alone of which the owners of are not usually resident in scotland those people will have no accountability to the community and so the government cannot use that argument for them <e> <s> but they will have to pay for the property which is in that area <e> <s> therefore it is a property tax <e> <s> there is no way they can wrap it up to make it anything except a property tax for that second home <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not my intention to intervene but before the noble lord sits down i should remind him that he should not appear to gloat in any way over the passage of this bill <e> <s> there are some doubts in the minds of many people and some questions which remain unanswered <e> <s> they may well be answered in another place when the bill is discussed there <e> <s> with all due deference to the noble lord he was not correct when he said that the companies were fraudulent or have gone suddenly silent <e> <s> many doubts remain <e> <s> they would undoubtedly have been expressed had there been more time to discuss the bill in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> strange as it may seem i wish to support the members of the committee opposite who are raising the importance of the schedule <e> <s> i must confess that i have a foot in both camps <e> <s> i am considering the matter from the scottish point of view and i am also much concerned about the bill that we have been threatened with as regards england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move

like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord trafford for his excellent maiden speech excellent far beyond my expectations <e> <s> i am very grateful indeed for what he said <e> <s> i should also like to thank your lordships for the constructive criticisms that have been made <e> <s> they have supported the bill in principle and i know the noble lord lord young will understand as most of us do the difficulties involved in getting any private members legislation through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no provision in the bill for that kind of function at all <e> <s> on the contrary we would all hope that there would be complete cooperation from the voluntary organisations in the compilation of these reports and statistics <e> <s> that has not been lacking so far in many of the fields in which i have been involved and i do not think it will be lacking in this field <e> <s> on the contrary i think they will be only too pleased to co-operate in the way the bill envisages <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage i do not want to prolong the debate much longer but to agree with the amendments put down by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i apologise to her for not hearing her opening remarks <e> <s> i do not want to go into the convoluted arguments that we heard from the noble lord lord campbell of alloway about the governments intentions and so on <e> <s> i share his concern about the absence of regulations <e> <s> we are discussing something that does not exist at this moment not for the first time <e> <s> it is difficult to envisage or to anticipate what might be in regulations when trying to discuss such details <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point we know that those changes were brought in to save million <e> <s> it was purely a saving exercise <e> <s> we also know that more than half that million was to come from this per cent <e> <s> the intention of the government was that over half the savings on the social security benefit side were to come from

in the country about the issues raised by the noble lord lord allen <e> <s> although <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that it is also very difficult for patients who are ill who have lost their jobs and who are dependent on legal aid to conduct cases of negligence <e> <s> will he look into those aspects of the matter and try to persuade doctors that their job does not finish when the patient has the accident that they ought to be prepared to co-operate with organisations such as action for the victims of medical accidents in order to assist patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move

publications <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us some examples of the restrictions that he would like to see taken away from the safety precautions etc <e>", "<cs> my lords when could a bill recieve royal assent under false pretences <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord is not suggesting that this bill was an example of that <e> <s> can he give us an example <e>", "<cs> my lords will

join in the tribute paid by the noble viscount lord buckmaster and others to char and the voluntary organisations shelter and shac which have waged a ceaseless campaign for years or so trying to improve the conditions of homeless households and single people <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the first time that i have followed the noble lord lord trafford in your lordships house and it does not embarrass me one bit to be able to say that i agreed with the sense of most of what he said as i did on the previous occasion when i followed him <e> <s> i should like to be able to say the same about the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter but i cannot agree that the main reason for introducing the bill is the changing scene <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that what the noble lord says is entirely true <e> <s> however i hope we shall go into that in committee <e> <s> by that time rather than skirt over this perhaps we shall be able to see the size of the problem and the exact nature of the proposals that are before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join those who have congratulated the minister on his introduction of the regulations this evening <e> <s> i should also like to agree with my noble friend lady jeger in her remarks on income support and family credit and with the other noble lords who have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some hesitancy that i rise to speak in the gap because i recognise that i am probably the only speaker in the debate so far who at the moment is not directly involved in housing affairs in scotland <e> <s> however i recognise that the proposals contained in this bill have much wider implications <e> <s> it has always been my hope and there is still a chance that those people who are involved in legislating for other parts of the united kingdom may well be influenced by the discussions that we have on this bill in your lordships house <e> <s> i have also had a long connection with housing matters homelessness and so on throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> as a result i have received much correspondence about this bill and others that may come on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord banks for giving us the opportunity to focus attention on what other noble lords have quite rightly described as an excellent and extremely important report <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it is nothing to be sniffed at <e> <s> i was not implying that the noble lord was sniffing at it <e> <s> i do not blame noble lords opposite who have probably never experienced a queue in a supplementary benefit office or filled in one of the forms that the noble lord lord winstanley mentioned <e> <s> he raised a few laughs and part of his speech was a bit lighthearted <e> <s> the position is not lighthearted <e> <s> i know that he will agree that there are thousands of people in this country who are absolutely terrified at the sight of a form <e> <s> there are many more thousands i have met many of them who are heartily sick <e> <s> they cannot claim benefit because they cannot fill in the form and they are too ashamed to admit to anyone that they cannot do so <e>

lords i am happy to justify what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord carter who has supplied me with a piece <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords stricture <e>

reform bill cuts across the provisions of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that people are concerned about the alternative local financial provisions being made under the education reform bill and that it will be more difficult for local authorities to find the resources necessary to carry out their duties under the act <e> <s> that will apply particularly if the ilea is abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the reply of the noble earl <e> <s> however will he acknowledge that it is now eight years since the government first promised to produce this national advisory standard on means of escape and fire-related safety measures in houses in multiple occupation bearing in mind that two and a half million people live in houses in multiple occupation whether they be bed-sits lodgings or bed-and-breakfast accommodation and that per cent <e> <s> of those have unsatisfactory means of fire escape <e> <s> the governments own report a recent report said that that was an indictment of national and local housing policy over many years <e> <s> can we accept that the reply of the minister is a firm booking for this year <e>", "<cs> my lords why has it not taken as long in scotland <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall not detain the committee for long <e> <s> i feel that i must get straight in my own mind one or two points which have been made by a very eminent spokesman from the government benches for whom i have the greatest respect <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord hailsham in his contribution i do not wish to quarrel with him about the constitution appeared at one stage to be threatening the committee or perhaps some members of the committee on the government benches who might be inclined to support the amendment with the horrible things that could or might happen if the committee votes for an amendment such as this to a bill which has come from another place <e>", "<cs> i shall not take it any further <e> <s> the matter can be judged on its merits <e> <s> the noble and learned lord also discussed whether we are dealing with a charge or a tax <e> <s> of course it is a tax <e> <s> that was rightly proven by the two noble lords speaking earlier in our debate <e>", "<cs> i am concerned with the simon community which is a mission for the caring of those on skid row <e> <s> they are probably the most unfortunate people within the community <e> <s> those who no one else wants to help are helped by the simon community <e> <s> i suppose that it is a quasi-religious organisation

minister tell us what has been the impact on the statistics that he has just quoted of the transfer of the long-term unemployed from the unemployed register to social security benefit <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those who have contributed to this short debate and i thank the minister for replying in such a constructive way <e> <s> i readily admit that i had reservations when i put down the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful for the way in which he dealt with it <e> <s> i am grateful too for the consideration which he said will be given to the amendment and i look forward to something helpful being proposed between now and report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that matters are going smoothly <e> <s> did the minister see the report in the scottish newspapers of last week that canvassers or collectors whatever they are had to leave the strathclyde district for reasons of assault <e> <s> i believe that was the reason <e> <s> they were afraid of being assaulted or they had been assaulted <e> <s> would the minister care to comment on that situation because i understand that it is difficult to replace these persons <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister was asked whether he was satisfied that the provisions are adequate <e> <s> is he aware that some people have been in hospital for more than months after they could be discharged <e> <s> that cannot be satisfactory <e> <s> is he aware that the supply of houses that should be available to these people has almost dried up because of government policy on rates and the governments refusal to release money to local authorities from the houses that they have sold <e> <s> the authorities could adapt or replace houses in order to rehouse these people who could then leave hospital <e> <s> he cannot be satisfied can he <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all who have spoken in this debate and for their welcome to the bill however guarded <e> <s> i am also grateful to the minister who has replied to the questions raised by noble lords on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that later this year we expect to receive the first reports due under the aids control act <e> <s> can he tell us whether his department has made any contribution or will he making any contribution to those reports <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the main difficulties in collating statistics is the fact that very often single homeless people cannot register with a gp and many of them have to use the hard-pressed emergency provisions in hospitals <e> <s> as has been said where they have been an in-patient they would be discharged into the same accommodation which may even have been a cardboard box with no after-care facilities at all <e> <s> may i suggest to the minister that he issues some <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble baroness say that if this amendment was carried languages would be taught almost willy-nilly and that head teachers would introduce languages that did not matter or did not have to be taught <e> <s> i do not think that it was intended but i took it to be an insult to head teachers to suggest that they would teach languages whether or not they were relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords in a few weeks time parliament will rise for the long summer recess after <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to a previous question the noble earl mentioned the private rented sector <e> <s> does he recall that the government survey on privately rented houses in multiple occupation in revealed that there are million people living in rented accommodation in the private sector in houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> the report described the conditions under which they lived as being an indictment of national and local government policy over many years <e> <s> in view of the fact that the present housing bill does nothing to redress that situation can he tell us what plans the government have to deal with the serious situation that the report threw up <e>", "<cs> i am neither a lawyer nor a barrister and i hesitate to enter a field which seems to be being taken over by lawyers <e> <s> however i have been a tenant of a private landlord and i know literally thousands of other tenants of private landlords <e> <s> i have dealt with them for many years in the whole of my public life and i was active throughout the whole length of the rachmanite era <e> <s> i was responsible for at least trying to do something in the other place about the legislation which was being used by the gangsters <e> <s> i must confess that i did not find it too difficult <e> <s> when i listened to the noble lords lord coleraine and lord renton i did not find it too difficult to align amendment no <e> <s> with clause i i thought it improved matters <e> <s> as i see it clause deals with the <e>", "<cs> i must stick to the point <e> <s> our amendment adds to clause the point that tenants will be given the same protection <e> <s> when we amend clauses and we shall have improved the protection they get <e> <s> therefore it is important that clause should contain the facility or the measures for giving that kind of protection to the new assured tenancies <e> <s> that is causing a great deal of concern <e> <s> i certainly do not know many private tenants with the simplified view held by the two noble lords <e> <s> it does not add anything if they get the added protection or if this protection is added to what is already becoming in most peoples minds a bit of a trick <e> <s> the assured tenancy will very shortly as soon as possible become an assured short-hold letting <e>", "<cs> the bill simply repeats the words of that existing act <e> <s> consequently it repeats the same inadequacies <e> <s> we shall probably never agree on that but that is how i read the bill <e> <s> if it repeats the words of the protection from eviction act it has not improved anything <e> <s> the bill has left that act as it was <e> <s> i thought that act was inadequate at the time and i still think it is inadequate now <e> <s> that is why i support this provision to amend clause of the bill <e> <s> if that is perverted thinking then i plead guilty to it <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have not given the impression that i am concerned only with penalties <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will read the amendments and will see what i am attempting to say about them <e> <s> the amendments would shift the burden of proof from the tenant where it lies at the moment and on to the landlord <e> <s> the landlord should be made to prove more than he has to at the moment and tenants should have more safeguards <e> <s> i hope i did not give the impression that i was concerned only with penalties <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said that one can blame the new breed of bad landlords on the rent acts <e> <s> how does he explain rachman who was a product of the rent act <e>", "<cs> i apologise for again interrupting but on this point the noble earl quite rightly says that rachman was interested in having empty properties for sale <e> <s> i accept that it would have been better if these measures had been available at the time and better still if they had been strengthened in the way that we suggested <e> <s> however he failed to mention that the prices which can be obtained for property are now far higher than even rachman could have dreamed of obtaining by emptying his properties <e> <s> so the incentive still applies to emptying the property for sale <e>", "<cs> the right to establish assured tenancies has existed since <e> <s> has the minister any statistics of how many assured tenancies have been taken up in london <e> <s> half of those in the private sector are in bed-and-breakfast and are outside rent control <e> <s> can he tell us how many assured tenancies have been set up since <e> <s> if we had that information we could decide for ourselves how the bill will set up some more <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gardner believes that it will produce many more assured tenancies <e> <s> from where will they come if they have not come since in the london area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that this is the best time for me to speak to my own amendment no <e> <s> a to which the minister has referred <e> <s> it gives me no joy to have to discuss these amendments on a friday afternoon <e> <s> i would far rather have been somewhere else on a friday afternoon <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i have had long discussions with officers of the house at the highest level and i am informed that they would wish me to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and a because it is for the convenience of the house that they should be linked with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should then wait until the appropriate amendments come up for a vote and move the amendments formally at that stage with no further debate <e> <s> as i understand it that is the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i would find it difficult to open the mouth without opening the jaws but i accept why my noble friend says <e> <s> this is an awful argument to get into on a friday afternoon but my noble friend is probably right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been discussing this matter since half past eleven this morning <e> <s> we have finalised it and i shall not go into the matter again <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no

beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the unsatisfactory reply from the noble earl i shall divide the house on this amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i find the discussion a wee bit unreal particularly the remarks of the minister <e> <s> in the real world we know and almost unanimously critics of the bill have said that this shorthold or assured tenancy will be a dead letter before very long <e> <s> landlords will have no incentive to let on this basis when they can have an assured shorthold tenancy <e> <s> they will all go for the shorthold because it gives them an outright power to do a number of things <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord expand on a point that he mentioned <e> <s> he said that he was concerned about getting homes for the people who most needed them <e> <s> that is my concern also <e> <s> there are million homeless people <e> <s> how will the premium <e> <s> the maximum rents and all the other incentives to landlords that the noble lord lord bellwin mentioned ease the problems of the homeless <e> <s> most of those million homeless people are on supplementary benefit or its equivalent <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i am always very interested to listen to the noble lord lord trafford <e> <s> we have listened to each other for a number of years now and he always puts some interesting points <e> <s> when he reads what he has just said and his comparison of a compulsory purchase order with hats i think he will find that on reflection it is one of the most interesting ideas yet in the field of housing <e> <s> i imagine it will create a great deal of interest among those who are about to be involved in these circumstances <e> <s> the fact that hats being compared with compulsory purchase orders might raise another few questions <e>", "<cs> it can apply only for a limited time <e> <s> no doubt we shall have this argument later when dealing with the alleged tenants choice procedures <e> <s> the tenants who will live in the area of a hat will have real fears of becoming assured tenants <e> <s> when the hat disappears they will become tenants of other landlords as i understand the bill <e> <s> they will then lose the security of tenancy which they had with the local authority <e> <s> that automatically means increased rents and there is no doubt about that <e> <s> the minister may say that that is not true and tell me that i am wrong but i know that i am right <e> <s> someone once told me that he had a notice in his office which stated i know that i am always right <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go into the tercentenary because we may well have differences of opinion about what we are celebrating and whether we should celebrate the tercentenary from where i stand <e> <s> i do not want to be drawn into that argument yet <e> <s> perhaps one day i may be <e> <s> i was concerned <e>", "<cs> i shall not come between the two front bench spokesmen except to say that i support my noble friend <e> <s> he said exactly what i would have suggested in reply to the noble lords original remarks <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly mainly to ask a question of the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> can the noble lord give some indication of the governments thinking <e> <s> i find it extremely difficult to believe that they have waited until this moment to give us any information on the question of charity commissioners reports and statements recently published <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister saw the report in the <e>", "<cs> i can understand that the noble lord cannot see the point <e> <s> i said that <e> <s> there are a number of people who cannot understand what the bill is about and why tenants should be worried about it <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> there are people who do not understand how or where council tenants live and how they feel <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may raise a point on the role of the electoral reform society because it seems that we are just glibly passing over the matter <e> <s> it would appear that the electoral reform society is now working for the landlords or for the applicants <e> <s> its representatives will go and see the tenants canvass them and collect the votes on behalf of the applicant <e> <s> i point out to the noble earl that there are cases at present where landlords have started canvassing applicants <e> <s> there is already pressure being put upon tenants to abstain or not to vote or to vote the way they do <e> <s> how will those same applicants or landlords employ the electoral reform society and what will he the employment relationship between the society and the landlords <e> <s> why have not the tenants access to the same organisations <e>", "<cs> the noble earl constantly mentioned in his reply though he did not do so when replying to my previous question that housing associations will be the alternative landlords <e> <s> is it not relevant for him to say whether or not it will be legal for housing associations to buy up chunks of council property <e> <s> if it is illegal for housing associations to buy up such property as was suggested by the charity commissioners then this whole argument and every reference to housing associations are surely invalid <e> <s> i ask the minister can he now tell me whether it is legal for housing associations which are registered charities to engage in the wholesale buying up of property that is inhabited by people who are not in need of housing but who are already housed <e>", "<cs> i must say that i welcome the statements which have been made especially the reference to old age pensioners and the disabled living in accommodation which is larger than they may need for many reasons <e> <s> indeed the minister outlined one or two such reasons <e> <s> however he then spoilt it all by referring to a gentleman living in a penthouse <e> <s> in all my years of experience in dealing with housing i have never heard of a fellow living in a penthouse in mayfair claiming housing benefit <e> <s> of course i may be wrong but i shall be interested to hear whether the minister can supply details of the number of such cases <e> <s> i shall be quite happy if he wishes to enlarge upon the mayfair case <e>", "<cs> i must say that it was a good try by the minister to clarify the situation but it did not convince me <e> <s> further i do not think it will convince the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour who made a most excellent point about something which <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down the argument about regulations is one that we constantly have whether it concerns social security or any other matter <e> <s> we never see the regulations <e> <s> they are never produced in time for us to look at them with the bill or even shortly after the bill at any stageto say that we have to wait until the unknown regulations which may contain all sorts of ridiculous and outrageous propositions are available before we can comment on what we think ought to be stated in the bill is ridiculous <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will accept that that is what i said or meant to say <e> <s> one of the problems is that this will not in future be recognised as the acceptable rent for housing benefit and the rent can go sky high <e> <s> the figure is almost immaterial now <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however it does not take us much further <e> <s> i had hoped to hear the noble earl say that there would be some kind of approval of the organizations <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a danger <e> <s> appears to me to be a question <e> <s> is there not a danger that the societies will be seen to be less than impartial thus encouraging that incentive <e>", "<cs> my lords i made notes while the minister was speaking i have merely glanced at them <e> <s> it is a sad fact that whenever <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a sad fact that ministers and noble lords opposite jeer whenever the problems of tenants of housing associations are mentioned <e> <s> would it not be better if they listened and became involved in some of these serious problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i too briefly want to support this amendment <e> <s> most of what i wanted to say has already been said far more eloquently than i could have put it <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord seebohm the right reverend prelate and other speakers <e> <s> housing associations which we have all supported i have supported them ever since they first began and the movement took an interest in housing have become totally different organisations from those to which we have been accustomed <e> <s> the reasons have been outlined <e> <s> i am strengthened in that view by discussions which i have had and correspondence which i have read recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendments <e> <s> i shall not weary the house by repeating the arguments that i put at committee and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of the stricture that the noble lord lord elton laid on us at the beginning of these exchanges but i also remember that the noble lord made a fairly lengthy statement himself earlier this week on another statement <e> <s> i should have thought that that was quite unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords i found it difficult to come to a decision about this amendment <e> <s> it is one of those very few amendments which cut across party lines <e> <s> i do not believe that this is a party issue <e> <s> however i find the government stance exceedingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord to accept my apologies as i did not hear his reply to the second part of the question <e> <s> is he yet in a position to tell the house when he expects to have the reports called for under the aids control act which had to be produced before the end of <e> <s> can he tell us when they will be available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to return to my point but can the noble lord find the information that i am seeking and perhaps write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to repeat my question <e> <s> is he in a position or when does he expect to be in a position to tell the house when the reports that were called for under the aids control act which were due to be made available before the end of will be produced <e>", "<cs> my lords how will the code of guidance that the minister mentioned be monitored <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether the new director of the council has a permanent appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also thank the noble lord for his concise explanation of the orars <e> <s> i should also like to support my noble friend lady jeger when she mentioned the timing of the presentation of the orders as well as the fact that the tragic disaster is on all our minds following last nights air crash <e> <s> for many of us that makes it difficult to concentrate on the finer details of the orders <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl reconsider his replies to the noble lord lord st john of fawsley and recommend a review of the notes of guidance <e> <s> he must be aware as i am <e> <s> that it is almost impossible in my area to find a beholder who finds any beauty in the concrete monster that is being built for the british library or for sainsburys oil rig which has been opened in camden town <e> <s> some guidance must be given to local authorities if we are to avoid a repetition of those monstrous buildings which are being put up in central london

to who are living in special needs hostels <e> <s> many of those special needs hostels are urgently awaiting from his department a reply to their representations about the future financing of that scheme and an immediate assurance that there will be no worsening of the financial conditions until the department has deliberated on the representations <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the answer to the original question the effect of interest rates on the current housing situation the fact that people per week are having their homes repossessed because of mortgage default <e> <s> that figure is expected to rise very shortly to about people <e> <s> those people are joining ever lengthening queues for non-existent public housing <e> <s> in the latest figures that i can find people were

"<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept that whatever changes are made the cooperation and the involvement of local authorities will be absolutely essential in this new set-up <e> <s> how does the minister explain the governments intention not to invite local authorities to be represented on these bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that we shall not be able to discuss all the alternative routes in this house that what we will discuss will be british rails preferred route and that that will be the only information in front of us <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that his replies give a false picture to all those people <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the reply given to my noble friend lord molloy does the minister not agree that in view of the ever increasing numbers of homeless people and those in bed and breakfast accommodation and the demand for more rented accommodation it is time to review the policy of wholesale selling without there being some kind of replacement housing for rent <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question <e> <s> can he assure us that the per cent <e> <s> will be raised to the present inflation rate

properties but that figure is out of date <e> <s> can he give the figure for the number of private houses which have stood empty for some time including government-owned property <e> <s> he will find

or even five separate forms may go to each household depending on how many adults are in the house <e> <s> is he aware that the study made no allowance for publicity or training and no allowance for the fact that local authorities estimate that the number of staff will increase from to an increase in bureaucracy of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that my questions not assumptions were based on a local government survey which covered over half the local authorities compared with a study of out of authorities <e> <s> therefore my assumptions must be more firmly based than are his <e> <s> is he aware that in birmingham the authority has already taken on extra staff more bureaucrats whose number the government were pledged to reduce <e> <s> the authority plans to send out forms <e> <s> does he accept that more forms will have to be sent out per household compared with the one form that was sent out for the rates <e> <s> the number will be multiplied in the case of the poll tax <e> <s> those are not assumptions those are facts <e> <s> does he not accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lord longford on inititiating this debate <e> <s> rather like the noble baroness lady cox my own interest in the subject goes back to the time when i was an apprentice engineer when there was no such thing as a formal training scheme and apprentices had to find their own courses after work <e> <s> i attended a number of polytechnics and benefited greatly from their courses not only technically but from studying life in general <e>", "<cs> my lords will computerisation improve the collection of statistics concerning poverty so that ministers are better informed of the numbers involved <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the thirteenth major social security bill since <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter quite rightly took the minister to task for calling it a small bill and almost underplaying it <e> <s> it is in fact a fairly hefty bill <e> <s> although not as hefty as bills on some other subjects this legislation contains enough meat in one clause to occupy quite a number of clauses in any other bill <e> <s> i do not see any justification for the underplaying by the government of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the question mentions low-cost houses to rent <e> <s> will the minister tell us what he considers to be low cost <e> <s> in the area where i live the average cost of houses coming onto the market for rent is somewhere in excess of per week <e> <s> if one adds to that electricity water gas and the coming poll tax housing costs themselves go above per week <e> <s> how does that help the thousands of people in bed and breakfast accommodation and the hundreds of thousands of homeless people who are waiting patiently for resources to be released to local authorities and housing associations to allow truly low-cost and affordable housing to be built <e>", "<cs> my lords do the ministers figures include inner london estimates because no borough in inner london will be charging less than each for the community poll tax <e>", "<cs> i think that the proposals in the bill are much worse than that now and certainly merit the reconsideration for which my noble friend has asked <e> <s> not only does the proposal now apply to unemployed people but as i understand it under the act the age has been reduced to so that is five years less <e> <s> that was in an attempt to include women <e> <s> we had to make sure that we catch everyone in the cut-off <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i follow his reasons but is he in fact saying that this deduction is really a tax on thrift <e> <s> of course a person who only has unemployment benefit is worse off than someone who also has an occupational pension <e> <s> is the noble lord then saying that one should not have an occupational pension beyond a certain amount if so we shall take some of it back <e> <s> are the government saying that one should not be thrifty <e> <s> that is a strange policy for a government which are pushing occupational pensions <e>", "<cs> i support these amendments <e> <s> i shall not go over the arguments or the points that i raised on second reading <e> <s> as has already been said we consider that the word actively is unnecessary having regard to the various restrictions that already exist <e> <s> i pointed them out at second reading <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat them now <e> <s> they are sufficient <e>", "<cs> the government are not agreed <e> <s> that is why we have put the amendment down <e> <s> i am saying that people are actively seeking work and the noble lord is saying the same <e> <s> we know that most people are indeed actively seeking work so why put the word in <e> <s> if it is not there we still understand what it means <e>", "<cs> because if one can say we do not think and we have found some obscure regulation that you have actively sought work last week we are suspending your benefit that will happen <e> <s> a survey was taken of appeals against suspension of benefit and were found to be in error but the benefit had been suspended <e> <s> it can take anything from three to nine months to have that benefit re-instated <e> <s> if it is re-instated the fellow has won his case but that is a long time just because somebody said we do not think you were actively seeking work <e> <s> he was proved wrong at the end and we were right but it has cost that man a lot of hardship and distress for himself his wife and his family just because that word does not have to be there <e>", "<cs> they are all dead <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> most of what i wanted to say has already been said but i certainly support the return if that is what it is it is an attempt to return and the reintroduction of the system that existed <e> <s> the changes were designed to place people in board and lodging or bed and breakfast accommodation on the same basis as people in self-contained accommodation <e> <s> from what we have heard today and what we know by nobodys imagination could one compare the squalid conditions in which most of these people live in the so-called hotels referred to by the noble baroness nobody could say that that amounts to the same as living in self-contained accommodation <e> <s> to suggest it is utter nonsense <e> <s> if only for that reason i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i misinterpreted the noble lord i apologise <e> <s> however i do not think that i did <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that the noble lord said that this provision was not the right way to achieve our objective and that all we are doing here is to reintroduce the premium that existed before for people living in these squalid conditions <e> <s> i support wholeheartedly the move to reintroduce the premium <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made the point about cost <e> <s> he has said more than once that the government were being generous in their allowances <e> <s> a few minutes ago he said that he could not lawfully go to the dss and say how much may i allow <e> <s> what is the sum i am supposed to give <e>", "<cs> that figure is per week <e>", "<cs> yes i was <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for replying and i am also grateful to all those other members who would have participated had it not been for considerations of time <e> <s> i must confess that i am very disappointed first that the minister as is his wont blames the local authorities and particularly the london local authorities <e> <s> but i said to him that these local authorities and again particularly the london local authorities have to know what levels of benefit would attract the full per cent <e> <s> government subsidy <e> <s> that is important to london local authorities who are in dire straits as it is and who are not looking forward to further problems with the community charge and about how much of this will go into the community charge <e> <s> there are whole problems that local government is facing in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that no one body can solve the problem <e> <s> but will the minister accept that all the bodies trying to solve the problem including the housing corporation have had their finances and subsidies slashed by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct the minister <e> <s> my figures or the figures from his documentation show that the housing corporation was allocated million in <e> <s> for it has million that is a reduction of million no matter how one adds it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply although he will not expect me to say that i am delighted by his words <e> <s> is he aware that his reply this afternoon will have done nothing to eliminate all the doubts that have existed in the voluntary sector over the past few years about their future <e> <s> the smaller organisations which do most of the hard work outside like the westminster branch of the mind organisation with three small hostels are extremely concerned about their future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say how much publicity will be given to the reply he has given today as regards the conditions that will exist in future in hostels for the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords both <e> <s> the report also provided evidence that most adolescents in scotland who buy alcohol appear to buy it unchecked and most of them from supermarkets <e> <s> i cannot go into the details at this time of night i wish that i could <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> i am in fact paraphrasing rather than quoting exactly <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i did not mention that point at this stage <e> <s> i said that the procedure that exists now is open to abuse by collusion between an under-age purchaser and a friendly operator at the check-out <e> <s> it is not the same point as that mentioned by the noble lord but it is the point that i am making <e> <s> it makes it more difficult for that kind of collusion to take place if the under-age person has to be checked <e> <s> he has not now to be checked but if he has to be checked in the future there will be less likelihood of that kind of collusion <e> <s> and of course there will be the force of law with its penalties and so on to back that up <e> <s> so it must be more difficult <e> <s> probably it will deter most under-age drinkers who have been getting away with this practice because of a friend <e> <s> they will find that the friend will now lose his job and all sorts of complications will arise <e> <s> that is the point that i was making <e> <s> we may well come to the other point later on but at this stage to save time i am bound to say that the fact that the adult has to be checked and indeed the whole operation has to be checked puts some kind of responsibility on those who do not have it now <e> <s> there is the force of the law behind it and they know that it is there <e> <s> young people will be less inclined even to try some of the practices that they have attempted up to now <e> <s> so i believe that there would also be some kind of restraint on those practices <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an exceedingly interesting debate albeit a bit truncated <e> <s> i do not suppose noble lords would expect me at this time of night to be able to reply to all the points that have been raised in the course of this debate without at least studying the report of the proceedings in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply and the detail that he has mentioned <e> <s> i deliberately mentioned in my remarks the current approach to ageism and age <e> <s> the ministers reply simply restates old myths that is the dead end <e> <s> there is a great school of thought that accepts that age expectancy is far longer now than it was when the noble lord lord ennals first introduced his mobility allowance <e> <s> that is a factor that has to be taken into account <e> <s> the pension rules the discussions and arguments and the implementation in some places of flexible retirement means that people can work beyond and can become injured beyond <e> <s> they could qualify for the mobility allowance in all kinds of circumstances beyong <e> <s> therefore that must be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the sum of per week given to people on family credit does not leave much scope for choice <e> <s> will he also accept as the noble baroness said that that has meant a great increase in the consumption of junk food by children who cannot afford anything else <e> <s> is it not time that the government began to think of imposing a national standard of nutrition for school meals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that the abysmal performance of british rail management in the recent dispute points to the need for a really good look at retraining for british management throughout industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those noble lords who have participated in the debate on the amendment and i wish to deal with some of the points that have been raised <e> <s> however before doing that and without getting into the area of the second reading debate as we seemed to be doing at one stage and repeating what we said at second reading i am bound to say that the point that was perhaps not adequately made during the second reading debate as the noble and learned lord lord fraser of carmyllie has just said is that the original intentions of the bill were a shop within a shop <e>", "<cs> the questionnaire concerned all aspects of under-age drinking under-age drinking in public access by under-age people to drinking and lack of supervision of the sale of alcohol <e> <s> the concern of those people in scotland covered all aspects <e> <s> we in england might not like the scots taking that view <e> <s> they may be a different community and much more strict in some ways than their english counterparts but that is what happened <e> <s> there is sufficient support in the communities in scotland for such a measure <e>", "<cs> the noble lord quoted the year-old age group from the table and i have just repeated what he said <e> <s> i was listening very carefully <e> <s> i do not quarrel with that <e> <s> those are points in debate <e> <s> one picks out points that one likes and leaves out other points <e> <s> however in this case we have to look at all the points <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble baroness whether her amendment no <e> <s> is in place of the existing section a in the bill or in addition to it <e> <s> it seems to me that if that is inserted into the bill and the rest is left intact there is a danger of contradiction between the two parts <e> <s> the noble baroness amends the second part with her amendment but then leaves the second part in the bill <e> <s> i should like the noble baroness to clarify whether that is her intention <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as i do almost at the end of the debate i can probably dispense with some of the remarks i intended to make <e> <s> however i should like to begin by congratulating the minister on his promotion and paying tribute to his predecessor the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e> <s> he took much flack from this side of the house and no doubt the new minister will take just as much hopefully <e> <s> we try to be constructive and we know that he will try to be helpful but i congratulate him all the same <e>", "<cs> it is nothing to do with my noble friend thank goodness otherwise i should have to scrap my quote <e> <s> however that committee was set up years ago <e> <s> it produced a report which contained some ominous warnings about the growing burden of caring for the elderly <e> <s> but that comment could have been made days ago because the same kind of findings emerge from bureaucrats who are now involved in such situations <e> <s> the majority of members of the committee proposed that the pension age for men should be ultimately raised to years of age and for women to years <e>", "<cs> my lords i might not be here then <e> <s> one would have to look at the new circumstances <e> <s> i have not based my view on equality of age on the premise of the noble lord <e> <s> i am not basing it on the fact that there will be a shorter or longer life expectancy <e> <s> it is a question of justice <e> <s> it was never based on that to begin with <e> <s> i am basing it on justice in the present circumstances <e> <s> given a completely new set of circumstances i would not be totally inflexible <e> <s> in fact i have stressed that i am for flexibility in this issue as in many others <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i think that she misquoted me or i hope so <e> <s> i certainly did not think that people should retire at <e> <s> i am in favour of a flexibility in retirement but the pivotal age should be <e> <s> the basic pension should be payable at <e> <s> there should be an adequate pension at for those who need it or require it or who must retire <e> <s> but for the rest of us i agree entirely with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one question on the linking of the means test to the housing benefit <e> <s> housing benefit has already been changed nine times since it was introduced <e> <s> does that mean that as the tapers change some people who were means tested and who were just outside the limit will now be inside it <e> <s> can the minister tell us that there will be some sort of stability as regards people who have been given grants if this measure goes through <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that my memory does not go back the years to which the minister referred in his reply but years <e> <s> we were told that it was a complex issue under discussion <e> <s> we are still receiving the same reply <e> <s> can he recall that the secretary of state for social services in said that the government accepted the principle of ending discrimination between the sexes <e> <s> it was not a question of whether but of how and when <e> <s> i submit that the european directive and the report of a select committee of your lordships house have given us the how <e> <s> we are asking the minister now to say when <e> <s> having accepted the principle the complexity has gone <e> <s> will the minister now tell us when the principle will be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the figures for bed-and-breakfast accommodation stood at and that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> i agree that we have had a good innings and i shall not prolong the business <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of homelessness always brings forth a response from government speakers about the obscenity of empty properties <e> <s> every time someone mentions homelessness it is said always to be the fault of local authorities which are keeping their houses empty <e> <s> we have explained a hundred times the numerous reasons that can force a local authority to keep some <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to add my thanks and congratulations to my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree that there are very few people who will accept his interpretation of the benefit of wheel clamps and car towing <e> <s> on the contrary most of us consider those measures to be counter-productive in that clamped vehicles are left for days on the side of the road at the point of the original obstruction <e> <s> the towing vehicles themselves are an obstruction for an hour or more while it is sorted out which vehicle should be taken away <e> <s> nobody i know will support the views expressed by the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords how did the minister make that comparison without knowing what british directors earn <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that i agree with him that the change in housing benefit is not the only factor involved although of course it is one of the main factors <e> <s> there have also been changes in the rate rebate system <e> <s> the poorest tenants now have to pay per cent <e> <s> of their rates whereas before they paid nothing being entitled to a per cent <e> <s> rebate <e> <s> there have been massive increases in rent because of reductions in subsidies by her majestys government <e> <s> is the minister aware that rates have also increased as a result of government policies and impositions on local authorities and also that heating charges have increased quite dramatically again because of new legislation privatisation bills and so on <e> <s> is he aware too that water charges have increased <e> <s> i could go on <e> <s> but those are some of the factors that have pushed up the rent arrears of council tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords extreme difficulty is being experienced in coming to grips with administration <e> <s> it is not the sort of administration the minister is thinking of <e> <s> it is a question of how to adminster inadequate social security benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that his statement on government policy on homelessness is to be welcomed <e> <s> recognition that the problem is mainly in the south-east and in london is welcome news to most of us <e> <s> but if we accept his figures of new homes and new lettings making together new houses by the figure is nowhere near the per year needed to meet the existing shortage <e> <s> we also need billion urgently for the repair and refurbishment not only of empty properties but properties that are rapidly deteriorating <e> <s> can he inject more urgency into the future statements of the secretary of state with regard to the statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me no pleasure to detain the house further on this order <e> <s> however i would ask those noble lords who are waiting for the next debate to have patience and tolerance for those people who are interested in the northern ireland situation and who have no other opportunity to air those views <e> <s> it has already been said that it is not an order in the normal sense of the word <e> <s> it is a fairly massively sized bill <e> <s> it is being rushed steamrollered through both houses of parliaments <e> <s> as the noble lord lord fitt has said it went through the other place at half past one in the morning and here it has been sandwiched between other very important subjects in which a number of people are extremely interested <e> <s> it is not a very satisfying procedure <e> <s> it gives me no great pleasure to know that i shall incur even further the wrath of my noble friend lord houghton who has been patiently waiting all day long to speak on his bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords explanation <e> <s> i remind him that i also have long experience of that part of scotland and therefore his comments are not strange to me <e> <s> however i am trying to compare the two situations <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord answered his own question when he said that he agreed that the situation in scotland was not as bad as that in northern ireland <e> <s> there there is a different set of circumstances and a different situation <e> <s> there were instances of non-segregation at primary school level in scotland <e> <s> some children received religious education apart from their lessons in the integrated situation <e> <s> however the situation in northern ireland is not the same as it was in the west of scotland <e> <s> it is much more difficult and complicated <e> <s> therefore the problems are more complex <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby on introducing the bill <e> <s> i certainly respect and admire his vast experience and great gifts as a parliamentarian <e> <s> i speak in the debate as a catholic <e> <s> my noble friend lord houghton would not expect me to apologise to him for that <e> <s> i do not have a medical background so i do not profess to be an expert on the medical aspects of abortion or embryology <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister enlarge on the reply that she gave to my noble friend lord mellish which was that tower hamlets has not presented an attractive proposition to teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that her complacency about the adequacy of the present arrangements will not be shared by millions of people up and down the country <e> <s> they will certainly not be happy with the replies that she has given to some of the very pertinent points that have been raised <e> <s> a per cent <e> <s> increase over months is per cent <e> <s> over months <e> <s> we continue to say therefore that is the rate of annual increase <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers replies do not bear any relationship to the facts <e> <s> these facts come not only from shelter but from surveys up and down the country <e> <s> the ministers statistics were even more selective than the ones he accused shelter of producing <e> <s> the housing act has failed in its alleged objective of producing more housing for rent <e> <s> landlords are now finding it easier to obtain evictions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that landlords are now finding it easier to obtain evictions <e> <s> is he further aware that there are now more illegal evictions than ever <e> <s> does he accept that homelessness is on the increase <e> <s> does he further accept that the houses that are being emptied as a result of the provisions of the act are not being returned to the rented sector but are being sold <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister see a recent television broadcast which dealt with these problems in scotland <e> <s> if he did how does he explain the position of crofters who receive no local services <e> <s> they have no street lighting no street cleaning and so on <e> <s> how does he justify charging those people personal poll taxes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we would obtain a more efficient ambulance service if the government were now to agree to send the claim to arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what proportion of that increase in spending results from an increase in the number of claimants and what proportion results from an actual increase in benefits taking into account the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there has been widespread agreement on his remarks about colin wallace and the inquiries that are about to take place <e> <s> we would all accept that some inquiry must be made there although we shall have to wait for a month or perhaps more for the calcutt inquiry to report <e> <s> however does the minister accept that the problem goes much deeper than that as has been said by noble lords on both this and the other side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house whether there was an appeal against the planning decision in the case of the canterbury reservoir <e>", "<cs> i become more confused as the discussion goes on and i am trying hard to come to terms with some of the expressions and the points that are being made <e> <s> however i was not confused when i listened to the noble lord lord ashbourne moving the amendment <e> <s> it appears to be a reasonable attempt to tidy up an untidy provision <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has explained the point quite adequately <e> <s> however what becomes the act and the statute are the words in the bill and not his explanation <e> <s> it seems to me that if he accepts the point made by my noble friend lord kilbracken then that word should be in the bill <e> <s> no one will read the noble and learned lords explanation <e> <s> people will read the bill <e> <s> if the bill is wrong and allows this malpractice then the bill should be altered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that constructive reply but is the noble baroness aware that among those families are to be found some of our most challenging social educational and housing problems <e> <s> does she accept that a firm government commitment to a package of measures is needed to support such families not just a treasury directive aimed at making absent fathers fulfil their legal responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness dislikes the criticism from this side of the house <e> <s> is she aware that our criticism is aimed at the constant nil-cost approach to social security benefits taken by this government <e> <s> is it not that single minded non-caring nil-cost approach that has worsened the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness ask her right honourable friend to have another look at the remodelling because it has resulted in people throughout the country having their number of hours help reduced <e> <s> it is true that they may well receive some minimal housekeeping help but the time has been reduced to less than an hour on the basis that housekeeping is not seen to be important <e> <s> other people have had their applications for the services that they have identified turned down <e> <s> that point is particularly important with regard to arthritic people who rely on the housekeeping and cleaning services to enable them to get around and do the things that they can do <e> <s> will the noble baroness take another look at the effect of the remodelling on those people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that information <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned that the vast majority of people on housing benefit will already have qualified for the maximum rebate on their rates <e> <s> can he tell the house what provision the government intend to make for those people who are in receipt of rate rebates and who live in an area in which the poll tax will be higher than those rates <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> charge if i make myself clear would still be the same <e> <s> in other words does he agree that their benefit will be further eroded because the per cent <e> <s> rebate on rates that they receive will probably be less than the payment that they will have to make for the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords the maximum rebate is per cent <e> <s> many thousands of people receive that per cent <e> <s> which means that they now pay per cent <e> <s> however per cent <e> <s> of the rates will amount to less than per cent <e> <s> of the poll tax <e> <s> in other words they will pay more poll tax than they currently pay for rates <e> <s> can the minister say whether those people will be compensated for that increase <e>", "<cs> i was becoming rather depressed when listening to some noble lords <e> <s> however the right reverend prelate has restored some of my confidence because he has introduced the moral issue which should transcend many other arguments that we have heard but apparently does not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has underlined what i have said <e> <s> we can go on and on with further legislation and further discussion and probably less evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that a high inflation rate spawns higher wage claims and that higher wage claims and higher wages increase inflation <e> <s> how does he explain that <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has backed a winner this time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that so far her reply has been very disappointing <e> <s> she has simply repeated what her right honourable friend the secretary of state has said much of which has been rebutted <e> <s> the rest can be the subject of negotiation <e> <s> the noble baroness has still not replied to the question or is she saying that the simple answer to the question is none <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that since the registered homes tribunal began operating in over cases have been heard <e> <s> that includes many cases of serious incidents of abuse against vulnerable residents <e> <s> in addition the poor condition of the homes and the inadequacy of the local authority resources for alleviating the problem have been mentioned <e> <s> will the new powers to which the minister referred assist in for instance introducing a national standard of contributions for residential homes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that we have already had instructions in a dss leaflet document paper whatever one calls it issued in january to local authority associations <e> <s> that document stated that it is highly unlikely on the basis of the experience in scotland last year that landlords will reduce charges to take account of the abolition of rates <e> <s> that is the governments advice which was given in their own document in january this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that constructive reply <e> <s> does he accept that it does not go anywhere near enough to solve some of the problems <e> <s> he has not helped and will not be helping the claimants whose applications were refused last december and for these desperate people the social fund is a last resort <e> <s> unless he can say that the government are introducing some element of retrospection in their directives to the local fund officers those people will not be helped <e> <s> would it not be more honest at this stage to lift the cash limit altogether and to change the directives so that they state that future applications are dealt with on the basis of needs and circumstances not just on the discretion of a local fund officer <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister a simple question <e> <s> what will be the position of those people to whom payments have been refused <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to return to the question of accountability <e> <s> the noble lord said that the main aim of the poll tax is to make local authorities accountable <e> <s> is it not a fact that three-quarters of the expenditure is controlled by central government <e> <s> does the minister not agree that there is no accountability from local authorities on three-quarters of the total expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble baroness for giving us the opportunity to discuss the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that in constituencies where the actual poll tax is higher than the governments assumed poll tax rebates and transitional relief will be worked out on the governments assumptions and not on the actual figure <e> <s> that will mean that thousands perhaps millions of people will pay more poll tax than the government are pretending that they will <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking my noble friend lord carter for initiating this debate and at the same time i should like to sympathise with the noble lord lord joseph in his frustration at not having enough time to develop the points that we should all like to develop in a debate such as this <e>", "<cs> i am not a lawyer <e> <s> will the noble earl clarify this point <e> <s> he mentioned civil courts procedure for the repayment of loans <e> <s> could there not come a stage in the procedure where the student could find himself in contempt of court for which offence he could be imprisioned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the further example of the city of canterbury <e> <s> it has announced an increase of - per cent <e> <s> which raises the average rent of to per week <e> <s> how does the minister justify that for people who do not receive rent rebate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a direct result of government interference in the form of the local government act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the interest rate is working <e> <s> is he satisfied therefore that one of the criteria for that judgment is that thousands of people can no longer afford to live in their houses which have been repossessed <e> <s> is that what he calls working <e>", "<cs> my lords given that some clubs will be hard hit by any further increases in expenditure how long will they have to appeal against those revaluations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised to hear me say that i shall not follow his line of reasoning <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord claimed authorship of the whole policy when he spoke on the local government finance bill when it went through your lordships chamber in may <e> <s> the noble lord claimed that he had invented the poll tax and had persuaded the cabinet to adopt it <e> <s> therefore he was bound to come out with some propaganda in favour of it <e> <s> the noble lord said that no one yet knows who will be entitled to rebates or how much they will get <e> <s> but in the next sentence he said that one in four people will be entitled to rebates <e> <s> how does the noble lord know who will be entitled to rebates if no one else knows that <e> <s> that puts the whole matter into context <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> does the minister accept that those of us who take an interest in these matters welcome the abolition of the earnings rule as indeed we welcome the publicising campaigns just mentioned <e> <s> is the minister also aware that there is little evidence to suggest that those campaigns on the demographic changes had any effect on the majority of employers to employ older workers <e> <s> will the government consider legislation to end age discrimination in recruitment as an important first step to changing the minds of employers regarding the advantages of employing older workers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is it not a fact that debates so far on the implications of an ageing society have focused primarily on the social security burden and the prospects of meeting the financial costs of the demographic change <e> <s> does not the ministers reply seem to indicate that what is needed is a government-sponsored comprehensive survey of all the aspects and implications of an ageing society and is not the best way of doing that to set up a ministerial committee to look at the effects of an ageing society on the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not reply to or did not accept my suggestion for an inter-departmental ministerial committee <e> <s> the supplementary questions have all tended in that direction <e> <s> will the minister not now reconsider and support the proposal for this inter-departmental ministerial committee to look at all aspects of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join other noble lords in congratulating my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey on initiating this debate <e> <s> at the tail end of a debate it is inevitable that i have had to throw away bits and pieces and replace them with other bits and pieces <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in the strange position of agreeing with almost everything that the previous speaker said <e> <s> i seldom agree with him but i agree with most of what he said this afternoon <e> <s> i well recall his stint when he was minister for pensions and his contribution in that field <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that when the chancellor announced the rebate scheme in the budget he boasted that people would benefit from the formula <e> <s> will he confirm that since then the dhss has conceded that only people will receive any benefit most of whom will receive minimum benefit which will make little or no difference to their poll tax charges <e> <s> does he agree that the poorest households which under the old rate rebate scheme paid nothing at all will now have to pay per cent <e> <s> of the poll tax at an average of a year <e>", "<cs> my lords we have the example of the second reading of the social security bill which took place a few weeks ago on a friday <e> <s> there was a lack of attendance and interest at that second reading debate <e> <s> that bill concerned one of the biggest spending departments in the government but because the second reading took place on a friday it did not receive the attention to which it was entitled <e> <s> is the noble lord the leader of the house not concerned at that <e> <s> if the trend is to have second readings on fridays is there not some merit in the concern that has been expressed by myself and by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> is it not possible to reconsider allocating a wednesday for the second reading of the environmental protection bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> i appreciate the governments hand in this as i appreciated and welcomed the ministers recent statement in another place that their policy was to continue to refuse to recognise the proclaimed so-called republic of northern cyprus <e> <s> he said that it was illegally declared and that the government would not recognise it <e> <s> that statement was very much welcomed and appreciated so far as it went <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press the noble lord for some further examples of what he considers to be the next step forward in this process of finding a settlement <e> <s> will he say what he considers to be the next step rather than just simply saying that we shall continue to support the united nations <e> <s> in what way can we take the next step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in reply to a previous question he told us that it takes between five and years for any change to work its way through <e> <s> yet a few moments ago he told us that the immediate effects resulted from the poll tax and other taxes <e> <s> it did not take any time for the mortgage and poll tax increases to be seen in the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that his answer will be disappointing to say the least to the organisations which provide special assistance to homeless groups refugees home owners the single homeless one-parent families and ex-offenders <e> <s> what criteria were used to cut the section grants to those people <e> <s> there has been a cut of at a time when homelessness is higher than ever and when experienced counselling <e>", "<cs> my lords in his replies the noble lord mentioned on a number of occasions that grants were being given to organisations helping young people who are sleeping rough <e> <s> no organisation has been doing that job better and more consistently than char <e> <s> we all know of the work that that organisation has carried out <e> <s> can the minister say why the grant to char has been cut by <e> <s> can he further say why all the organisations received application forms for the renewal or increase of their grants in late february which had to be submitted by the beginning of march <e> <s> the organisations did not know until th april that their grants had been cut <e> <s> i am still puzzled how the organisations were categorised and what were the criteria used <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there are no instructions on my razor blades when i buy them as to what i should use them for <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment <e> <s> it is useful to go back to how it started <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear has given me that opportunity by talking about the difference between those with children and those without them <e> <s> this benefit was introduced in place of a married mans tax allowance <e> <s> it was never introduced as a social handolt but was introduced to make a distinction and equity between those who had children and those who did not <e> <s> it was a deliberate tax policy to produce that kind of equity <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord says that the amendment would cost million drawn from social security does the noble lord not agree that that sum would have been paid as tax allowances <e> <s> had we left the tax allowance with the married man with children has the noble lord calculated how much that would have cost <e> <s> has he also deducted it from the million which he alleges would have to be spent <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves the point is he aware that these amendments were available on the th <e> <s> i saw some of them actually dated the th <e> <s> moreover i am sure that he must have seen them <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain the committee much longer or to indulge in a long debate on clause stand part <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to answer two questions which arise from the clause <e> <s> why has it been necessary to specify renal failure as a special case <e> <s> there must be many other conditions i could think of them if i had time which would be equally open to a similar specification <e> <s> renal failure has been specified and that point should be clarified <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will be able to answer that question <e> <s> secondly why is there no special appeals procedure included given that the attendance allowance board will be deciding who is terminally ill and who is not <e> <s> there is an appeals procedure but it could be long drawn out <e> <s> i wonder why there is not a special speeded-up procedure given all the special circumstances of those sick people <e> <s> why could it not be two weeks from the beginning to the end of the procedure given the urgency of the cases <e> <s> perhaps he could answer those two points why renal failure has been spelt out and why there is no special appeals procedure in relation to the boards designations <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment <e> <s> i confess that i did not fully understand the implications until i listened to the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth who so ably moved the amendment <e> <s> on reading the proceedings of the other place and from reading various letters since then i had thought that the assurances given there were adequate <e> <s> the minister assured the committee in the other place at col of <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will accept that i appreciate the work that he did in the old days of the workmens compensation scheme <e> <s> however i had hoped to hear him say tonight that he opposed the abolition of the reduced earnings allowance <e> <s> its abolition virtually takes us back to those days of litigation argument responsibility and negligence of the workmens compensation scheme <e> <s> i thought that we had moved on from that <e> <s> beveridge certainly moved a chunk from that and as the noble lord rightly said he moved another piece in the right direction <e> <s> we are now going right back for no other reason so it appears than to save more money <e> <s> it will not improve anything <e> <s> in the main the abolition of the rea is another cost-cutting exercise <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord accept that although we understand that the present participants in the rea scheme will not lose entirely their allowance will be frozen at the level at best so that ultimately they will lose <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment <e> <s> i shall no repeat the arguments of the noble earl in his excellent opening speech on the subject <e> <s> he pointed to an experience that many of us have had when working in voluntary organisations and seeing the effects of a whole number of social security acts over the past to years <e> <s> i do not need to add to what he said <e>", "<cs> when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i also speak to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by saying that i understand and appreciate the objectives behind the proposals <e> <s> i can readily accept those proposals <e> <s> however in so far as the objectives seek to safeguard the interests and provide greater protection for members of occupational pension schemes i hope that the minister will share my concern <e> <s> there is a real possibility that the proposals as they stand could operate adversely on some schemes they may even threaten the existence of some schemes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the minister said <e> <s> i shall welcome a copy of the reply that he sends to his noble friend on the question which i also asked concerning what happens to the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that the commission is to ask for comments <e> <s> are those comments to be limited to hospital staff or will they be addressed to a wider catchment area of patients within the hospital region <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that among those potential voters are many men and women who served this country well in the last war who have spent all their working lives in this country who have paid taxes and national insurance contributions in this country like the rest of us and who are now spending their retirement with sons or daughters in canada <e> <s> how will the governments election material convince those people of the equality of their case as opposed to the pensioners who live in other countries in regard to annual increases in their pensions <e> <s> how does the minister justify the discrimination against pensioners who live in canada in regard to annual increases in pensions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i simply referred to some of those voters who will be canvassed by his government <e> <s> i asked the minister how his government will explain to those voters why they are being discriminated against <e> <s> potential voters who live in america finland turkey and israel receive annual pension increases whereas pensioners living in canada do not <e> <s> how will the government justify that to those voters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord mountgarret mentioned the dramatic decrease in the price of beef has the noble baroness any idea when that decrease will work its way through to the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that answer <e> <s> what steps are being taken by the government to inform those people and the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is quite correct when he says that this is uprated from september to september <e> <s> it means and certainly has in recent years that the pension has never really increased in line with the cost of living and inflation <e> <s> for instance last year it was increased by - per cent when inflation by september stood at - per cent <e> <s> we never make up that loss between the april and september period <e> <s> is there not therefore a further argument for a biannual increase <e> <s> with computerisation is should not be too difficult to review the increase every six months <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect i do not think that the noble lord has understood the issue <e> <s> we can never make up the lag <e> <s> the uprating last year was for instance - per cent with inflation running at - per cent in september <e> <s> it has now increased to - per cent <e> <s> what happens to the months between april and september <e> <s> from april this year the uprating was - per cent and inflation is now per cent <e> <s> god knows what it will be by september <e> <s> and the increase next april will perhaps be - per cent <e> <s> however we have still lost the few months in between <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one very short point to make <e> <s> as other speakers have said we have heard the arguments time and again on child benefit <e> <s> however in my view one point has not been made sufficiently clear <e> <s> the noble baroness lady young and the noble lord lord carter start from the wrong position <e> <s> child benefit was not an offshoot of the family allowance it was a tax benefit <e> <s> it was a straightforward transfer from the married mans child tax allowance to be paid to the woman <e> <s> that makes the matter far more complicated <e> <s> we dodge that factor <e> <s> it is very easy to say that it is a benefit and eventually we can erode it until we cut it out as with maternity benefit and funeral allowance <e> <s> but child benefit did not originate in that way that is the problem which has to be discussed <e> <s> it was in effect a tax allowance <e> <s> it was taken away from a married man because there were great arguments about men who did not give enough to their wives for the childrens upkeep and so on <e> <s> it was voted upon and agreed generally that it would be better to make the payment to the wife and the tax allowances were adjusted accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is another factor which contributes to the brain drain namely the age discrimination factor <e> <s> a number of people have to leave this country because they are too old at or younger <e> <s> would she care to comment on the effect that that has in forcing people to leave this country to take employment elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us what are the immediate to medium-term commercial and planning development interests in that area and how much they have influenced the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that it appears to be becoming easier for pubs to obtain planning permission to extend car parks and for new pubs to build bigger car parks <e> <s> is that in the best interests of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl able to say how many of those young offenders were given custodial sentences under the vagrancy act <e>", "<cs> the minister said that a local authority cannot have a contract with itself and therefore it cannot make a contract with its direct service organisation <e> <s> surely that is not true <e> <s> the direct service organisations are bound under law to submit estimates for the various contracts <e> <s> if they succeed they are awarded a contract <e> <s> therefore they enter into a contract with their local authority and agree to pay the necessary sums <e> <s> surely the minister is wrong in saying that a local authority has no contract with its direct services <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> he must be aware that although governments come and governments go that kind of reply goes on for ever <e> <s> does he agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not answer my question <e> <s> i pointed out the relationship between occupational schemes and the state scheme <e> <s> it is a definite relationship <e> <s> to a large extent occupational schemes depend on the state scheme and since they will now certainly yesterdays question time pointed in this direction have to implement the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that the community health councils will have a role <e> <s> a great many people fear and the reply from the minister and the delay involved will do nothing to alleviate that fear that those councils have been given no role and nor will they be given a role <e> <s> they fear that no criteria will be laid down and that eventually they will be chopped off <e> <s> the real fear is that they will be dispensed with altogether because no role is laid down for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that informative and detailed answer <e> <s> can he confirm that the figures show a dramatic increase in recent years in the number of prosecutions and convictions under sections and of the vagrancy act particularly in the metropolitan <e>", "<cs> my lords in his first reply to me the noble earl mentioned a number of offences <e> <s> he mentioned indecent exposure and prostitution in the streets and so on <e> <s> is he aware that alternative laws are capable of being used to deal with the criminal aspects of this social problem <e> <s> my point and that of the noble lord lord alexander is that we must take criminalisation away from homelessness <e> <s> that must be removed from the statute book and the sooner the better <e> <s> the legislation was introduced to deal with social problems in the aftermath of the napoleonic wars <e> <s> it is generally accepted that those wars are finished <e> <s> we should now make sure that the legislation is abolished and we should use the modern up-to-date legislation to deal with the criminal offences <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down i wonder whether he could help me to understand this amendment on <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that when the government constantly review statistics it causes a great deal of concern <e> <s> for instance we have all been concerned about the almost monthly review of the unemployment statistics <e> <s> are we now to be treated to a similar review of increases in inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to speak for much longer than i shall speak <e> <s> i had prepared a long speech but after having read the reports listened to the arguments and sat in the chamber throughout this debate i have changed my mind <e> <s> i and many other people are puzzled by one issue <e> <s> i have deferred and held back because of the number of experts that we have heard this afternoon <e> <s> we have heard experts from the religious medical and political fields <e> <s> what came across is the difference between them <e> <s> i have no medical expertise apart from almost a lifetime spent on health committees and in advising and counselling for advice services in the voluntary sector <e> <s> apart from that i was an engineer <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who do not have a great deal of medical knowledge must be careful <e> <s> if noble lords read the conclusions in part v they will see that my comments are correct <e> <s> the contention that there is a difference and that the existing bill will lead to abortion on demand up to birth did not come from any pro-life organisation <e> <s> it came from an article in a paper with which i do not agree that is the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for your support and i shall try to return the compliment some day <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the minister equate her policy of accountability and fairness with the fact that she has just said that the shortfall will fall on those who pay <e> <s> further how does she equate the same two items that is accountability and fairness with the governments current policy of capping those authorities who go against the wishes of the electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to check his reply to my noble friend lord hatch <e> <s> it seemed to me that in his figures he announced a decrease of nearer per cent <e> <s> than per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to repeal the vagrancy act except for the provisions of that act relating to insulting behaviour towards females to repeal the vagrancy act and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords referring back to the noble lords reply about the sleeping policemen humps in the road perhaps i may ask this <e> <s> is he aware that there is worry in many areas that these so-called sleeping policemen hinder the passage of ambulances and other emergency vehicles <e> <s> the sleeping policemen are placed only a few feet apart from each other and are a constant hazard in long roads where ambulances have to carry very ill patients <e> <s> will he consider that point <e>", "<cs> my lords while the government use their best endeavours and discuss free calls will they include in that discussion the possibility of providing free calls for servicemen serving in the gulf when making calls to their loved ones at home in line with facilities allowed to their counterparts serving in similar forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however does she recall the concern expressed by the secretary of the conservative-controlled association of county councils about the governments booklet on grant-maintained schools entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the anxieties that have been expressed by people who understand the statistics <e> <s> they believe that the metropolitan police are top heavy <e> <s> there are far too many chiefs and not enough indians <e> <s> there are far too many people in offices and not enough on the ground <e> <s> many people do not think that we are obtaining value for money from the way in which the existing finances are used and the existing personnel is deployed <e> <s> will the minister consider conducting a review of that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell me what happened to the promise made in an election address by the then candidate for st pancras north now the right honourable member for huntingdon that the government would replace the rates with a just tax which would be levied on the basis of ability to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is not a very satisfactory reply <e> <s> it is almost the same reply that he gave many months ago when the issue was raised for the first time <e> <s> if as a result of the judgment occupational pension schemes have to provide equal treatment for men and women and in particular equal pension ages is it not essential that the state scheme should give a lead <e> <s> what discussions are taking place about the equalisation of retirement ages in the state pension scheme and when will the government be in a position to announce their decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i must come back to the point <e> <s> the noble lord says that the issue has nothing to do with the state pension scheme <e> <s> the two cannot be divorced <e> <s> it is almost impossible for occupational pension schemes to operate without taking account of the state pension scheme <e> <s> the two are interlinked <e> <s> because pensions are a long-term business and need a lot of planning pension schemes have to know what the government plan to do about the state pension scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness meets the disablement organisations she will learn that some people on mobility allowance cannot afford a car any more because of the poll tax <e> <s> there is one other disadvantage which she has not yet mentioned <e> <s> disabled people who live in high poll tax areas in specially adapted units of accommodation do not have the same mobility as others in the community <e> <s> they cannot move to a cheaper area because they will not obtain similarly adapted accommodation <e> <s> they are therefore trapped in high poll tax areas <e> <s> what is being done about them <e>"]
