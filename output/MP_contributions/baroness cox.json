["<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for raising this question on continuing education because it is a subject on which i feel so strongly that is has given me the courage to make my maiden speech and i beg the indulgence of your lordships house on this occasion <e> <s> continuing education as has already been emphasised is a matter of great importance indeed of necessity <e> <s> it is necessary for at least three reasons first to enable people to adapt to a society characterised by continuous technological economic and social change secondly for people to realise their potential to attain personal fulfilment both in work and in recreation and thirdly it may also be necessary at a basic level to teach skills such as literacy or numeracy to those who for one reason or another are lacking them <e>", "<cs> my lords i will begin by expressing my appreciation to the noble lord lord kennet for introducing this bill <e> <s> it draws our attention to a matter of great concern which has both medical and social implications <e> <s> i should like to speak in strong support of this bill as both a nurse and a sociologist <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying that i share the concern of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby in that i too am worried about unsolicited material in the form of political propaganda of any kind being sent to schools and other educational institutions <e> <s> this is because i like him am deeply averse to schools and colleges being used as bases for political indoctrination <e> <s> again this is because i believe it is antithetical to the principle of pluralism which underpins the traditional concept of education in a free society <e> <s> by pluralism i mean that on controversial issues pupils and students should be provided with the evidence and arguments associated with different positions and should be encouraged to make up their own minds <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many aspects of the gracious speech for which i should like to express my support <e> <s> however i will confine myself to the reference to education <e> <s> i was delighted to hear that the government will <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by offering my sincere congratulations to the noble lord lord graham on his eloquent authoritative and impassioned maiden speech <e> <s> i would like to contribute to the debate on this important topic which has been raised by my noble friend lord beloff by discussing that aspect of local government which accounts for well over one-half of local government spending <e> <s> i refer of course to education <e> <s> i shall use as an example the inner london education authority as its future is currently under discussion <e> <s> i readily acknowledge of course that some of its problems are associated with its own peculiar situation <e> <s> however they reflect wider issues and the problems are also important in their own right <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my great privilege and pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord ennals on his informative eloquent and enjoyable maiden speech it was indeed incontrovertibly non-controversial <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that his speech bore all the marks of his great experience in many fields and this experience will surely enable him to make many wide-ranging valuable and frequent contributions to your lordships house <e> <s> i therefore speak for us all when i say that we anticipate those speeches with great pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak again on this important subject because as i said previously i believe it draws our attention to a matter of great medical and social concern <e> <s> speaking as a nurse and as a sociologist i should like to repeat in an abbreviated version of my previous contribution my support for the noble lord lord kennet in the reintroduction of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to speak in strong support of this bill on a number of grounds <e> <s> they are first and foremost because its provisions can be used to further this governments commitment as outlined in the gracious speech at the opening of this parliament to promote educational standards secondly because the bill will encourage local education authorities to respond more flexibly and sensitively to educational needs and thirdly because the proposals are couched in a form which retains the sacrosanct autonomy of local authorities with safeguards to ensure that this is not the thin end of the wedge of centralist control <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to add my voice to those who are concerned about the inclusion of the words mental health very largely merely to endorse the arguments that have already been put <e> <s> i am deeply concerned because though i understand the arguments that a girl may be very depressed perhaps even to the point of being potentially suicidal because she perceives herself as having a physical abnormality if she does not actually have such a physical abnormality it seems a very inappropriate treatment to subject her to a mutilating operation <e> <s> surely the more appropriate treatment is that which has already been endorsed that she should be referred to those people who can help her with her mental disorder <e> <s> i think that that is particularly important because the very nature of the situation as it pertains to someone who explicitly has no physical abnormality is that it is a delusion or depression <e> <s> therefore even if she were to have the operation which i am in no way suggesting she should have it is likely that some other focus for the depression would emerge in due course <e> <s> thus the operation itself would very likely not be therapeutic but would just leave permanent physical damage <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the fact that the government have made so many constructive recommendations which have improved the wording as i think the noble lord lord kennet agrees and that they have given the bill such strong support <e> <s> i take the point that has just been made that it would be a pity if the final points raised and reservations made this evening could not be considered a little further at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to oppose this amendment because it runs contrary to a central feature of the bill which is precisely as has been admitted not to increase expenditure on education by making new money available but by redeployment at the margin <e> <s> i for a number of reasons suggest that it is entirely justifiable not to make new money available <e> <s> first i should like to remind your lordships that in real terms more is being spent now on education than <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that this amendment could cause more problems than it solves <e> <s> i appreciate of course that the local authorities have every right to be consulted and they will indeed be consulted <e> <s> the secretary of state has ensured a position for them in the consultation process <e> <s> indeed they will be partners in any decisions that are made <e> <s> more fundamentally the whole purpose of this bill is precisely to give the secretary of state some money to use at his own discretion <e> <s> this is indeed desirable because in britain our education system has such a high degree of local autonomy that it is among the highest in the world in terms of the local autonomy enjoyed <e> <s> i think the noble baroness lady lockwood has herself acknowledged on a previous occasion the advantages of this high degree of local autonomy in meeting local needs but she also acknowledged some concomitant disadvantages in that sometimes the local education authorities may overlook the countrys national economic and industrial needs <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised to hear the noble baroness lady lockwood arguing for a reduction in the size of the education support grants because she together with her noble friend lady david are among those who have very clear ideas of very good purposes to which these grants should be put <e> <s> in later amendments they are each advocating earmarking at least per cent <e> <s> of amounts available for specific and indeed very worthwhile purposes <e> <s> so i suspect that there must be some ambivalence in their position if they are simultaneously advocating earmarking money for eminently good causes and at the same time recommending a reduction in the overall amount which might mean that such money might not be available to fund those very worthwhile causes <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest that it seems most unlikely that the consideration underpinning this amendment will come about <e> <s> it has already been indicated that there will be no shortage of good ideas for projects which would merit the education support grants <e> <s> this is instanced not only in amendments yet to be discussed but also in the suggestions which have been put forward in a very tentative way in discussions in another place <e> <s> also if we look at the past local education authorities previous initiatives have led to a very widespread response <e> <s> for example the manpower services commissions technical training initiative has been taken up very widely <e> <s> therefore i beg to suggest that the concern underpinning the amendment has no real substance <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest sympathy for the nature of the project specified in this amendment particularly for that project that would enhance the integration of children with special needs into ordinary schools <e> <s> i also have sympathy for that amendment which would help to improve maths teaching a need which is so urgently highlighted in the cockcroft report in the institute of maths survey and professor prais recent research which shows that british children on the whole are two years behind their german counterparts <e> <s> here is an urgent educational need <e>", "<cs> i think i appreciate that the intention behind this amendment is to involve those with a direct and legitimate interest local education authorities teachers and parents and also i think to meet an equally valid concern the need for evaluation and report on progress of projects which have been funded <e> <s> however as far as the first of those concerns goes there is surely already ample provision made for consultation and it seems not at all desirable to set up a quango which could well lead to many delays and confusions <e> <s> so far as the second aspect evaluation of how the money is spent is concerned this i believe is an extremely important matter and i have in mind the funding of research projects which sometimes do not necessarily see fruition <e> <s> i think there is a need for accountability on the projects which have been funded but i think this would be particularly difficult for the proposed body to do <e> <s> i would suggest that a better way of approaching evaluation and accountability would be to build in mechanisms for evaluation within the terms of reference of projects as they are established and funded and particularly to make sure that the money is spent on the purposes for which it has been allocated <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that this amendment is a composite version of several previous separate amendments and as such succeeds in avoiding some of the logical and practical difficulties previously encountered <e> <s> i have very great sympathy for the areas recommended for special consideration <e> <s> i very much hope that pupils with special needs will be helped in the ways indicated and that there will be more provision of nursery education the need for which i wholeheartedly respect and recognise <e> <s> i also hope that standards of teaching in science and mathematics will be improved <e> <s> for example i have on a previous occasion drawn the attention of your lordships to the sober fact shown in recent research that british schoolchildren are two years behind their german counterparts in mathematical attainment <e> <s> that is an inexcusable situation and surely merits urgent attention <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say i am deeply perturbed by this amendment because it seems to me to be hitting at local democracy <e> <s> local authorities surely have a right to decide the kind of schools they provide and presumably these reflect the wishes of parents in their areas <e> <s> i cannot see why if they wish to operate a system where some schools select by ability they should be ruled out of court for consideration for education support grants because some members of this house do not look with favour on that type of scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given considerable thought to this whole issue since the discussion last time <e> <s> i regret that i am still not convinced that such an advisory board is necessary because it seems to me that the two objectives which it is designed to serve to secure advice from representatives of relevant interest groups and to evaluate the progress of projects are both better secured by other means <e>", "<cs> my lords in my brief contribution to this debate on this important topic i should like to emphasise some of the positive aspects of the growth in opportunities for women which have occurred in recent decades <e> <s> in so doing i do not wish to belittle the problems which many women encounter both at work and in their domestic circumstances <e> <s> there is still cause for concern in many areas especially for those who are at or near the poverty line and for single-parent families <e> <s> however others are speaking in this debate who have greater knowledge than i have especially of crucial issues concerning equality of opportunity and equality of pay <e>", "<cs> my lords like other members of your lordships house i wish to thank the noble lord lord annan most warmly for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important subject <e> <s> i would especially like to thank him for referring explicitly to polytechnics <e> <s> this is because i believe that the polytechnic sector of higher education has a particular contribution to make and because i myself owe a debt of gratitude to polytechnics <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment because as the noble lord lord kennet has said it contains the extra provisions crucial for protecting those other than qualified medical practitioners who might legitimately carry out the kind of procedure to which reference has been made <e> <s> without the amendment midwives and those training for midwifery and for medical qualifications would have been in an extremely vulnerable position <e> <s> moreover i understand that the royal college of midwives has explicitly welcomed the inclusion of these extra provisions <e> <s> therefore i believe we are indebted to those who have taken account of these considerations and i hope that they will find acceptance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i speak very briefly to say that i too hope most sincerely that this bill will now go forward without let or hindrance <e> <s> the principles underlying it have had unequivocal support from all parts of this house <e> <s> moreover matters of complex technicality and detail have been the subject of lengthy and thorough discussion and debate in earnest attempts to ensure that the spirit of the bill is reflected in the letter of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin with an apology because i deeply regret that i may be unable to stay for the latter part of this important debate for which we are so indebted to the noble lord lord hunter <e> <s> at present i am absconding from an international conference which i must rejoin no later than six oclock <e> <s> i shall be very sorry if i have to miss the latter contributions but i very much look forward to reading them in <e>", "<cs> my lords along with countless others i welcome legislation which is intended to help trade unions to become more democratic <e> <s> i particularly welcome initiatives designed to ensure that trade union leaders are representative of their members and more responsive to their wishes <e> <s> to the extent to which this bill is designed to achieve these goals it has my unequivocal support <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say whether he is confident that the reduction in numbers entering the profession will achieve the necessary adjustment in the ratio of dentists to patients and/or can he indicate whether thought is being given to a policy of voluntary early retirement for general dental practitioners <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that i welcome very warmly indeed the spirit and intention of the amendment and particularly the objective of ensuring representation of the community nursing services <e> <s> however i have been advised by the royal college of nursing that the present wording could cause some difficulties in terms of the practicalities involved <e> <s> i do not wish to take your lordships time now unless you would wish me to do so <e> <s> i believe that those difficulties could be avoided by the rather simpler wording of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it might also he preferable to consider the merits of membership of professional organisations separately from those of voluntary organisations <e> <s> i conclude by reiterating my appreciation of and support for the objectives of this amendment but saying that i must record some reservations on its detailed wording <e>", "<cs> before speaking to this amendment may i say that i welcome and support legislation designed to increase efficiency and accountability in the provision of health care and particularly to promote measures designed to enhance the quality of primary health care <e> <s> therefore in so far as this bill will achieve those objectives it has my support <e> <s> however i hope that this amendment will be considered sympathetically <e> <s> it is necessary on grounds of consistency and efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although the polytechnic of north london has suffered repeated disruptions to which reference has already been made for more than years no disciplinary action whatever has ever been taken by the governors or by the inner london education authority and that the situation is now so serious that some staff in some good departments would prefer to be relocated in a healthier academic environment <e>", "<cs> my lords since the political composition of the ilea is such that it is unlikely to take action to this effect i should like to ask whether the government might undertake a radical review or reorganisation of the polytechnics similar to that which has already taken place in london university <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand here today feeling deeply ambivalent <e> <s> on the one hand i greatly appreciate the concessions that have been made in the direction of postal ballots <e> <s> on the other i am concerned about a number of omissions that i know worry many moderate trade unionists <e> <s> i welcome the fact that the amendments proposed by my noble friends shift the centre of gravity of the bill towards the presumption that postal ballots should be the normal way of conducting elections in keeping with the amendment which was moved so effectively in committee by my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> i also welcome warmly the requirement that trade unions should compile and maintain up-to-date registers of their members and i appreciate greatly the provisions that enable individual trade unionists to take complaints to the certification officer rather than having to go directly to the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that it is one of the cherished traditions of this country that schools should not be used for purposes of political indoctrination <e> <s> could he give some indication as to whether in view of the growing body of evidence of concern about the use of peace studies for political purposes the government might be considering formalising the criteria outlined by the secretary of state in the excellent speech which he made on that topic earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join others in thanking the noble lord lord rea for giving us an opportunity to discuss this subject this evening a subject which as he has shown is of the utmost importance for our nations health <e> <s> the point has already been made that coronary heart disease is the number one killer in our country at the present time <e> <s> it causes the deaths of more than people every year or in other words of one person every three to four minutes and of one man in before he reaches the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak very briefly to these amendments and with special reference to amendments nos <e> <s> to in order to put the views of two of the royal colleges most directly concerned <e> <s> i have consulted both the royal college of nursing and the royal college of midwives and understand they support the view that if intimate body searches are to be undertaken it is clearly preferable that they should be conducted by members of the health care professions rather than by the police for the very obvious reason that appropriately qualified professional staff will be better equipped in terms of knowledge and experience and because it will be less humiliating especially for innocent persons to be searched by a member of the caring professions than by a police officer <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the organisation called the centre for international peacebuilding which houses generals for peace and whose director is their administrator has set up a registered charity called the caroline gourlay trust <e> <s> might this matter not be brought to the urgent attention of the charity commission in view of what many people regard as the blatantly pro-soviet propaganda distributed by these organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a brief contribution to this debate with particular reference to nursing <e> <s> i shall leave consideration of wider issues to noble lords who have greater experience and who can speak with greater authority than i can on those matters <e> <s> but first i must emphasise that the nursing profession is delighted that occupational health has received such serious consideration and that so many issues have been subjected to such expert analysis by the committee under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord gregson <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend the minister for that very encouraging reply <e> <s> may i draw his attention very briefly to three points which might be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the director of the polytechnic of north london resigned his post largely because of pressures from the inner london education authority to act in ways which he was led to believe could bring him into contempt of court <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that the court of governors of the polytechnic of north london had great pressure put on them by ilea to appoint the director of the polytechnic of the south bank although that was contravening their own articles of association <e> <s> finally is my noble friend aware that there are very many staff in the polytechnic of north london who are deeply worried about what has happened but who are afraid of victimisation if they make their views known to a committee of inquiry set up and serviced by ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply which is a little disappointing <e> <s> would he explain further the reasons for keeping a system going his answer notwithstanding in which over million of public money every year is given to student unions <e> <s> many thousands of pounds of that money are subsequently squandered on expenditure which has nothing whatever to do with education for example for the funding of buses and coaches for demonstrations and for donations to political causes such as funds for striking miners <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in congratulating my noble friend lord renton on introducing for debate this subject which raises to many issues of vital national importance and is timely to the point of urgency <e> <s> such urgency is illustrated by this headline which appeared not long ago in a lancashire evening newspaper <e> <s> i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to intervene <e> <s> i was making the point that where local authorities have defaulted the responsibility for making sure that they do not continue to default should be with national government not that civil defence should be centrally co-ordinated <e>", "<cs> precisely my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say whether there is any policy about the provision of information to help care staff especially nurses who may be looking after patients who could be suffering from aids <e> <s> is he aware that a number of members of the nursing profession have been looking after such patients without that information perhaps at considerable risk to themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other members of your lordships house in congratulating the noble baroness lady jeger on initiating this debate which raises so many issues of human concern and professional responsibility <e> <s> i must at the outset reluctantly offer my sincere apologies because i have to leave your lordships house shortly before seven oclock for a very long-standing commitment <e> <s> i deeply regret that i will probably be unable to hear the latter stages of the debate and i apologise especially to the noble baroness lady jeger and my noble friend lord caithness but i shall naturally read <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that i said that it is presently thought to be any time between six months and six years according to present state of knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the regulations laid before the house on th march be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> before i begin to try to answer their questions perhaps i may especially thank them for their kind and generous words of welcome and reassurance <e> <s> i also wish to apologise in case perhaps they feel a little hard done by through having such a novice to respond to the points that they have made <e> <s> i confess that i cannot think of anything harder on which to cut my teeth than minerals but perhaps i may assure the noble lords that if i do not answer their questions adequately i shall naturally be pleased to write to them subsequently <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i was just going to refer to the fact that the interdepartmental committee is hoping to make its report available shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord also asked about compensation amounts <e> <s> it is not easy to give an estimate of those amounts <e> <s> the noble lord should perhaps be aware that the regulations we are debating do not apply to any new permissions which may be granted in the lee valley or elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords one speaker has withdrawn from the list and so perhaps the house will agree that my noble friend may continue <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord swinton i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this point will become clear but in principle yes it means that that could be the case <e> <s> it is according to the parents wishes and the policy of the school <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by thanking all noble lords and noble baronesses who have been so kind in their welcoming remarks to me particularly in a situation where i seem to be batting on a very unpopular wicket unpopular at least in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that a local education authority can legally abolish corporal punishment now <e> <s> the intention is that the bill will not allow a governing body to overturn that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate very warmly my noble friend lady macleod of borve on the moving and comprehensive way in which she opened this debate <e> <s> i should also like to thank the other noble lords for their helpful contributions <e> <s> of course we are all greatly indebted to my honourable friend in another place for initiating this valuable legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the development of higher education into the s which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord rochester for their comments and constructive contributions in response to this statement <e> <s> the noble baroness said that she was very disappointed that it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord beloff for his welcome of the green paper and the very helpful comments he has made <e> <s> so far as the terms of reference of the ugc inquiry are concerned they are still under review <e> <s> but it will certainly be an external inquiry it will have an external chairman and it will not be an elected representative body <e> <s> however its terms of reference as i understand it are still very much to be determined <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put the noble lord right <e> <s> there is not a major contraction anticipated which is out of line with for example falling student numbers <e> <s> when one considers the projected planning for the expenditure on higher education until the s one sees that there is also a projected fall demographically determined through the falling birth rate of students going through <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that the demand for full-time courses is likely to stay fairly constant and will then fall by about per cent but provision for higher education for students is intended to meet such demand as will take place <e> <s> there is also intended and provided for other categories of students such as part-time students and mature students of whom full account is taken and they often receive very real benefit from involvement in higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank my noble friend for his encouraging remarks with regard to the implementation of the robbins principle in spite of the financial situation <e> <s> to try to answer the question with regard to potential closure the situation at the moment is that the government have asked the various bodies concerned with the university sector and the public sector to consider the position with regard to rationalisation and the more effective use of resources <e> <s> the ugc will be undertaking such a study so far as the universities are concerned the national advisory board will be undertaking such a study with regard to the public sector <e> <s> at the moment there is no question whatever in the governments mind of any candidates for closure as such but should that be deemed necessary in due course legislation may be required <e> <s> but that is not at the moment in the thinking of the government and it would be wrong to pre-empt the findings and the deliberations of those bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no grounds whatever for the assumption underlying the noble lords question <e> <s> the ugc is the determining body with regard to the allocation of the university funds that are made available to it <e> <s> it has been suggested in the jarratt report that there might be a review of the ugc and the government are considering that review <e> <s> but at the moment the ugc functions as it always has done <e> <s> i am sad that the noble lord feels so dismayed because the record in regard to the increase in provision for higher education over recent years has been highly commendable and i should have thought cause for a certain amount of satisfaction <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the noble lord that the total number of students in higher education to whom we all feel a deep commitment has increased from in to in and that there is a projected increase beyond that up to <e> <s> so i <e>", "<cs> my lords the future expenditure plans as they are at present outlined are for a modest increase in cash terms <e> <s> but of course that increase must be seen in the light of other general factors such as inflation and it is impossible to determine exactly what will be the relationship between the actual increase and the net increase <e>", "<cs> my lords it is impossible to ascertain in a hypothetical way the relationship in the future between an increase in actual terms and an increase in real terms because it is impossible to make allowance in the future for other factors such as inflation <e> <s> but perhaps i may point out that the government are making some specific grants in addition to current levels of expenditure to the universities and particularly on the research side to encourage research which is of such importance for our performance in the whole area of industry and technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out that the green paper is concerned with higher education as a whole and not just with the university sector <e> <s> it is very important that one considers the totality of higher education and the governments present expenditure plans if i may emphasise this point should provide sufficient resources for higher education for the current planning period to allow demand to be met at the level which is currently projected for that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to agree with the noble lord opposite i am sure we all do that access to higher education is of immense importance <e> <s> the government are committed to ensuring that there should be places available for pupils and students who are qualified in terms of formal qualifications and/or in terms of the other criteria which have been elaborated in the green paper <e> <s> the policy is such that there is a commitment to ensuring that courses of higher education should be available to all those who can benefit from them in either a university or the public sector <e> <s> as regards the question of a debate the noble lord is well aware of the normal channels through which to proceed should such a debate be requested <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the noble lord that of course everyone recognises that the development of higher education is taking place in the context of financial constraint and i have never sought to indicate anything other than that <e> <s> but higher education is i think expected to respond to that positively in terms of increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness <e> <s> one of the ways in which that has been accomplished and may continue to be enhanced is <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord annan for his contribution <e> <s> there is an intention that there should be an increase in participation commensurate to some extent with the demographic changes which will take place over the next years or so <e> <s> there is very much a commitment to greater cost-effectiveness and to a certain amount of rationalisation in higher education in both sectors the university sector and the public sector perhaps with some of that being brought about by a greater concentration of research in those universities which have a record of excellence in that subject and perhaps by a removal of some of the research which is spread rather thinly across other institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i begin by emphasising the point that the reason for the bill is to secure compliance with the ruling of the european court of human rights which obliges us to change our law in order to respect the rights of parents parents who have a philosophical conviction against corporal punishment <e>", "<cs> the government believe that it would be wrong to impose this restriction on the right of a member of staff to use corporal punishment <e> <s> each teacher has <e>", "<cs> i hope i may be able to clarify this <e> <s> as i said in responding to previous amendments subsection is about those actions which a teacher takes to protect property or people <e> <s> in both those cases such action is by definition on the spur of the moment and the precise combination of motivations may be difficult to disentangle <e> <s> for example a teacher may slap a child to use an example which has been used to stop him from running on to a dangerous road but although the prime motivation may be to <e>", "<cs> i accept this as a matter of extreme importance and i have great respect for the reservations that have been expressed <e> <s> i shall naturally be very pleased to consider the points that have been raised and perhaps will write to the noble baroness and the noble lord <e> <s> i hope to be able to explain and clarify this more effectively than i have this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i hope that on this occasion i will be able to explain it <e> <s> first perhaps i may reply to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham who asked whether the government had taken legal advice <e> <s> yes the government have taken legal advice and have been told that the bill as it is now worded fully meets the requirements of the european convention <e> <s> i am afraid that the government cannot accept this amendment because without subsection of clause a teacher might be the subject of criminal proceedings simply because of a contravention of exemption arrangements <e> <s> perhaps i may amplify that <e> <s> as the law stands at the moment a teacher committing a battery on a pupil may face proceedings in a civil court or in a criminal court if the action were to involve immoderate and unreasonable corporal punishment <e> <s> the bill does not remove the prospect of criminal proceedings where that prospect now exists but subsection ensures that no new crime is brought into being by this bill <e> <s> in other words no criminal offence is committed simply by failure to comply with exemption arrangements <e>", "<cs> were a teacher to inflict immoderate and unreasonable corporal punishment then he or she would be subject to criminal proceedings as is the case now <e>", "<cs> the arguments which relate to the amendment put forward by the noble lord in this context are perhaps similar to those which were discussed with regard to the earlier amendments of delegation of authority from a head or from a local authority to other teachers <e> <s> but i think it could be said that they apply with even greater force to restricting the right to use corporal punishment to the head teacher alone <e> <s> i think it might help if we remember that the definition of corporal punishment is necessarily broad a point which we have already <e>", "<cs> i regret that the government cannot accept this amendment because it would in effect mean that all school pupils would be liable to corporal punishment unless it were medically certified that such punishment would result in physical or psychological damage <e> <s> in practice it is doubtful whether most parents would ask their doctors to certify to this effect <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady david has said these amendments are seeking to restrict the range of pupils liable to corporal punishment even though their parents may be perfectly content to agree to the sanction <e> <s> in this particular case the ideal would be to impose a ban on any form of corporal punishment in any maintained nursery school and nursery classes and even on under-fives in primary schools <e> <s> the smack on the leg or the hand would not be allowed in the light of these amendments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond very briefly by reiterating that of course parents and teachers have <e>", "<cs> naturally i have great sympathy with the thinking behind this amendment <e> <s> it raises sensitive issues and i believe a sensitive approach is needed in any discussion on it <e> <s> but i also believe that the amendment would be undesirable in itself and because of variations in the way education authorities work in relation to statements it could well lead to inconsistencies <e> <s> perhaps i may explain <e>", "<cs> the bill does provide for an exemptions scheme covering all maintained schools as the noble lord said including nursery schools and nursery classes <e> <s> the bill is concerned with provision under the education acts and as such does not apply to day nurseries <e> <s> therefore the government must resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would naturally be willing to consider what has been said and should it seem to be helpful i shall write to the noble lord if i can add anything to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> i accept that this is an important point and without giving any commitment i undertake to consult further <e>", "<cs> as we are all well aware this bill is related to the provisions under the education acts <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i cannot give the noble baroness the answer at the moment but i can write to her as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will have a certain amount of sympathy with me as he knows what it is like to have a brief which says resist <e> <s> but i hope i have shown during the course of this debate that i listen and i am prepared to take very seriously the arguments which are put forward <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord is concerned with the relationship between the bill and section of the children and young persons act and its scottish equivalent <e> <s> section of that act concerns cruelty to a person under and has no relevance to youngsters over that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that he was prepared to return to this <e> <s> i recognise the importance of the points that he raises and in view of the complexity of the issues i shall be taking advice on them <e> <s> it might be relevant to mention at the moment that we are aware that there are cases before the european commission of human rights in which the claim is made that corporal punishment amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment <e> <s> but the government are defending all those cases <e> <s> perhaps it is appropriate to say that opponents of corporal punishment should not necessarily jump to conclusions about the outcome of those cases <e> <s> as i have said the issues are complex and there will be an opportunity to return to them <e> <s> i shall certainly take advice on the important points that the noble lord raises <e>", "<cs> each part of this group of amendments is rightly concerned with ensuring that this clause introduced at report stage in another place adequately protects a pupil from debarment under which i include refusal of admission on account of his parents wish to exempt him from corporal punishment <e> <s> we are confident that the clause as it stands fulfils that requirement but i should like to comment on the amendments <e>", "<cs> this amendment would increase the power of local education authorities at the expense of individual schools <e> <s> at present school articles of government are the means by which responsibility for the conduct of a school and that includes discipline and corporal punishment is assigned <e> <s> these articles of government vary between authorities and sometimes between schools within an authority but usually they assign ultimate responsibility for discipline to school governing bodies albeit often in somewhat imprecise terms <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that is the situation which pertains <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help by clarifying the reasons which underpin the wording of the bill as it now stands <e> <s> under the wording of the bill a pupil will be exempt from corporal punishment if one or both of his parents indicate in writing that such is their wish <e> <s> that is a straightforward principle <e> <s> it will be translated into practice through regulations <e>", "<cs> the situation can be summarised very briefly <e> <s> the punishment books recording instances of corporal punishment are kept by schools because of paragraph of des administrative memorandum which states <e>", "<cs> this clause provides simply that the order in council extending the provisions of the bill to northern ireland be subject to the negative resolution <e> <s> regulations made under clauses and will be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution in either house <e> <s> but for northern ireland it is important that we follow the same course for the order in council and i trust that your lordships will agree to the motion on those grounds that it is one of compatibility <e>", "<cs> i shall study very carefully the points which the noble lord has raised and will be very happy to take advice and write to him <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to bring the legislation into effect by january but it is the governments view that that would give schools insufficient time to review their disciplinary arrangements and to canvass the views of parents and to reach decisions about the provisions for exemptions <e> <s> it is perhaps important to remember that in the first ear of operation schools wishing to use corporal punishment will need to establish their own ways of working and will also have to canvass the views of parents of all pupils likely to be on roll at the operative date <e> <s> this is a much bigger exercise than the one which will be undertaken in subsequent years when the schools will need only to deal with each new intake <e>", "<cs> i think that this is a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may very briefly on behalf of the government echo the words of appreciation spoken by the noble lord lord mishcon and express our gratitude and appreciation to my noble friend for the excellent way in which she has piloted this most important bill through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking most sincerely my noble friend lord rodney for introducing this very important bill and for putting the case for it so clearly and forcefully <e> <s> perhaps i may also say how disappointed we are that my noble friend lord mancroft is not able to be here this evening as i know he had hoped to be <e>", "<cs> my lord i thank the noble lord for suggesting that in the interests of accuracy and i would put accuracy as the top priority in this matter it will be best if i write to him and make a copy available for members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor suggested it may be helpful to put the governments position which i shall do very briefly <e> <s> it has for some time been the policy of successive governments not to seek to advance a view in debating personal bills such as the one before us today <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady seear reminded us since parliament has passed four such bills and the government have consistently and collectively adopted a neutral position on the merits of each individual case <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware that a nuclear winter is one hypothetical <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said the home office civil defence adviser circulated those comments in response to requests received in view of a great deal of publicity which had been given to the nuclear winter theory and they formed a counter-balance as it were to the wider publicity that that theory had already obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those comments <e> <s> there is indeed a very complex range of proposals and hypotheses which are currently being considered and one of them is the so-called nuclear greenhouse theory suggesting that temperatures might rise rather than drop <e> <s> i should point out that the two major studies which are being conducted are of the first importance <e> <s> one is by the scientific committee on problems of the environment which is part of the international council of scientific unions <e> <s> the results of that study are expected later this year <e> <s> the other research is sponsored by the united states government and an interim report of that is available in your lordships library <e> <s> however i think these findings highlight the need to wait before considering the policy implications of any hypothesis <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord lord mishcon the hypothesis which had already been widely distributed contained its own premises <e> <s> the comments were an attempt to put that hypothesis the assumptions and the alleged results of a nuclear winter into a proper context <e>", "<cs> my lords i can hardly imagine a summer which would be worse than the present one <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may assure the noble lord that the government will take account of all serious research which has a bearing on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble baronesss concern but prison rules and departmental instructions already provide that unconvicted prisoners under should be kept separate from adult prisoners and from convicted prisoners as far as this can reasonably be done <e> <s> those who have not previously served a sentence in custody should so far as is practicable be separated from others <e> <s> governors have regard to those principles in allocating prisoners to cells as well as of course to the availability of accommodation and the circumstances of individual prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said it is our intention that people under should not be located in the same cell as older prisoners whether convicted or unconvicted <e> <s> if on rare occasions unconvicted under--year-olds have temporarily been placed in the same cell as older unconvicted prisoners this is regrettable and i share the noble baronesss concern <e> <s> if she knows of any particular instances i am sure that my noble friend the minister would be willing to hear of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble lords concern for the seriousness of the question <e> <s> as regards the under- population governors do their best to ensure that younger prisoners do not share cells with those who are considerably older or who have serious previous criminal convictions <e> <s> we cannot make hard and fast rules to suit every case taking into account all the factors such as age nature of the offence and state of mind so some discretion must be left to the governor <e>", "<cs> my lords the main source of the problems which are causing such concern to your lordships is the delay which takes place in the courts and the government have taken active steps in this area <e> <s> field trials of the statutory time limits provided in the prosecution of offences act will soon take place <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is providing a substantial increase in resources in terms of both judges and courtrooms for the crown courts which have suffered the most rapid recent increase in business <e> <s> very briefly perhaps i may also point out that as your lordships will be aware this government have embarked upon an extensive prison building and renovation programme which will result in two new establishments being planned as remand centres for those under <e> <s> five establishments will be local prisons <e> <s> much refurbishment work will be aimed at improving conditions in local prisons <e> <s> taken together the current proposals on building projects will provide about new places by the early s and should well help to solve these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give any information on the average length of time because it varies a great deal <e> <s> but there is certainly a statutory requirement for formal education for juveniles <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hope that the actual taking of drugs in prison would not be increased but obviously such contacts with people with other kinds of problems and records is a serious matter <e> <s> that is one of the reasons the government are so deeply concerned about the problem and are trying to remedy it <e>", "<cs> my lords unconvicted prisoners under are mainly held in remand centres <e> <s> if under-s are held within the prison itself they will wherever possible be located in a separate wing on a separate landing <e> <s> but they will always be held in separate cells unless there are exceptional circumstances for example perhaps where a father and son are both remanded together in custody <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that it is very important to make provision for bail and we believe therefore that hostels which take people on bail have an important role in reducing the remand bottleneck <e> <s> new hostels have recently been opened and we are reviewing the arrangements for assessing demand for places to see how this option can be better utilised <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a concern that we all share <e> <s> i shall certainly draw it to the attention of my noble friend the minister and i imagine that he will draw it to the attention of his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised a number of questions <e> <s> perhaps i may point out that with regard to the placement of young persons under three-quarters of those on remand are held in remand centres <e> <s> the reason they are held in remand centres is that they need to be as close as possible to their families and friends relatives and legal advisers in order to facilitate visits <e> <s> very few juveniles are remanded in custody and those who are almost always go to remand centres <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say briefly that the government cannot support the proposed amendment to the bill of the noble lord <e> <s> lord monson <e> <s> we believe that the courts must have the widest possible sentencing discretion <e> <s> we also believe that nothing less than a maximum sentence of life imprisonment would adequately express societys abhorrence of the despicable people who exploit and who profit handsomely from the misery of drug addiction <e> <s> we therefore wish this bill a speedy and unamended progress onto the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord ritchie for their comments and for their i think qualified support bearing in mind that i know and respect the reservations of the noble lord and the noble baroness about the principles of education support grants <e> <s> it is reassuring to know that on the whole there is support for the new areas now being proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords not automatically because every bid is subject to assessment to evaluation as to its appropriateness <e> <s> the noble baroness also asked me whether there has been any change since the answer of nd may <e> <s> i understand that there has been no change since then <e> <s> clearly evaluation is an important principle <e> <s> the departments letter to local education authorities drew attention specifically to the importance of monitoring and has foreshadowed the governments intention of requesting reports on the outcome of individual projects <e> <s> final arrangements for evaluation will however be a matter for consultation between individual authorities the department and her majestys inspectorate but we must have regard to the administrative burden which evaluation arrangements impose on authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords recognition of the national nursing examination board certificate is a matter for public and private sector employers of nursery nurses and for higher education institutions <e> <s> however it should in general reflect the educational content of the course <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the nneb holds firmly to the view that access to training should not be determined purely by academic ability measured by previous examination success but rather by a far broader range of abilities and personal qualities needed for success in a course of such vocational training and i think that it puts great store on the personal characteristics of applicants <e> <s> with regard to the second of my noble friends supplementary questions certificate holders at the moment go on to work mainly in the following areas at private homes as nannies as assistants or ancillaries in nursery schools or nursery classes in day nurseries or family centres run by local authority social services departments and in hospitals as assistant nurses mainly in paediatric wards and in special care baby units <e>", "<cs> my lords i would indeed agree with the points made by my noble friend <e> <s> the nneb course gives a very good training <e> <s> my noble friend may <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand at the moment the nneb validation is the qualification in itself <e> <s> of course opportunities for further continuing education are available to people who hold that qualification but i think there is nothing specific provided for them in the context of that particular occupation <e>", "<cs> indeed i do my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science is considering the judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the matter it is indeed a fact that if the inner london education authoritys contribution were reduced the total contribution from other local education authorities would increase by the same amount <e> <s> the effect on the expenditure of individual authorities would depend on the precise nature of the change in the formula <e> <s> the block grant would tend to equalise the impact of such expenditure changes on rate bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to acquiesce in the first suggestion of the noble baroness that i should draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state to the wish that he should come to a decision <e> <s> i am less happy with the suggestion that money should come from the department <e> <s> i may point out that my right honourable <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord glenarthur i beg to move that the draft pool competitions act continuance order which was laid before this house on th may be approved <e> <s> the joint committee on statutory instruments has considered the draft order and has made no comment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is clearly much more widely framed than those which we considered in committee <e> <s> we are not surprisingly opposed to this amendment because it is thorough-going in its efforts to see an end to virtually all corporal punishment outside the home whatever the circumstances whatever the views of parents teachers or other professions <e> <s> my noble friends lord arran and lord beloff have very helpfully reminded us of the context of this bill its purpose and the desirability of respecting the wishes of parents and teachers many thousands of parents and teachers have indicated a wish to retain the option of corporal punishment if and when it seems appropriate to a teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought it was absolutely ridiculous to thrash a child for letting the school hamsters out of a cage <e> <s> what i am talking about is precisely the heart of this bill which is to retain for the primary school teacher or for any other teacher the use of such appropriate physical force or corporal punishment in the broadest sense of that word as might help quickly and speedily to bring a situation back into order and to impose appropriate discipline <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of my noble friend the minister thank all who have contributed so much to this bill <e> <s> i join other noble lords in congratulating and thanking my noble friend lady vickers for piloting this vessel through very stormy seas with unfailing grace and courtesy <e> <s> i believe that not only those of us here now but those in other <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not consider such legislation to be necessary and have no plans to introduce it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the second point which is a more general one first <e> <s> my right honourable friends the prime minister and the home secretary take extremely seriously their responsibility for satisfying themselves that the security service operates entirely within the letter and the spirit of its directive <e> <s> they are accountable to parliament for that responsibility just as they are for the discharge of their other duties <e> <s> in line with the policy which successive governments have followed it is not the practice and it would not be in the national interest to disclose detailed information about security matters <e> <s> i take exception to the noble lords response to the answer which my noble friend gave on july nd <e> <s> i think that it met the points adequately <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the greatest sympathy for the comments which have just been put forward by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have an answer to that question <e> <s> i shall be pleased to write to the noble lord when i find out <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot dispute the noble lords logic <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sympathy with the points made by the noble lord and i would agree <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be aware that successive governments have taken the view that it is not in the national interest to comment on the detail of security matters <e> <s> your lordships will recall that as recently as th may at column of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble viscount for that very pertinent and helpful contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot disagree too strongly <e> <s> the director-general is responsible directly to the home secretary for the proper and the efficient working of the service <e> <s> this means that the responsibilities of ministers and of the director-general are clearly defined and unequivocal <e> <s> we should be very cautious indeed about the creation of new bodies which would risk blurring the present very clear train of responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords our proposals are at an advanced stage of preparation <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary hopes that there will be an opportunity for legislation in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords we would indeed agree that drug traffickers bring untold misery into society <e> <s> i think that everyone in your lordships house will agree that it is intolerable that even after conviction they should enjoy the proceeds of their crimes <e> <s> therefore i am sure your lordships will welcome the fact that my right honourable friend the prime minister only last monday indicated the governments intention to introduce a law in the next session of parliament to strip traffickers of their profits from the sale of these drugs <e> <s> in regard to the second of the supplementary questions of the noble lord lord harris concerning the channel islands this matter has been the subject of discussion with representatives of jersey and guernsey <e> <s> the home affairs committee have been looking into this matter and we look forward to learning their findings <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much we welcome the support that the proposed legislation has had from all benches in your lordships house <e> <s> i am afraid that i am no oracle and cannot give an indication of at what stage the legislation will be coming forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what the noble viscount means by follow through the profits <e> <s> however i assure him that we regard provision for freezing assets at or just before the time of arrest as essential to the effectiveness of the new confiscation powers <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i believe that the people working on the proposals are aware of the fact that that is a very real problem and cognizance will be taken of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness very much for that contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that a few countries most notably the united states already have legislation in this respect <e> <s> many more are actively considering its introduction <e> <s> i may also point out that that trend is being encouraged by extensive discussion of confiscation issues which has taken place in the united nations and in the pompidou group <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to comment on that suggestion but i shall draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerhy for providing us with an opportunity to discuss my right honourable friends proposals for designation under the video recordings act and his regulations on the labelling of video recordings and their containers <e> <s> perhaps i may say personally how grateful i am to the noble lord lord houghton for giving me advance notice in his own fair hand of the questions he intended to raise <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> wayland prison the first of the projects in the current programme was completed last year and is now operating at full capacity <e> <s> the new stocken prison which was completed in april has just begun to receive inmates and a third project thorn cross youth custody centre will do so shortly <e> <s> two more projects will be completed in and three in <e> <s> the remainder of the programme will come on stream as planned between and <e>", "<cs> my lords the commitment to the building programme to put us on course to end overcrowding by the end of the decade was based on long-term projections of the growth of the prison population <e> <s> the current projections published in may continue to indicate that the commitment is still intact suggesting a total population in in the range of to <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of relief of the pressure on remand places five of the schemes in the programme are for new local prisons and one is for a new remand centre <e> <s> together these will provide some additional remand places <e> <s> the creation also of new places in training prisons will help to relieve pressure on local prisons by facilitating the transfer of sentenced prisoners in the locals for whom training places are currently unavailable <e> <s> major modernisation and redevelopment work is in progress or planned at almost all the existing local prisons <e> <s> the other point which the noble baroness made is an important one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for making that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the current total estimated cost of the programme to which the government are committed is just over million <e> <s> in we plan to spend a total of about million on building new establishments which i think goes some of the way towards meeting the first of the points made by the noble lord lord mishcon and also million on building work at existing establishments <e> <s> so there is a considerable commitment of resources not only to renovation but to new institutions <e> <s> so far as alternatives to custodial sentences are concerned there is already a wide range of non-custodial sentences available to the courts <e> <s> i am sure that my right honourable friend will take note of all representations made to him by professional bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly undertake to draw my right honourable friends attention to that important point <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said i shall ask my right honourable friend that question <e> <s> i do not have an answer this morning <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be reassured to know that the home office is currently conducting an appraisal of recent american prison designs in order to assess the extent to which we ought to take account of developments elsewhere <e> <s> concerning the important question of the relationship of manpower to buildings my right honourable friend has already announced a major increase in the size of the prison service over the next few years in order to provide the staff to man the new prisons which are being built <e> <s> future manning levels are taken fully into account along with capital costs before new schemes are added to that building programme <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that the fact that the ilea has reduced the intake at highbury grove school from to places in spite of the first preferences for that school running at places represents an infringement of the principle of freedom of choice which is enshrined in the education act and also that the distress caused to the unsuccessful applicants is most regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord ennals on introducing this debate on such wide-ranging and important topics and for speaking with such verve despite his incapacity <e> <s> my brief contribution will focus on my professional interests as a nurse because so many other members of your lordships house with far greater expertise than mine on other issues have spoken on those topics <e> <s> i shall limit my contribution to a few words on three topics concerning the national health service funding nursing salaries and the effects of reorganisation on nursing <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister indicate whether in direct contrast to the suggestion put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> lord rea the government are considering following the example of chancellor kohl in condemning dr chazovs deplorable record in the persecution of dr sakharov <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble lord lord irving for giving us this opportunity to discuss the problems facing our nations schools <e> <s> my contribution will focus on two kinds of problems which are not caused by cuts or by the dispute over salaries <e> <s> the first is a result of policy and the second of the political attitudes and commitments of some teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had perhaps been able to hear what i said he would have heard that i had no intention of suggesting putting the clock back <e> <s> i was arguing for a way of looking forward which avoided precisely that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but just for the record i was arguing for something called magnet schools or specialist comprehensives which combine the best of both worlds <e>", "<cs> my lords may i for the record in two seconds say what my argument is <e> <s> i have always argued that partisan party politics should be kept out of the classroom but not that the word politics should never feature in the classroom <e>", "<cs> my lords i never mentioned exeter university <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i did not use the word university <e> <s> i said exeter teachers for peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i had been head of the department of sociology at the polytechnic and therefore i think i know very well what i am speaking about <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way in the interests of accuracy please <e> <s> the noble lord will see when he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with respect explain this to the noble baroness and put her out of her perplexity <e> <s> originally the motion was to have been on local government but as the second reading of the local government bill was due to come through yesterday it was thought inappropriate to have a debate on that subject on two successive days <e> <s> it was nothing more sinister than that <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to say a very sincere thank you to all noble lords and noble baronesses who have contributed this afternoon and this evening to the discussion <e> <s> it has been a very worthwhile and as my noble friend the minister lady hooper has said a very fascinating debate and a long one so i will not prolong my concluding remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords like other members of your lordships house i welcome many aspects of this bill <e> <s> the increased involvement of parents as governors is to be warmly welcomed as one means of helping to make schools more accountable to those whom they serve the pupils <e> <s> as other noble lords such as the noble lord lord ritchie and my noble friend lord beloff have already said a particularly beneficial feature of the changed provisions for governing bodies is the reduction in the proportions of local authority representatives <e> <s> this of course does not imply a general indictment of all those who have served in this capacity <e> <s> many have done so with great dedication and political impartiality <e> <s> but it is a sad fact of life that in some highly politicised local education authorities the complexion of lea representation has become excessively political and partisan <e> <s> the proposed changes should help to ameliorate this problem <e>", "<cs> i was talking about partisan political teaching <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that last-minute reassurance from my noble friend but before i conclude may i clarify two points which i think are of great importance <e> <s> first i should like to underline the point that was made by the noble lord lord charteris that those of us who are concerned about the misuse of political issues in our schools are concerned about them from whichever end of the political spectrum such influences might come <e>", "<cs> once again i should like to thank most sincerely all noble lords who have responded so warmly to the spirit of this amendment and made such constructive contributions about the wording as it currently stands <e> <s> let me say one word about the so-called wreckers charter which has been the subject of a certain amount of dispute <e> <s> i suggest that it is not so much the genesis of that wreckers charter which matters as the results of its being put into practice <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that that had been agreed by all concerned in moving amendments <e> <s> as one of the proposers of one of the amendments i would have been a party to that agreement and i never gave my agreement to it <e>", "<cs> that is because i was notified not consulted <e>", "<cs> may i just endorse what my noble friend lord renton has said <e> <s> i took advice about whether i had to follow that suggested grouping and was advised that it was not necessary and unless we agreed at the beginning of the grouping that it should be dealt with on that group basis they would be taken separately <e>", "<cs> may i take that cue and speak briefly in favour of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like very briefly to reinforce the arguments put forward by my noble friend lord renton for the necessity of an amendment on these lines by quoting a very small selection of examples which have not previously been mentioned in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i deeply regret to say that my noble friend has not met the point that i raised very briefly and upon which my noble friend lord renton expanded <e> <s> at this time of night it is too late to explain the reasons why we cannot say that we are satisfied <e> <s> we will not press the amendment at this hour but we shall study very carefully that which my noble friend the minister has said <e> <s> we may return with a revised form of the amendment at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i will speak only very briefly indeed in support of this amendment because already in speaking to a previous amendment i have given some examples of the type of anti-police behaviour in the classrooms of some of our schools that causes such concern <e> <s> as the noble lord lord harris put it so well one of the major purposes of this amendment is to try to ensure that the police are not banned from our schools <e> <s> the noble lord read a very sober list of those schools where a policy of banning the police is already in operation and it is rather worrying that that list might be expected to grow given that it is now the policy accepted by the inner london teachers association <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak very briefly but wholeheartedly in support of this amendment <e> <s> it is particularly timely in view of the fact that the united kingdom is a signatory to a statement of commitment to the attainment of health for all by the year which requires us as a nation to do all in

was tentative <e> <s> i suspect that my noble friend the minister may say that the provisions of the bill as they now stand meet the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> i suspect that the word that we should have used is syllabus rather than curriculum <e>", "<cs> it is a very important point <e> <s> i shall seek clarification on it and perhaps have a word with the noble lord <e> <s> i cannot answer this specific case at the moment but i think that the general point is a valid one and something that we should like to consider <e>", "<cs> as i understand it from a letter i have from the headmaster of the london oratory school the governors have submitted and re-submitted this case to the secretary of state in the terms which the noble baroness outlined <e> <s> however so far there

kirkwood for an excellent maiden speech which achieved the well nigh impossible in respecting the canons of your lordships house by avoiding being too controversial on a subject which is sadly riddled with controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in support of these amendments <e> <s> i know that other noble lords would have voiced their support but have foreborn to do so because of pressures of time <e> <s> i must also thank my noble friend the minister for his kind opening remarks to me personally but i regret that i have not found his arguments or his criticisms convincing <e> <s> nor do i find the governments alternative amendment convincing <e> <s> therefore i must ask that i may test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i support this amendment on two grounds those of moral education and health education <e> <s> on moral education there is widespread concern about the recent developments in the teaching of sex education particularly under the rubric of so called anti-sexism <e> <s> too often this is used to attack the concepts of traditional family life and of heterosexuality <e> <s> the recent edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to those who have supported this amendment at previous stages of the bill and now <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord rea for being here so late in order to speak to and support the amendment <e>", "<cs> it only remains for me to express my appreciation to my noble friend the minister for his offer to come back at third reading with an amendment which hopefully will meet the needs and spirit underpinning this amendment <e> <s> i welcome that <e> <s> in the light of that it is not necessary for me to try to respond to the constructive queries from the noble lords lord kilmarnock and lord mcintosh <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the proposers of the original amendment perhaps i may say that i welcome the efforts that have been made by her majestys government to come forward with an amendment which tried to meet the spirit of our original amendment <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to the representations of concern made from all parts of your lordships house this afternoon and i am very happy to support the current motion which is before us <e>", "<cs> my lords let me briefly say that i am pleased to support the amendment on educational grounds because i believe that it embodies the fundamental principle which differentiates education from indoctrination <e> <s> education in a free society is traditionally committed to encouraging pupils and students to consider all aspects of complex or controversial issues and to make up their own minds on the basis of all available relevant evidence <e> <s> indoctrination by contrast seeks to instil predefined attitudes and opinions closing rather than opening minds <e> <s> therefore the requirement as in this amendment to present a balanced range of views is consistent with sound educational practice <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank those who have supported this amendment both at this stage and previous stages during the passage of this bill <e> <s> whatever the form of provision may be in terms of the requirement for adequate coverage of first aid the situation now pertaining shows a lack of systematic implementation because of the wide variation in the provision currently found in many schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for her reply <e> <s> is she aware that in brent the recently agreed syllabus for religious education defines faith in such a way that it includes non-theistic religions and life stances <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that that not only seems to be a contradiction in terms but also opens the floodgates for teaching topics such as militant atheism or marxism <e> <s> does my noble friend think that is acceptable <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say whether there is any information available concerning the relative outputs of the bbc overseas services and radio moscow <e> <s> when i was in the sudan in the summer it was easier to pick up radio moscow and it was sometimes hard to tell the difference between the two programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i can help the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby with one or two very brief examples which may assist in understanding the thinking behind the government amendments which i strongly support <e> <s> let me say that it is very unfortunate that we have to have these amendments because in many schools there is a lot of very good work being done by conscientious teachers concerning sex education this is much appreciated by parents and pupils <e> <s> but i am afraid that it is a problem of some local authorities in london and not only in london but in other areas as well who are developing an approach to sex education which i think most of us would agree is a complete inversion of the moral values and the kind of approach to sex education that most parents would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment in the strongest possible terms <e> <s> it seems to me that the need for legislative measures to provide protection for freedom of speech on our university and college campuses is becoming increasingly more urgent <e> <s> recent events have shown that violations of this fundamental freedom in our academies are still occurring with alarming persistence <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is currently an acute shortage of teachers in brent but that brent is refusing to advertise those posts in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to give this bill the strongest possible support for two reasons <e> <s> the first is an urgent necessity to put a stop to the use of public money to promote teaching and other policies in our schools which are causing grave offence to many parents and members of the public and secondly because of the harassment and intimidation meted out to those parents who have tried to protect their childrens interests <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that a survey is currently being undertaken on the proportion of nurses suffering physical assault <e> <s> in some areas it is remarkably and alarmingly high <e> <s> for example in accident and emergency departments perhaps as high as per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of nurses suffer physical assault <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that this is a matter of great concern to the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome the bill as a prime example of the old adage out of evil cometh good <e> <s> the evil is the background to this bill that disastrous situation of chronic disruption which has affected so many state schools for over two years <e> <s> i think it is worth reminding ourselves briefly of the effects of that disruption because they are so serious and because they are still not over <e> <s> further strike action has been threatened later this week by many teachers in london schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> he referred to the concerns behind the introduction of this bill and to the fact that attention was being drawn to education by the teachers dispute <e> <s> it is worrying when it appears that the background to the bill in terms of the teachers dispute is seen perhaps by some commentators as being commendable because the dispute seems to me to be a sorry context in which to consider favourably the provisions of this bill and parents anxiety and dismay does not seem to me to be a promising background for consideration of these concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may continue i am prepared to clarify that point if it is put to me on a point of order <e> <s> much has been said in another place and elsewhere about the loss of trade union negotiating rights but little has been said about the rights of children to a good uninterrupted education or of the rights of parents to see their children receiving the kind of education of which they approve an education for which those parents pay through rates and taxes and about which they care passionately <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that both research and the figures of the dhss have shown that overall a selective system of secondary education with secondary modern and grammar schools performs better than a comprehensive system in terms of examination results <e> <s> will she therefore agree that it would be very sad to see more good schools closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that partially encouraging reply <e> <s> will she agree that a commencing salary of only and a possible maximum basic salary of only is inadequate incentive to retain midwives in a profession whose responsibility it is to advise and care for all new parents and to supervise a significant proportion of deliveries of our countrys babies <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his partly encouraging reply <e> <s> however is he aware of the real seriousness of the situation now confronting nursing and that it is reaching crisis proportions owing to the fall in the number of school-leavers and the decline in the number of school-leavers who are choosing to enter nursing <e> <s> their numbers have dropped from per cent <e> <s> in to per cent <e> <s> today and only about two-thirds of them actually complete their training <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that a percentage increase on a low salary is still a low salary that newly-registered nurses still earn only about and that many leave as soon as they have finished training <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved so plausibly by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is still a form of reincarnation of burnham albeit with certain significant modifications <e> <s> if politics is the art of the possible it must be essentially pragmatic although also principled <e> <s> on pragmatic criteria we cannot countenance any serious consideration of an imminent return to the type of negotiating machinery which has proved so disastrous for over two years <e>", "<cs> let me speak briefly as one who i confess was initially in favour of an independent review body and was rather puzzled and indeed disappointed that the government had not opted for this other solution i had a certain inherent sympathy for the amendment now before us but rather like paul on the road to damascus i saw the light and became understanding as to why the government were not going for this option at this stage <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that correction and stand very embarrassed by my misrepresentation of the holy book <e> <s> paul regained his sight and i hope i have now seen why this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords given the fact that as the noble lord lord chalfont has said this office is likely to be particularly vulnerable as a target of terrorist violence would the noble baroness not agree that the particular location is especially unsatisfactory <e> <s> for example the rear entrance of that office is only feet from a large primary school and there is a petrol station only feet from its front entrance <e> <s> is there any <e>", "<cs> it remains for me to thank all noble lords who have contributed so constructively to the debate on this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the concerns raised by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey whom i was pleased to hear support at least the idea behind the amendment have been met by subsequent speakers in the debate <e> <s> i personally feel that they have been met <e>", "<cs> my lords the main point which i made on several occasions was my anxiety that so many resources and so much local authority money were being diverted from those problems in areas where the suffering is greatest towards matters which i think worry many of the citizens who live there <e> <s> they see that as an abuse of the resources <e> <s> it is because i care about problems such as homelessness and the others which occur in areas of high social deprivation that i care so passionately about the distortion and diversion of funds in other directions <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me for intruding once again but i must put the record straight <e> <s> i made as my first and most important caveat the fact that we are talking about a minority <e> <s> i specified the figures and proportions of that minority <e> <s> i said that we were talking about approximately councils <e> <s> they represent about per cent <e> <s> of the population of england and between one-quarter and one-third of those who live in labour-controlled areas <e> <s> that is not a loose cheap jibe that is accurate quantification <e> <s> it is a substantial minority <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene for one moment i have actually sat around committee tables and fought at committees with what i would call the hard-line far left for nine years <e> <s> i have written about those experiences so it is public knowledge that i have had first-hand experience and i have been physically attacked by them as well <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a long and immensely informative debate <e> <s> i should like very warmly to thank all members of your lordships house who have taken part <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend the minister for his generally encouraging reply <e> <s> for example i was particularly pleased to note that he has an open mind on questions of such importance as individual challenge and enforcement <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway would like to share my appreciation on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords some of the general reservations about this amendment have been very eloquently put by my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> i should like to focus upon what seemed to me to be two practical problems with regard to the amendment before us <e> <s> the first problem is the way in which the rights of minority teachers unions might or might not be protected <e> <s> it seems that the opportunity to exercise a veto by two-thirds majority <e>", "<cs> my lords i join all other noble lords in congratulating my noble friend lord home of the hirsel for initiating this particularly timely debate especially timely given recent developments in the united states and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if effective measures can be provided to prevent the promotion of homosexuality in schools such as those provided for in the bill of the noble earl lord halsbury there will be widespread rejoicing not only among the parents in haringey but also among parents in ealing lambeth and throughout inner london all of whose authorities are committed to precisely these policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i too congratulate the noble lord lord ennals for initiating a debate which covers so many matters of great and urgent concern <e> <s> i also congratulate the noble lord lord peston on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i must apologise if i have to leave just before the end of the debate due to a longstanding commitment to chair a meeting which cannot take place in my absence <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in some of londons secondary schools teachers have been encouraging pupils to go on demonstrations during school hours to protest against the redeployment of those staff and that failure to redeploy those staff would cost ilea million in the coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to use my brief contribution to this debate on the gracious speech to welcome and endorse very strongly the proposed legislation concerning education <e> <s> the leader of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> however it is only partially encouraging given the size of the problem <e> <s> is he aware that at present nurses are leaving the national health service each year and that student nurses leave before completing their training <e> <s> very often they leave because of low pay poor conditions of work and low morale <e> <s> can the minister say whether there is any substance in the reports in several of todays newspapers concerning proposed increases in nurses pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by saying how much i appreciated the opportunity to sit on the sub-committee <e> <s> i found the inquiry immensely informative <e> <s> i believe that the constructive contributions of so many witnesses have been reflected in the constructive recommendations which have emerged in the report <e> <s> i deeply appreciate the chairmanship of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who so ably helped us to distill coherence from the abundance of significant and often fascinating material which was presented to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the bill in its general principles and the way in which those principles are to be translated into various practical policies <e> <s> however i must emphasise at the outset that i agree with my noble friend lord bellwin that it is a sad day which sees the need for some of the provisions contained in the bill <e>", "<cs> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> may i also speak to amendment no <e> <s>

in order to encourage nurses to stay in service and in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the bill for its provisions to enhance education standards accountability and local democracy <e> <s> for example the national curriculum will help to ensure that virtually all pupils receive an education to equip them with the basic competencies needed for modern life an appreciation of our cultural and spiritual heritage some understanding of the world in which we live and opportunities to develop talents in fields as diverse as technology music art and pe <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may suggest that the time for detailed discussion and evidence is the committee stage and not now <e> <s> perhaps i may also <e>", "<cs> i very warmly welcome the amendment tabled in the name of the right reverend prelate the bishop of london especially those that refer to the inclusion of religious education as first among equals in the basic curriculum <e> <s> that should at least help to remedy what is at the moment a very unsatisfactory situation whereby many schools breach the requirements of the education act <e> <s> for example the religious education statistics bulletin showed that per cent <e> <s> of fourth year children and per cent <e> <s> of fifth year children at the moment are not taught any religious education at all <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i speak for all my colleagues who sponsored this amendment when i say that we are most grateful to all members of the committee who have spoken and given us the benefit of their support and their criticisms <e> <s> we shall take very careful note of all the points made <e>", "<cs> i am very happy that my remarks may be taken as relevant to that wider range of amendments <e>", "<cs> absolutely correct <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i was just about to point out that this indeed came from the head i understand with the backing of the governing body <e> <s> that was the source of the prohibition <e> <s> the teachers felt that they were living in east germany rather than in east sussex <e> <s> they were also forced to offer an alternative history course for the scottish o-grade which they felt a commitment to do but they had to offer it off the schools premises in their own free time as well as teaching for the gcse in school <e> <s> perhaps it is worth

thought a definition of sufficient might be a viable teaching group but i agree that it is a loose phrase and i take that comment on board when considering where one might go from here <e>", "<cs> with that kind assurance for which i am most grateful and the understanding that this will be brought back by the government on report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall speak briefly in favour of the amendment put forward by my noble friend lord thorneycroft <e> <s> i understand that it is an attempt at drafting and is not the final form <e> <s> the point i should <e>", "<cs> this amendment runs counter to the whole thrust of this part of the bill <e> <s> the whole essence of this part of the bill is to give maximum parental choice within the constraints of the capacity of each school <e> <s> i suggest to the committee that the provision in this part of the bill is necessary given the tendency of many local education authorities to put artificially low limits on popular schools in order to discriminate in favour of unpopular schools <e>", "<cs> i was not referring to the poorer schools but to the more unpopular schools those to which parents did not wish to send their children <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to a point which was made twice by the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester as regards the quality of schools in socially deprived areas <e> <s> is the right reverend prelate aware that research dating back to the days of rutter and recent research by mortimere and his colleagues has shown that schools in the most socially deprived areas vary greatly in the quality of education they supply to their pupils <e> <s> in other words teachers and schools make a significant difference <e> <s> even when they draw pupils from the same catchment area they can offer very different educational opportunities for the pupils <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for that sympathetic and helpful response <e> <s> i am not <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness is confusing the amendments <e> <s> one relates to special schools <e> <s> it was a separate amendment that related to small schools so i think there is a slight confusion there <e>", "<cs> i do not wish the noble baroness to mis-understand why i am shaking my head <e> <s> i fully agree with her about the special needs of children <e> <s> i am shaking my head because i do not think that this relates to the question of whether a school may wish to apply to opt out into grant maintained status <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to noble lords who have contributed to the discussion and who have offered their support and clarified certain issues <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend the minister for clarifying the governments thinking although i am not totally reassured or convinced by the arguments concerning special schools <e> <s> i still believe that the amendment perhaps not drafted perfectly at the moment but something along those lines would have been more just and more humane to parents and children with special educational needs <e> <s> however i recognise that the problems are immensely complex <e> <s> i shall therefore consider extremely carefully all that has been said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the proposals embodied in clause are at the very heart of the bill <e> <s> i believe that they are sound and desirable both in principle and practice first and foremost because the opportunity to apply for opted-out status will increase greater public accountability both formally to the secretary of state and since grant-maintained schools will need to attract pupils informally to parents <e> <s> accountability is the hallmark of professionalism

baroness for giving way because she is actually distorting what i said <e> <s> i never said all over the country <e> <s> i emphasised that there are many areas where there is political meddling and i

baroness makes that point <e> <s> a recent report shows the geographical spread of those schools and does not support the point she has just made <e>", "<cs> i am happy briefly to respond and clarify the position from my point of view <e> <s> the examples i gave were from those schools which have already applied for voluntary-aided status and therefore are so to speak already in the pipeline but

for terminally ill people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing great appreciation of the endeavours of the right reverend prelate the bishop of london by saying how much many of us value the progress he has achieved since we discussed these matters in committee <e> <s> with these amendments there is a profoundly significant move from a position where christianity was not on

has explained so lucidly were not really good reasons why special schools should be denied that freedom which is available to other schools to choose to opt out if they so wish <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord stewart referred to amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name perhaps i may just assure the house that i shall not move that amendment this evening because of pressures of time

week and that an amendment to meet these valid points will be agreed and forthcoming for third reading <e> <s> for example the problem might be met by putting in a phrase appropriate not only to pupils age and family background but also other faiths <e> <s> i am conscious of the fact that we shall have these discussions and i hope very much that we shall have an agreement by third reading

not only the parents of the pupils who are already at the school but intending parents in other words those coming up to the stage of choosing schools for their children as it may well be a factor influencing their choice of school <e> <s> perhaps that will be taken into account in any formulation that is eventually agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords like many noble lords i welcome the city technology

voluntary-aided status for longest and some of the new christian schools which seem to be running into opposition of a political and not of an educational kind <e>", "<cs> my lords in robustly resisting these amendments perhaps i may briefly highlight three kinds of arguments which i think prove convincingly the case for the necessary and timely abolition of ilea <e> <s> in so doing i shall highlight some of the evidence which was not made available during committee stage <e> <s> the arguments relate to profligacy inefficiency and politicisation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just correct a misrepresentation because i was very seriously misrepresented <e> <s> the noble lord suggested that i was against attempts to combat racism <e> <s> i abhor racism <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking in support of these amendments it seems to me that there are three kinds of arguments that can be briefly put forward <e> <s> the arguments are the principles in the amendments professional considerations and political considerations <e> <s> the principles in the amendments have been very fully and lucidly explained by the noble baroness <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may briefly highlight the professional and political considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down for the second time would he agree that the figure he has just given us is by no means typical of student nurses salaries and that it is in fact at the top end of the scale in london taking into account the london allowance <e> <s> it is certainly not what the average student nurse receives which is very much less <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not speak for more than three minutes because the last thing that your lordships want is another long debate on religion in schools <e> <s> all i wish to do is to say thank you to all who have worked so hard to achieve the results which seemed impossible as recently as a few weeks ago and to clarify the position as i see it now <e> <s> in saying thank you i must first and foremost thank the right reverend prelate the bishop of london and congratulate him on his immense efforts in negotiating so many complex issues with so many people representing such diverse interests to achieve a situation which i believe should satisfy christians and those of other faiths <e> <s> i also wish to thank the many other people inside and outside your lordships house who have worked so hard <e> <s> i shall not say tirelessly because i suspect that many are exhausted <e> <s> they are too numerous to name in the compass of three minutes but they too deserve congratulations on all that has been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that not surprisingly i am disappointed with that answer and i think my colleagues will be <e> <s> many people concerned with special education will also be disappointed <e> <s> all i can say is that we have fought valiantly to put up a marker <e> <s> we have put up arguments that we believe have not been successfully answered and we hope that perhaps at some stage in the future her majestys government may reconsider this position and offer to special schools that opportunity which at the moment they are denied which seems a most unacceptable discrimination against them <e> <s> i have no intention of pressing this to a division at this time of night and i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that many health care professionals are deeply worried about some of the recommendations in the griffiths report and rather hope that they will not be implemented <e> <s> they are especially concerned about the lack of clinical expertise in the social services and their appropriateness for providing for the growing number of patients coming into the community with very complex clinical problems <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while there is general satisfaction with many of the good aspects of the gcse there is concern in some places over excessive proportions of course work <e> <s> for example it is possible to get a gcse with per cent <e> <s> course work and no final examination <e> <s> this has led to some strain for pupils and very seriously to problems of comparability of standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i must reluctantly start with an apology <e> <s> due to a longstanding commitment to be speaker at a nurses graduation ceremony this evening i am afraid that i must leave by six oclock <e> <s> if i have to miss the final stages of the debate i apologise most profusely <e> <s> i shall read the proceedings with great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord hunter of newington for initiating this debate <e> <s> i greatly regret that i have a long-standing commitment to host a dinner this evening and i shall have to leave by oclock <e> <s> but i shall read the rest of the debate with very great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by expressing my appreciation to my noble friend the duke of norfolk for introducing this bill which concerns matters of such ultimate significance and which i believe is very timely <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which is most encouraging <e> <s> it is so important to recruit more women into the workforce and to retain them there especially in such professions as teaching and nursing where there are acute shortages <e> <s> however can my noble friend say what measures the government are taking to ensure adequate quality of care for the young children concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i also congratulate the noble earl lord longford on choosing this topic which is of such great importance for the future of higher education in this country <e> <s> i suspect that i am one of only very few perhaps the only one from these benches to have benefited from studying at a polytechnic and to have benefited from the greater flexibility of access to higher education to which polytechnics are committed with their traditional emphasis on part-time evening and sandwich courses and to courses with a more vocational orientation <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question for clarification <e> <s> forgive me if it is obtuse <e> <s> i am not sure which secretary of state is involved <e> <s> at the moment we are in a state of uncertainty as to the governments response to the griffiths recommendations <e> <s> we are not sure whether the care of people who have been diagnosed and treated as schizophrenic and discharged from institutional care will go to social service departments primary health authorities or another formulation <e> <s> therefore i wonder whether it is desirable to leave the secretary of state unspecified <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which i am afraid i do not find very encouraging <e> <s> is he aware that nurses comprise nearly half the workforce of the national health service <e> <s> is it not inept at best and i am afraid insulting at worst to exclude from membership of such a key policy-making body anyone with direct experience of nursing particularly as a shortage of nurses will be one of the most acute problems facing the national health service over the next few years <e>", "<cs> i must declare an interest because i am on the council of management of st christophers hospice <e> <s> i must say that this matter is regarded as one of the utmost urgency <e> <s> what my noble friend the minister has just said could be regarded with great dismay given the fact that it will indicate a continuing period of quite appalling suffering for many people who are caught in this situation at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out to my noble friend that i made that point in my speech <e> <s> perhaps he might have listened and taken the point on board and made note of it when he was thinking about his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which gives a distant ray of hope on a rather distant horizon <e> <s> is she aware that there is an increasing demand for hospice type care not only for people within the hospices themselves but extending into domiciliary care for the terminally ill in their own homes <e> <s> this often leads to very real financial problems both for the terminally ill themselves and for their families <e> <s> can my noble friend indicate whether the government have any plans to help alleviate the financial problems of the terminally ill in hospices or at home and to ensure that they have a genuine choice of the kind of care they most want in their last illness <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in thanking the noble earl lord longford for initiating this debate on a subject of such importance and timeliness <e> <s> as has become clear the hospice movement represents one of the most significant developments in health care in recent years radically transforming attitudes and practices in the care of the terminally ill and their families <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity provided by the noble lord lord peston to discuss the important subject of the contribution of education to the economy and society <e> <s> i shall follow a number of other noble lords and focus on the contribution made by the non-university sector of higher education <e> <s> i do so for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that i believe that anthony croslands vision of the polytechnics as a sector of higher education complementary to the universities was essentially sound <e> <s> that was a concept echoed earlier by the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford and more recently by the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> it is a concept of colleges with a parity of esteem with universities but with a greater commitment to professional and vocationally oriented higher education <e> <s> it has more part-time and sandwich courses and greater opportunities for older students than those traditionally catered for by the universities <e> <s> although now there is an increasing blurring of these distinctions i believe that the polytechnic concept is still highly relevant today <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there have been many exciting developments following the introduction of the education reform act for example the emergence of voluntary groups of teachers and parents such as christians and tyneside schools or christians and derbyshire schools <e> <s> those groups help with the provision of school assemblies and some of them have actually raised money in order to fund full-time workers for the purpose <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that those developments which foster greater links between the schools and the community in this way are very greatly to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords might have noticed that i have not always been a completely uncritical supporter of the government but tonight i rise to support the government in the strongest possible terms in their commitment to introduce a student loans scheme <e> <s> i do so on the grounds of social justice and of the potential which loans may have to increase access to higher education for students from all backgrounds including those from less advantaged backgrounds <e> <s> i therefore do not have any sympathy for those who resist the basic concept of loans and i have not been convinced by the arguments of those who wish to delay the implementation of a scheme to provide them <e> <s> however i have a number of questions and slight reservations about the bill before us and i hope that some of those might be answered by my noble friend this evening and/or addressed during the later stages of the passage of the bill through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by declaring an interest as a fellow of the royal college of nursing <e> <s> however although i will be raising matters relevant to my own profession of nursing i hope that my contributions will transcend sectional professional interests and will reflect much wider concerns for the national health service and for community care <e>", "<cs> my lords i pointed out that in many areas there is good co-operation <e> <s> i know that people are being well served and will be well served <e> <s> but i am afraid that in many areas and examples will be forthcoming in committee there are genuine problems <e> <s> i do not see that these solutions will help those problems <e> <s> however i recognise the point that the noble baroness has just made in regard to some areas <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee for more than a few moments but i wish to explain why my name is attached to the amendment <e> <s> i hope that it provides clarification and that the minister will be able to accept it <e> <s> surely it must be the intention that there should be provision for some continuity of experience and expertise <e> <s> if that is the case then the amendment is clearly necessary <e> <s> it would do a great deal to allay anxieties about the ambiguity of the bill as it stands <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend can respond sympathetically to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support these amendments and urge the committee to consider them sympathetically because i believe their provisions are essential for ensuring appropriate care for the wide range of patients and clients for whom the regional district and family health service authorities will be responsible <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend misrepresented me perhaps i may correct him <e> <s> what i tried to say the point was made by the noble baroness lady seear was that nurses are not interested in being represented for the sake of their own self-interest self-esteem and self-aggrandizement <e> <s> their concern is for the patients and quality of patient care and for the knowledge expertise and first-hand experience they can bring both in terms of the implication of policy making and also as i tried to indicate of the financial implications for nursing services which are enormous <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the track record of the or so grant-maintained schools that are already up and running is extremely good and that they are popular with parents <e> <s> can she give some indication of the <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps i can ask whether she puts in the same class as what she refers to as propaganda the very serious professional representations put forward by all the royal colleges and professional organisations quoted in the earlier speeches <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all members of the committee who have taken part in this lengthy and constructive debate <e> <s> i am also grateful to my <e>", "<cs> i shall read <e>", "<cs> i support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> its intention is to ensure that when patients are discharged from hospital their health and clinical needs are met <e> <s> that is most important <e> <s> however there is concern that because community care has moved firmly into the hands of local <e>", "<cs> i thank noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment in my name and those of other noble lords and i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply <e>", "<cs> as amendment no <e> <s> a comes within this group of amendments perhaps i may speak briefly on it <e> <s> perhaps i feel stronger than the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i am an optimist <e> <s> i hope that the minister may surprise us by responding sympathetically to the amendment <e> <s> it reflects the intention expressed by her right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> we were hoping to see a government amendment on the same lines for consideration during the passage of the bill through this chamber <e>", "<cs> i briefly but equally strongly support this amendment for three main reasons <e> <s> first incontinence is a serious social problem requiring skilled assistance if physical problems such as pressure sores and infection are to be avoided and if psycho-social problems such as loss of self-esteem embarrassment withdrawal and isolation are to be averted <e> <s> many people who suffer the affliction of incontinence are however enabled to lead lives where the physical and social complications are avoided <e> <s> they will testify to the importance of necessary professional support and also appropriate resources <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> this is a probing amendment <e> <s> we are all speaking extremely rapidly and it is difficult for me to take in all the implications of my noble friends helpful reply <e> <s> i shall read it with great care <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this important amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals has spelt out the implications of its contents so clearly that i have little to add to his wise words and those of the noble baroness lady masham except perhaps just to highlight the great importance of any measures which would facilitate the availability of organs which would alleviate the suffering of those people who are waiting to benefit from transplant treatment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments <e> <s> i shall not speak at length because the arguments have been put so comprehensively by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> the situation as now reflected in the bill is anomalous <e> <s> it appears to be inconsistent and i hope that that is an oversight <e> <s> i am particularly concerned by my perception that the audit commissions present remit will enable it to study the effects of the new legislation on community care because that will become the responsibility of local authorities <e> <s> but perhaps by default there is no comparable provision for the audit commission to study the effects of the new legislation on the national health service <e>", "<cs> i briefly but wholeheartedly support the amendment <e> <s> the major arguments for it have been put admirably by the noble lord lord young of dartington and amplified by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> all i wish to do is emphasise the importance of the amendment both in principle and in practice <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may reassure her by answering her question as to how professional people especially nurses might feel about that concept <e> <s> the whole concept of the inspectorate has the full support of the royal college of nursing which is keen for professional accountability to be in the public domain <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> i am especially grateful to my noble friend lady mcfarlane for her comprehensive coverage of the issues involved <e> <s> she put them in an historic context while highlighting and reminding us of some of the current problems which are matters of great concern <e> <s> i refer in particular to the downturn in the numbers entering nurse education which will create real problems for staffing the national health service in the future and also to the reduction of funding for the education of nurse teachers <e> <s> it is helpful to have those points on the record <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved so well by the noble lord lord carter which contains many important provisions <e> <s> the essence of the amendment has been expressed comprehensively and in general terms <e> <s> therefore i do not wish to repeat the arguments <e> <s> i wish simply to illustrate the need for the amendment <e> <s> i shall do so by referring to a true case study which could be multiplied many hundreds of times over <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to those who have contributed to this short and constructive debate <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord ennals for helpfully broadening the points that i raised in my opening remarks to include entirely appropriately the other members of the health workforce <e> <s> he also emphasised the importance of continuity of care and relationships which have been established during long-stay care <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment i believe that it may be helpful if i compliment in both senses of the word the noble lord lord peston on his opening remarks <e> <s> i do so by highlighting the seriousness of the needs of many people who suffer from low incidence disabilities <e> <s> i highlight the complexity of their problems in order to show the need for the provisions of the amendment <e> <s> these problems often represent some of the most acute the most poignant and complex problems which can be confronted by people who live in the community <e>", "<cs> as i was one of the speakers who referred to mental handicap i should like to clarify the situation <e> <s> i did not intend to suggest that mental handicap was a low incidence disability <e> <s> the conjunction of mental handicap with some of the low incidence disability problems was the context in which the words mental handicap came into the discussion <e> <s> it is not that mental handicap itself is a low incidence disability but sometimes it is an associated symptom or problem with some of the genuinely low incidence disability problems <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment for three brief reasons <e> <s> first it would allow people to be consulted who can make a most important contribution to planning <e> <s> for example they may be aware of a range or if i may use the word prevalence of need which is not perhaps known to those who are charged with planning the arrangements for care <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly give three reasons for supporting the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> they relate to the client and the clients own needs the accountability of social services and the needs of carers <e> <s> first given that the client or patient always must know best what his or her own needs are and how best they might be met it seems strange that at the moment there is no ostensible provision for him to have the right to take the initiative to request an assessment <e> <s> i therefore support that part of the amendment on the fundamental principles of consumer or client power and consumer or client independence <e>", "<cs> as my name is linked with the amendment perhaps i may speak briefly in support of the group of amendments which as the noble baroness lady seear said is a kind of carers charter <e> <s> carers make a major contribution in the provision of care but often receive an extremely raw deal <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> it addresses one of the most fundamental problems associated with community care the fact that the <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment with even greater conviction than when i originally put my name to it as an amendment embodying the principle of the need of some form of systematic and genuinely independent inspection <e> <s> my conviction has grown as my concern has grown with the passage of the bill through this committee <e> <s> the more debates i have heard the more acutely aware i am of the potential suffering that may arise as a result of some of the unforeseen effects of the proposed legislative changes and the lack of safeguards being built into the operation of the new system from its inception <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that somewhat encouraging reply <e> <s> however is he aware of the very high cost to a polish citizen of a visa to visit the united kingdom and that it represents approximately one half of a physicians monthly salary <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that that cost is not refundable in the event of permission being refused <e> <s> that policy is different from that adopted by other western embassies which give refunds <e> <s> the british approach is felt to be unhelpful at a time when poland is trying so hard to emerge from desperately difficult economic and political circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is a great shame that despite the ostensible freedom to apply for the posts those teachers do not feel free to do so at present because of unfortunate remarks which have been made about them in public <e> <s> it is a great shame that two excellent history teachers should not be allowed to teach history <e> <s> one has been relegated to retraining as a primary teacher and the other to a course on tourism <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that that is a very bad situation at a time when the country needs every excellent teacher it can get <e>", "<cs> my lords in my contribution i wish to touch on two aspects of the bill <e> <s> first i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment for three main reasons <e> <s> first it respects the governments concern which was repeatedly expressed during the committee stage in your lordships house not to embody the principle of representation in setting up policy-making bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> i thank my noble friend lord auckland for expressing his anxiety <e> <s> i sympathise with him but hope that to some extent his anxiety was allayed by the response of the noble lord lord butterfield <e> <s> he pointed out that provisions already exist for certain reports to be made <e> <s> however i do not believe that that removes the need for the provisions contained in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend looks slightly uncertain may i say that i am not in the least unhappy about proceeding in the way which i believe to be the formal procedure of the house <e> <s> that an amendment to an amendment is taken <e> <s> i am not sure that it is proper to proceed in any other way <e> <s> i am sorry that it has caught noble lords on the hop <e> <s> it caught me on the hop when i <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret the confusion which arose at the outset of the debate <e> <s> however that confusion was not of my making <e> <s> i hope that it has not detracted from the presentation of the arguments <e> <s> i am most grateful for the arguments which have been put forward by noble lords and for the fact that there has been at least some support for the spirit of the two amendments standing in my name and that of the noble lord lord peston <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak briefly in support of this important amendment <e> <s> it might affect over million people <e> <s> incontinence can affect a wide range of all age groups <e> <s> a survey a few years ago indicated that a third of the people who replied were aged between and <e> <s> incontinence may also be associated with accidents which often affect young people <e> <s> it is also one of the problems associated with some of the tragedies than can come with increasing age especially cerebrovascular accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made the case so comprehensively that i shall spend only a few moments highlighting my reasons for supporting these amendments by reinforcing the principles which underpin them <e> <s> they are the key principles of the possibility of self referrals confidentiality and ease of access <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to indicate how strongly i support the amendment <e> <s> i shall not repeat the arguments put so comprehensively by the noble lord lord ennals perhaps however i may highlight some of the implications of the situation for the nursing profession of which i have most personal experience <e> <s> i do not believe the examples to be inappropriate <e> <s> i am not undertaking special pleading but i believe that in so far as nurses represent the largest group of employees in the national health service the implications for the profession and in particular for the provision of high quality care throughout the national health service are extremely serious <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the amendment both because of the problems that it adcresses and also the anxieties that those problems are already causing among national health service staff <e> <s> those anxieties are entirely understandable and are not part of the so-called scare- <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly intervene and say that i concur wholeheartedly with the noble lord lord young of dartington in welcoming the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak in support of the amendments moved by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i supported similar amendments at the previous stage of the bill in your lordships house because they address significant problems spanning both individual and public health issues <e> <s> despite the reply given by my noble friend the minister to similar amendments at report stage which i have since read carefully i still believe that there is a need to ensure provision of these facilities because of the implications for confidentiality and anonymity <e> <s> i shall not repeat the arguments that i and other noble lords made previously particularly with regard to family planning or drug dependency <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak briefly in favour of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i do so reluctantly because of my continuing dissatisfaction with the reply given by my noble friend the minister on report <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> i believe that the freedom to initiate inquiries or investigations is fundamental if the clinical standards advisory group is to have enough independence to respond to concerns which members may identify from their own or colleagues professional experience at the front line of the delivery of care <e> <s> without this freedom there is a real danger that the group will be seen as a puppet of the secretary of state <e> <s> given this freedom the group will have much more credibility as the watchdog of clinical standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish the bill well for the sake of the patients and clients it is designed to help and for the sake of those who work in the national health service and those who provide community care who will be responsible for implementing it <e> <s> i sincerely hope they will find it achieves its objectives of providing better quality and more cost-effective care <e> <s> therefore i welcome in particular those provisions which have been agreed to in your lordships house which will enhance patient and client choice and help to ensure high clinical standards <e> <s> i especially welcome those amendments which establish the clinical standards advisory group <e> <s> i express appreciation for that but i regret the governments parsimony this evening with regard to two of the key issues <e> <s> i hope however those will be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak briefly and reluctantly <e> <s> i warmly welcome the concessions which provide some protection for certain vulnerable members of our community and for the voluntary organisations which provide such immensely valuable services <e> <s> however like other members of your lordships house who have already spoken i am deeply disappointed that other groups who are equally if not even more <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that generally encouraging reply and for the non-specific but important criteria that he indicated <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the americans have stipulated more specific criteria which they wish to see fulfilled before they give economic aid <e> <s> is he aware that those criteria include compensating opposition parties particularly for the destruction of their buildings the immediate release of students and political detainees information concerning the location of three missing leaders mr leon mr dinca and mr munteanu a guarantee of the freedom of the press and an assurance that vigilantes will not be used again as agents of brutal repression <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that those are useful criteria which might be borne in mind before assistance other than humanitarian assistance is given <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this group of amendments perhaps i may begin by saying how much i appreciate the governments concessions improvements and proposed amendments to the bill especially in this most crucial area of religious broadcasting <e> <s> i speak in terms of my personal position as a christian and also as a christian who has a deep respect for the rights of other faith communities <e> <s> i share the concerns that the faiths other than christian should be represented in religious broadcasting <e> <s> that point was emphasised by the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool <e> <s> i wish to see that right enshrined in principle and in practice as was achieved in initiatives with which i was associated in the education reform act where the rights of faith communities other than christian to request religious education and worship according to their own faiths were recognised in historic amendments <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> i speak tentatively as a layman on these matters but i believe that the word true implies certain objective criteria whereas the word due seems more negotiable and therefore possibly conveys a more arbitrary concept <e> <s> as this amendment and all the subsequent amendments that we are about to discuss concern impartiality we are ultimately concerned with matters of truth <e> <s> we are also concerned that all the available relevant evidence should be presented in the best possible way so that people can make up their own minds on complex and <e>", "<cs> in speaking briefly in support of some of the amendments in the grouping i shall concentrate on amendment no <e> <s> and the other amendments referring to the word current and also say a few words on amendment no <e> <s> concerning impartiality over a service <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly <e> <s> i am puzzled by the amendment <e> <s> it seems at worst some kind of censorship <e> <s> as others have said safeguards already exist <e> <s> it also appears to be patronising i am sure unintentionally and to suggest that people are excessively gullible <e> <s> i ask the right reverend prelate a question <e> <s> does subsection b ii imply for example that an organisation could not ask for money save for bibles to send to countries where bibles do not exist <e> <s> it would appear that the wording could be interpreted in that way and that would be most unfortunate <e> <s> if there is that kind of ambiguity i hope that it is not intended and that it will be corrected <e> <s> however i am basically against the amendment in regard to the principle of censorship which i think is quite unnecessary in this kind of advertisement <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may point out that there is a grouping of amendments and that there are one or two amendments in that grouping with which other noble lords names are associated <e> <s> we should proceed with the debate if that is agreed by the house because i had hoped to say a few words in support of my noble friend the minister and also to <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move this amendment with considerable trepidation born of an awareness that there are those in your lordships house for whom i hold very deep respect who are hostile to any attempt to reopen the whole question of the profoundly complex and sensitive matters of abortion and termination of pregnancy <e> <s> however many of us feel compelled to do so however unpopular we may become because the situation has changed radically while the bill was in another place <e> <s> we believe that it would be wrong for the implications of those changes not to be considered by your lordships house today <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should point out that at the moment we are not discussing that point which is the substance of the second amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> with the leave of the house we agreed earlier that they would be dealt with separately <e> <s> rather than waste the noble lords time while speaking now when he may wish to make the same points on the second amendment perhaps i may say that there is a separate debate on that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly thank every noble lord who contributed to this important and often moving debate <e> <s> i wish to make three points <e> <s> i cannot emphasise too strongly that amendment no <e> <s> a would not in any situation whatever constitute grounds for termination of a pregnancy covered by the house of commons amendment <e> <s> in other words the house of commons amendment allows for a termination of pregnancy according to a number of grounds <e> <s> our amendment would in no way prevent that termination of pregnancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> in introducing amendment no <e> <s> b as an amendment to commons amendment no <e> <s> i shall speak very briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i wish to express deep gratitude to all noble lords who have contributed to this rather shorter debate <e> <s> i express gratitude also to my noble and learned friend on the woolsack for clarifying the situation <e> <s> i confess that i accept that there is ambiguity in the term incompatible with life <e> <s> however as my noble friend lord elton has said there is a
