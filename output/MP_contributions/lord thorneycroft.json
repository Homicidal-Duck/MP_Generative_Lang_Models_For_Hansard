["<cs> my lords i do not know how many of your lordships remember harry crookshank who was a much loved leader of the house of commons <e> <s> he was loved by both sides <e> <s> i remember harry crookshank once embarking upon a debate of this character when there was an incoming conservative government and an outgoing labour government <e> <s> he spoke about the skeletons in the cupboards and he was challenged as to what and where these skeletons were <e> <s> he said that they were hanging like chandeliers in all the offices in whitehall i think to the delight of both sides of the house of commons <e> <s> it is customary on these occasions for people to talk a little about the legacies they have inherited but i think it is perilous <e> <s> it is dangerous to exaggerate all the problems of ones country and to exaggerate the problems with which a government are faced <e> <s> moreover we are sitting on these benches because we claimed that we had some kind of a solution perhaps to some of the problems we were there to try to do something about them <e>", "<cs> i know my lords <e> <s> i accept this completely <e> <s> if the noble lord will follow me he will see the point of what i have to say <e> <s> the labour government were led by social democrats yet they were determined to achieve a permanent shift to the left an irreversible shift to the left <e> <s> i am not absolutely sure i know they lost the election whether they succeeded or failed in that particular objective <e> <s> what i do know is that the attempts to do it had some dramatic effects upon this nation when they were in office <e> <s> i do know that the attempt to do it also has had a dramatic effect upon the labour party now that it is in opposition <e> <s> the attempt by the unions to obtain control of the labour party through the nec is of much more than domestic importance to the labour party <e> <s> it is a trend which goes to the very root of the prospects <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord may have slightly misunderstood me <e> <s> i was not attacking the schools in london <e> <s> i was saying that the inner london education authority seemed to have a rather curious choice of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords it is some seven hours since i moved the <e>", "<cs> may i perhaps express a slightly different view from some of the speeches which have been delivered so far <e> <s> the whole house must have listened to the speeches of the noble duke the duke of norfolk and the noble lord lord butler with respect with understanding and with sympathy <e> <s> the noble duke the duke of norfolk speaks with a wide knowledge of the problems of catholic schools and also a deep understanding of the countryside <e> <s> with the noble lord lord butler i shared office defeats and triumphs over many years and i think like everybody else i always listen to him particularly perhaps on this subject with deep respect <e> <s> hope that the house will however listen to me with a little sympathy too <e>", "<cs> no i would rather not give way because i possibly could not face the cross-examination <e> <s> well if the noble viscount really wants to <e>", "<cs> they have a discretion within guidelines clearly laid down <e> <s> they cannot charge anything the terms are clearly laid down as described by the noble baroness from the front bench <e> <s> but it is nevertheless a discretion <e> <s> i too have had letters and i have had letters like those of the noble lord lord butler <e> <s> like him i will not read them but they are from local authorities who say please do not turn this discretion away <e> <s> in our particular area we believe it better to make a modest charge in this field than to attack the quality of education <e> <s> that is a perfectly fair view to take <e> <s> if you do it this way giving the option to local authorities then i think it may better serve the interests of the children and the families in those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always refreshing to listen to the noble lord lord rhodes <e> <s> i have had the privilege of listening to him over quite a number of years in another place as well as this house and it is a delight to hear him speaking with the vigour imagination and originality of thought that i have always associated with him after every speech he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend was too young to be a member of the cabinet at that time <e> <s> at any rate the cabinet thought that i would lose and i was advised that i should not contest it <e> <s> i remember the words of mr churchill the prime <e>", "<cs> my lords the house listened with interest and i think deep appreciation to the speech of the noble lord lord lever of manchester <e> <s> he spoke with that modesty which we have learned to expect from him and with a fascinating account of a subject of which he is indeed largely a master and i myself was much indebted to him for the privilege <e> <s> the noble lord might perhaps be described as a reluctant monetarist <e> <s> he is a monetarist in a way i suppose in the school of keith joseph <e> <s> i do not know whether he would acknowledge his master but he like keith joseph believes that monetarism is not enough and he is right <e> <s> but my lords nothing is enough <e> <s> as the noble lord said if there were some solution to our problems by now some clever man would have stumbled on it and we should not be sitting round debating these topics <e> <s> so i accept from him that monetarism is by the way <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that i misunderstood <e> <s> in any event my point remains the same <e> <s> they have spelled out in real terms what it is that they are going to spend <e> <s> as a result investors borrowers unions and managers know the background against which they are bargaining negotiating and making their various decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the government and the noble earl lord gowrie in what they have said <e> <s> i realise that this is a subject about which there are what i understand are called in the context of this bill deeply-held personal convictions <e> <s> i therefore address the matter with i hope restraint and quietness <e> <s> i certainly feel i owe an explanation of my feelings to those who support this amendment noble friends whom i have known for many years and for whom i have a great respect <e> <s> the noble lord lord spens moved this amendment with great clarity <e> <s> may i say i share some of those anxieties <e> <s> no one is going to say in an area as complicated as this that it is not possible to probe and find some faults <e>", "<cs> that is true my lords <e> <s> may i confess an appalling weakness as chairman of the conservative party <e> <s> it is that i have always put the future of my country beyond the party manifesto <e> <s> i know that i shall get into trouble for that but i say from the bottom of my heart that if everybody would follow that rule it would be so much better it really would <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for raising that point and of course i entirely endorse the principles to which he adheres <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government stop harassing these great public corporations and concentrate on the intelligibility of the address system in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the right reverend prelate and to have the honour of congratulating him upon his maiden speech <e> <s> he comes to your lordships house with great qualities drawn from the coldstream guards from experience in india with a great record in the church and as president of the footlights club at cambridge <e> <s> if he had done nothing else the latter might well commend him to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords at my personal request i wished the conservative party it was not all from that to pay particular tribute to the achievements in productivity in the public sector <e> <s> i believe that unless we as a nation can come to recognise that both public and private enterprise have a role to play there is little future for us <e> <s> what i am saying is that the public sector in this instance is an enormous burden <e> <s> we therefore have to look coldly at the facts <e> <s> these are the cumulation of events which face the government and the prime minister <e> <s> they have to be tackled not against the background of a rising tide of trade or national accounts that are in balance <e> <s> they have to be tackled against the background of a world recession and a debt level which makes the interest payments among the highest items of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to speak following the noble lord lord glenamara who himself made an important contribution to the public sector in his work and i wish at the outset to thank him for the tribute he paid to my friend the late lord amory <e> <s> it was only a few months ago just before i last spoke in your lordships house in an economic debate that telephoned lord amory it was in the closing days of his life to ask his advice <e> <s> i will not be the only person in this house to miss the counsel and advice of that wise and good man <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for that tribute and i thank the noble lord lord beswick for the way in which he opened the debate <e> <s> his motion taunts the government with their attitude to the public sector <e> <s> i suggest the argument is not really about whether we have a public sector obviously we are going to have a large public sector in this country <e> <s> i think the argument is about the size of the public sector and how best its welfare can be secured <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord gowrie spent paragraphs doing this in his opening speech and that is why i said i was not going to go into massive figures <e> <s> i simply say this and i think that i probably carry with me quite a number of noble lords on both sides of the house that however good public enterprise can he there is a limit to what you can do in the way of adding to it and if anybody really suggested today that we should as a matter of policy add to the public sector and these financial burdens i should have thought that that was an area of policy which most sensible men of any political party would reject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will also note that that leader made a savage attack on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this debate and the opportunity to contribute to it not least for the opportunity to hear the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool in his maiden speech when he spoke with great knowledge and understanding of the bitter problems of the great area over which he ministers <e> <s> i join with the noble lord lord taylor in saying that i hope we will hear him on other occasions and i join with the noble lord lord taylor on many other matters too <e> <s> one of the encouraging things about this debate is the remarkable degree of unanimity and understanding with which a great <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether many of your lordships happened to see the speaker of the house of commons having a conversation with norman st john-stevas on the television but in it the speaker said that short speeches were incompatible with oratory <e> <s> your lordships will have to sacrifice the oratory so far as i am concerned because i would prefer to make a very short speech and i think lord watkinson and lord weinstock would probably go along with this suggestion <e> <s> so i will keep it very brief <e> <s> i have really only one point which i wish to discuss <e> <s> it was touched on by my noble friend lady young and in an admirable maiden speech by the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> it concerns the practical limits that are set to the powers of a government today to intervene in economic affairs <e> <s> the idea that the national government of one small country can really have a decisive effect upon what happens to the economy over the next two years is a proposition which does not really bear very close examination <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to thank the noble lord lord evans for introducing this debate in a speech of a great deal of quiet common sense <e> <s> indeed i had the embarrassment of finding myself at too frequent intervals somewhat in agreement with <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the chance to speak for a few moments after lord jacques and to agree very much with the final sentence of his speech that if we can avoid polarisation in this country we shall make a substantial contribution to the solution of our problems <e> <s> which brings me to say to the noble lord lord beswick that i start from a position of some sympathy with his approach <e> <s> he asks for broadly-based policies <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> he speaks with moderation he is not a man who searches for extremes and i think all this is common ground between us <e> <s> so i do not set out on the basis of picking quarrels with him <e> <s> i will not use the word consensus which seems to me too controversial and uncertain but if i can find a consensus with him not necessarily about the <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will agree that this is a very valuable debate all the more valuable for the balanced and very able way in which it was opened by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and for the quality of the contribution which those experienced in local government like the noble viscount lord ridley the noble baroness lady stedman to whom i listened with interest the noble lord lord sandford and many others will have made <e> <s> it will shorten and simplify my argument if i say to the house what is already known to my noble friend lord bellwin that i have consistently opposed the idea that the abolition of domestic rating is a sensible objective to take <e> <s> the right objective to take is the improvement of local government and the finding of a sensible solution to its finance <e>", "<cs> my lords these are grave and complicated matters that we are discussing this afternoon <e> <s> i would say this on the motion put forward by the noble lord lord glenamara as it is written i would support it <e> <s> i rather agree with what it says and i would give him any of the papers that he wants <e> <s> but the effective measures i would choose would i think vary a little from his <e> <s> it is an honour to follow the noble lord lord allen of fallowfield <e> <s> he speaks with great knowledge of the trade union movement and has made a speech of moderation and quietness <e> <s> he said he did not like to aproach something in which we all blame one another <e> <s> i share that view <e> <s> he found it rather difficult not to blame the government <e> <s> i must tell him that great numbers of the public are finding it increasing difficult not to blame the trade unions and even i may say a word about them <e> <s> but i think we want to speak with moderation of one anothers faults <e>", "<cs> i would like to say a word not about the theory but about the practical problem of buying a gas cooker which is after all what this comes down to <e> <s> i do not say i would attempt such a dangerous and difficult job myself but i have recently witnessed my daughter attempting to do so <e> <s> my daughter rings the gas showroom <e> <s> she says i am the mother of two young children with no means of cooking in the house which i have just moved into <e> <s> i wish to order a gas cooker <e> <s> i would like to place an order and i can inform you of the type and mark and so forth <e> <s> the gas showroom reply we will be delighted to place the order will you please give it <e> <s> my daughter says there is one thing i am not prepared to place a firm order unless you can give me a guaranteed delivery because i cannot sit here cooking over candles and the rest day after day <e> <s> i wish to know at what time and date this cooker will be delivered and fixed <e> <s> i am sorry madam say the gas showroom it is quite impossible for us to quote any delivery until we have a firm order placed <e> <s> but my daughter says this is an impossible situation <e> <s> madam say the gas showroom you must remember we are a big corporation and we are completely computerised <e> <s> but can you not ask your computer what the date of delivery is <e> <s> no say the gas showroom we are quite unable to ask our computer to give and our computer cannot give a firm delivery date until we get a firm order for the cooker <e>", "<cs> i am going to finish this <e> <s> the noble lord can well reply afterwards <e>", "<cs> no i am not going to give way to the noble lord <e> <s> i want to finish my story <e> <s> i am not very fluent on gas cookers so i do not want to be interrupted <e> <s> my daughter is therefore put in a completely impossible position and so is the gas board <e> <s> but she has her father standing by and a humble motor-car to escort her to the nearest private enterprise firm up the road where a gas cooker is procured ordered without any of the difficulties presented by this great corporation <e> <s> i do not say that this is a <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord at least think very carefully before he allows six different forms of proportional representation to be dignified by the name of a common system <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord zuckerman <e> <s> he is right that we served together in the ministry of defence and over the years i have been the recipient of much wisdom and much kindness from him <e> <s> i am delighted to follow him in the debate <e> <s> we debate defence my <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the horrors of the nuclear deterrent is the immense and to my mind dangerous confusion into which people drift by trying to analyse exactly when nuclear deterrents will be used <e> <s> the moment you start in that direction you get into the most desperate trouble and i shall not therefore be tempted along such delicious paths by the noble lord <e> <s> one of the great things about a deterrent is that nobody quite knows when it might be used and as a result people are much more careful than they would be otherwise <e> <s> i prefer to have deterrents as deterrents not spelling out to potential enemies and aggressors just what mischief they can get up to without the danger of anything going off <e> <s> a deterrent should be a deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the responsible opinion of british people is expressed at general elections and that they have now elected eight governments in succession including a <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure as always and certainly a great honour to reply to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos who delivered an admirably argued speech to the house <e> <s> it is a speech which is reinforced and elaborated in an admirable document i found in the library called <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords point is a perfectly fair one <e> <s> if as a nation we find ourselves in great difficulties with grave problems against a background of international trade such as it is today we must not for heavens sake worsen that background <e> <s> i say do not deprive us of such advantages as we have <e> <s> do not kick us in the teeth at the very moment when we want everybody to have the maximum advantages <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are many on this side of the house who are delighted to see that the government are not in the words of the noble lord lord bruce of donington allowing public expenditure to roll merrily along as things go on <e> <s> that comment was partly supported by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that action is being taken by the government to deal with these matters early firmly and in the right direction <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and other noble lords who are moving this amendment will not press it to a division <e> <s> i do not believe that there is much difference between both sides of the committee in this respect at least that we want the ablest possible man we can find to take on an appointment of enormous difficulty <e> <s> in the years to come that man will sometimes be appointed by a conservative government and no doubt sometimes appointed by a labour government <e>", "<cs> i am confident that both governments would do their level best to find the ablest man possible for the job in question <e> <s> to introduce this amendment would militate considerably against finding such a man <e> <s> within the short period before an election was due it would prove almost impossible to find someone whose term of office was not three or four years but might be a few months <e> <s> put yourselves in the position of someone taking this job <e> <s> it would be quite a big decision to take anyway <e> <s> it would probably mean if he was any good at all that he had to give up some considerable appointment he was already holding <e> <s> i do not think that anyone would be found to take a job where within a short time on the mere quirks and changes and ups and downs of politics his whole position would be put in jeopardy again <e>", "<cs> there are a great many things in this world which one does better without legislation and i believe this is one of them <e> <s> everybody has a great deal of sympathy with what was said by the noble lord lord bruce of donington and with the aims he has <e> <s> certainly i do because i too am a post office supplier <e> <s> a great many people and certainly all suppliers share a good number of the anxieties which the noble lord quite properly expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords after deep thought as to how to meet all the objections i supported the government on the main amendment which they put down at the committee stage <e> <s> with great respect to my noble friend lord belstead who i admire very much and who has made great efforts to help the house i must tell him that i supported the government not because i thought the amendment was a brilliant contribution to the subject but because i thought that nothing could be more awful than what was in the original bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider that there is probably a feeling on all sides of the house that not much more evidence is required that the present procedures have already proved inadequate and that this gives rise to a very serious matter of public policy <e> <s> will he draw the attention of the home secretary the lord chancellor and others to our anxiety in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that the exporting industries of this country can take an immense pride in the fact that we are selling overseas per head more than the japanese more than the americans and more than most other manufacturing countries in this world <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that whatever happened to the gini coefficient it was a jolly good budget <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this morning in portland square a team were beginning to clamp a car and indeed continued to clamp it in front of a driver who had returned and who was anxious to drive his car away <e> <s> will my noble friend explain how that improves traffic flow <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the bill <e> <s> it gives me an opportunity of saying how much i enjoyed the speech of the noble lord lord bottomley <e> <s> i have counted him as a friend over many years and i am indebted as he knows to him for one or two acts of kindness which i do not forget <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear him on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> i cannot see her <e> <s> if i might have a private word with the noble baroness to which i would ask the government not to listen too closely she has followed legislation on local government matters over many years and she may have held the view that some of the measures introduced by my honourable and right honourable friends have not been an unqualified success <e> <s> the view has been expressed <e> <s> i express no view myself but the view has been expressed <e> <s> those were measures where the government knew or thought they knew what they were trying to do <e> <s> to urge them to introduce a measure when they plainly will not know what they are trying to do seems to me to be a recipe for disaster and that we should be invited to vote for such a cause is surely a little unwise <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bellwin will recognise that i would be the last person to urge the government to precipitate action of any kind in the field of local government <e> <s> quite rightly he may feel that he does not want in the middle of the passage of the bill to commit himself to the appointment of a committee to examine the next stage <e> <s> my noble friend may well feel that he wants to get this bill under his belt before he advances to the next stage <e> <s> that is not to say that this is not a very good amendment to have put down enabling a very useful debate to take place <e> <s> i would however say this to my noble friend <e> <s> although he may well refuse the amendment there are many in this house who will be listening most anxiously to the tone of voice that he uses in turning down the amendment <e> <s> we want to have some idea without firm commitments from the government of how the government see the further horizons in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house is grateful to the noble lord lord wilson for initiating this debate <e> <s> i think that the house would agree with him both as to the scale of the problem and to the difficulty of finding a solution to it <e> <s> in my case brevity is my chief aim in the debate <e> <s> i want to make four points only <e> <s> i want to say something about the facts as i see them about the damage that we do to ourselves about the options that are no longer open and about how best to soldier on <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not interrupt <e> <s> i intend to speak for only a few minutes <e> <s> i am not giving a minute to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords though perhaps a shade more instinctively supportive of governments than my noble friend lord alport i do not jump automatically to the support either of my party or this government or hardly any other government when it comes to local government reform <e> <s> in my experience almost all local government reform ends in disaster so i approach the whole thing with caution <e> <s> nevertheless having thought rather deeply about the matter i differ quite sharply from lord alport and agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i am quite sure that the government are right to pave the way for a sensible discussion of what will be a very much larger measure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there are many noble lords on this side of the house who are very grateful for the fact that her majestys government are in charge of these matters and not an ilo committee <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend convey to the prime minister on behalf of at any rate many in the house of lords our congratulations on a negotiation stubbornly conducted but reaching such a successful conclusion <e> <s> will he also recognise that many in this country would prefer determined negotiations by people who are genuine in their desire to stay and work within the community to on the other hand weak negotiators who are utterly uncertain as to what their role there would be <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that all of us who regard unemployment as a serious problem in this country must deplore the calling of a strike of this character in circumstances of this kind which is so damaging to the opportunities for work <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister encourage lord roberthall to continue educating the noble lord lord ezra in the principles of multinational trade <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if he can save money by recording rather fewer figures in this world he shall have a great deal of support from many quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there are many people in this country who are beginning to resent the constant attempt to decry the aid which is being given from this country to these unfortunate people and that there are millions of people in the world who have every reason to be deeply grateful both to the charities referred to from the cross-benches and to the british government for the efforts that they are making in these distressing circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords if jobs policies are to have a top priority will my noble friend the minister make a close study of the number of jobs that are lost particularly by young people and particularly in small businesses and small service operations every time a wages council decision is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i start with an assumption <e> <s> i assume that this island will continue to export or try to export one-third of everything that it makes <e> <s> i assume that it will buy much of what it wants abroad <e> <s> i assume that it will live by foreign trade <e> <s> on that assumption there is no choice <e> <s> we have to be competitive and efficient or we fail in everything and above all we fail in any jobs policy <e> <s> against that background i accept the governments strategy <e> <s> abroad there is a policy of wider trade and payments living with the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the rules of the eec and so forth <e> <s> i think that that is inevitable and indeed necessary to us <e> <s> at home to major in their attack on inflation <e> <s> for inflation in this situation would suck in imports <e> <s> inflation erodes jobs inflation loses markets not only here but overseas as well <e> <s> and i agree with the government in their policy about union legislation for the abuse of union power and immunities make free wage negotiations impossible <e> <s> free wage negotiation is an essential factor in a free society and the swift moving technological world in which we live <e> <s> so i regard the governments policies their strategy as not only right but inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever conflicting statements may have been made by the press over the weekend is the noble lord aware that the government are much to be congratulated on the firm action they have taken as well as on the brevity with which the statement on it was delivered <e>", "<cs> my lords i have really only three points to make <e> <s> i want to say a word about sterling <e> <s> i want to say a word about sterling because i think that the value of our money matters quite a lot <e> <s> i do not stand here to criticise the chancellor of the exchequer i have held that office myself <e> <s> i know what pressures operate on a minister in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> i am not giving way my lords because there are other people speaking in this debate and i also have other points to make <e> <s> the point i wish to make now is that there is far less room to manoeuvre between parties when they actually come to the business of government <e> <s> they are all driven sooner or later much closer to one another <e> <s> what political parties should be doing is battling for the centre ground <e> <s> if i may say so with great respect to the noble lord lord beswick and the labour party i wish that they could join in battle for the centre ground <e> <s> it is only when you have parties battling for the centre that consensus in any real form is possible <e> <s> therefore i make that my second point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i represent telecommunications interests and i declare my interest <e> <s> i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that unless the british electronics industry can open up its ideas to the whole of europe and persuade europe to open up that market to us there is little prospect of our being able to compete in future with either the japanese or the amercans <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend continue to rub into the noble lord lord beswick that there are men and women in all ranks of employment with rare skills and who are in extremely short supply who are vital to the creation of jobs in this country and that the only way of attracting quality of this kind is on some occasions to pay over the odds and that it is necessary to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> many people do magnificent things and not for profit at all <e> <s> i was talking about how you create the wealth to help those people who cannot help themselves and for that purpose somebody has to make a profit otherwise there is no surplus with which to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise simply to thank those who have participated in the debate and to express my special thanks to the noble baroness lady seear and to the noble lord lord barnett for <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house should be deeply grateful to my noble friends lord harmar-nicholls and lady faithfull for raising this matter <e> <s> indeed it goes to the root of the bill <e> <s> like my noble friend lady faithfull in my life i have seen many reorganisations <e> <s> they have been argued sometimes in industry and sometimes in local government powerfully and passionately for the efficiencies that they will attain <e> <s> but no reorganisation will really work unless one has answered the -dollar question of what is happening to the men employed in that reorganisation <e> <s> what is their situation now and what will be their situation tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise simply to say that i find myself very much in agreement with the speech which has been made by the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> i see the arguments <e> <s> i thought that they were put with great skill by the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool and i must confess that i feel a conservative always unorthodox perhaps respect and affection for the right reverend prelate <e> <s> there is force in his argument <e> <s> there is a case for a tier there <e> <s> there is a case in a great city like liverpool for having some overall body of that character <e> <s> quite obviously it is the case and it is a case that is can be and has been by him powerfully argued <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that it was a jolly good speech that she made and that no one capable of recognising that they were actually in this chamber and that this chamber was a debating society could possibly take any exception to it <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend thank the noble lord lord jacques for the uncovenanted tribute that he is trying to pay to the success of the policies of her majestys government and at the same time invite the noble lord to share his investment advice with other members of your lordships house so that we can all enjoy a per cent <e> <s> return on our investments <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the british telecommunications industry is technically right out in front in the techniques associated with dbs broadcasting <e> <s> although i agree that there are all these problems of funding does she accept that if anything can be done to accelerate matters it would be of

few days in office and one debate on having responded to some of the views expressed to him <e> <s> it would indeed be a sorry day for parliament if ministers were to be bitterly criticised every time that they respond to arguments put forward in this house or in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were any evidence which linked those syrians with anything so grave as the actual plot against the e a aeroplane is <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister include among his conclusions maintaining a determination to resist all pressure from opposition parties to depart dramatically from her majestys governments economic policies which would only have the most disastrous results upon our current balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider whether the almost daily announcement of what appear to be rather trivial incidents in nuclear power stations is really very helpful to the objectives that the noble lord lord taylor properly has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness one question <e> <s> i am not sure that i press her too earnestly to answer it but it could be asked <e> <s> it is where do we go from here <e> <s> i ask the noble baroness whether she agrees that there is a view that money has been poured into the national health service <e> <s> i know there are views that more should be poured but there is certainly one view that masses of money have been poured and grave doubts exist about the quality of management to manage an organisation of that size and that cost <e> <s> mr paige was given some degree of responsibility concerned with management and though we may talk about horses for courses i could ask the noble baroness if she would consider whether the next horse ought to be given infinitely more authority over the management side of the health service if any real impact is to be made on that organisation to ensure that whatever sum is eventually agreed to be paid is spent to the best advantage <e>", "<cs> may i with diffidence say just a word not about the time but about the merits of the amendment <e> <s> i have the deepest respect for those who moved the amendment all of whom i count among my friends <e> <s> however i am bound to say that i hope they do not press it to a division and i hope that my noble friend the minister will advise the committee to reject it if they do <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we debated this point a little earlier in the bill <e> <s> at that time we were considering the first part of this amendment which effectively was to link child benefit to the cost of living <e> <s> i hope that the house will not accept the amendment for the reasons which were put so eloquently and with such knowledge and force by my noble friend lady gardner <e> <s> quite a number of benefits are linked to the cost of living but child benefit is a little different <e> <s> child benefit is not a case of each according to his means or each according to his needs <e> <s> it affects that section of the population which has no children paying for that section of the population that is fortunate enough to have children <e> <s> it is without means test and without tax <e> <s> of course it is immensely popular i would not deny that for one moment <e> <s> the richer members of the middle classes delight in this <e> <s> never have they been offered anything so good <e> <s> to have this sum of money paid regularly to the wife is a delightful thing <e> <s> members of the working classes in full employment and high pay are delighted but many of them are slightly amazed to receive these sums of money <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government continue stoutly to resist all the attempts of the <e>", "<cs> my lords do noble lords agree that perhaps the less we ask in detail about consultations and the more we rely upon the standing experience and reputation of the prime minister and her acknowledged friendship and loyalty to the united states the more likely we are to be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that if we suffered an attack conventional or unconventional a great many terrible things would happen not only to nuclear power stations <e> <s> is that not the reason we maintain an independent nuclear deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that if anyone genuinely wishes to give help to the unemployed or to find a proper analysis of this great social problem questions of this kind must be asked <e> <s> indeed the only question is why more of them were not asked before <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend convey to the prime minister our congratulations from this side of the house on so successful a mission on such important matters and in particular on obtaining assurances which make clear that the keeping of a credible effective nuclear deterrent lies plain before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an affectionate relationship with your lordships <e>

difficult to sit in a room with the chiefs of staff and try to persuade them that the weapon you are choosing has to be as ineffective as the outdated weapon you are phasing out <e> <s> i honestly do not believe that that is a sensible way of weapon development <e> <s> i do not think the chiefs of staff will regard it as a sensible way either <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is right <e> <s> perhaps it is i who am feeling years older <e> <s> whatever its birthday may have been polaris will be out of use by the middle of the s or before <e> <s> therefore the time has arrived indeed it has passed when we have to start planning the successor system <e> <s> the successor system has been chosen and planned <e> <s> a great deal of time and money have been spent upon it <e> <s> the other successor systems which the noble lord proposes will in fact now cost more than trident <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank those members of your lordships house who have spoken to this motion and indeed to thank those noble lords who have listened to those who have spoken to this motion and indeed to thank those noble lords who have listened to those who have withdraw my motion

rather strange to hear from the labour party an argument that a change in the ownership of assets should never have any effect on creating the wealth of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord investigate the cost and probable delivery date of the much inferior weapons ordered by the sdp <e>", "<cs> my lords the house should indeed be grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn for introducing this debate <e> <s> he said many things that find an echo in many parts of the house and he expressed some anxieties which are shared by all <e>", "<cs> may i just say a word on this subject to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i have no interest to declare in this matter <e> <s> indeed if anything i was on the other side so to speak <e> <s> i was brought up not in the bank but in the treasury <e> <s> but i hope very much that he will not press this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord bruce of donington will take note of what has been said by the noble lord lord obrien <e> <s> when people are asked to join boards and institutions the object is to try to get the best people available in the country for the job <e> <s> if the

for the laundering of the proceeds of large-scale crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene for a few moments in this debate in which i have not yet spoken <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord young of graffham has the matter just about right in what is a desperately difficult argument <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an honour and a privilege to speak after the contribution of the noble lord lord basnett <e> <s> it falls to me very genuinely to compliment him on the quality of his maiden speech <e> <s> the noble lord quite rightly said that he would make a non-controversial speech but it was no less powerful a speech because it was non-controversial <e> <s> the points the noble lord made were made from deep knowledge and with great sincerity and i think they made a deep impression upon the whole house <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so <e> <s> nevertheless i pursue my argument <e> <s> if ever there was a man who deserved that assistance even in the terms which the noble lord lord murray has just stated it was jim callaghan <e> <s> he had devoted his life to preserving the immunities of the trade union movement <e> <s> he had challenged his leader mr wilson as he then was who let us remember introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not come between the house and the noble baroness for more than a few moments but perhaps it may be helpful even to the noble baroness if i make a few short comments on what has been said <e> <s> the debate is rather apt both in origin and timing <e> <s> its mood comes from a speech which was made from the cross-benches by a noble lord who has a very deep knowledge of a very difficult branch of journalism that is particularly concerned with defence <e> <s> the noble lord made a remarkably powerful speech which certainly deserves the deepest consideration by those new men who are now in charge of broadcasting in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that some contribution to this difficult problem might be made if health authorities were encouraged to make fuller use of beds in private hospitals many of which are not filled at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise simply to thank your lordships for this excellent debate <e> <s> there were some very good speeches from noble lords including those from the maiden speakers <e> <s> i learnt much from listening to the speeches from all sides of the house and i am grateful for having had the opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate the welcome that will come from many quarters for such a positive constructive and undogmatic statement of strategy in relation to the co-operation and intervention of government in the affairs of industry and the hope that it may help to set the pattern for what clearly will be a market-led economy for many years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord at least on one point if on no other <e> <s> i agree that this is a very wide-ranging white paper <e> <s> one could talk about many things from restrictive practices to regional policy <e> <s> but for my own part i should rather concentrate as the noble lord lord joseph did in a brilliant maiden speech upon the principle involved here <e> <s> this paper in some ways goes to the root of the relations between industry and the government <e> <s> it is part of the pattern which this government have drawn up on how a government should conduct themselves in a free democratic society <e>", "<cs> my lords the great service that we debate today will i think always be coupled with the name of aneurin bevan <e> <s> i remember nye as do some others in this house with his unmistakable welsh voice and the slight stammer that he adopted when in the grip of great emotion <e> <s> the health service was a triumphant contribution to the welfare of the nation <e> <s> hundreds of thousands of men women and children have cause to be grateful to him <e> <s> it is a matter of honour for him and for the great party of which he was so notable a member <e>", "<cs> i rise for just a few moments as a most imperfect christian but a layman to offer a short contribution to this discussion <e> <s> my aim is a rather simpler aim than some have stated <e> <s> i should like to see in what is acknowledged to be a christian country christian children being brought up as christians in the schools and that they should as we shall discuss on a later amendment have an act of christian worship daily when they are there <e> <s> it seems to me that those aspirations are shared by millions of my fellow countrymen and they find it difficult to understand why there should be any problem or any doubt about it <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> the right reverend prelate said that we must be careful not to do things which would cause great unease <e> <s> when the right reverend prelate is considering these matters he should not underestimate the great unease which exists in this country at the moment about the failure and it is a failure to give christian education properly in our schools <e> <s> i fully accept that this amendment is not the correct amendment to achieve all that and that there are problems about the drafting and all these things but we have to do something more than exists at the moment <e> <s> we must somehow devise machinery a little more apt to produce the results which millions of parents are asking for in this country <e> <s> i hope that the right reverend prelate will bear those things in mind <e> <s> with that i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am just coming to that if i may <e> <s> it was originally intended to take amendment no <e> <s> and i am happy to do anything i am told to do <e> <s> however amendment no <e> <s> deals with an entirely separate subject and it would simplify the discussion and be much shorter if i moved it briefly after these amendments and we had the discussion then <e> <s> it is quite a separate point <e>", "<cs> if i may be permitted to say so it was not agreed with me at any rate nor with my noble friend lord somers <e> <s> i feel it would be very much easier to debate these quite separate issues separately <e> <s> it will create utter confusion if we try to discuss everything together <e>", "<cs> i shall concentrate therefore on the amendments dealing with religious worship <e> <s> the first amendment here amendment no <e> <s> which i have moved is to insert the word christian <e> <s> i very much hope that the minister will be able to accept this <e> <s> it is absolutely critical to clauses on the subject of worship that we have the word christian incorporated in them <e> <s> the definitive and longer amendment dealing with it is in the name of my noble friend lady cox and i shall refer to that in the course of my remarks <e> <s> the situation as it stands in the bill is explained in clause which states <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i found the ministers reply disappointing <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is absolutely right but i happen to be a christian and i am not ashamed to say so <e> <s> i believe in the christian religion <e> <s> i have found great joy and comfort myself and i want to see it extended to others <e> <s> other men hold other views <e> <s> that is why in the amendments under discussion particularly that in the name of the noble baroness lady cox we make provision for the others <e> <s> we do not offer to moslems the opportunity to share in some mishmash act of worship we offer them the opportunity to engage in moslem worship <e>", "<cs> in answer to what the right reverend prelate said i have uttered no word of criticism whatever of him in my remarks <e> <s> i have never suggested that there is anything un-christian in what he does <e> <s> i have the highest admiration for him and i am a very humble member of his church <e> <s> he has his responsibilities and he has many great problems which i accept <e> <s> i too have my responsibilities <e> <s> all who are christians have our responsibilities <e>", "<cs> i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> if i may perhaps say a word of thanks to the right reverend prelate for what he has been saying nothing i have ever said or thought is meant to be used in criticism against him <e> <s> i yield to no man in my respect for him both for his humanity and for his christianity <e> <s> i understand fully the difficulties that he is in <e>", "<cs> i will use practically any word the right reverend prelate asks me to use <e> <s> it is not other faiths that are stopping us <e> <s> the fault lies not in our stars but in our souls if we are underlings in this matter <e>", "<cs> not for the first time i find myself in agreement with my noble friend lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> i think that he has struck exactly the right note in this matter <e> <s> we have expressed our views strongly and we have great sympathy for the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i think that he understands the depth of feeling behind him in any negotiations that he enters <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in answer to the debate so far <e> <s> i do not want us to continue debating the community charge <e> <s> the committee has just had a long and valuable debate upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may raise one question of procedure before the right reverend prelate starts <e> <s> there are grouped with this amendment some other amendments which is quite something on a report stage <e> <s> it is quite a problem for the right reverend prelate <e> <s> obviously i do not quarrel with it but we may well have something like a second reading debate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might ask my noble friend to consider what he is saying on that point <e> <s> nobody could possibly object to the first amendment it is a drafting amendment <e> <s> to say that the decision of the house on a drafting amendment will affect the length of debate or the closeness of the analysis of other matters which raise far more important issues later cannot be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind my noble friend that i have taken the prudent course bearing in mind that something like this might present itself to withdraw all the relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not discuss it here <e> <s> i only discussed it in the most general terms on second reading <e> <s> i shall not move it formally but with a considered speech at the appropriate point in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we have gone a long way and we are indebted both to the noble baroness lady cox and to the right reverend prelate for having gone so far <e> <s> the speech of the noble lord lord houghton rather encouraged me <e> <s> i felt that we had gone further than i thought when i listened to him <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting my noble friends perhaps i may put one point to which i should like an answer <e> <s> i am in a rather curious position <e> <s> the right reverend prelate will correct me if i am wrong but i believe that he himself believes that christianity should be the basis of religious education <e> <s> i shall be very surprised if he says anything else <e> <s> however he has a very real problem which faces not only him but everybody namely that in a certain number of areas of this country there are very large populations that are not christian <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> the noble lord lord parry sitting behind him made an extremely well informed speech just <e>", "<cs> my lords the last person i want to offend is the noble baroness <e> <s> i said that the noble lord lord stewart of fulham asked this question and that it was raised and perfectly rightly raised by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> it has been raised by many people <e> <s> what does one do about the other faiths <e> <s> if an act of worship is mainly christian one can say although it is not made very plain that one has an act of worship broadly wide enough to permit almost anybody to attend it <e> <s> that is an unhappy solution for christians and it is an equally unhappy solution for other faiths <e> <s> my noble friends and i have received a good number of approaches from people of other faiths to say how unhappy they are to see their beliefs trivialised or subsumed in some all-purpose act of worship <e> <s> in their families and in their churches they practise very devout acts of worship <e>", "<cs> my lords may i perhaps just call the attention of the noble lord to the particular amendment that we are discussing <e> <s> if he will look at page of the marshalled list in the amendment standing in the name of the right reverend prelate the subsection with which we are dealing is this <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i rise simply to say that moving this amendment has created rather more heat than i had either intended or anticipated <e> <s> like everybody else my object is to support the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i agree with virtually everything that he is trying to do <e> <s> i see some gap between his expressed intention and the bill and amendments as drafted which come before the house but he has offered in the most generous terms to meet us and discuss these matters <e> <s> we shall certainly take that offer up <e> <s> i thank him very much for it <e> <s> against that background i am absolutely willing to withdraw the amendment and beg leave to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it absolutely plain to the noble lord lord harris that any conversations we have with the right reverend prelate will have nothing to do with the date of the third reading of the bill <e> <s> indeed he has enough problems on his hands without having to take that one on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give unequivocal congratulations to the hotel and catering industry that works so hard and which does a magnificent job in attracting tourists to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that almost anyone setting out to try to control the excessive use of credit is bound to consider the price of money and that the chancellors policy with <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express the hope that we will leave this bill alone <e> <s> i feel that if we reflect quietly about it the house may come to the conclusion in more quarters than one that that is the right course <e> <s> i recognise to the full the sincerity of those who have argued the case regarding the charges for dentistry or as we are now discussing eye tests <e> <s> of course they are sincere <e> <s> of course there are merits in the arguments that they have put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend make it plain that there is nothing whatever obscene in some educational activities being voluntarily funded other than by state funds <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question asked by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes does the minister agree that what matters is not who is represented in this debate but how we can pick the very best people available and enable them greatly to improve the present management of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that thanks partly to demographic reasons and partly to the admirable policies of her majestys government there will be a great shortage of young workers in this country that it will be very difficult to find them and that they will be in a sellers market <e> <s> in those circumstances would it not be very odd indeed to try to clutter the whole matter up with bureaucratic statutory instruments <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse the good wishes that the noble lord lord callaghan expressed to the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord mishcon said that this is a subject which has strained the ingenuity of all parties and of all governments <e> <s> that point was well illustrated in the speech of the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead who described his difficulties in achieving a solution of his own no doubt an ingenious one through a labour cabinet <e> <s> we sympathise with him <e> <s> we had the advantage of being able to see the smiles on the face of the noble lord lord callaghan as he described his efforts in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords they should be read <e> <s> they should undoubtedly be read <e> <s> let us face it dick crossmans view of security was a bit different <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe but he used to seize me in the corridors of this house and say peter you have no conception what they got up to in cabinet this morning <e> <s> there is no reason why one should not reveal this <e> <s> i do not say it against him <e> <s> i loved the man <e> <s> however it is a different approach to public life <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the good defence of earlier publication which i absolutely accept from the noble lord <e> <s> i would find it a bit astonishing if having gone through all this trouble with the bill the treasury managed to put back a criminal offence into the finance bill but it may be able to do so <e> <s> however this would be a committee point <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be a very odd form of negotiation if a party were to put trident on the table as a negotiating factor with all the world knowing that it was desperately anxious to get rid of it <e>", "<cs> while there are differences which may divide us in this debate and there are many i believe that we are united in our desire to see a strong security service <e> <s> as to the methods this is a sufficiently complicated matter to warrant good men holding different views about it <e> <s> there were marked differences between the solution given by the noble lord lord callaghan and the solution given by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> in another place the opposition were arguing for a supervisory service but of an utterly different sort to that proposed either by the noble lord lord mishcon or the noble lord lord callaghan <e> <s> indeed the solution argued here was much condemned by mr roy hattersley when speaking in the other place <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is perfectly entitled to hold that view but i have grave doubts about it <e> <s> it is very difficult to sack anybody anyway <e> <s> for a committee of five people all of whom hold different views and who probably know him in different ways to come along and say sack him <e> <s> and by the way sack maclean too because he has been found tight on several occasions would be a most unlikely event <e> <s> if you wish to have a tough rule and tough government in the security service have a good home secretary and above all as someone said have a good director general <e>", "<cs> that is the proposition that has been put forward <e> <s> it is very difficult to know what else they will do or how else they can discharge their function <e> <s> it is said that they must be on the inside of the barrier of secrecy and that they must know everything that goes on <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord mishcon shakes his head <e>", "<cs> i had rather hoped that that might be the view but when the committee was required to investigate research assistants i began to realise its review was getting a little deeper than a general oversight of the proceedings <e> <s> it would have to study all these matters <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord will agree that having heard all the secrets that it was worthwhile hearing from the security service the committee would have to make up its mind how to compile a report and make its own judgment on what it was safe to say <e> <s> i will not repeat the admirable speech made by my noble friend lord whitelaw but the difficulties that would face a committee under those terms at this moment or at any other are almost inconceivable <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recognise that with the mercifully improved climate of peace in central europe the danger of the western powers losing their will-power their nerve and their sense of unity has always been an apparent and possible danger that we must face <e> <s> will he therefore wish the prime minister well in her efforts with president bush to try to hold this great alliance together so that the great benefits that have come from that including the present climate of peace may be continued in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever else has happened in the past years is it not a rather cheerful fact that it has resulted in the labour party embarking upon a policy of trying to reverse almost every policy that they pursued before that period <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord remember that wages councils tend to restrain wages among the most successful and cause unemployment among the weakest members of society <e> <s> will the government therefore consider very carefully before developing the system <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever else is done about teachers pay so far as possible will the noble baroness ensure that headmasters are enabled to attract teachers of adequate quality to the places where they are most sorely needed <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the unstable world in which we live does the minister agree that any government would require a crystal ball to answer the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords before asking the public detailed questions on these complex matters will my noble friend remind the noble lord that the british labour party is fully and publicly committed to membership of the common market <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene for just a moment in this complicated debate i would say that this is not an easy subject because the noble baroness lady cox interprets amendment no <e> <s> as being multifaith and the noble lord lord jenkins thinks it is so totally christian as to be unacceptable on that score <e> <s> if you can get those views honestly and sincerely held by intelligent people on both sides of the committee i think the right reverend prelate would agree with me that we have to think carefully about the wording that we use
