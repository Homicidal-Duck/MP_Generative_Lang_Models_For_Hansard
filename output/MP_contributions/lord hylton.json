noble lord any further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is quite certain that very nearly everyone in this house and very nearly everyone in another place and probably opinion throughout the world welcomes independence for the gilbert islands <e> <s> neverthe <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one further brief question <e> <s> could my noble friend and those who will be reviewing the law consider whether a modernised version of the old riot act would be of great help in the control of the kind of disturbances which we have been experiencing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to follow on from what my noble friend lord brookeborough said about detention and interrogation and ask the government whether they would examine very carefully the state of affairs that prevails in the netherlands where as we know the dutch government have been up against some very tough terrorists <e> <s> i understand that there a man can be detained for up to six or seven days before he is either charged or released but that during that period there are considerable safeguards built into the system to make sure there are no abuses or even suggestions of abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just interrupt <e> <s> we know about the prevention of terrorism act being part of united kingdom law but will the government look at this point of having a comprehensive system covering the whole which can be invoked when required anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i should apologise for intervening today <e> <s> when we had the debate on th july on what i might call the principal order i made some remarks which were no doubt ill-prepared unclear and which certainly failed to persuade my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i tried then to suggest that there should be drafted one emergency law applicable to the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> this might be either in replacement of the emergency provisions act and the prevention of terrorism act or it could be in addition to both of them <e> <s> i hope that i shall be in order in trying to clarify that suggestion a little <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord newall for raising this question this evening <e> <s> i hope that he will be successful in prodding the government into being perhaps a little more active and certainly much more successful than their predecessors on the question of cyprus <e> <s> it would not be using excessive language to say that the cyprus question has been festering for far too long <e> <s> the drift one can only call it that of events has had the most unfortunate consequences first for the island itself secondly for the relationships complicated as they already are between greece and turkey and thirdly for nato <e> <s> i will not follow the noble lord lord brockway into all the intricacies of non-alignment <e> <s> i think it enough to note the fact that nato has suffered because this question has been for so long unresolved <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the problem how to put back the clock or years <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all extremely grateful to the noble lord lord dunleath for the way in which he introduced this debate <e> <s> i hope it may be fitting if i say from these back-benches to him or about him that nobody would describe him as a career politician <e> <s> nevertheless he has been democratically elected in northern ireland on several occasions and he plays an important part in the debates on northern ireland in your lordships house <e> <s> i believe that he does this from a sense of responsibility and from a real love of his fellow-countrymen <e> <s> i share with him his vision of an ireland that may become deeply religious but distinctly non-sectarian <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply which i realise can be only an interim one <e> <s> will he accept that there is a considerable body of opinion which is pressing and which succeeded in convincing professor astins working party of the need for change and improvement in the present system <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that quite full reply <e> <s> while i would not wish to complicate the reorganisation which he mentioned may i ask whether he would consider giving some role to district councils to act as a channel for grievances for suggestions even from the people to the housing executive and in relation to individual district or area offices <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to my noble friend for those remarks but may i ask whether the government will give some publicity to the arrangements which he just outlined so they can be known rather more widely than they perhaps are at present <e>", "<cs> my lords an acute observer of modern industrial society has written about apoplexy at the centre and the anaemia at the periphery <e> <s> this kind of thing very much affects northern ireland situated as it is on the very outside rim of europe <e> <s> northern ireland shares with some of the remoter regions of great britain geographic problems which are inescapable <e> <s> when one turns to the economic situation it suffers also from the hangover and consequences of very great prosperity in the th century particularly in shipbuilding and textiles as has already been said <e> <s> if that were not bad enough the very successful post-war textile industry is now in serious trouble with a worldwide surplus of man-made fibres the consequences of the energy crisis and very stiff competition from various fibres produced in the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the nuclear power stations at torness and heysham which are now under construction have anti-earthquake devices incorporated in them <e> <s> does that not show that the authorities have had a change of mind and are incorporating safety precautions which were not previously thought necessary and can he tell us why this is so <e>", "<cs> if the ministers who are replying for the government could perhaps give an undertaking from the dispatch box that they will draw this debate to the attention of the responsible persons within british rail who can look at the question on a united kingdom basis then i think those who have spoken to the amendment already would feel a lot happier <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that this must be the first occasion on which we have had white rabbits in the middle of a security debate <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord kilbracken has not convinced me about withdrawing the army and i do not imagine that he has convinced very many others of your lordships <e> <s> we are all grateful to the noble lord lord leonard for making us smile in the midst of a serious and sombre evening and i concede that he has a serious point as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> is it not a fact that the designed life of these stations was at first taken to be years <e> <s> can my noble friend say how it is possible to extend that life by a further nine years <e>", "<cs> my lords when we debated this subject last july her majestys government had been in office for only two months <e> <s> now some nine months have gone by and i think we are entitled to ask them what they are doing and how they are facing their responsibilities <e> <s> i should like to raise three points of which i have given notice to my noble friend <e> <s> for the last years young greek and turkish <e>", "<cs> my lords i was delighted to hear my noble friends original answer and his reply to the supplementary <e> <s> however can he say whether the government fully appreciate how much one village amenity such as a post office or a school or a shop reinforces all the others <e> <s> do the government understand that villages need a full set of amenities <e>", "<cs> in the interests of short speeches may i just say that the presence in your lordships house of the mobile bench so-called and the invaluable help we get from them on so many occasions is a very strong argument for deciding in favour of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will resist this amendment for the reasons given by the noble lord lord beaumont <e> <s> i should like to go a stage further and express the hope that the chairmen of these committees will not be teachers employed by the local authority in question <e> <s> i know that is not written into the bill but i hope it will become the accepted practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the voluntary homes are being realistic about the position <e> <s> they would like an avalanche of funds but they probably will not get them <e>", "<cs> what would the effect be on a nursery class in a voluntary aided school <e>", "<cs> i venture to suggest that the historical position may not be entirely satisfactory <e> <s> if the noble lord lord stewart feels like pressing his amendment i personally will support him as i hope some of my noble friends will <e> <s> what my noble friend lord bellwin is saying confirms the substance of the point behind the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that the sensitive question of records will be given further thought <e> <s> there are two further points to be borne in mind in this reconsideration the first is the right of the parents to information the reasonable right and the second is the legitimate interest of the child <e> <s> these two things in certain circumstances may be seen perhaps to be clashing but such circumstances would be very rare <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord wells-pestell that not all teachers may be suitable persons in this context <e> <s> however i think the amendment has slightly more merit than he is prepared to admit <e> <s> i say that because the amendment protects the rights of parents as well as the rights of governors and managers of schools <e> <s> four years ago in a primary school we had an experience of this type with my eldest son <e> <s> in that case looking at the amendment paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a geological branch of central government regularly takes days to settle its bills <e> <s> is he further aware that the housing executive in northern ireland takes approximately the same time as i pointed out to his noble friend lord elton with the result that small builders are not willing to tender for maintenance work in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a highly technical matter and i venture into it with very great trepidation <e> <s> however i should like to follow on from what my noble friend lord renton has said and no doubt my noble friend the minister will be expressing a view later as to whether his method has some advantages over her method <e> <s> having said that may i thank her for what she said about the giving of information to the parents of handicapped children <e> <s> i think this was most helpful after the government had succeeded by a small margin in defeating the previous amendment at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak again i think i understood my noble friend the minister to be saying that it was a policy decision that the matters of parents preferences and of appeals regarding handicapped children should come in a subsequent bill <e> <s> am i right on this <e>", "<cs> my lords if this amendment were to be agreed there would be some danger of misleading information being published <e> <s> let me take the question of staffing quotas <e> <s> if the information is about a previous year it may be quite inaccurate for the current year <e> <s> if it is a forecast of what will happen in years ahead it may never be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is perhaps fitting that someone from this side of the house should say something on this amendment <e> <s> i believe the open university is a brilliant british innovation which has led the whole world in many ways and which is very much envied and admired by some other countries <e> <s> on those grounds i hope that my noble friends on the front bench and the government generally will look on this amendment more favourably and give it greater consideration than other special cases <e> <s> the second point is that students of the open university being by their nature solitary people require tremendous motivation to proceed with their studies right through to the end <e> <s> therefore there could still be scope for regulations making money or grants available after students have shown determination for six months or a year to prove themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friend lord ridley there are two possible things at least which school kitchens can do and which some of them are doing already <e> <s> one is to provide meals-on-wheels for old people and the other is to provide meals at a fixed point for lunch clubs and such like <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this could be an important amendment and i say that because i believe it is the governments intention to restore the real level of rent rebates to the value which they originally had when they were first introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have written to my noble friend lady young since the committee stage i wonder whether she will be able to say anything to me in reply particularly about the destruction of records for instance when a child finally leaves school <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a suspicion that we ought to have these debates more often as we all seem to have so much to say of very great importance <e> <s> as this is the first time that i have spoken in a forestry debate i feel i ought to declare my own interest in a medium-small woodland area in somerset between and foot contours <e> <s> i am extremely keen on the multiple use of land and in my woods i have orienteering going on with no damage problems at all <e> <s> i have a nature trail under construction which i hope will be ready next month and this is in addition to the more traditional forms of shooting <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord caithness will be pleased when i tell him that i am a convert to the idea of small felling areas and to the enrichment of existing woodlands <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has been subject to timetables and to the guillotine in another place <e> <s> it is quite clear that it is very much in need of revision and that is one of the chief functions of your lordships house <e> <s> may i welcome chapter ii of the bill and go on to make two rather specialised points <e> <s> i want to reinforce everything that has been said so far in this debate about hostels and common lodging houses <e> <s> it is a very sad fact that in the last two and a half years there have been over deaths from fires in such premises <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his detailed reply and also for the governments welcome to the report <e> <s> in view however of the fact that northern ireland has a much colder and wetter climate than most of britain and that there is higher unemployment and worse conditions of housing by and large would the government consider a more generous scale of welfare benefits for that part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend comment on the recommendation in the report for a single integrated housing benefit to be applicable to northern ireland <e> <s> if that could be experimented with there would it not also be of great benefit to the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i apologise for inaudibility <e> <s> i was going to say that i hope my noble friend lord bellwin will be prepared to listen very carefully to the arguments that will be brought forward on these amendments and that he will persuade his ministerial colleagues in another place to do the same <e> <s> it may be already known to your lordships that the housing association programme for england and wales which would in normal times have amounted to no fewer than new or rehabilitated units has been cut for to <e> <s> that represents a cut of nearly per cent <e> <s> a cut that will have a very serious effect on many families and individuals living in the most unsatisfactory housing conditions <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that my noble friend is unable to provide any forecasts or estimates <e> <s> can he say how building societies are to lend to housing association tenants purchasing their properties at a time when they are unable to supply even the needs of the general house purchase market <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has referred to me and since i was moved by what the noble lord lord evans of claughton was saying earlier i think it is right that i should state my position <e> <s> the conservative party which i support has for many years insisted that local authorities should be able to determine the method of selection or the administrative procedures that govern how children are admitted to secondary schools <e> <s> in this bill it lays down with no possibility of local choice and with very few exceptions what is to happen on the sale of council houses to existing tenants

parts of the committee <e> <s> i think my noble friend lord sandford expressed the views of the committee extremely well when he said we have a shared concern over everything that concerns old peoples housing <e> <s> the noble baroness lady denington mentioned the extreme scarcity value of every unit of old peoples housing and how much i agree <e> <s> i am also extremely grateful to the noble lord lord seebohm for his support <e> <s> my contention is that every single vacancy that one gets in the existing stock of old peoples housing is absolutely vital <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans mentioned the possibility for old people to have a capital gain when they have bought their flat or bungalow <e> <s> i just wonder how many will be in that position when one considers the proportion who are now dependent upon supplementary pensions <e> <s> i do not think that they will be able to afford mortgages <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e> <s> surely he has confirmed to me that he is not considering amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he is prepared to consider amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw that amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether that is in order <e> <s> very few noble lords are on the opposition front bench let alone on the liberal front bench <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bellwin lays great reliance on clause as regards this amendment as he did in relation to my earlier amendment <e> <s> in doing so he is brushing aside entirely the fact that there are and presumably will be for quite a long time a large number of people in rural areas who are simply not in a financial position to buy <e> <s> it is for that reason that i hope this amendment will be pressed <e>", "<cs> i want to support this amendment <e> <s> i do so from the experience of having interviewed many hundreds of families who were living in housing stress areas and who themselves were in very great housing need <e> <s> i do so for the reasons the noble lord lord pitt has just brought to your lordships attention <e> <s> my noble friend the minister may reply that at present there is no statutory definition of a housing stress area <e> <s> to that i would say first of all that the secretary of state has only to designate one <e> <s> if that were not enough i am sure it would be possible to include a definition in one of the many schedules to the bill <e> <s> my noble friend may also say he prefers my amendment no <e> <s> which tries to stiffen up clause but i would much prefer to see the particular houses excluded from the right to buy in the first place <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could be allowed to add in support of the right reverend prelate that housing stress areas have been well known ever since the milner-holland report in and the london council for social service has done a tremendous amount of work defining them and suggesting where they should be <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend the minister a question of which i have given him notice <e> <s> with regard to group schemes of dwellings for the elderly i am anxious to discover whether both category and category schemes are exempt from the right to buy <e> <s> i should further like to ask my noble friend whether he can define what is meant by the term social service or special facilities in line on page of the bill <e>", "<cs> it was in regard to category and category <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord bellwin for saying that he will write to me <e> <s> i am sorry that he did not receive advance notice of my question since it was not only telephoned but sent in writing and his secretary confirmed to me this morning that it had been received <e> <s> may i add that unless much greater clarity can be got into the phrases social services and special facilities there will be long and considerable arguments about them when the bill becomes law because the local authorities and housing associations who do not wish to sell their own peoples units will try every expedient not to do so <e>", "<cs> yes i am delighted to ask leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be possible before report stage to have an answer both about the management point and about the useful life of flats <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in

exhibitions in one place <e> <s> would this not also be very much in accordance with the recommendations of the brandt commission report and would it not follow on from the discussions recently held at the venice economic summit <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider whether or not support can be given to british civil goods for developing countries to an extent comparable to the support now given to military sales which i understand are backed up by some civil servants working for the defence sales organisation <e>", "<cs> i express general support for this amendment <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he would consider this proposition and give a reply now or later <e> <s> if per cent <e> <s> discount is the correct figure after years occupation then surely per cent

coming into effect of this bill as an act thinking is still taking place as to how the regulations will be drawn up <e> <s> i understand that that could be a matter of only eight weeks after royal assent <e> <s> is my noble friend able to say a little more <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to press this amendment any further and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> obviously i do not have any particular brief for subsection of this amendment which may need a little redrafting or strengthening <e> <s> but i feel that the amendment is an improvement on the bill and gets the balance

that two years is too long <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble friend was not able to be more forthcoming <e> <s> i wonder whether there are some grounds for a compromise period here <e>", "<cs> before

does it apply only during the period of the option to those who are able to take advantage of the option <e>", "<cs> my point was about subsection of this clause and failure to pay rent <e>", "<cs>

been said that the noble viscount has raised an extremely important point <e> <s> i just wonder whether he should have drawn his amendment even wider to include voluntary bodies which employ residential social workers <e> <s> i am thinking of bodies like doctor barnardos homes or the church of england childrens society <e> <s> if my noble friend the minister can reassure us that the voluntary bodies do not need the same protection as the statutory ones that will be fine <e>", "<cs> i really had hoped that this amendment was one that my noble friend the minister could have

forth-coming at least towards the spirit behind this amendment <e> <s> local authorities have been saying for many many years that it is quite impossible to abolish residential qualifications <e> <s> i should like to quote the example of one which has done so and succeeded that is the london borough of hammersmith <e> <s> you would think that was a very difficult place in which to get away with it owing to housing stress and everything else but it was done and the housing manager in question has written an article about it in the journal of the institute of housing describing how it went

briefly like to support the noble baroness over this amendment <e> <s> the amounts required can be quite small or to start the finance <e> <s> i agree it would be not unreasonable to ask these co-operatives to put up something towards that themselves but very often they cannot find the whole of the money and there is a lack of charitable funds to cover this kind of thing <e> <s> it would be very helpful if some government agency or other could do something about it <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord bellwin for saying that there would be further consultations both with the national federation of housing associations and with the national federation of almshouses <e> <s> however i was disappointed in his reply in that i did not think he really covered the point made by my noble friend lord moyne about retrospection <e> <s> at this time of night i am very uncertain as to whether points made with great force about the assets of old charitable trusts have really been taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords this governments paper has been very thoroughly debated and so i as the ultimate back-bencher want just to look very briefly at some of the background to both northern and southern ireland <e> <s> those who study culture and anthropology seem to be fairly well agreed that ireland can be divided into three <e> <s> there are if i may call them so the irish-irish the scots-irish and the anglo-irish <e> <s> the cultural differences between these groups have been and still are reinforced by political and religious differences <e> <s> the three tribes have been predominantly catholic presbyterian and anglican in their religious outlook <e> <s> i very much agree with dr conor cruise obrien when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the government are taking steps to bring about some kind of international control of the old city of jerusalem and perhaps of east jerusalem too <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister not also say that he would also consider my amendment at committee stage at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how much i welcome the governments acceptance of the principle of co-terminus leases <e> <s> this is something to which i drew attention earlier in the bill pointing out the rigidity of the -year requirement <e> <s> speaking as a chartered surveyor and as a trustee of a charitable estate whose property is almost entirely let out on long leases both residential and commercial i only hope that the governments amendments are really watertight and will meet the case <e>", "<cs> my lords having spoken at second reading as strongly as i could about the unsatisfactory consequences of a combination of the discount and the option period i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> in moving it the noble baroness has touched on the effect of the present option on local authorities and particularly on local authority staffs <e> <s> i think that if her amendment is accepted there will be a great deal of saving of unnecessary administration and i hope the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important amendment <e> <s> i and many others have been most concerned and still are about the impact of the right to buy in rural areas <e> <s> it is for this reason that i wrote to my noble friend on the front bench immediately after the committee stage asking him what would be the criteria by which the secretary of state would designate his rural areas <e> <s> i also asked when these criteria would be published <e> <s> he has very kindly replied to me but i am sorry to say that all he has been able to put on paper is the following <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he say when he will speak to the government amendment no <e> <s> and would it not be to the convenience of the house if he did so now before the noble baroness lady birk made up her mind what to do with her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the whole house will be grateful to the noble viscount lord craigavon for having raised this question in the first place <e> <s> may i say now that i am very grateful to my noble friend lord bellwin for writing to me upon precisely the point that my noble friend lady faithful has just been mentioning which is the voluntary bodies carrying out social service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for what he has said particularly about the broad construction of the word development in the town and country planning act <e> <s> i am also grateful for what he said about the various categories of tenants who will not become secure by the fact that they have a tenancy <e> <s> i am a little disappointed that he could not go a step or two further and say that no local authority or housing association need board up a house which is empty for fear that if they put somebody in it that will become a secure tenancy and that they will never be able to do the rehabilitation which they want to do <e> <s> this is a very important amendment which has been moved by my noble friend simply because for too long there has been a total scandal of boarded-up and bricked-up houses which is something we all want to end <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am very disappointed with the governments reply to this amendment <e> <s> i should have thought that there was rather a strong case for the landlord being able to anticipate the subsequent judgment of the court <e> <s> then if the landlord happened to get it wrong he could be put right by the court <e> <s> in the interim period which may be quite long we would avoid the situation of a landlord having to keep on the husband as a secure tenant and finding extra accommodation for the wife and the children <e> <s> it seems to me very undesirable that two units should have to be provided for the same family <e> <s> unless my noble friend can say something rather more helpful i very much hope that the amendment will be pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am in order to speak again but i said that the court would have a later chance to correct anything that the landlord had done that was not legally correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest that the noble baroness is making heavy weather over this <e> <s> this ground for possession is something entirely permissive <e> <s> local authorities can act on it or not as they see fit <e> <s> they can exercise their housing management discretion <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans was helpful and for once i think the government are right and that the noble lord lord evans was right to be so helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords the practice at which this amendment is aimed appears to be a quite indefensible one <e> <s> i am grateful for what my noble friend the minister has said in reply <e> <s> he mentioned a circular of <e> <s> does this not show how quite often circulars do not get put into practice <e> <s> can the government keep on drawing the attention of recalcitrant local authorities to the shortcomings of their ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to suggest to the noble baroness lady birk that her amendment is cumbersome and would be very costly to put into practice <e> <s> if there is a large-scale abuse of holiday letting and i have yet to be convinced of that although there are perhaps some signs of it in london i should have thought that a much better method of tackling the situation would be to bring in an amendment saying that a holiday letting can only go on for perhaps six months and if the same person remains in those premises for longer than six months then it shall be taken to be a shorthold letting <e>", "<cs> my lords first i apologise to my noble friend the minister for the fact that i was not here to hear the beginning of the remarks which he made in moving his amendment <e> <s> despite that may i put to him one question and two comments arising from his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the question is this what precise types of premises will be affected by the new duty <e> <s> in relation to this i suggest that it will be vital that the legislation in this bill is not restricted solely to the large institutions <e> <s> i would point out that the fire last march in the kilburn hostel in which women were killed was in a three-storey terraced house <e> <s> it was quite a small house not an enormous hostel <e>", "<cs> my lords before the question is put may i say that the charitable housing associations in particular are extremely grateful to the noble lord for the care consideration and thought which he has put into drafting these amendments and in moving and speaking to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support this amendment so clearly moved by my noble friend lady vickers <e> <s> the essence of this amendment is the question of time <e> <s> what we are anxious to do is to prevent a perpetuity arising in favour of the government and the exchequer by inadvertence or by accident <e> <s> beyond that i would say that i hope that on many occasions where such surpluses arise the government will see fit to leave them in the hands of the association where the surplus is given of course that the government are satisfied that that association can make a really good use of that money in the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support this amendment i should declare an interest in that i am chairman of a small housing association which has already received a very limited amount of hag <e> <s> i should first like to thank the noble lord the minister for the very helpful remarks that he made earlier on amendment no <e> <s> which bear on this amendment of my noble friend lord boyd <e> <s> the essence of this amendment is the idea of apportionment and i wonder whether i could give some instances of the kind of case where apportionment is so much needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> i thought that perhaps my noble friend lady vickers was being slightly sanguine in moving her amendment when she said that the writing into an act of parliament of this new standard would create no homelessness at all <e> <s> i hope she is right but i fear that she may be wrong <e> <s> nevertheless like my noble friend lord sandford i too thought that the government were being unwelcoming <e> <s> if they think it is wrong now to write this in could they please tell us when they think it might be possible because it will be a great and useful step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> in many ways considerably superior to the government amendment <e> <s> i say that because it seems to contain more effective teeth and i hope that between now and third reading the government will look at the points i outlined earlier and in my view what my noble friend suggests in no <e> <s> has an advantage in that it is stronger and more enforceable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this very important amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness has made clear it is a non-partisan and a non-party-political amendment <e> <s> i think the noble baroness deserves our thanks for drafting and moving the amendment to deal with a matter of very considerable public interest <e> <s> she herself has pointed out how years have gone by since the cullingworth report of which i have often quoted in your lordships house and there has been very little progress indeed <e> <s> no doubt the government will say that we ought to give a chance to the voluntary scheme recently devised and i would say this by all means let us give it a trial but let us have something in the bill as a long-stop <e> <s> maybe this clause should not be put into operation for say three years or five years but let us have it there or something extremely like it so that there is a target towards which the voluntary scheme will we hope lead us <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the government will take this amendment very seriously and not by any manner or means brush it aside <e> <s> when mr ross brought in the act of shorthold was not envisaged it is something that has come up since then <e> <s> also during the course of a shorthold tenancy which could be as long as five years a persons circumstances may change completely children may be horn all sorts of things may happen <e> <s> i do think this is an important and very serious amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i moved an amendment in committee and also wrote to <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to what my noble friend the minister said about the technical considerations <e> <s> i suppose that these may explain the single word inappropriate in reason no <e> <s> <e> <s> by itself it looks hardly adequate to have just one adjective as the reason for refusing an amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask when the secretary of state will publish criteria by which special rural areas are to be defined <e> <s> will these criteria be circulated in draft for comment by interested parties <e> <s> and when do the government expect that everybody will know where the areas are and what is to happen <e> <s> this is going to have quite a considerable effect on the rights of individual would-be purchasers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should say on behalf of my noble friend lady vickers and the right reverend prelate the bishop of london that we have made some progress in this matter of hostels and houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend the minister why we have to have the last sentence in amendment no <e> <s> which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said but it seems that the amendment reduces the existing duties of local authorities and that is what we want to avoid if we possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords in this context may i ask if the government will continue to impress on all concerned and particularly on local authorities that agriculture by itself in the countryside is not enough and that there is also great need for forestry small businesses and small manufacturing industries <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow my noble friend lady elliot of harwood <e> <s> this debate is accelerating and i should like to move it on to new ground and say something about northern ireland <e> <s> earlier this autumn i visited ulster and i spent some time there <e> <s> i was received as always with a wonderful welcome and marvellous hospitality

are indeed happy that the number of violent deaths has fallen once again this year <e> <s> it is of course disappointing that the current round of political talks seems to have reached standstill and therefore i hope that the usual channels will find a way of arranging a general debate on northern ireland in the fairly near future <e>", "<cs> my lords pending the release of these detained prisoners will the government try to arrange for regular visiting of them by the international red cross <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> is it not a fact that over the last years successive governments have avoided rationalising personal housing finance that this has very considerable implications both for income support for families with children and for pensions policy and that all these matters tie in very closely with the whole question of means testing <e> <s> can we not have some further progress <e>", "<cs> my lords can i persuade my noble friend that it might be useful to compare the methods used in other countries to resolve the difficulties of personal housing finance given that i think there is fairly widespread acceptance that our own public subsidy system is shot through with anomalies <e>", "<cs> my lords as the question of old power stations has been touched on can my noble friend say what progress is being made in selling waste heat from existing power stations which is now largely heating the atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord chitnis for giving us the opportunity to debate the sombre and violent situation of el salvador and of some of its neighbours <e> <s> the social background to el salvador has already been sketched in and i should like to add one point <e> <s> the extremes of deprivation and violence have resulted in something like a quarter of a million people being displaced from their homes <e> <s> it is estimated that of these are refugees within el salvador itself and the other have been obliged to flee to neighbouring countries <e> <s> in addition there are some orphans it is thought <e> <s> it was for these reasons that in february this year the world council of churches launched an appeal for million for immediate relief and welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> can he say whether it is true that the defence sales organisation employs nearly persons and does this figure include or exclude a further employees of international military services limited a so-called commercial subsidiary of the ministry of defence <e> <s> are not these figures somewhat surprising when one compares them with the people working in the arms control and disarmament office of the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear if we look at the whole post-war period that there have been considerable advances and improvements in housing conditions <e> <s> it is true today that the vast majority of people are at least adequately housed <e> <s> however none of that gives any reason for complacency and here i agree strongly with what the noble lord lord evans of claughton said <e> <s> we need only think of the special needs of particular groups those for instance mentioned in her eloquent speech by my noble friend lady faithfull and some of those touched on by the noble lord lord pitt we need only think of the geographic areas of special need the obsolete and decaying victorian houses particularly in the older industrial areas or of the obsolete council housing needing large sums to be spent on repairs improvements and sometimes on total replanning and the housing stress areas mentioned by the noble lord lord pitt in london and elsewhere where housing need and other acute forms of social problem are found in the same place <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the indulgence of your lordships house in speaking not having put my name to the list of speakers <e> <s> i speak largely because no back-bencher on this side of your lordships house seems to have thought that this was an important enough matter on which to address you and also because i regret that so few on this side of the house have been present to hear the arguments <e> <s> it does seem to me that this bill is being rushed <e> <s> it is a constitutional matter and it is not one that should be rushed <e> <s> if we are to have disqualification and that may be necessary then i myself should much prefer that there should be disqualification from sitting in the other place rather than from standing for the other place

haste one often repents at leisure <e>", "<cs> i indicated on second reading that i supported the principle of this amendment and i hope the noble lord lord underhill will press it because in my view it is even more important than amendments nos <e> <s> or <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead on second reading indicated that the government were anxious in the northern irish context to stop up certain loopholes <e> <s> they may be doing so but they had better he careful because they will find there are an enormous number of loopholes still open and usable which would be almost impossible to cure by any amount of legislation <e> <s> i am thinking for instance of terrorists who have completed their sentences of others who have been sentenced to terms of less than one year and of the possibility of changes of name by deed poll as was brought out without reference to this bill in a question in the house earlier today <e> <s> in the past we have seen in other countries particularly in the commonwealth many occasions when former terrorists have been negotiated with been elected become prime ministers and valued members if the commonwealth <e> <s> can we sensibly say to a particular terrorist organisation you shall not try to make use of parliamentary and democratic procedure <e> <s> think we may be very unwise to do so <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and i very much hope that my noble friend will feel able to accept it <e> <s> he said on second reading at col on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords from what my noble friend the minister has said several times during the course of the passage of the bill it is quite clear that its prime motive is an anti-terrorist one <e> <s> it has been introduced because of the concern anxiety and disquiet which have been expressed by many sides to the government about abuses of the parliamentary process by terrorists <e> <s> can my noble friend therefore explain why it has been found necessary to tack on to the bill certain matters which deal with the technicalities of all elections <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill moved two amendments one dealing with postal votes and the other with returning officers which have absolutely nothing to do with terrorism <e> <s> the course which the government have adopted seems to be particularly strange because as i understand it a general review of electoral law is taking place in the home office <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend could answer this question all the more so because we have had to consider the whole bill in a mere hours <e>", "<cs> i am extremely sensitive to the points made today concerning security and fear <e> <s> it is for that reason that i wish to point out that the whole of clause refers to children born after the coming into force of the bill <e> <s> the bill is not retrospective <e> <s> i should have thought that was quite clear and i hope that your lordships will resist this amendment but on the other hand that you will accept amendments nos <e> <s> a and which we shall come to later and which will have just a slight softening effect <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has referred to questions of whether a person is settled or not being decided by civil servants <e> <s> could my noble friend the minister say whether clause <e>", "<cs> is it not entirely wrong to invite workers

support for amendment no <e> <s> a and consequential ones <e> <s> i hope the government will consider this not only very carefully but very sympathetically <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt moved this in the most persuasive way <e> <s> i would only add this <e> <s> it is surely desirable from the point of view of the child that these matters should be cleared up while the child is still in the primary school and before he is moved on to a secondary school <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend the minister for explaining the background to this second order <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to him for being able to give us some points of good news and hopeful news at what is otherwise a rather sombre moment <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice i regret <e> <s> however the position was slightly different from what it is now i think <e> <s> i come now to the question of complaints against the police <e> <s> it seems that the police complaints board has been to some extent ineffective because of the double jeopardy rule <e> <s> the recent rafferty tribunal was i understand frustrated by lack of co-operation from the police <e> <s> it may be worth while noting at this point that between and there were over complaints made to the board but that these resulted in only some prosecutions of police officers and in not one conviction <e> <s> may i ask her majestys government what their view is of the suggestion that in future there should be an independent complaints commission with power to carry out its own investigations and to order its own prosecutions <e>", "<cs> my lords in legal terms it may be a tall order but when there is an intention to prosecute it must surely be known why a prosecution is being brought whether it is a civil matter or a normal law matter or a terrorist matter <e> <s> i accept that there may be borderline cases <e>", "<cs> my lords following the affairs of scotland i should like to say a few words about northern ireland to which i think my noble friend lord belstead is no stranger <e> <s> i had the opportunity to spend two weeks in ulster earlier this autumn and i should like to mention one or two

say that those i met came from both main communities <e> <s> i was able to visit lagan college in belfast which has been mentioned in your lordships house earlier this year <e> <s> this may not be the first protestant and catholic school in northern ireland but it is probably the first to be established by the deliberate wish and intention of the parents concerned <e> <s> religious education in

learned lord <e> <s> these things constitute our hope <e> <s> that is why we must all persevere in efforts towards peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is general agreement that the one problem that most impedes progress in northern ireland is the continuance of murder and wounding <e> <s> it is not enough to condemn violence as many people have over a long period of time <e> <s> it is not enough to behave in a constructive and non-violent way while murder still inspires fear and fear blocks progress <e> <s> what is needed is information <e> <s> i briefly mentioned this in our debate last week <e>", "<cs> i have spent a certain amount of time both in england and france with mentally handicapped people of various ages <e> <s> i therefore think that the wording of this

the rather alarming speculative view of the noble lord lord bishopston on the combination of high technology and rural squalor will not be borne out in practice <e>", "<cs> if it were helpful i could provide evidence given a certain amount of notice of both large commercial companies whose names are very well known to the public and of government departments who regularly take days and sometimes a little more to settle their accounts <e> <s> on those grounds i should like to support the amendment and i very much hope that the government will take it very seriously and give it their full consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord stanley replies may i say that i feel that this subject is one which needs the very greatest possible care <e> <s> i say that as being associated with the ownership of a labyrinth of underground caves not very far away from a large metropolitan area <e> <s> i hope that if the law is to be changed we shall make the greatest effort to get it absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to elderly owner-occupiers can the noble lord say whether his department is studying the very important experiments carried out recently in rhondda and tyneside and elsewhere by voluntary bodies and would he agree that the level of bureaucratic complexity combined with personal poverty means that many elderly owner-occupiers are not getting the help they need with repairs insulation and improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister do his best to ensure that on the lines of the report published this week by the national council for voluntary organisations as many as possible of these empty houses particularly those that have been empty a long time are used for purposes of community care for the sort of people who used to have to be cared for in institutions <e>", "<cs> it is relevant to mention in connection with the amendment the experience of the alternative probation project which has been running for five years or more at farnham in hampshire <e> <s> it was conceived originally as a new way of doing probation but in the process it was discovered that most of the young offenders coming into it had either missed school or failed to benefit from school <e> <s> therefore they built into the whole project an educational component <e> <s> that is why i support the noble baroness lady faithfull in all she said about keeping children in education and not doing custodial sentences of one kind and another <e> <s> i hope the government will take the matter very seriously <e>", "<cs> i

order which will provide for medical treatment for such purposes as detoxification and if possible the prevention of future alcohol drug or glue abuse <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments on this amendment and the previous one they establish beyond any doubt the principle that there should be a review at fairly frequent intervals by a body composed of people other than statutory social workers <e> <s> i hope that the government will pay great attention to the point made previously by the noble baroness lady birk comparing a situation with that which will exist or already exists with the mental health tribunals <e> <s> it is wrong that juveniles should be in a worse position than psychiatric patients <e>", "<cs> my lords since the act of union of and

counties but i suggest that for various different reasons each of those is a potential recipe for disaster <e> <s> we are faced as the minister said in his introduction with loyalties identities and aspirations which are often incompatible <e> <s> strong national and religious feelings sometimes make compromise almost impossible to attain <e> <s> it has been rightly said that the situation demands both political and theological techniques for any improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble earl for just missing his two opening sentences the previous order went through rather more quickly than i expected <e> <s> i think that all of us who fairly regularly attend these twice-yearly debates are extremely grateful i am sure that i speak for many that there will be independent reviews of both the emergency provisions act and the prevention of terrorism act <e> <s> in addition it is good to know that the emergency provisions act review will be as wide-ranging as that carried out by the noble and learned lord lord gardiner in <e> <s> in the meantime i should like to urge the government to keep going with minor improvements to the system while the reviews take place <e> <s> i say that because it is well known that the whole process of administration of justice in northern ireland beginning with the investigation of a given crime right through to the release of a convicted prisoner has an immediate impact on community relations and on political confidence <e> <s> nowhere is this more true than in the so-called hard-line areas <e>", "<cs> i thought that it

housing to be available for instance to homeless families in grave housing need many of whom in the past have not been on the waiting lists of local authorities <e> <s> are they also aware that if this pool is diminished by compulsory sales there will be very many fewer vacancies in future for the particular type of family and person in the greatest need <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he accepts that prison rule obliges the government to pay special attention to the interests both of the prisoner and of his family <e> <s> would he agree that transfers would reduce the risk of family and marriage breakdown <e> <s> finally do the government still stand by the declaration of the home secretary that each request for a transfer will be considered on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords the review conducted by the noble earl lord jellicoe was published only six weeks ago <e> <s> we have had less than one weeks full notice of the debate on that review and i feel that we have been rushing into it somewhat <e> <s> i express the hope that the usual channels on all sides of the house will take notice of this <e> <s> one of the amazing and encouraging things about your lordships house is that there seems to be almost always someone or other who knows precisely where the shoe pinches <e> <s> it is for that reason that i was particularly glad to hear what the noble earl lord longford had to say earlier <e> <s> i would invite the noble lord lord blease if he is willing to tell us when he speaks of some of the problems which have occured of perfectly innocent trade unionists crossing the irish channel in both directions and being detained and arrested simply because they happen to have an irish name or an irish accent <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the superior knowledge and experience of the noble lord but i should still like to obtain a judicial flavour in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do my best <e> <s> this act so far as i can understand is a dead letter <e> <s> nobody attempts to enforce it <e> <s> it is really something quite obsolete regardless of claims or anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords we have seen in the past separate government departments merged into one as for instance in the case of the department of the environment from which i may say later the department of transport was extricated and became <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how much i agree with the noble earl who has just sat down concerning his points on retrospection and the law on charities <e> <s> if i may i shall return to those points later <e> <s> however as so little has been said today about the case of london i should like to give some figures from greater london which i believe illustrate that the timing of this bill is quite inappropriate <e> <s> new local authority starts in greater london have decreased for every single year since <e> <s> by they were running at one-tenth of the rate achieved in and <e> <s> if that was not bad enough news local authority lettings were in but fell to in <e> <s> it is estimated that for the current year lettings will reach a figure of only <e> <s> this last figure may be only just sufficient to cater for the number of households which are totally homeless of which there were no fewer than in <e> <s> so the total availability of local authority lettings is likely to be taken up solely with the demands of homeless families and households <e>", "<cs> my lords i am willing to accept the correction of the noble lord the minister but i put it to him that these two things could be the opposite sides of the same coin <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord like to give way so that he can perhaps have a chance to get his breath back for his own peroration <e> <s> may i just ask him whether he will be very kind and write to me about turnover particularly in housing stress areas especially in villages and also about my point on the non-replaceability of certain houses which may be sold <e>", "<cs> i had some initial sympathy with this amendment on the ground of non-discrimination but i hope the minister will not be tempted to accept it for that reason <e> <s> i should like to support very strongly what my noble friend lord ingleby has just been saying <e> <s> for many years we have had a shortage and it still goes on of even ground floor local authority flats <e> <s> in addition to that there is a shortage of adapted ones and of purpose-built ones <e> <s> therefore i feel that this amendment is premature and ought to be resisted <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister and the committee may recall that in i thought that the size of the discounts being offered was too large <e> <s> in those days i sat on the government benches <e> <s> today i sit on other benches <e> <s> i think so even more strongly today <e> <s> this is a kind of give-away of public assets <e> <s> what is more it is not even a fair or an equal or a proportional give-away <e> <s> it is what i would describe as a lottery <e> <s> let me take the position of somebody who has been the tenant of a private landlord or even an owner-occupier who at some point along the line becomes the tenant of a local authority <e> <s> all his time as a private tenant does not count or all his time as an owner-occupier does not count for the purposes of discount <e> <s> this is pure speculation favouring those who have been the longest tenants of local authorities or even housing associations <e> <s> to have this from a government which proclaim their faith in victorian values seems to me to be absolutely astounding <e> <s> i hope the committtee will resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very happy when both the proposer and the seconder of the humble address mentioned northern ireland in their speeches <e> <s> it is a pleasure to see the noble baroness lady airey of abingdon in her place today <e> <s> the noble duke the duke of norfolk said that he thought injustice and discrimination against the catholic minority in northern ireland had been ended <e> <s> i fear he may have been just a little too sweeping in his remarks <e> <s> of course much has been done to improve the situation since but the reports of the fair employment agency the record of some local authorities and the uneven impact of unemployment on the two sections of the community show that there is still a great deal to be done <e> <s> i trust that the government will not forget that <e> <s> perhaps i may now take the opportunity i think i speak for all of giving our very best wishes to the noble earl lord mansfield as he takes up his new responsibilities in the northern ireland office <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that concern and interest in these prisoners and their families is just as strong in this parliament as it was in the last <e> <s> may i ask whether the government would consider changing the onus of proof that now rests very heavily on the prisoner so that in future transfers would be granted from britain to northern ireland unless the authorities could make an overwhelming case against a particular individual <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that i do not expect an instant answer today but if he would consult with his right honourable friends i would be more than satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i speak for all on the cross-benches when i say how much i welcome the resumption of talks between the heads of government in london and dublin <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount whether the government will study carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a weary list of interests to declare <e> <s> my family and i own tenanted farms in somerset and surrey and further i am a trustee of a charitable trust owning other let farms in other counties <e> <s> i am a farmer and a chartered surveyor qualified but not practising and a member both of the cla and the nfu <e> <s> but i hasten to add that neither of these bodies consulted me for a moment during the preparation of the famous package <e> <s> i agree very much with the remarks made by the noble earl lord caithness both about the consultation and the process of preparation of this bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl who moved the amendment makes up his mind what to do with it may i ask whether he will consider writing into his amendment perhaps at some future stage a provision that the tenancy must endure for shall we say <e> <s> years or years so that the period of security would be quite long but not indefinite and not totally uncertain as the law has been standing recently <e>", "<cs> i hope that local authorities will not be pressurised by short-term financial considerations into selling off their smallholdings willy-nilly <e> <s> i hope also that before they sell off any they will take into consideration the importance that there may be particularly in remote places in part-time holdings <e> <s> i hope that they will not assume that every single smallholding <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how very much i agee with the noble lord lord fitt about all these vast empty benches particularly if i may say so on the government side <e> <s> perhaps the government whips could do something to bring this to the attention of their supporters and perhaps the government themselves could do something to help by trying to arrange for us to have northern ireland business earlier in the day at more popular hours <e> <s> then the noble lord lord fitt perhaps i may call him my noble friend will i am sure have great success in persuading many members of both houses to come to the annual and sometimes more frequent gatherings of the british-irish association <e> <s> these are very valuable occasions which bring together not only politicians from both sides of the channel and from ireland north and south but also academics and people involved in the media in a very free and informal way and with the benefit of chatham house rules <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point i wonder if he has taken on board the importance of <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to agree with the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> the analogy was drawn between commercial and industrial properties and let farms <e> <s> it might perhaps apply in the case of institutional landlords <e> <s> i am quite sure that it does not apply in the case of individual private landlords and particularly resident ones where the relationship between the landlord and the tenant is of an extremely personal nature <e> <s> such people would resist to the last the introduction of total strangers <e> <s> i do hope that the amendment will be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i want to support the principle of this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first of all i know from personal experience that the demand for allotments fluctuates up and down in the most remarkable way <e> <s> secondly where there are occupied allotments next to unoccupied ones there immediately arise problems with weeds <e> <s> anything that can be done to control that and make possible interim cultivation is very desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness although not particularly encouraged by that reply <e> <s> will she accept that some million a year needs to be spent on these homes to bring them up to acceptable modern standards <e> <s> will the government consider matching pound for pound whatever money the voluntary bodies can raise for themselves and in the longer run devise a system comparable to that which exists now for help through the housing corporation for sheltered housing and caring hostels <e>", "<cs> my lords this is very much the kind of housing bill with which we have become all too familiar in and in the last year <e> <s> it comes from a government which in one year greatly increased the tax relief on mortgage interest and at the same time proposed to reduce housing benefits <e> <s> they have thus shown they favour the richer people at the expense of poorer people as they did once before in <e>", "<cs> my lords even after three statements i think that we can all agree with the noble lord lord mishcon when he says that terrorism is one of the greatest scourges of the modern era <e> <s> contrary to what is sometimes said i suggest that it is seldom completely mindless or unthinking and is usually very coldly calculated <e> <s> it is dangerous in particular because it inspires fear and panic and induces irrational behaviour even sometimes in governments <e> <s> i think we have a duty to take measured and considered steps against terrorism <e> <s> our aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount the leader of the house for his reply <e> <s> would he accept that this suggestion is not an original one but <e>", "<cs> my lords in his second reply the noble viscount mentioned collective responsibility <e>", "<cs> i believe we should be extremely discriminating in this matter of exclusion orders <e> <s> i have some evidence which tends to show that the royal ulster constabulary would perhaps be satisfied with a system of exclusion orders that operated only to exclude people who have already left their jurisdiction <e> <s> it would therefore prevent people from returning and not expel them from where they are currently living <e>", "<cs> a concrete example perhaps of those with whom my noble friend is concerned might be say a basque terrorist and whether he can be kept out given the privileges of citizens of the ec <e>", "<cs> your lordships will no doubt have seen the letter which appeared in <e>", "<cs> reference was made at second reading to the circular to be issued to police forces and <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the standing commission on human rights in northern ireland is concerned about people travelling to and from the two countries on perfectly lawful occasions on lawful business <e> <s> i did mention this at second reading <e> <s> i would like to support this amendment because i believe it would give much greater certainty to the law <e> <s> it would also i suggest make much more difficult the so-called fishing expeditiions for information where there is no reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed <e>", "<cs> as i asked at second reading whether there could be either a standing or a select committee to review these acts i should like very strongly to support the amendments of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> i am sure that his amendment no <e> <s> is important in order to give a chance for a properly informed debate on the renewal of the act <e> <s> as to the proposal in his amendment no <e> <s> i agree that it would be far superior either to a select or a standing committee or to the formula put forward by the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> i should like to support strongly what he said about the privy counsellors oath and the possibility of giving privy counsellors confidential information that cannot be released to other people <e> <s> having said that i should like to express the strongest possible hope that the government will be able to accept this amendment and that if they cannot it will be pressed at a later stage <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i throw in the suggestion that my noble friends commission should be given in its terms of reference a further duty to report on the northern ireland emergency provisions act <e> <s> there is such an interlocking and interrelationship between this bill and the act that it could perform a valuable function by covering both <e>", "<cs> i should like to submit that this is a very much more important matter than one of mere statistics <e> <s> on second reading we saw how the same statistics could be quoted as meaning two completely different things <e> <s> tonight we are asking for a review by people who can receive confidential information and who therefore then come to a view as to whether or not it is still necessary and essential to continue the act either in whole or in part <e>", "<cs> the bill that we are considering tonight comes from a government and their predecessors who have very serverely cut the local authority capital housing programme despite enormous backlogs of repairs and despite system-built housing collapsing all over the place <e> <s> as if that were not bad enough they have cut the housing association capital programme despite endless evidence to show what a good job that is doing in particular in inner city areas and housing action areas <e> <s> now this year the government propose to reduce housing benefit to people who are eligible just at the same time as they increase the upper limit for mortgage interest relief <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can commend to the minister working paper no <e> <s> from the school of advanced urban studies at the university of bristol <e> <s> it seems that this study confirms what a number of us foresaw and indeed mentioned in that the houses that would be sold would be semi-detached houses and end terrace houses the best of the bunch <e> <s> the houses would sell far more than flats <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his very helpful reply <e> <s> does he agree that innovation is one of the main justifications for voluntary bodies <e> <s> does he accept that today homelessness and sub-standard housing are two of the most acute problems that we face <e> <s> is it not true therefore that voluntary innovations in adapting unlettable properties and in making use of short-life housing urgently need to be copied in the public sector <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister and the committee know that i have very considerable reservations of principle both about the act and about this bill <e> <s> i shall mention only one reservation <e> <s> the act took away from local authorities and non-charitable housing associations all discretion whatsoever over the right to buy <e> <s> the government now propose to take away all discretion from charitable associations <e> <s> however that is not the main point i want to make tonight <e> <s> instead i wish to look at the detail of the amendment <e> <s> my concern is that it is going to place a considerable administrative burden and extra costs upon the charitable associations which may i fear divert them from their main purposes <e> <s> the larger associations employ paid staff <e> <s> they are very capable and qualified people but on the whole they are under extreme pressure and already are very highly stretched <e> <s> the smaller associations on the other hand rely to some extent and some of them to a great extent on voluntary staff <e> <s> they will have to face even greater problems <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord campbell replies i should like to put a point to him <e> <s> clause states that <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the financial implications of any new severn crossing will the government take into account possible grants and cheap loans from the eec <e>", "<cs> it referred my lords to possible cheap loans and grants from the european economic community <e>", "<cs> my lords like the majority of your lordships i hesitate very much before crossing swords with the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> however it seems to me that we can either rely on the patriotism and civic sense of people at large or we cannot <e> <s> if we cannot rely on that sense this clause will not make them come forward with the evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported this amendment at the committee stage and i want to do so again this evening <e> <s> i do so mainly for two reasons <e> <s> the operation of this legislation and its continuance or otherwise has a considerable impact on community relations in not only northern ireland but also britain <e> <s> for that reason we need to have a properly informed parliamentary review of it annually and the amendment is a most important proposal for getting that informed review <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the opportunity to ask the minister whether he could respond in some way to the letter sent to him by the standing advisory commission on human rights dated th february <e> <s> the letter dealt with port powers which is not precisely the subject of the amendment but i think it is analogous <e> <s> i wonder if he could be helpful on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i start tonight from two basic principles that concern government expenditure in northern ireland <e> <s> first there is no way by which politically-motivated violence can be overcome solely by security or police measures <e> <s> her majestys government recognise this but unfortunately not all the local political parties do so <e> <s> one can only hope that they will study the history of the s the s and the period since <e> <s> they may then see that violence <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would be kind enough to give way i did not mention dual sovereignty or double sovereignty <e> <s> i spoke very carefully of a joint or dual guarantee and i think there is a difference <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government think that weekend imprisonment might be a suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say in support of the noble baroness that i received my copy of the list of groupings after the start of questions this afternoon <e> <s> i am very grateful for it but it seems to me to be leaving matters a little late <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> everything that i heard convinces me that the government are in pursuit of a mirage <e> <s> they are inviting the house and the public to follow alice through the looking glass into some amazing kind of wonderland beyond <e> <s> i suggest that this kind of pursuit of the unattainable is diverting attention from the real housing needs of today <e> <s> i regret that we have come to this pass <e> <s> i wish that the government would concentrate their minds on the real problems of homelessness bad housing and all the rest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to explain why my name is attached to this amendment and why i support the noble baroness in this matter <e> <s> i had numerous doubts and disagreements with the economic and social policy of the first thatcher government but it was the housing act that precipitated my departure from the tory benches after sitting on those benches for some years and after i might add voting tory in just about every parliamentary election between and <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of the noble lord lord sandford perhaps i may draw the attention of the house to the views of the association of district councils which is concerned that sub-paragraph iii of the amendment passed by this house has more or less been removed from the amendment as it has emerged from another place <e> <s> sub-paragraph iii dealt with the removal or relocation of internal walls in conjunction with the relocation of a bathroom fixed bath or shower or water closet <e> <s> the effect of that removal seems to be that many dwellings with internal but nevertheless substantial adaptations for the disabled would still risk being lost to local authorities for future use by disabled people <e> <s> this seems to be a pity <e> <s> i do not know whether anything can still be done to correct that situation if so it would be most helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords since a very large section of this house has been actively concerned about this matter <e> <s> the reason for this concern is that in there was an acute shortage of bungalows and flats suitable for old people <e> <s> there still is the same acute shortage <e> <s> if anything it is getting worse because of the restrictions and cuts that have been imposed on the housing association programme and on local authority building <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i should like to ask the government whether the famous safeguard extracted from the government by the noble lord lord sandford in has not proved to be something of an illusion <e> <s> so very few rural areas have been defined less than one-quarter of those asked for <e> <s> are the government really saying that there are no rural areas outside about six or seven counties in england and none in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords in the kind of revision that the noble baroness has asked for would the government take into account the higher than average levels of house prices <e> <s> secondly will they also bear in mind the difficulty of replacing council houses in villages once they have been sold for all sorts of good reasons <e>", "<cs> thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to read tomorrow what i have said on that very point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very kind in giving way <e> <s> i just wanted to catch him in some way or other before he sat down <e> <s> it was simply to ask him <e>", "<cs> my lords we are debating this order at a time when yorkshire and certain other midland counties in england have been suffering from very severe public disorder <e> <s> i am sure that all members of your lordships house are concerned about these particular disorders and it is my very strong desire that every member of your lordships house should also be concerned about the troubles and disorders of northern ireland <e> <s> i say that if only because it is so essential that a democratic society should defend itself by democratic means <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i have west indian friends in england and i believe that they look on it as a very important amendment <e> <s> my knowledge of northern ireland makes me particularly sensitive to measures that will help to build confidence in the police force <e> <s> the amendment is also widely supported both in parliament and outside in particular by the national association of community relations councils <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords has been a remarkable year for anglo-irish relations <e> <s> as i believe the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs mentioned we had mr haagerups report on northern ireland to the european parliament <e> <s> since then there has been the forum which brought together the four constitutional irish nationalist parties <e> <s> we have had discussion papers from all the unionist parties and from the <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain degree of predictability about our remarks on these occasions and i should like to apologise in advance if by any <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord is still on that point can he say when the government hope to begin this process of de-scheduling <e>", "<cs> my lords in previous years in common with other noble lords i have expressed concern about the impact of this act on community relations <e> <s> i hoped that this would have been a matter to which sir cyril philips gave some attention <e> <s> i hoped that he would consult not only organisations connected with community relations in northern ireland and the irish associations in england but also organisations connected with refugees and with commonwealth citizens <e> <s> it is not clear from his introductory letter or from paragraph of his report that he has extended his consultations beyond what he calls officials and the police <e> <s> however that is not the main issue that i wish to examine <e>", "<cs> my lords after various criticisms that i have made in the past i think i should congratulate the noble lord on the front bench and his noble friend the chief whip for arranging to take this debate on a major northern ireland order during prime parliamentary time <e> <s> i know that the television cameras are not switched on today but at least we can hope that the members of the parliamentary press gallery have not yet gone home for tea <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is relevant to the original question to ask why is it that british oil for domestic consumption is priced in dollars when british gas coal and other british fuels are priced in sterling <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly in this important debate to draw attention to something happening in northern ireland that may well be more significant than supergrasses and more lasting in its effects <e> <s> i think that it is relevant to this debate because it concerns the ultimate triumph of justice and peace in both the united kingdom and ireland <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness lady fisher by giving this example from bristol and bath which are an almost continuous conurbation with very short gaps in between on the north bank of the river avon <e> <s> i well recall the very serious difficulty that my late father had when he was chairman of the somerset county council planning committee in getting the various then fragmented authorities ever to work together <e> <s> it so happens that the new county of avon is an ordinary county and not a metropolitan county and therefore the planning situation will continue to be as it was in but in a rather better state <e> <s> i hope that on those grounds at least the government will have second thoughts on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the european court of human rights has already achieved considerable improvements in the conditions of life for prisoners in british prisons for example in the field of correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put a question to the noble lord lord glenarthur and i apologise to him for not having given him notice of it and i also apologise to the house if perchance this point has been raised at an earlier stage of our discussions on the bill <e> <s> do the government think that the nuisance and the grievances which this bill seeks to remedy are sufficiently widespread to justify legislation that will be nationwide <e> <s> may it not be very much better to legislate in such a way that a local authority could invoke the bill for either the whole of its area or a particular part of its area if it considers that there is a localised nuisance <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the somewhat thin house i think we should remind ourselves of the importance of this debate sandwiched as it is into the middle of the committee stage of a transport bill <e> <s> we are discussing an arrangement that has obtained for <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was trying to make is that bodies such as the housing executive and the standing advisory commission on human <e>", "<cs> i speak as someone who was not able to attend the second reading debate of this bill and also as someone with no direct experience of bus operation <e> <s> however i live in somerset and i am aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that anybody could possibly assert that the order we are considering today is in any way similar to any other northern irish order which comes before us <e> <s> the two noble lords speaking from the front benches for the opposition have spelt out clearly why the powers given by this legislation are so serious <e> <s> if that were not enough the fact that the act has had to be reviewed twice by two separate distinguished judges underlines this contention <e> <s> i should like to suggest that it is most inappropriate for us to be debating this matter at lunchtime on a friday <e> <s> i have written about this to the noble lord the chief whip and i hope that i shall receive support from the other front benches concerned with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him does he appreciate that we <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give any indication at all as to when this will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister twice referred to housing expenditure <e> <s> can he confirm that the minister of housing obtained only one-third of the amount that he was asking for <e> <s> will the minister put himself in the place of an unemployed person living in a system-built dwelling which is suffering from both damp and condensation <e>", "<cs> my lords after scottish salmon fishing i am very happy indeed to widen the debate still further by referring to affairs in northern ireland <e> <s> in the fog that we have today of rumour speculation and apprehension about the british-irish talks and the search for a positive agreement i should just like to describe two very encouraging developments of which i have personal experience <e> <s> here i follow on from what i said in your lordships house on th july in attempting to give just one or two items of good news <e> <s> i think it is very important that we should discuss northern ireland in a general debate and not give the impression that it is a strange place far away and full of extraordinary people whose affairs can be discussed only by specialists and experts <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak today as an eyewitness <e> <s> this morning i flew back from ireland in order to take part in this debate and on saturday i was present at the demonstration in belfast <e> <s> i stood there in donegall square in front of the city hall and i listened to the speeches as best i could there were some difficulties with loudspeakers and so on <e> <s> it was a very large and very orderly demonstration <e> <s> i think one must also say that it was a very negative demonstration and a slightly tribal one <e> <s> nevertheless it showed clearly the shock and the trauma from which many sections of northern ireland opinion were and still are suffering <e> <s> it showed the strength of the fears and suspicions <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us encouragement that the government will at least consider a slight delay in full implementation of the agreement so that we may have a thorough and effective period of consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise as a layman and very much a beginner in these complex matters <e> <s> i shall try to be brief and i hope non-controversial <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord broxbourne for introducing this bill tonight <e> <s> experience has i think shown that the european convention on human rights provides better safeguards and remedies than some of the traditional british procedures in which we used to take justifiable pride <e> <s> this is i think not surprising when we consider that we helped to draft the convention and were i believe the first country to ratify it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that nearly all the points i wish to make have been made by previous speakers but i will just say how much i agree with the noble earl lord cork and orrery about the vital importance of consent about which this bill says nothing <e> <s> it does not even say anything about a request from the person who is to be assisted out of life <e> <s> i found myself carried along persuaded and in agreement with the noble and learned lord lord denning both on the legalities the present ones and the probable future ones of the situation and on the crucial importance of the european convention on human rights which we were discussing only last night <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord dunleath and congratulate him on introducing and explaining this bill tonight <e> <s> my noble friend i would say has a very enviable record when it comes to legislation <e> <s> seven or eight years ago he piloted through the house a measure to do with schools which has made it possible for shared integrated christian schools to be accepted into the system of public education in northern ireland <e> <s> that is of very great benefit in my view in enabling children to grow up

personal thanks to the noble lord the chief whip and to the other usual channels for arranging to have this order debated during the afternoon of a normal working day <e> <s> in expressing those thanks i think it is right for me to re-emphasise why this is such an important order <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i

northern ireland voice in the conference of ministers <e> <s> i do not think i would go so far as my noble friend lord dunleath when he talked about putting the agreement on ice for a period but i should like to underline the importance of what the noble viscount lord brookeborough was saying about the symbolic importance of the maryfield office <e>", "<cs> i hope that this amendment will not be accepted <e> <s> at second reading i mentioned the special case of northern ireland from which have come incidentally many of the appeals which have eventually gone to the european court <e> <s>

that i am happy to say enables me to shorten my remarks quite a lot <e>", "<cs> i would be grateful if the noble lord the minister would consider the following case and i apologise for not having given him warning of it <e>", "<cs> i should just like to raise a small point <e> <s> in both clauses and an exception is made which says that no offence is committed where the acts take place within a dwelling <e> <s> i should like to ask what is the reasoning behind that exception and why it says inside a dwelling and not inside a building <e> <s> it seems to me that the situation may be rather worse where the behaviour takes place inside a private house or flat as compared with some other kind of building <e>", "<cs> is the minister able to tell the committee the maximum penalty that can be imposed on a person who throws a petrol bomb into a building either destroying it or severely damaging it without necessarily injuring any person inside the building <e> <s> i ask that because it has

campbell of alloway does the committee a service by suggesting that all the refugees of the world are going to come to this country <e> <s> past records and statistics show clearly that a very small minority of refugees have done so <e> <s> it is also relevant to the amendment that the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture is one of the numerous organisations that are highly concerned about the bill <e>", "<cs> is it not the case that there is some degree or there was thought to be some degree of emergency because several hundred people managed to reach these shores from

building can be worked out <e>", "<cs> as a mere layman who has listened to this debate i should like to draw attention to the distance factor <e> <s> if a british citizen is extradited to the north of france or belgium he is not put at enormous risk but if he is taken away to turkey or israel and is acquitted who will pay for bringing him back to england where he belongs <e> <s> i should be

noble baroness for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> i hope very strongly that the committee will accept it because if it is accepted it will concentrate the mind of the government on reducing the prison population to manageable proportions <e>", "<cs> having spoken earlier today and having urged that we need to make a serious effort to reduce our total prison population i am bound to support this amendment <e> <s> it is true to say that our sentences in this country are on average longer than those in most of western europe <e> <s> therefore this is a small step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> the noble earl when replying to the last amendment mentioned the seriousness of <e>", "<cs> some of the noble earls remarks could be considered to be sympathetic on this matter but the upshot is disappointing <e> <s> i was particularly surprised and disappointed that he did not mention anything about greater use of the bail act and much more widespread large-scale use of bail hostels bearing in mind that they do not necessarily have to be owned and operated by the government but can also be put into action by voluntary bodies <e> <s> i invite him now to say something about both points <e>", "<cs> we should certainly consider the victims <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the schemes devised by nacro and other bodies for victim support <e> <s> however there is

"<cs> i too welcome what has been done particularly in the direction of partially suspended sentences greater eligibility of parole and increased remission for sentences up to months <e> <s> the minister mentioned all those points in his intervention <e> <s> i strongly welcome this amendment which provides for custodial sentences and for supervision in the community <e> <s> i believe it to be of such importance that it would be a pity if it was not more fully discussed today and i hope that we may have further opportunities to do so in the course of the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down will he say in plain terms what is wrong with the system proposed in the amendment <e> <s> is it cost i wonder <e> <s> if so will the noble earl tell us <e>", "<cs> speaking as a complete layman in these matters it seems to me that this very welcome new clause proposes to legislate by reference to two previous statutes <e> <s> the numbering is extremely complex <e> <s> it goes back and forth and it is very difficult to follow for a person who is not legally trained <e> <s> all that suggests to me that it is a prime candidate for consolidation <e> <s> will the minister ensure that he gets the highest possible priority for that <e>", "<cs> i am advised by my noble friend lord henderson whose name is also on the amendment that sentences under this clause can go up to detention at the pleasure of the secretary of state <e> <s> i have to plead total ignorance as to the arrangements for that type of punishment in england but i have had some experience of how they work in northern ireland where there have been a number of juvenile terrorist-type offences and sentences <e> <s> there i am glad to say we have reached a point where nobody has been detained for more than six years without having his sentence properly reviewed by in that case the life sentence review board <e> <s> this is tremendously important because we know that long indeterminate sentences generate a feeling of total hopelessness and despair in those suffering them <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl whether the review arrangements in england and wales are at least comparable and possibly better than the arrangements in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for his reply <e> <s> is it not the case that at the moment we are totally in the dark <e> <s> is it not true that recently the government have refused to publish either a green paper

be in place by one year before the tunnel comes into operation <e> <s> may we not therefore hope that both passport and customs control will have been abolished between england and france <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to follow a suggestion indicated by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> a number of police officers both in britain and northern ireland have been prosecuted either for murder or for manslaughter and have nearly all been acquitted <e> <s> will the government consider creating a lesser charge which could be available for example using excessive or inappropriate force in a given circumstance <e> <s> i understand that there is a precedent in australian law <e> <s> i do not expect a full reply now but if the government could consider that matter it would be very helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords every single amendment we have dealt with today seems to have underlined the value of your lordships house as a revising chamber <e> <s> this one is no exception <e> <s> i hope that the government will be able to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is beyond doubt that there have been abuses in the past <e> <s> nevertheless the act went a long way to correct them and i therefore regret that the government seem to have used a sledgehammer to crack one or two rather small nuts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned voids in local authority properties <e> <s> can he say what the government are doing to encourage and ensure better standards of housing management and a quicker filling of voids <e> <s> perhaps i may turn to the single homeless situation <e> <s> has the noble lord become aware that single homeless people are now taking refuge at night in british rail railway carriages beyond victoria having been moved on from the arches below charing cross <e> <s> what hope of improvement can he offer us in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords before considering the details of the order before the house tonight in the light of two acts and about four reports i should like to mention some general points <e> <s> i do so with some trepidation in the presence of one and sometimes two former secretaries of state <e> <s> the whole house and both parliaments will wish to congratulate the security services of our two countries on the massive amounts of arms and explosives discovered in both the north and south of ireland in recent weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to give also the figures of outflow from this country having made such a big point about the inflow <e>", "<cs> my lords as the only other speaker from the cross-benches in the debate i hope that i may be permitted to say how much we appreciated the speech of the noble lord lord jakobovits not least for what he said on the subject of refugees in palestine <e> <s> he also mentioned the importance of accommodating opposing rights <e> <s> i feel that that gives great light to the present situation for instance in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend and i are both grateful to the minister for his care in explaining tonights order <e> <s> i shall start by glancing briefly backwards to the appropriation order debate which took place in your lordships house on th july <e>", "<cs> the noble lord stands at the dispatch box producing new difficulties out of his <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to speak for the noble lord lord mishcon but i thought that he made it transparently clear that he took on that point in the first place and that he was referring to the children of parents who are already legally settled in britain <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies will he note that the children about whom we are speaking will already be aged approximately <e> <s> i believe that they had to be born before a certain date in <e> <s> therefore we are talking about a very small limited category of children <e>", "<cs> i do not deny that <e>", "<cs> at second reading i suggested to the government a basis on which they could discriminate fairly against polygamous wives if that is what they want to do <e> <s> i suggested that they should make it impossible for new wives to enter this country that is wives who have not been married previously to the person in question <e> <s> however the second or third existing marriages of people already here could be admitted as they might well be entitled to under koranic law <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> as i said at second reading the passing of the immigration carriers liability act last year followed rather swiftly by this bill has given rise to suspicions that the government are not adhering to their traditional policy with regard to asylum seekers <e> <s> therefore i was extremely glad that the noble earl lord ferrers said in winding up at second reading that <e>", "<cs> i assume that the compassionate grounds and special circumstances referred to could include family reunions about which many members of the committee are concerned and about which the <e>", "<cs> with respect to the chair should we not have clause stand part first <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for my earlier procedural oversight <e> <s> perhaps i may now ask a question for clarification <e> <s> i apologise to the noble earl for not giving him much notice <e> <s> if he prefers to reply in writing that will be perfectly acceptable to me <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord reflects on that question perhaps he will also consider a further proposition <e> <s> if we are willing to have an able-bodied man in this country surely we should not also be willing to deprive him of his next of kin <e>", "<cs> my lords before this bill leaves the house i should like to say a few words about genuine refugees who reach this country

requirements and the immigration carriers liability act <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl rises again to finish his speech perhaps i may urge him to remember that this country had a policy of asylum long long perhaps centuries before it had any policy on immigration and that those two things are very different <e>", "<cs> as the president of a very small housing association in england which is highly registered and supervised by the housing corporation i should like to support very strongly the amendment of the noble lord lord morton <e>", "<cs> i hope that if the minister is not already in the picture he will inform himself about the arrangements that have been worked out in england and wales stemming from the housing corporation <e> <s> year after year it was consistently provided with finance for community care projects <e> <s> in this country these are usually done through housing associations <e> <s> the property is built to a specification for the client group <e>

per cent <e> <s> of the budget of the housing corporation in scotland has been spent on those areas <e> <s> that fact rather underlines the thrust of the noble viscounts amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to put down a marker which is that these two amendments are likely to have very considerable significance for england and wales <e> <s> at the present time i understand that discussions and negotiations are going on to work out a form of secure housing association tenancy for england and wales <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord on the government benches who has just sat down i think am right in saying that succession rights apply only lo the tenants of private landlords and not to those of housing associations <e> <s> it has of course been a practice of most housing associations to give another tenancy to a close relative living with a tenant at the time of his death <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i am somewhat encouraged by reading clause <e> <s> it makes me think that perhaps the government have begun to learn something from the experience in england <e> <s> they were warned time after time during the course of the housing act in england that there would be serious problems in english rural areas <e> <s> those warnings were borne out in practice <e> <s> i imagine that exactly the same situation applies in scotland <e>", "<cs> once again i should like to thank the government for clause <e> <s> it shows that the very long debates we had in your lordships house in and i think on one or two subsequent pieces of legislation have sunk in <e> <s> we now have a clear exception for sheltered housing and special provision even for houses bungalows and so on specially designed for persons of pensionable age and for disabled people <e> <s> i hope that this will prove a good precedent an omen for the english legislation that has yet to reach us <e>", "<cs> in his reply the minister drew our attention to certain safeguards which he says will be built in when houses are transferred <e> <s> however i wonder whether these are likely to be sufficient <e> <s> there have been cases of housing associations getting into difficulties and having to be bailed out by the housing corporation or merged with other associations or taken over <e> <s> we have also had experience of building society fraud and it would not surprise me at all to learn that one or two tenants co-operative associations had found themselves in financial difficulty <e>", "<cs> i have looked carefully at the bill thinking that i might find somewhere in it a reference to housing action trusts in scotland <e> <s> these are proposed in the bill for england still in another place <e> <s> it is known that in england there is a vast backlog both of repairs and improvements

state of repair required <e> <s> does repair include improvement <e> <s> if so it would make a difference <e> <s> i am encouraged to ask the question because the noble earl lord dundee used the word

electricity consumers in the south-west of england are concerned about impending price increases which they think rightly or wrongly are being made in preparation for the construction of the hinkley point nuclear reactor which they do not want at all <e>", "<cs> i thought that the conservative party was in favour of openness in government rather like certain leading elements in the russian

the trustees and the other parties involved <e> <s> nevertheless when he began to expound at some length on the situation at the cardinal vaughan school i could not help thinking that it was something of a red herring because surely that arose over a matter of the reorganisation of a whole pattern of schools especially of their methods of dealing with sixth-form education whereas on these amendments that i have proposed we are dealing with opting for a change of status which to my mind is a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this whole group of amendments is of considerable importance <e> <s> however i should like to say something concerning amendment no <e> <s> which deals with people living under threat of violence <e> <s> that might be thought to be

london and the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to underline the very important point which the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords there are cogent arguments to he made in favour of the new clause <e> <s> if it comes into effect and succeeds in reducing homelessness and the use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation that will be a step forward <e>

to remember co-operating with the noble lord lord stanley on some previous act <e> <s> i do not remember now whether it was the rent agriculture act or the rent act <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord has raised an important point <e> <s> the present system allows for some orderly coping with the fluctuating demand for labour on particular farms <e> <s> that demand may fluctuate rather more in the future because of changes in systems and because we are for some commodities in a state of overproduction and surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may commend to him the old proverbial saying you cant get a quart out of a pint pot <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment as strongly as i can <e> <s> the noble earl will be aware that i speak

amendment but also on the future level of rents for new tenants <e> <s> that is bad enough <e> <s> but as the national federation of housing associations has already pointed out it will cause a real problem to charitable housing associations which are a large proportion of the total <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one technical point i wish to raise as regards amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it says in the first line with the appropriate approval <e> <s> can the noble earl tell us whether that means the secretary of state possibly the treasury or some other approving body <e> <s> i wish to underline what the noble lord lord mcintosh was saying about double scrutiny <e> <s> we do not want that back <e> <s> i am sure that it is possible to devise streamlined arrangements that will not include it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i have had experience over some years as chairman of the housing associations charitable trust <e> <s> we gave a number of small grants and loans to associations housing elderly asians some of them refugees from uganda <e> <s> we also assisted a body housing elderly white russian emigres some of whom had been in

<e> <s> i should like to ask the government what advice they have received on this point of housing management from whom they received it and how they propose to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> one understands the difficulty experienced by immigrant groups in speaking and understanding normal english but when one gets into the technicalities of housing jargon which speaks of succession rights and so on then i believe they need a crib in their own language <e>", "<cs> my lords i am to say the least surprised by the contents of amendments nos <e> <s> and and by the explanation which the noble lord has given in speaking to them <e> <s> we must envisage the strong possibility of situations arising where properties will have a negative value <e> <s> i say that first because of clause d which provides the obligation to put them into a reasonable state of repair secondly because there may be massive rent arrears which will deter applicants from submitting bids of any size and thirdly because in a number of situations it is likely that one will be faced with only one effective bidder <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that members in all parts of the house are grateful to the minister for explaining the contents of the order <e> <s> i hope that i manage somehow to retain my sense of perspective and proportion <e> <s> i

majestys government and from the government of ireland <e> <s> i mention the republic because its security expenditure per head of population is so much greater than ours <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has given a great exposition of the prison building programme <e> <s> when do the government expect to clear court cells and police cells of people awaiting trial <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness referred several times to continuing research in microbiology <e> <s> will that include research into the incorporation of antibiotics not only into poultry feed but also into the feeding stuffs of other livestock <e> <s> i believe that it is essential for that kind of research to be independent and therefore presumably government-funded <e> <s> it should not be dependent on the vested interests of either chemical and antibiotic producers or farmers <e>", "<cs> i think we are all quite well aware that in the case of a particular child the chronological age and the mental age may differ quite widely <e> <s> i do not know whether that needs to be reflected in rules of court <e>", "<cs> this may be an appropriate moment to raise the question of the status of voluntary welfare bodies <e> <s> if such a body is in contact with a family or a child whose future arrangements are being discussed by a court and also if it employs a qualified person would it be entitled to submit its views to the court and <e>", "<cs> i should just like to finish my sentence would the court then be obliged to take account of those views <e>", "<cs> on first reading the amendment i had assumed that it was a probing amendment <e> <s> i now appreciate that if it should be approved the bill would read consecutively even allowing for the omission <e>", "<cs> for a long time now we have

baroness lady david has made out a very strong case for it <e> <s> she mentioned the possibility when families do not have to make a contribution of their using the money in order to travel to visit their children in care thereby maintaining the family link <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the original question it was announced some months ago that on compassionate grounds some vietnamese people would be admitted into this country for family reunions <e> <s> can the minister say how irar we have got in admitting those people and whether steps can be taken to speed up the reception of the balance of them <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are at report stage and as i have been involved to a small extent in discussions in your lordships house on previous bills and renewals of the previous act i

view then those with a different point of view should also be allowed to have their say <e> <s> will the noble viscount accept that these subjects may only be suitable for education discussion and examination by certain more mature age groups of pupils <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that nearly every new bill that is brought to your lordships house confers great new powers on secretaries of state to regulate our lives <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be appropriate for her majestys government to follow the example of the great powers and turn their defence effort more and more towards non-threatening forms of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords at the same time as raising the question of human rights will the government also take up with the romanians the question of the bulldozing of historic churches in bucharest and the enforced collectivisation of villages in the romanian countryside which also involves the destruction of much of romanias cultural heritage <e>",

developer but also to the occupier <e>", "<cs> if these regional committees are to be open to public listening and public scrutiny of documents can the noble earl say why the same cannot apply to more

about emergency measures <e> <s> i can cast my mind back to the time in the late s and early s when my father and the then lord fortescue were administering a large voluntary fund for the relief of

time out of rivers and flash floods and things of that kind <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble earl whether he would agree that the language used in this amendment is a good deal more precise and taut than that set forth in the bill <e> <s> i should like particularly to underline the fact that on page at line the bill states that the persons to be appointed to the proposed committees are solely those who have an interest in the matters under discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that since this question was put down it has become so acutely topical <e> <s> is the noble earl not appalled that conditions among remand prisoners have led to unconvicted men being driven to suicide <e> <s> is he able to tell the house what steps are being taken with regard to remand cases

radioactive waste and the decommissioning of nuclear power stations <e> <s> the schedule empowers the secretary of state to make loans again in connection with nuclear generation at any rate of interest which he may with the approval of the treasury direct <e> <s> the schedule then goes on to allow him to give guarantees <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord lord stanley is making up his mind what to do with the amendment perhaps i may say that these issues are likely to cause a certain number of farmers to change their whole farming system in a marked and deep-rooted way <e> <s> they will therefore require the maximum length of time in which to prepare for the changes <e> <s> that may be allowed for when the definitive order eventually emerges but i do not know whether that will be the case <e> <s> it would be helpful if the minister could give us reassurance on that point <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether this is the right moment to raise the question of sampling errors <e> <s> if

political settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important amendment and i am glad that it has support from all sides of the house <e> <s> ever since nationalisation of the electricity industry and perhaps even before there has been a convention in practice that a public service principle would be applied to the price of electricity <e> <s> thus although there are small differences between the price applied in one board area and another by and large rural consumers are not discriminated against in favour of urban consumers <e> <s> that is the principle which we all wish to see maintained and which the government have no possible mandate for overthrowing <e>", "<cs> as i understand it when redundancies occur trade unions in most parts of the world certainly in england have generally adopted the principle of first in last out <e> <s> we know that over the last years there have been a sad number of redundancies in northern ireland <e> <s> i should like to know whether that principle has been applied until now and whether in future the irish trade unions operating in northern <e> <s> ireland will abandon it in favour of conducting redundancies in such a way as to balance the composition of the workforce <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to think that my noble friend lord dunleath has a good point about small companies with a very low turnover of labour <e> <s> surely the answer is that the goals and timetables that may be set have to be long-term and cannot be expected to come about quickly or take effect rapidly <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that i differ from the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i know a number of persons who have been convicted of charges involving terrorism <e> <s> some of them are remorseful and regret their involvement because it turned out badly for them others go much further than that and are repentant and have had a total change of attitude and outlook <e> <s> on moral grounds they are convinced that what they did earlier was wrong <e>", "<cs> i am glad this amendment has been tabled because it gives me an opportunity to raise a point which may be unnecessary <e> <s> however i cannot be sure of that and i shall be glad if the minister can tell me whether or not it is unnecessary <e> <s> i need to declare an interest because i am currently the president of the northern ireland association for the care and resettlement of offenders which is perhaps better known as niacro <e> <s> the association in parallel with various other voluntary bodies provides training for released prisoners ex-offenders and young persons at risk of offending <e>", "<cs> i am reading amendment no <e> <s> incorporating new clause aa <e> <s> the words are <e>", "<cs> this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> tabled by the noble lord lord blease raise an important principle <e> <s> i should like to see the government accepting either one or the other <e> <s> if they cannot do so they should produce their own improved version at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i expect we have all heard the stories of atheists living in belfast who have been immediately classified as either protestant or catholic <e> <s> there was even the story of a gp in derry who became so fed up with the carry-on of the two main religious communities that he became a bahai <e> <s> i cannot vouch for the authenticity of that story but it is indicative of the background <e>", "<cs> my lords this is quite an important amendment <e> <s> i am sure that it would be obvious to anyone who thought about it that the first six months in this country for an asylum seeker who probably arrives totally destitute will be the most difficult months of his stay even if later he may be able to obtain normal work <e> <s> surely the regulations could distinguish between asylum seekers on the one hand and ec nationals and tourists on the other <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord who moved the amendment will not withdraw it too lightly <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> for the past years or more we have suffered from acute local housing shortages and attendant homelessness <e> <s> as a result the housing problems have had to be picked up by social services departments and social security payments <e> <s> i hope that the government will be successful in their attempts to make it no longer necessary to use bed and breakfast accommodation especially for families with children <e>", "<cs> my lords i give general support to this amendment <e> <s> so far we have had mention of the mentally handicapped the physically handicapped and those suffering from psychiatric illness <e> <s> i draw attention to discharged prisoners who often need employment rehabilitation before they can have any hope of finding work in the normal way <e> <s> that arises or course from the regrettable situation in many prisons where there is a great shortage of work and where alas and unfortunately prisoners are being locked up for or hours each day <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> what guidance has been given to the courts to encourage them to make the greatest possible use of the existing provisions for reparation and restitution especially when dealing with non-violent offenders <e> <s> will her majestys government provide the necessary resources for the probation service and others who enforce those sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept the fact that non-custodial sentences are more likely to make the offender face up to his crime and his personal problems whereas prison may degrade him and drag him deeper into crime <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord lauderdale mentioned bearing down in electricity prices <e> <s> i wonder whether in the past couple of years when fuel prices have actually been falling we have been witnessing a certain amount of bearing up on those same prices <e> <s> i ask why in this bill the government are taking a line that is less positive than the energy act <e> <s> can the government explain that <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to think that the amendment is relevant to the recent education act which provided for the devolution of quite considerable administrative matters from the education authority to the individual school <e> <s> when that legislation comes into force it will be a totally untested and untried area <e> <s> it could go seriously wrong if schools are not given sufficient administrative personnel to do everything properly and those personnel are not properly funded <e> <s> it would be in the national interest that the local government ombudsman should be able to look into those matters of administration <e> <s> i am not talking about the quality of teaching or the subjects taught i am talking about administration <e>", "<cs> of course there have been abuses in local government and no doubt some of them go back a very long time <e> <s> nevertheless it is not possible to deceive every electorate indefinitely eventually they see when local authorities are exceeding their brief or are using local questions to conduct national campaigns <e>", "<cs> i support these amendments so well moved and explained by the noble lord lord hayter <e> <s> i speak as chairman of a local charitable foundation in a rural area <e> <s> some years ago now we invented a new type of person to meet a particular need <e> <s> that person is called the village contact person a kind of miniaturised cab scaled down to what is needed in a village <e> <s> this is particularly useful when one lives on the borders of three district councils three counties one health authority and one police area with overlapping and conflicting boundaries and catchment areas <e>", "<cs> i have been associated with voluntary bodies in one form or another since about <e> <s> i have occupied most kinds of roles from that of volunteer to that of president in such fields as housing adult education mental handicap and prisoners <e> <s> i therefore strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the minister very kindly say what will be the position of organisations such as the national housing and town planning council and other national organisations such as mind mencap and age concern <e>", "<cs> i read clause as a non-lawyer and it appears that subsection b is directly relevant to the case of the four voluntary bodies about which i asked the minister a question when the committee dealt with the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord hayter <e> <s> i ask the minister to take the issue away and read the two amendments in conjunction <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham has demonstrated beyond any possible shadow of doubt the unbelievable complexities of the implications of this bill and this particular part of this bill <e> <s> perhaps i should say that i was one of the founder members of the organisation which the noble lord mentioned the london housing aid centre shac although it is quite some years since i had any connection with it <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy for the amendment but if the particular class of charity with which the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu is concerned is exempted why not exempt all registered charities <e> <s> i urge the government to make use of the protection that is presently provided both by the district auditor and by the existence of the charity commission and vetting bodies instead of introducing the unbelievably complex provisions checks and controls which are in the bill <e>", "<cs> at the risk of prolonging the debate i wish to congratulate the noble earl lord caithness on becoming an economic minister <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him wearing both his former hat and his present hat whether under the new system there will be incentives to local authorities to manage their housing stock as efficiently as possible <e> <s> when i say incentives i mean both in capital spending and in capital borrowing <e> <s> perhaps i may go on to ask him why it is necessary to control so closely and to introduce fine tuning of local authority borrowing at a time when there are no controls other than interest rates on private borrowing for instant consumption <e>", "<cs> i am sure that many members of the committee will be in the position of having deposited records of all kinds with local authorities for example manorial records court records family and genealogical records <e> <s> i am certainly a person in that position <e>", "<cs> i wish very briefly to support the plea made by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> the matter has a bearing on tourism because many americans and commonwealth citizens come to this country specifically to research their ancestry <e> <s> they spend a great deal of money here in the process of doing so <e> <s> it is very shortsighted to discourage them by imposing charges <e>", "<cs> it seemed to me that in replying to the amendments the noble earl lord ferrers took a slightly complacent line <e> <s> he seemed to imply that everything is marvellously well handled after major disasters <e> <s> perhaps i may speak from the experience of a personal friend of mine who was involved as a volunteer in counselling affected people after the hillsborough football stadium disaster <e> <s> it seems that it was pretty difficult or perhaps more difficult than it should have been for relatives and friends of those involved to discover who had been killed and injured <e> <s> it is also clear that the bereavement counselling of families in one place who had had a relative in hospital in another place left quite a lot to be desired <e> <s> so i hope that the committee will not gain the impression that these matters are as well handled as they might be <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey replies i think it would be appropriate if i drew attention to a recently arrived group of refugees of non-commonwealth origin <e> <s> i am referring specifically to about people of kurdish origin from eastern turkey who have arrived in this country since the end of april <e> <s> those who were not detained and put in prison or in detention centres

<s> it is amazing that the government should seek to introduce this type of amendment at this stage of the bill after it has passed through another place and at this very late hour <e>", "<cs> i should like to pay tribute to the sheer persistence of the national agricultural centre rural trust in working away on this problem over many years until we have now reached the point where there are successful schemes already built and in existence <e> <s> i should very much like to congratulate my noble friend lord stanley on the great clarity with which he moved this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been associated with a good many voluntary bodies and in some cases i have been a founder member <e> <s> it becomes clear as these amendments rumble on that part v of the bill was far too widely drafted in the first place <e> <s> i support and congratulate my noble friend on the clarity of his drafting <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of newport very properly mentioned that this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he could help me on the question of debt redemption <e> <s> no doubt i ought to know the answer but i do not <e> <s> i dare say that a number of your lordships also do not know the answer <e> <s> is he talking about debt redemption on a debt attaching to the particular site sold or about the total pooled debt of the particular local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i was recently taken round the salford docks regeneration <e> <s> there you have an ancient industrial inland dock which i understand was totally derelict a few years ago <e> <s> now you find beautiful yuppie houses right up to the waterfront with the water cleaned and purified and everything looking lovely <e> <s> nearby are office buildings and other very recent private sector developments <e> <s> i will bet any amount of money that any other noble lord wants to wager that this would not have happened if at the time there had been this idea of a notional capital receipt which i feel must have been dreamt up by some very strange treasury mandarin <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the amendment because it gives me the opportunity to congratulate the secretary of state mr christopher patten on his recent initiative designed to make it possible for local auhorities and housing associations to take people particularly families with children out of bed and breakfast accommodation and put them into permanent homes which are now standing empty <e> <s> i am sure that that is something which we all welcome <e> <s> i am delighted that the secretary of state has succeeded in convincing the treasury that that is a sensible and economic use of resources <e> <s> it is something that has stood out a mile for years but it is highly encouraging that it at last seems to have been appreciated and even acted on <e> <s> it may be that the sum of money allocated is too small but let us hope that it is a first instalment and once it has been shown to work and to succeed it can be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> is it not very frustrating that this order which will provide the framework for the educational future of million of united kingdom citizens cannot be amended in parliament <e> <s> further does he appreciate that the order contains something which is quite new namely provision for a new funding and a new status for integrated schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord stanley on this amendment which he has so clearly moved <e> <s> i should like to recount some <e>", "<cs> my lords i have added my name to the amendment <e> <s> i shall speak briefly endeavouring not to repeat myself <e> <s> tonight noble lords must decide whether they wish to retain the social assets of bungalows and flats for the purposes for which they were built <e> <s> the question is should those social assets be preserved or should they become market commodities perhaps with futures attached <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for speaking without having put down my name <e> <s> i do so only because i have listened to the whole debate and have a number of friends currently working in the hospice movement <e> <s> i should like to make just one financial point <e> <s> in doing so i support strongly what the noble lord lord blease has just said <e> <s> pound for pound is no doubt a big step forward in scotland <e> <s> i am sure that the scottish hospices are grateful for the scheme but something a little better and a little more thought through is called for for england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> will the government convey to the israeli authorities that the reopening of these universities would be a useful step in building up confidence in the context of the approaching negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords until such time as we have international agreement is it not in israels own interest to enable those who are the leaders of the rising generation to return to their studies <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to break new ground and speak about northern ireland which i have visited several times during the past year <e> <s> i am glad to say that the hospitality there is as good as ever <e> <s> great areas of normal life continue while much constructive work is being done <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his helpful answer <e> <s> which department is in charge of the resettlement work both in hong kong and in london and is it adequately staffed <e> <s> further have all those cases due for family reunion already left hong kong to come to britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> however will the government do their very best to achieve a concerted policy with our european community partners and in other international groupings so that there is some consistency in diplomatic representation and in trade policy not only with iraq but also with certain other middle eastern countries that have a deplorable human rights record <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister and his colleagues continue to press for the release or the charging of mr bazoft who is a british protected journalist <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by warmly welcoming the fairly modest amount of good news that the noble lord lord skelmersdale was able to give us about economic development and job creation <e> <s> beyond that i wish to raise two points of which the minister has already had notice <e> <s> i am sure that he will be just as helpful as his predecessors in office were in answering points of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords in general i welcome the order but i must immediately say that it should have been taken as a bill <e> <s> a long consultation period as outlined by the minister in reply to my starred question on th october and again today is no substitute for full parliamentary procedure <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord prys-davies and with the noble baroness lady seear that pages of legislation should not be disposed of in five or six hours of affirmative motion debate <e> <s> i raised that point again in the home affairs debate on rd november and suggested various possible remedies for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would give way for a second may i say that it was the staff of existing schools that i am more concerned with <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down can he explain why austria iceland norway and sweden appear to have excluded the fiscal requirements of the protocol <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest possible sympathy for the values and principles that have moved my noble friend and kinswoman to put forward the amendment <e> <s> i entirely agree that it is highly desirable that all children should have two parents if that is at all possible <e> <s> however the weakness of the amendment is that it seems to discriminate against the infertile unmarried woman or couple because those who are fortunate enough to be fertile will simply go ahead in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the current levels of housing benefit will be sufficient to cover the very much higher level of rents that already are becoming payable <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a brief word in favour of the amendment <e> <s> it states that representations must be made first to the secretary of state <e> <s> it goes on to state that he must consult the authority <e> <s> however after that presumably he must make up his own mind <e> <s> it may be desirable that the kind of representations or who should make them should be clarified a little further <e> <s> but on the face of it i should have thought that this was a useful reserve power to have in the bill <e>", "<cs> we should all be extremely grateful to the noble earl lord lauderdale who has very much clarified the issues <e> <s> as he pointed out the key distinction lies between those children conceived by artificial insemination through the husband and those children conceived through the aid of a donor <e> <s> that is the key distinction which applies not only to peerage and other such questions it also concerns the general population <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a disgrace that of official funds are reported to be ready and available should the temperature drop so low that people are in danger of dying of cold <e> <s> should those funds not be spent now regardless of the temperature to help not only the young people to whom the right reverend prelate referred but also other vulnerable groups such as ex-psychiatric patients and ex-prisoners <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals has made an interesting debating point but i am sure that even he will admit that he is not comparing like with like when he puts on the one hand the semi-reform of the national health service and abortion law on the other <e> <s> surely the fact remains that for years since parliament has failed to change the act <e> <s> that surely is a telling point in support of my noble friend lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the doe uses recycled paper for its parliamentary correspondence <e> <s> will he encourage other departments to follow that admirable example <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the way in which he introduced the order <e> <s> i very much welcome what he said about future video recordings of interviews <e> <s> it is certainly no frnction of this parliament let alone of your lordsihips house to criticise the decisions of the courts of other countries <e> <s> however the fact remains as has been pointed out that two recent decisions of the supreme court of ireland have unfortunately been a major setback to relations between our two countries <e> <s> this has implications for security in northern ireland and for co-operation between the security forces of the north and south of ireland <e>", "<cs> public dividend capital is mentioned at the bottom of page of the bill <e> <s> is that a device for extracting dividends from some super-efficient hospital or on the other hand is it a way of avoiding paying loan interest on debt which might possibly be attributed to it <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the minister for the sympathetic views she expressed particularly about the possibility of a tighter or better-drawn government amendment <e> <s> nevertheless further remarks must be made because the impression should not be given that the problem affects only people in wheelchairs for example <e>", "<cs> with respect that only says shall consult <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the government do not feel able to be a little more forthcoming on these two amendments <e> <s> we must bear in mind that an increasing number of children in need of care or support of one kind or another are either adopted or fostered <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be permitted to say a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> if accepted it may well be the first time that carers will appear on the face of the bill <e> <s> if so it is high time that they did <e> <s> from personal experience within my family i know how extremely wearing it can be to support people who for example have lost their memory or are suffering from a depressive illness <e> <s> there is a great need for respite help for carers and their views should be very much taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> in connection with this group of amendments it is relevant to mention a matter which may appear to be extremely obvious but it should be stated <e> <s> there can be little point in conducting painstaking assessments unless they are followed up by a form of treatment provision of services or action that will remedy the condition in question <e> <s> first if an assessment is carried out and nothing happens for several years that is a waste of the professional effort involved <e> <s> secondly if nothing follows the assessment that can be extremely depressing for the person assessed <e>", "<cs> it is a pity that these important amendments are being discussed in a thin chamber at a late hour <e> <s> i know that they affect for instance cheshire homes and also servite house a housing association rather well known to me <e> <s> there is about the country quite a substantial volume of residential homes and nursing homes <e> <s> they have been provided over a long period of years <e> <s> they have been upgraded consistently to meet fire regulations and so on <e> <s> it would be a great waste of resource if because of the financial provisions in respect of them they were running at much less than capacity <e> <s> we have to remember also that they cater particularly for the frail elderly and for people with a whole variety of disabilities <e> <s> the sums provided by local authority top-up payments are still not sufficient to meet the necessary level of charges even when income support has been taken into account <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will not brush aside these amendments <e>", "<cs> the governments reply is depressing and unacceptable <e> <s> the minister did not once refer to voluntary bodies providing residential or nursing homes <e> <s> they are by definition not-for-pr of it organisations <e> <s> to put them together with commercial operators is unfair and unreasonable <e> <s> i hope that we can have something better <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord russell is greatly to be congratulated on moving this amendment in addition to the many others to which he has his name attached <e> <s> it deals with one of the most deprived sections of the population <e> <s> anyone who has thought about the problem would readily agree that no family with children should be placed in bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> we are not in an ideal world <e> <s> it does happen <e> <s> therefore the only way to approach the problem is for the government to adopt a generous policy on allowances and benefit <e> <s> that is what the amendments seek and that is why i support them <e>", "<cs> i ask the government to think rather more deeply about the situation of elderly parents of pensionable age who are continuing to care for sons and daughters who are either physically or mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> is the weekly earnings rule reviewed annually and if not will it not very soon become out of date and obsolete <e>", "<cs> i invite the committee to consider the costs of not accepting the amendment <e> <s> what will be the burden that falls on the police <e> <s> what will be the cost to the courts <e> <s> what will be the cost in borstal training and imprisonment <e> <s> what will be the cost to hospitals <e> <s> what will be the cost of failing to improve the present parlous situation <e> <s> in the previous regulations were changed <e> <s> i foresaw that there would soon be a considerable number of sturdy vagrants in this country to use old poor law <e>", "<cs> some years ago the catholic housing aid society in london made loans to people who needed deposits to secure accommodation <e> <s> at that time the sums involved were quite small but nowadays the sums have multiplied enormously <e> <s> however the society still grants the odd loan for that purpose when there is no other source from which the money can be found <e>", "<cs> of its nature a hospital is a total institution and very expensive to run whether it is for long-stay or short-stay hospital care <e> <s> one therefore completely understands the governments wish to see patients discharged from both types of hospital care <e> <s> what we all have to face is that there will be consequential costs which are the consequential costs of handling people within the community and enabling them to cope with their own lives in a community setting <e>", "<cs> my lords i was happy to add my name to this amendment when asked to do so <e> <s> the noble earl lord russell has referred to an alarming and serious case <e> <s> there must be many like that <e> <s> we have to bear in mind that no young person normally makes himself or herself voluntarily totally devoid of any kind of shelter <e> <s> such people hope to find a place with a friend or relation but if they fail to do so they end up on the streets <e> <s> however we want to keep them off the streets <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is much narrower than the previous one <e> <s> i support it on the grounds of the cost not only of clothing but also of shoes as any parent who has children in this age group will readily understand <e> <s> many of these young people are still growing and therefore need not fewer but more clothes and shoes in the course of one year than older people <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment particularly as it applies to mature students <e> <s> any government ought to encourage this group if only because of its much higher degree of motivation as compared with the general run of students in the country <e> <s> we must remember that grants for mature students are in most cases discretionary <e> <s> many local authorities refuse to take up that discretion and make use of it <e> <s> therefore those who have contributed over quite a number of years in some cases to national insurance and social security should be entitled to benefit in the way suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe the noble lord <e> <s> lord carter an apology for not having been in my place when he began to move his amendment <e> <s> he moved it in a matter of fact way whereas he would have been justified in moving it with a good deal of passion and even emotion <e> <s> perhaps on this occasion the government will admit that we are in a totally non-ideal situation with families with children being forced by circumstances by shortage by the kind of housing crisis which we are in into bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> nothing could be less suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of intricate and drafting points have just been raised on the government side <e> <s> however i should like to urge the government to take sufficient time to reply in some detail to the point raised by the noble earl lord russell concerning regional cash limits on the social fund which i believe bear harshly on claimants in certain parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support as strongly as i can what the noble baroness lady seear has just been saying <e> <s> i believe that what i want to say applies not only to this group of amendments but also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> ever since about it has been thought right proper and appropriate that a certain very small minority of the total elderly population should be accommodated in residential or nursing homes and that these people should be largely but not entirely funded from public sources whether that funding comes from local authorities or from central government <e> <s> can the government explain why that is no longer thought to be right and why it is that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not about time that we abandoned semantics and niceties of accounting and got on with the job of providing homes at rents that people can afford <e>", "<cs> it is clear that the practice of landfill tipping is likely to continue for many years with the best will and incentives <e> <s> it is also obvious that there are many completed sites quietly decaying <e>", "<cs> i think that we have reached the point in the bill where we are concerned with illegal and unwanted fly-tipping that is the depositing on land of refuse and rubbish of all kinds <e> <s> i speak with some feeling on the matter as one who has been the victim of such procedures on occasions in the past <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy for the spirit and intention of this amendment <e> <s> however i should like to know what it is intended should happen with clinical waste arising from ordinary doctors surgeries <e> <s> in some cases this waste could be highly infectious or dangerous <e> <s> it seems undesirable that it should go either into general landfill sites or into water-borne sewage <e> <s> we could hardly expect every surgery to have its own incinerator <e> <s> therefore there seems to me to be a need for some policy on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is it not a fact that there is compelling evidence of widespread and possibly systematic use of torture of deportations and of the existence of death squads <e> <s> do not these matters make a mockery of signing international conventions <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government agree that agricultural and horticultural producers are always weak sellers of perishable commodities <e> <s> is it not a duty of governments to protect them whether through marketing boards or by other means from exploitation by powerful purchasers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i have recently returned from denmark where i stayed at roskilde <e> <s> it is the equivalent of canterbury and westminster abbey rolled into one <e> <s> two or three miles outside this historic and beautiful town i came across a very large wind generator <e> <s> it was at least one hundred feet high with a proportionate span of rotor blades <e> <s> it operated virtually silently <e> <s> i thought that it fitted extremely well into the rather attractive landscape <e>", "<cs> my lords is the pricing of british oil in dollars a relevant matter <e> <s> do the government consider that practice either necessary or desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to this amendment it is relevant to say that there exists generous-hearted couples who are willing to adopt seriously handicapped babies and children <e> <s> in many cases they are unable to find such children to adopt <e> <s> in cases of late diagnosis of handicap it is greatly preferable to deliver the child if the pregnancy has to be terminated by means of caesarian section or induction rather than by methods which end the life of the child in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very much with the noble lord lord holme of cheltenham <e> <s> i should like to try to respond to the eloquent appeal of the noble lord lord fitt <e> <s> i want to refer to our closest neighbour the republic of ireland and later to mention the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to give way <e> <s> he rightly mentioned the court case <e> <s> would be not agree that that was a totally exceptional case <e> <s> he must accept that it took five years to bring it and i can tell him from my own knowledge from correspondence and communication with the plaintiffs solicitor that no compensation has yet been received <e> <s> i hope it will be received very shortly but leaving that case to one side the point i endeavoured to make was that there are rights in theory but that they are not enforceable in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that since there has not been one single execution in
