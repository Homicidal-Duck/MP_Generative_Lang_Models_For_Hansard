["<cs> my lords first i must apologies as according to how long this debate lasts it is possible that i may have to leave before the end for i must be in my diocese early tomorrow morning <e> <s> i do not propose to say anything about the effect of these rules on the law <e> <s> i know little about the law and i have always been taught that it precedes the gospel anyhow <e> <s> last time i spoke of the good community relations which exist in my see city <e> <s> i then stated my conviction that good race relations can be maintained and fostered only by person-to-person relationships between people of different races and that the judgment of people in close personal contact with those of other races is the judgment that can best assess the overall benefit or the overall damage of any particular legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain irony in my choice of this debate as the occasion for my maiden speech in this house for i left school at the age of and my higher education was gained in what is euphemistically called the university of life <e> <s> however in recent years i have endeavoured to remedy this deficiency and through my membership of the council of the university of bradford and various of its committees i have become aware of some of the very real problems confronting our institutions of higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak in this debate <e> <s> however i believe that it is probably unique that there is an ulster catholic on that side of the house and an ulster protestant on this side of the house speaking in the same debate <e> <s> i should like to say categorically that i agree with every word that the noble lord has said <e> <s> i endorse his sentiments and the manner in which he expressed them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am slightly relieved that i do not have to stand to support the introductory speech of the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> however integrity demands that i say that i wish to support the bill for four reasons <e> <s> first it separates the physical and legal issues relating to abortion from those relating to the more complex issues of human fertilisation and embryology <e> <s> while from certain viewpoints there may be attractions in such a linkage i can see no overriding justification for it <e> <s> on the contrary i support the contention of the noble baroness lady warnock that it cannot be in the interests of clarity to consider two different kinds of entity in one piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> i simply and briefly support the amendment before us <e> <s> although in a sense i speak for myself at this point i believe that i have the support of many church leaders across the country <e> <s> i say that because at the general synod last july when the national health service and various proposals connected with it were debated a resolution was passed which runs on almost similar lines calling for this sort of evaluation <e>"]
