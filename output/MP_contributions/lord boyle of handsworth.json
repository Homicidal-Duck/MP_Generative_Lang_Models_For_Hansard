["<cs> my lords may i put two questions to the noble lord <e> <s> first does the postponement until the autumn of any further statement mean that there will be further opportunity for consultation about the cuts with those providers of services most affected <e> <s> secondly the noble lord referred just now to plans for and <e> <s> is he aware that it really is impossible for a body such as a university to plan for or when at the moment it has absolutely no idea of the extent to which future pay settlements will <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble viscount lord amory and to the noble lord lord vaizey for their kind personal references to me <e> <s> the hour is very late but i feel it would be wrong for this debate to end without one contribution from a representative of the large civic universities of the north of england <e>", "<cs> i was never a secretary of state but i was the last minister of education before the department of education and science was set up in and i should briefly like to express my sympathy with the view put by the noble earl lord swinton and also by the noble lord lord alexander on this subject <e> <s> first of all this will cost something <e> <s> i believe the total cost of it will not be minimal and surely this is a time when in the education service as in the health service we want to get all the money as near the front as possible into the schools for capitation grants per head for those who are actually being taught and for improvements in teaching in the schools themselves <e>", "<cs> may i just ask one question before we part with this clause <e> <s> i feel that this part of the bill while evoking infinitely less controversy than it would have done only years ago should not pass without careful consideration on the part of your lordships house <e> <s> indeed we have the advantage for this debate of the presence of two right reverend prelates <e> <s> may i ask one specific question <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the effect of clauses and taken together is that local opinion will have the same opportunity to express itself as at present if there should be any significant shift in the balance between county schools and voluntary schools in a particular area <e> <s> i think it is important to be reassured about that because there are still parts of the country where this is felt to be a matter of real concern <e>", "<cs> i know the hour is late <e> <s> i regret that i was not able to attend the second reading <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord young of darlington that it is not very likely that any of us will influence many votes at this hour of the morning <e> <s> even so having listened to the whole of this debate i would rather make two or three points than simply be enumerated in the division lobby <e> <s> therefore i hope i shall be forgiven if i make not more than three comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise very much to the noble lord as i have only just taken my place <e> <s> but i hope that the noble lord will not forget that a very high fraction of the total cost of the scientific effort in universities is financed not through the research councils but through the dwindling recurrent budget of universities financed through the ugc <e> <s> there has been very great concern caused to vice-chancellors by the fact that apparently the prime minister and it appears the noble lord also is not fully aware of that <e> <s> it is the running costs of departments that finance a very high fraction indeed of the total scientific effort of the universities <e>"]
