["<cs> my lords it is with great humility diffidence a sense of great privilege and above all i hope brevity that i rise to make my maiden speech in this historic debate <e> <s> in doing so i hope not to be considered presumptuous since i have no personal legal expertise whatever and i am very conscious that your lordships house is well endowed with a great wealth of such knowledge <e> <s> indeed i cannot hope to share the great skill of advocacy that so many noble lords who are members of the bar possess <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first declare my interest as chairman of the national consumer council <e> <s> consumers of goods and services when dealing with monopoly suppliers are at a great disadvantage <e> <s> when they are dealing with monopoply suppliers of essential utilities suppliers of their basic needs the disadvantage is even greater <e> <s> but worst of all is the position of the captive consumer dealing with a monopoly supplier of his essential needs in the public sector <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene either but i should like to put a thought to my noble friend <e> <s> whereas it is true to say that it is not the polluter who pays but the consumer who invariably pays i believe it is true to say that under the bill the regulator would not permit the polluter to pass on the cost to the consumer if the pollution was due to negligence <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend replies can he confirm that at the end of the day it will not be the treasury which pays the salary but the industry <e> <s> therefore it seems all the more of an anomaly that the treasury should have to be consulted <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene but i have been provoked <e> <s> i have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment of my local friend lord peyton <e> <s> i am a little alarmed to hear some of the views expressed by the noble lord lord stoddart and others about the undesirability of the role of the secretary of state in these matters <e> <s> i have to declare an interest as chairman of a public body to which the secretary of state makes appointments <e> <s> i have also been the minister who had made these appointments <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that one of the great problems is to find the people to do these jobs in particular in the regional areas <e> <s> it is not easy for the secretary of state <e> <s> he does not have the freedom that the noble lord attributes to him in finding the right people <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend can tell me this <e> <s> if the consumers committees appointed by the director and the director comes cosily together and decide that something is in the consumers interest and consumers do not think that it is in their interests who is going to mediate on their behalf <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down is he saying that the regional <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend can say whether anybody else in all the consumer bodies has taken the same line as the electricity consumers council <e> <s> is there another single consumer body that has taken that line <e>", "<cs> i must make my point clear <e> <s> i was referring to a very narrow point <e> <s> i was claiming that nobody else but the electricity consumers council had welcomed not the general consumer protection elements of the bill but simply the fact that the regional committees would suffice in their present form and not independent of the director <e> <s> it is a very narrow point that the electricity consumers council has welcomed this <e> <s> it has not been supported by anybody else in the consumer movement so far as i am aware <e>", "<cs> my noble friend assures me that he is not tired <e> <s> in many ways i am delighted to be doing so at this hour because the debates that have taken place in committee this afternoon and this evening have paved the way for this amendment far more eloquently than i could have done <e> <s> when i have described the amendment i think that the committee will see that it will resolve a number of the problems which have vexed noble lords on both sides of the chamber during the course of the committee stage and answer a number of questions which have not been resolved <e>", "<cs> i strained my ears to hear messages of hope in my noble friends reply <e> <s> i was a little disturbed to hear him say that his department had given great weight to what the electricity consumers council had said <e> <s> i do not understand why it was necessary for his department to give great weight to the opinion of one council and not to consult at all my council or other consumer organisations on this matter <e>", "<cs> on the basis of that reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his extremely helpful answer <e> <s> i hope he will answer a final question <e> <s> does he agree that when we discuss the standards in clause we should consider compensation for interruption of supply <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in the deputy leader of the labour party called a press conference to celebrate the fact that inflation was down to per cent <e> <s> if that was a cause for celebration why are we now complaining about a rate of inflation of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the national consumer council i should also like to thank my noble friend for this generous concession which is extremely welcome <e> <s> we cannot win them all but we are most grateful for those we do win <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the case put forward by the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to consider what my noble friend the minister has said <e> <s> i think that he may have gone a long way to convince me <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister has given a full and thoughtful answer for which i am extremely grateful <e> <s> i shall study it carefully in relation to those parts of the bill which he mentioned and which obviously one has not had time to study at this moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may correct a mistaken impression given inadvertently by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> the director general of fair trading has no power to do anything in relation to a public sector industry <e> <s> it is only after the passage of this bill that the director general of fair trading will be able to intervene for the first time <e> <s> he was able to intervene to a limited extent if references were made under the competition act <e> <s> i should like to clarify that point <e>", "<cs> my lords my emotion is not one of shock but of great gratitude to my noble friend the minister for the generous way in which she has accepted the amendment <e> <s> she has demonstrated in the best possible way her and the governments commitment to ensuring that consumers are adequately protected after privatisation <e> <s> i am sure that consumers will benefit and that they share my gratitude <e> <s> i thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister confirm that for consumers privatisation cannot come quickly enough since there will be far better regulation of prices and competition and they will benefit from a far better consumer protection system than could possibly exist under a public sector monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord williams of elvel on resisting on this occasion the temptation to turn this debate into a full-scale political one <e> <s> he was extremely generous in offering the conservative party the opportunity to clean up its act <e> <s> i return the compliment and equally generously offer the labour party the opportunity to clean up its act by turning down the trade union contributions that it receives <e> <s> they are far larger than any contributions companies receive <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that whereas it may be true that certain companies have a bad reputation in regard to paying smaller companies a good many more companies have a positive policy of paying their smaller suppliers early as part of their social responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome the bill which is by far the most important measure of consumer protection in relation to food that we have had in this country and is probably the best in the world <e> <s> no government have taken such radical comprehensive and indeed some would say draconian steps before <e> <s> as an ex-chairman of the national consumer council i was particularly delighted to note that a number of the ncc proposals had been incorporated into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been listening with interest during the course of the <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to the opening remarks of the noble lord lord ennals on this amendment <e> <s> i have no doubts at all about his sincerity and anxiety <e> <s> however i must question at least two of the premises which he raised <e> <s> the first concerns the question of the budget and its effects <e> <s> he spoke as if to say that a budget <e>", "<cs> i am not referring to the gp in norwich i am referring to the gp who appeared on television day after day stresssing the fact that he was resigning from the national health service because this was such a serious situation and because he thought the whole service would be undermined <e> <s> as i said he was the same gp to whom i took my cut finger for treatment <e> <s> while looking at my finger he said you know i am very much to the left <e> <s> i replied im not interested in your politics i am more concerned in your qualifications <e> <s> that doctor was very willing when holding my cut finger to tell me what were his politics but when he went on television to say that the national health service was being undermined by the governments proposals he did not feel it necessary to tell the country about his politics <e> <s> therefore i would not go so far as to say that there are no politics in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the country owes a great deal of gratitude to the prime minister for the stalwart way in which she has defended the interests of this country as a good member of the community but with the interests of this country obviously first in resisting the urge to rush towards conformity for conformitys sake particularly in the areas of anxiety which she spelt out <e> <s> should she not receive the wholehearted support of both houses in that respect <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene but i must oppose amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> from what has been said it would appear that the floodgates would open as soon as anyone applied to operate a residential home <e> <s> ex-convicts from all over the country could apply and nobody would know unless the police were consulted <e> <s> to my certain knowledge the police are disturbed about the fact that they do not receive from hospitals doctors and others vital information that would prevent crimes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for introducing the bill <e> <s> i am also grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate for supplying some of the background to the story of why we are debating the measure this evening <e> <s> the noble lord lord meston has described it as half a loaf <e> <s> i should not describe it as such i should describe it as a pathetic remnant <e> <s> that is no disrespect to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point does my noble friend therefore agree that three weeks was a reasonable time for mr bernstein to have had his car and to have lost his right to reject it under the law that my noble friend is commending to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that one of the matters on the agenda was that of consumer guarantees <e> <s> that was in line with the undertaking given by the government which is now obviously being fulfilled <e> <s> will my noble friend confirm that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is very difficult to consult the community since one cannot define the community <e> <s> will she take it from me that what people want is a free comprehensive hospital service which uses its <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend educate the parties opposite by telling them that the biggest donation to the conservative party is time which is given by people in the party organisations who work to raise a very large proportion of the money that is given to the party <e>"]
