of the system very successfully practised in west germany <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to detain the house by repeating arguments advanced at the committee stage but i have been through the recent history of this little bill with considerable care and it seems to me that on any reasonable interpretation of what was said by the secretary of state for the environment in another place

certain that the government inadvertently have failed to allow for this important research activity <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ritchie-calder pointed out the comparable american law to which this

act <e>", "<cs> my lords i like other noble lords am most grateful to the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> for affording us this opportunity of debating these important matters <e> <s> her motion is so wide-ranging that one could jump in at almost any point in the whole spectrum of education and training <e> <s> this afternoon i shall resist taking up in any detail the question of provision for to year-olds for three reasons <e> <s> first it is still a matter of speculation what the government will pull out of the hat in response to the manpower services commissions consultative document <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply which i am afraid does not give me a great deal of encouragement may i ask him this while not disputing the governments right under existing arrangements to prescribe and deprescribe the external vernacular services of the bbc would he agree to discuss with the bbc the possibility of merging the spanish and latin-american services into a single ibero-american service in line with other major european broadcasters <e> <s> would he accept such a solution if it could be achieved at no additional cost within the framework of the overall saving required of the external services <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble lord agree that on th november at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord assure the house that the government contemplate no further cuts in their aid for population activities <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this bench also wish to express our gratitude to the noble earl lord ferrers for repeating this extremely important statement <e> <s> many of its lines we are able to welcome in particular its emphasis that all future training should be to standards without regard to age <e> <s> this is something which those on all sides of the house can welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the statement he has just made is not in accordance with paragraph of the government white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this bench are not particularly enamoured of the assisted places scheme <e> <s> we do not believe that it is the right way to go about closer liaison between the public and the private sectors <e> <s> however that being said and looking at the present amendments and regulations one or two points arise <e> <s> incidentally i should like to ask the noble lord in passing as a question of curiosity why in regulation after the words including the united kingdom he wishes to add the words as constituted from time to time <e> <s> is the noble lord contemplating an early disintegration of the united kingdom <e> <s> similarly he wants to add the same words after european community <e> <s> that could be interpreted as meaning the accession of spain and portugal but i am wondering what precise weight is to be attached to the words as constituted from time to time in relation to the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the record of the civil service in employing the disabled could be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bill about which we can have little enthusiasm <e> <s> we understand the difficulties <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton referred to the changing and difficult economic conditions of our time which we do not dispute <e> <s> we understand that something in the region of billion will have to be found in for social security benefits of which about billion will go on retirement pensions <e> <s> it is all too clear that the redundancy fund will also require additional finance <e> <s> but we very much question the way the government have gone about finding this money <e>", "<cs> may i make a suggestion <e> <s> there is a great deal of sympathy in the committee towards both amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> which have some merits and some demerits <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton has kindly offered to come forward with something to satisfy the general feeling in the committee and may i suggest that both amendments might be taken and rolled together in a more fruitful whole <e> <s> i was rather attracted by the suggestion made by the noble baroness lady macleod <e> <s> in a case where the understanding was very much in doubt but where the understanding could be achieved could there he a fall-back position <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness mentioned the next-of-kin the social worker and various other people who might be brought in <e> <s> my suggestion is that when the noble lord takes this away he might also consider allowing for a fallback position in a case where understanding was virtually impossible to achieve <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord craigmyle in this amendment <e> <s> i agree that it is possible that he may not have got the age right <e> <s> maybe is better than <e> <s> it has to be admitted in fact it was pointed out in the review of the mental health act paragraph that an age limit is arbitrary and leads to anomalies <e> <s> then in this document it was accordingly proposed that the requirement to certify a likelihood of benefit from treatment should apply on admission only to those suffering from mental handicap and psychopathic disorder and that the age threshold should be dropped <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i was not in my place but yes consultation among members of the alliance was taking place <e> <s> i am grateful of course to the noble lord lord sandys for his very full reply to this amendment but i should like to put him right <e> <s> i was not trying to suggest that those admitted for treatment should be considered on a par with offenders what i was trying to show was that in this particular case they have less protection from abuse of their rights than offenders have <e> <s> that was the point <e> <s> in effect the offenders have a slightly greater safeguard <e>", "<cs> i understand that this is primarily a paving amendment for the schedule for which i will reserve my detailed remarks <e> <s> perhaps i may say why i did not intervene when the noble lord moved amendment no <e> <s> last tuesday <e> <s> i thank him for his courtesy in sending me his notes on that clause on this amendment and the other related amendments and the schedule in the package designed to give effect to the judgment of the european court of human rights <e> <s> i had not read the material that the noble lord sent me and so i thought it unwise to intervene <e> <s> the fault was mine <e> <s> i assumed that we were not going to reach the new clause on tuesday of last week <e> <s> i have been trying to remedy that dilatoriness however and i have one or two queries to put to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> it still seems to me after having read the noble lords remarks last time on amendment no <e> <s> that the right of unrestricted patients to make application for a tribunal within the first six months was being sacrificed to the new right of restricted patients to make an application between the sixth month and the twelfth month <e> <s> that is my understanding <e> <s> i wondered why this was necessary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his lucid explanation of the governments thinking on this issue <e> <s> on the face of it it seemed to me that there was no good reason for waiving the requirement for the second doctor under this type of committal but the noble lord as usual has been very persuasive <e> <s> i should like to read his remarks with close attention and possibly come back to the matter again at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> these amendments are related in that the weeks maximum is applied for assessment and also in the next amendment for treatment <e> <s> it raises the question of what is meant under assessment and whether treatment is likely to creep in under assessment <e> <s> of course we all very much respect the recommendations made in the report of lord butlers committee <e> <s> i still think that weeks is rather excessive and i wonder whether the problem might not be solved by allowing a period of remand for a further days for assessment or something of that nature <e> <s> however i shall think very carefully about what the noble lord has said and possibly refer to the matter at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for pointing out where in his view this amendment is technically defective <e> <s> i am equally grateful for his offer to look at the proposal in the last part of my remarks <e> <s> on those grounds i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there was no need for the noble lord lord sandys to apologise for the length of his reply i am extremely grateful for it <e> <s> i am also glad that the government recognise the desirability of a wider range of options becoming open to the tribunals <e> <s> i listened with care to the noble lords remarks about the powers of granting leave of absence or recommending leave of absence and also to his remarks about the projected revisions of the rules of procedure which may indeed also help in introducing greater flexibility into tribunal proceedings <e>", "<cs> we seem to be speaking not to two amendments only but possibly to three <e> <s> at this stage i should simply like to say as the amendment which stands in my name and those of the noble lord lord hooson and the noble baroness lady masham has been mentioned that my inclination is to support the amendment of the noble lord lord wallace if the government are disposed to accept it or if indeed the noble lord wishes to press it to a division <e>", "<cs> since the amendment in my name has also been mentoned during the course of the debate i should like to repeat that i am and my friends are disposed to accept the advice of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and to offer our support to the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> the matter contained in the second part of my proposed amendment is indeed an additional safeguard for the mental patient before a tribunal and it is a point that i could consider and possibly bring in at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like also to support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord renton has already pointed out the section is based on the assumption that patients are vexatious litigants and the courts in their legislative powers under the supreme court of judicature consolidation act already have adequate powers to deal with vexatious litigants <e> <s> there is also the point though i am not sure that it was made by the noble lord lord wallace that it is very unclear at the moment as to whether section applies to informal patients <e> <s> it seems to me that those are two drawbacks of the existing legislation <e> <s> one would have thought the government would have taken the opportunity of this essentially reforming bill to bring forward something to correct the position but they have not seen fit to do so <e> <s> there is also the suggestion embodied in a later amendment put down by some of my liberal friends which might provide a way out of the difficulty <e> <s> before deciding what i should do i should like to hear from the noble lord lord elton whether he is at all disposed to accept the suggestion that prior application to the director of public prosecutions will be a satisfactory alternative <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for the care and thought with which he has given his answer on this very important question and stated the governments view <e> <s> i was particularly struck by the anomalies which the noble baroness lady jeger pointed out from first hand experience <e> <s> they rather seemed to underline my own feeling that atlhough anomalies may be inevitable in law this particular one seems almost to have got out of hand <e>", "<cs> one listens to the noble lord lord hunter of newington with vast respect but it is worth putting the point to your lordships committee that essentially he was discussing the question of the second opinion which is contained in amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> whether or not one agrees with the noble lord lord hunter i do not think that his objections on that score should obscure the general <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make a second reading speech but before the committee decides whether to accept or reject the clause i wish to go back a short way over recent history <e> <s> the clause reduces the treasury supplement from to per cent <e> <s> with a resultant benefit or saving of million to the exchequer <e> <s> but that is not the whole of the story <e>", "<cs> the committee will see that i have a later amendment down to clause no <e> <s> b which refers directly back to clause which we are now discussing <e> <s> i am not sure whether it would be for the convenience of the committee and in particular to the noble lord lord elton if i spoke to that now or perhaps he would prefer first to answer the points that have been put to him by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i await the ministers guidance <e>", "<cs> very well i shall be guided by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> in fact while we were talking about clause i asked the noble lord lord elton whether i should make my remarks at that time and i think he gave me guidance to the effect that it would be better if i reserved them until later <e>", "<cs> i am sorry about that <e> <s> with due respect to the noble lord lord mottistone my remarks arise from my concern about the very considerable powers of the commission and also the point which with due respect i do not think was made when we were talking about clause that this particular health authority will be rather a different sort of health authority from those which are specified in the national health service act <e> <s> as i said a minute or so ago the authority will have control over mens minds rather than over their bodies <e> <s> i consider that to be a matter of very great concern <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord i fully understand that the intention behind the commission is that it should be the watchdog of the detained patient <e> <s> i believe that that is the phrase that is used in the governments notes <e> <s> my concern is whether at some future time secretaries of state perhaps yet unborn and certainly commissioners as yet unappointed may choose to view their duties in a slightly different light <e> <s> that is why i wish to make it incumbent upon the secretary of state to bring orders under clause before parliament <e> <s> however i certainly do not intend to press this amendment at this stage <e> <s> i wanted to get some idea of the governments feelings on the matter <e> <s> i shall consider with great care what the noble lord has said and i may well return to the matter at the report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee but i also should like to thank the noble lord for the way he has handled this rather complicated committee stage and also for the notes he has provided us with <e> <s> the arrangements which the government are proposing in order to implement the ruling of the european court of human rights are a package of which the schedule is the last and possibly the biggest part <e> <s> it is connected with the previous amendments nos <e> <s> and which have already been carried in the committee and i have absolutely no objection to it <e> <s> i just want to put down a marker at this stage to say that looking at the package in its totality i am still slightly unhappy about the way the rights of the unrestricted patients have been adversely affected in order to give the necessary ground for the new right for restricted patients but i should like to come back to that at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the phenomenon to which the question draws attention coupled at the same time with a very high rate of unemployment is due to the fact that we have a larger workforce that is to say people both in jobs and seeking jobs in relation to the population than any other european country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that there is a very good case for a home responsibility allowance for mothers whose earnings are affected by children under five who are not yet going to school <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for explaining the draft regulations but may i ask him to clarify paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i apologise to him for not having given him advance notice <e> <s> i am afraid i was unable to get the amendment drafted in time to put it down until yesterday <e> <s> i should also like to take the opportunity of thanking the noble lord for the notice which he has sent us of some of his later amendments which we are also now striving to digest <e>", "<cs> my lords i must go back to the beginning of my remarks and say that these amendments have not just been plucked out of the sky they were drafted after consultation with members of the nursing profession <e> <s> this is a very inappropriate subject for a kind of horse-trading over the number of hours that are most appropriate in such cases <e> <s> i suppose in economic terms one would call it a question of fine tuning <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton spoke of the unsuitability of a nursing officer as referred to in the second of the two amendments but i should have thought that that gave added weight to the amendment by requiring a quite specific limitation of the powers of junior nurses <e> <s> however as i have said it is a question of fine tuning as to whether it should be six three or four hours and at this stage i should like to take away the amendment and have another think about it <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the care and thought which he has given to this amendment <e> <s> if i may first turn to the noble lord lord avebury i understand his concern about the danger of labelling patients as untreatable when they may at a later date turn out to be treatable <e> <s> my concern is that no patient should be labelled as treatable when he is not treatable <e> <s> it is a very tricky path between the two extremes <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for pointing out that paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened as always with the greatest of interest to what the noble lord lord belstead had to say <e> <s> i take the point that the extension of the right to a tribunal hearing to the restricted patient is a fundamental extension of the patients rights <e> <s> but it was only conceded because it was required by the ruling under the european convention <e> <s> i must confess we seem to have come to a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i am afraid that i did not hear the noble lords intervention <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead took issue with me on my metaphor of the bus at the bus stop <e> <s> i should have thought that that analogy is a very accurate one <e> <s> the bill is the bus and it is at the moment at a bus stop in your lordships house <e> <s> this i should have thought would have been a good opportunity to load on another bit of necessary baggage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for his explanation of the governments view <e> <s> i think he is right that there is not a great deal between us on this <e> <s> it is perhaps merely a drafting question <e> <s> it seemed to me as it read that subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for his most sympathetic response <e> <s> we are aiming at the same thing we want to get it right and i appreciate that the minister finds himself in rather a quandary in having to decide <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that intervention my lords <e> <s> as there has been a considerable degree of feeling that we may have got it right with eight weeks i hope the government will be able to meet us and i look forward to seeing what they bring forward at the next stage <e> <s> meanwhile <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> he has spoken about the rules and no doubt they will be helpful but there is a certain amount of concern among tribunal members that they should have equal powers for unrestricted patients as they are to have under this bill for restricted patients <e> <s> i am not going to press this amendment and it is getting rather late in the evening <e> <s> to be frank with the noble lord i am not sure that i am entirely happy with it and at third reading i would like to table a further amendment which may be rather more ample in scope than this one <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for having once again addressed himself to this thorny issue with his usual care <e> <s> i would also say to the noble lord lord mottistone that we are talking about the rights of citizens not about the rights of another place <e> <s> i do not think it is out of order in your lordships house to talk about the citizens of this country and their rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord lord winstanley that what the government have done has made an improvement to the bill <e> <s> they have removed the offending subsection with its chilling statement of principle that consent shall not be required a dangerous principle to introduce in legislation despite the qualifying safeguards <e> <s> but it is worth pointing out that this is largely cosmetic because the same principle is reintroduced at a later stage in the clause <e> <s> i think it would have been better to restate the positive principle that consent shall be required save in certain emergencies which my amendment would have done <e> <s> it was not my intention to exclude normal nursing care and things like that but that cannot be remedied at this stage as i am not able to move that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i shall not be able to move the following amendment i wish to enter here a note of disagreement with the noble lord <e> <s> he certainly has improved the wording in so far as <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally i do not know whether i can speak for all my noble friends am in favour of lord hoosons amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that if the government later feel that something has been lost on the way which should not have been lost they have an opportunity to bring it back again <e> <s> we should have the opportunity of deciding on this very important issue in principle this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be guided by the noble lord in this instance and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords personally i should have thought that the word irreversible left in its purely neutral form would be better but i shall certainly <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment <e> <s> the government have seen their way in this part of the bill to define more closely and acceptably what the word competence means <e> <s> while we welcome that they have not gone far enough they have not followed on logically by conceding that the wishes of the patient to refuse treatment if he is competent should always be upheld <e> <s> that would have been the effect of the batch of four amendments which i would have moved if the governments rewording of this part of the bill had not made it impossible for them to be called <e> <s> it was intended to work together with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and were not called and in fact amendment no <e> <s> was met by the government <e> <s> so that leaves amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandys and glad to hear him state in stirring tones the governments adherence to the principle of independence for the second opinion <e> <s> that is what we hoped for <e> <s> the amendment also has managed to elicit for the first time i think a glimmering of how the government envisage the appointments being made <e> <s> the noble lord lord sandys has lifted a corner of the veil which until now has shrouded the machinery of the mental health act commission <e> <s> i shall want to read the specifics in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> many of the difficulties would have been avoided if the government had set out in a schedule in some clearly defined form the way in which they envisage the operation of the mental health act commission <e> <s> this amendment really arises from the fact that the government have been very coy about the commission and the reason given for this coyness is that it is a health authority appointed under the national health act <e> <s> i think that has led to this area almost of mystery which has shrouded the commission in the pages of this bill so in fact what is happening now is that we are gradually drawing from the government in piecemeal fashion a statement of their intentions as to the operation of the mental health act commission <e> <s> that in itself is a worthwhile operation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i quarrel slightly with his use of the word superfluous because i am in point of fact rather pleased by the answers which the amendment has elicited <e> <s> so for my purpose it has not been superfluous <e> <s> the delineations of the commission are becoming clearer before my eyes and i do not think that i should have had this clarity of vision if i had not tabled these amendments <e> <s> so i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has vouchsafed to tell us about his view of the commissions operations and activities <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for that exposition <e> <s> if my amendment is defective on the grounds that he suggests that in fact simply highlights what i was saying before that it was not appropriate to introduce this mental health act commission under the umbrella of the national health act because the commission is to have powers or certainly influence over the liberty of the subject in a way that no regional area health authority would ever have <e> <s> therefore it simply highlights the fact that the government have brought the mental health act commission to birth by the back door and through a procedure of which i personally disapprove <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining his position in terms which i must say i expected <e> <s> in general terms it all points very much in the direction which was taken by the noble lord lord wade in his speech on the desirability of incorporating the european convention on human rights into our domestic law which would automatically get rid of all these problems <e> <s> there is no doubt that there are problems of this sort pending at the moment and more are on the horizon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord the minister two questions which occur to me <e> <s> first has he any idea of the numbers involved <e> <s> secondly would he not agree that it is very unwise to persecute those who are striving to make the best of a bad job and to improve their prospects pending the introduction of a fairer and more rational system of education maintenance allowances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the care and thought with which he has replied as he always does <e> <s> it seems to be a case in which we shall have to agree to differ <e> <s> the noble lords view is that the european convention made it incumbent upon the government to behave in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply by the noble lord <e> <s> i am certainly not going to cross swords with him as regards the technical deficiency in the wording of the amendment <e> <s> however although it is certainly improper to quote oneself at an earlier stage i will if i may paraphrase what i said at committee stage which was to the following effect <e> <s> there is certainly no intention he <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady masham of ilton has been collecting voices from all sides of the house i should like to pledge our voice from this bench also <e> <s> from the debate it does seem to me that there is considerable doubt over whether correct powers do exist in the correct place <e> <s> i myself do not consider that circulars or guidelines are really sufficient in dealing with this very important matter <e> <s> i hope that if the noble baroness decides to divide the house your lordships will support her <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my thanks to the noble lords on the front bench opposite for the very great attention that they have given to our comments and worries about the bill and particularly for the letters that they have written to some of us on intricate matters <e> <s> i am also extremely glad to hear that lord winstanleys suggestion about the mental health panel of three members has actually been adopted by the government and will be introduced into the bill in another place <e> <s> it is extremely good news and introduces an inter-disciplinary element into the certification of capacity to consent which many of us have been very concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for his clear and thorough exposition of the origin purpose and effects of these draft regulations and this draft order <e> <s> as he has explained they are the outcome of the first quinquennial review of the relationship between occupational pension schemes whose beneficiaries are partly contracted out of the state scheme and the state scheme itself as provided in the act of which came into effect in april almost exactly five years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for his i think lord boyd-carpenters word was masterly introduction of this bill <e> <s> the noble lord is always magisterial <e> <s> the two principal schemes introduced by this bill are the new provisions for statutory sick pay and those relating to housing benefits <e> <s> i shall begin with the housing benefits with which we do not disagree in principle pass then to the sick pay arrangements on which we have very serious reservations and then touch briefly on an important opportunity the bill has missed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether a fresh date has been agreed with the spanish government for the opening of the frontier <e> <s> if so does he think that the frontier will indeed be opened on that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> our welcome i think rather depends on the relationship that the two new bodies are going to have a point made by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley <e> <s> the schools council after all was the schools council for curriculum and examinations <e> <s> in fact it was given a new constitution in march that was only four years ago and one wonders whether it is really necessary to change the arrangements so radically in such a short time <e> <s> no body is perfect of course and the statement refer to an elaborate network of committees but after all the schools council was concerned with both functions that is both curriculum and examination and it is quite possible that some of this elaboration may have been necessary <e>", "<cs> very briefly my lords i asked the noble lord whether the schools councils proposals for an i-level an intermediate level to run alongside and concurrently with a-levels was still under consideration <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord has made great play with the cost that would fall on the government as a result of this amendment and indeed of earlier amendments which i believe were moved earlier this afternoon although i was unable to be here would the noble lord agree that the social security advisory committee in its first report has estimated that the social security measures undertaken by the government since they came to office have saved something like billion on the social security bill <e> <s> we have also heard today that there has been a billion shortfall in the psbr <e> <s> therefore i do not think that the noble lord can really convincingly claim that some of these amendments that have been put forward which are socially right and desirable are necessarily too expensive to meet <e>", "<cs> i wish very strongly to support the noble lord lord banks in this amendment which he has outlined with his usual thoroughness <e> <s> in the other place there were debates at second reading and on report on this issue <e> <s> in the latter on th march <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady jeger has said there remains extremely little to add to what has been said by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment gives the government a chance to remedy both the injustice perpetrated in the bill by the non-incorporation of allowances for dependent children which were previously available and also to restore child benefit to its proper level <e> <s> this would be enormously popular and would go a long way towards reversing the governments poor record in respect of social security benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords the plight of elephant jobs has been most eloquently put by the noble lord lord wells-pestell and backed by the right reverend prelate and the noble lord lord byers has set the community enterprise programme in a slightly wider context <e> <s> among the main criteria listed for community enterprise schemes we find included <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask whether he is aware he has referred to the working party scheme that it will require a special interview with an administrative grade officer and not just a clerical grade officer and whether he expects no extra cost to arise from that <e> <s> furthermore is he not aware that the working party stated in paragraph that in their opinion those hospitals where a large number of patients were liable to proceed to stage interviews would be likely to have to take on additional staff whom the working party were unable to quantify and is this a satisfactory basis for a comprehensive scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the secretary of state said in another place that it is unlikely that the amount we shall receive back from hospital services will be less than million <e> <s> what weight is to be attached to the word back <e> <s> who is to get the money <e> <s> can the noble lord assure the house that this is not simply a backdoor cut in national health service funding <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that the past secretary of state mr jenkin and the present secretary of state mr fowler suggested at various times in speeches in another place that foreign visitors should simply take out insurance in their own countries against health risks <e> <s> while this might seem to be a reasonable proposal may i ask whether the government have thought about the difficulty of recovering charges from people who may be running out of money and will want to refer the matter to their insurers before paying <e> <s> has the minister thought of the likelihood of bad debts and the considerable administrative costs that could arise from these <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the idea of insurance has the noble lord taken into consideration the fact that health stamps for example might be sold over post office counters for variable periods of time <e> <s> if he is not attracted to that idea would it not be something that our own insurance market could take up for the benefit of the insurers in this country rather than overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i may say without exaggeration that we have had a very good debate <e> <s> that is often said but i think that on this occasion it is true <e> <s> i started by saying that i had some sense of occasion in introducing this motion and that has been diminished by no single speech <e> <s> we have had no bad speeches <e> <s> i know that we do not often have bad speeches in this house <e> <s> it does happen from time to time but did not this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the noble lord lord banks and very briefly indeed since he has made his exposition in his usual masterly way <e> <s> at the committee stage the noble lord lord trefgarne pointed us in the direction of child benefit as the proper vehicle for the solution of the problem <e> <s> then by setting himself against the child benefit vehicle the last time that we debated the matter at report stage he boxed himself into a corner that is to say back into the corner of dependency additions <e> <s> the noble lord cannot have it both ways <e> <s> if it cannot be done under child benefit then we shall have to go back to the dependency addition principle <e> <s> as the noble lord lord banks has pointed out if we do not go back to the dependency addition principle then we shall end up again with increased demands on supplementary benefit which is highly undesirable because it is now involving a great deal of work for which it was not originally designed <e> <s> on those grounds i should like to give my support and that of my party to the amendment which as the noble lord lord banks has said is a modest one <e>", "<cs> my lords i always feel on third readings of social security bills that we are coming to the end of a ritualistic dance <e> <s> we know exactly where we shall finish up at the end of the minuet <e> <s> i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord trefgarne on his speedy mastery of his new department and i should like to add my personal appreciation of the great courtesy that has been shown to me by the noble lord lord cullen <e> <s> i am sorry that he is not now in his place and hope that he will read the report tomorrow <e> <s> i saw he was wearing slightly festive dress so i hope that he has gone off to a celebration <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i declare an interest as a member of the wider share ownership council and then ask the noble lord whether the government will give serious consideration to introducing something along the lines of the french <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement of the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> although it is open to question whether this is a climb-down or a change of heart or a change of emphasis i do not propose to add my voice to the rather ungracious tone of the reception given to the statement by the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> i frankly welcome it <e> <s> the statement does refer to the views and the advice of the select committee on employment in another place and of the social security advisory committee <e> <s> it does not in so many words refer to the advice which emanated from all sides of your lordships house when we debated this very matter on th june only a few days ago <e> <s> but i was glad to note that the noble lord lord trefgarne referred to this debate and i think we can say with some confidence that it must have had some effect on the governments thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to begin by making an apology to the noble baroness lady lane-fox for the fact that it is i and not my noble friend lord banks who is intervening in this short debate <e> <s> he would have done it a great deal better than i but he has asked to be associated with what i am going to say <e> <s> he is absent simply owing to a longstanding engagement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for having introduced this motion and to lord plowdens committee who produced the report which is the subject <e> <s> it seems to me that lord tordoffs motion offers a useful and timely opportunity to debate the relationship between our national regional policy and the communitys regional policy embryonic though that may be <e> <s> on the national side we heard only the day before yesterday of the governments proposals for completing their reduction of the population covered by assisted-area status from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> it is clear that if resources are scarce they should be targeted where the need is greatest <e> <s> however this begs a number of questions <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will forgive me i am not sure we can accept his argument that this would cause a great deal of administrative delay of an expensive nature <e> <s> if an assessor has to exist in any case is there any reason why all the potential cases should not he sifted through to him <e> <s> obviously all those which do not require his attention could be put on one side <e> <s> this happens perfectly normally in your lordships own committees when documents from the eec are put into a sift some marked a some marked b some marked c i see no reason whatsoever why this should not happen in this case <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord oram referred to us on this bench and said quite correctly that my honourable friend mr bradley put down a per cent <e> <s> trigger amendment in another place which of course was not called i am afraid i have to tell him it does not mean we shall be able to support him on this per cent <e> <s> trigger <e> <s> there is a very considerable difference <e> <s> we consider this is too low <e> <s> also i cannot find anywhere in the noble lords amendment any limitation on the frequency of triggering <e> <s> therefore we might have a constant series of very disturbing <e>", "<cs> the clause which was tabled by mr bradley in another place which i have with me was entirely different in every respect or at any rate in many respects from the amendmen tabled in this <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount replies i wonder whether i may seek the advice of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> this amendment seems to me to introduce an element of policing the union rule book by statute <e> <s> i am not going to argue against the amendment on those grounds <e> <s> later in the committee stage i believe there will be areas where public policies should influence the union rule books <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble baroness in the amendment she has just moved may i say that i did a little research into the operation of the act <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn referred to the crock of gold <e> <s> he said that these was no crock of gold that we can go on juggling with these percentages and we would be extremely unlikely to get them right unless we brought them right down to per cent <e> <s> we do not agree with that <e> <s> as to the operation of the act which introduced the per cent <e> <s> threshold in discussion in standing committee g in another place on th march of this year it was elicited from mr waddington the under-secretary of state for employment that in fact two ballots had taken place under the provisions of the act <e> <s> in both cases there were just over people in the scope of the proposed agreements so we are talking about small workforces and some per cent <e> <s> or more voted in each case <e> <s> in both cases just under per cent <e> <s> of those eligible to vote voted in favour <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i was quoting a concrete instance <e> <s> the whole point of my remarks was to show that something marginally under was achieved and this gave rise to all sorts of undesirable results which had not been envisaged <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the noble earls point about the earlier intervention of my noble friend lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i do not think that there is here any inconsistency at all <e> <s> i came to your lordships chamber this afternoon thinking that there might be something in the comparative levels of award proposed under the bill and those awards usually made in regard to racial or sexual discrimination <e> <s> i had that in my mind <e> <s> however during the course of the debate i was convinced by both the noble earl opposite and by my noble friend lord harris that these issues were not strictly related and in that debate the noble earl and my noble friend lord harris carried me against the arguments advanced by the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e>", "<cs> before i decide what to do may i press the noble earl on one point i made to him <e> <s> would he undertake to consider before report stage looking at the question of the rungs on the ladder <e> <s> there are only four rungs in the noble earls ladder and there are five rungs in our ladder which we consider to be a little more flexible and more sensitive to the varying types of unions and varying types of membership <e> <s> can the noble earl give us a little encouragement on that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> before he presumes to lecture the alliance he may like to accept as i think he will have to that certainly in the perception of the general public in this country the divisions currently existing inside the labour party are far and away of a larger order of magnitude than any minor cracks there may appear to be in the alliance <e>", "<cs> one of the great advantages that have emerged from the committee stage is the noble lord lord mccarthy recommended his book <e>", "<cs> as my name appears above the amendment i wish to give it my warm support <e> <s> our party will produce a strong programme for industrial democracy and may even set up an industrial democracy agency with statutory powers but that is in the future a gleam in our eye <e> <s> in the meantime as the noble lord lord mottistone said the amendment is an ingenious way of introducing a small but positive step forward in the practice of industrial democracy in companies <e> <s> i support it because while lord mottistone thought we might not be ready and it was perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this bench thank the noble lord for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> we single out in the statement the reference to permanent new arrangements which we welcome in principle but we very much doubt whether permanent new arrangements can be successful outside the framework of a sensible national incomes policy <e> <s> we regret the disruption and the suffering which will be caused <e> <s> i should like to ask the government whether at this stage they have washed their hands of the matter <e> <s> is there not possibly a case for arbitration which the government have rather consistently set their face against <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord the minister for that reply may i ask him whether he read <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the number and distinction of the speakers to follow i am going to make a very short speech in support of the prayer <e> <s> in the first place the use of the special development order procedure in this case seems to me to be totally misconceived <e> <s> originally introduced for the purpose of overriding private interests for the public good in such developments as new towns and national parks already mentioned by the noble lord lord duncan-sandys this type of order is here being invoked for the very opposite purpose that is to override the public good for the private interests of a developer <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house whether the government accept in principle the idea put forward last night by the noble lord lord duncan-sandys for a special commission to consider the whole thamesside area <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider implementing the schools councils proposal for an intermediate or i-level to run alongside a-level <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his intervention <e> <s> in fact my name is not on the amendment but that of my noble friend lord aylestone is so i hope i may be taken as an acceptable substitute <e> <s> briefly throughout this bill we have been discussing the righting of certain wrongs and the imposition of further restrictions on the closed shop on immunities and on the definition of trade disputes <e> <s> this is the first time we have been able to discuss properly something positive something which is designed to avoid or to reduce such disputes in the first place <e> <s> the forerunner of this amendment came up at something like am on the last day of the committee stage when we had all rather run out of steam so i am delighted that the noble lord has brought it forward again at prime time when all our minds are fresh or at least fresher <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i too should like to thank the noble lord for his lucid and very brief introduction of the seven orders <e> <s> i should like to enter a mild note of complaint with regard to the explanatory note at the back of the social security benefits ups-rating order <e> <s> the explanatory note alludes to the report by the government actuary and refers to the command paper and where the number is normally given there is a blank within brackets <e> <s> so i was unable to obtain a copy of the government actuarys report in time for this evenings debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks with his great expertise has of course covered the most important points which arise from it but it would be helpful to your lordships if command papers numbers could be given in the explanatory notes <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench i also should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his rapid review of the principal regulations <e> <s> we agree on balance with the concept of a unified housing benefit <e> <s> as a result of the change to a direct waiver of rent and rates by local authorities people will not have to worry about getting into arrears or retaining money for rent at the expense of food or heating <e> <s> on the other hand they will not receive the rebate money and will thus lose a certain flexibility in the use of resources <e> <s> in a tight week it will no longer be possible to borrow from the rent to keep going <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to clear up a misconception which i think has been introduced into the debate by the noble lord lord oram when he referred to compulsory strike ballots <e> <s> if your lordships will read the amendment here you will see that there is no provision and no requirement on the secretary of state to order compulsory strike ballots <e>", "<cs> my lords may i associate myself and my absent friends from this bench with all the remarks that have been made concerning the marvellous back-up we have had in this house and the unfailing courtesy we have had from the government front bench during the course of the various stages of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly may i say that i am sure my noble friend lord aylestone will withdraw his somewhat jocular proposal for the abolition of another place if the labour party will withdraw its proposal for the abolition of this place <e> <s> i was encouraged by the speech of the noble lord lord molloy who praised the procedures of this house and the way in which this bill had been handled in it <e> <s> i have no doubt that he will lend his weight in his own partys councils to a revision of his partys view on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should simply like to refer to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we supported this opposition amendment in another place but one rather wonders why emergency applications under section are excluded <e> <s> speed may be of the essence in such cases and there is no reason why a social worker should have a veto over a psychiatrist <e> <s> but a subsequent interview with a social worker who may know the family background could be of considerable assistance to the doctor after an emergency admission <e> <s> i should be grateful for some clarification upon this point <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> refers to people remanded for assessment and amendment no <e> <s> to people remanded for treatment <e> <s> these amendments were sdp amendments in standing committee in another place <e> <s> as important issues of liberty are at stake the accused person should in my view be able to produce his own evidence for the court to balance against the rest particularly as our attempts in your lordships house to reduce the period of remand for assessment from to weeks were not successful <e> <s> twelve weeks is a long time if it eventually turns out that the patients mental condition is satisfactory and that a custodial sentence was inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add my support to the question put by the noble lord lord wallace as we too have been strongly in favour of legal aid for representation of patients before mental health review tribunals <e> <s> i was very glad to learn from the standing committee proceedings of nd april in another place of the noble and learned lords proposal to bring forward regulations under section a of the legal aid act as soon as possible <e> <s> in evidence on that day the representative of the lord chancellors office said that the lord chancellor hoped to bring forward regulations in the late summer or early autumn when the necessary consultations are complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> the governments new package is certainly an improvement in our view on old clause <e> <s> it is an improvement in presentation and an improvement in the organisation of material <e> <s> frankly the old clause had turned into a self-defeating maze <e> <s> the subject is of such importance as to warrant a whole section rather than one labyrinthine clause under the heading miscellaneous and supplementary which came after after care and correspondence of patients <e> <s> so far so good <e> <s> however i must enter one reservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord lord trefgarne whether he can perhaps help the house to help him <e> <s> it seems that the amendment which was passed in another place errs perhaps in an over-protective direction towards the informal patient <e> <s> of course we all accept that this kind of protection is required for a detained patient <e> <s> but there might be offered here a certain over-zealous protective covering <e> <s> i very much accept what the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has said that we do not want to lose the bill <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister give us any prospect of the matter being put to rights in the regulations or possibly in the code of practice which the mental health act commission is due to draw up <e> <s> would either of those routes be possible in order to eliminate the anomaly without our having to send the bill back to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord also spoke to amendment no which is the one that i wanted to touch on <e> <s> it provides that in the second year after it is established and then in every subsequent second year the mental health act commission shall publish a report <e> <s> in standing committee in another place that was changed to annual reports which i personally favour <e> <s> unfortunately that was overturned at report stage in the other place and so we now have biennial reports <e> <s> i still think and i hope the government will give consideration to this that there is a very strong case for having annual reports <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elton has been good enough to give some of the prehistory of this amendment <e> <s> i introduced two amendments one at committee stage and one at report stage <e> <s> they were in a slightly different form but did not find favour in your lordships house <e> <s> but then an amendment was tabled by my honourable friend mr mike thomas in standing committee in another place which was won <e> <s> so this very important step was pioneered by the sdp in another place and i am happy to say that in accordance with the spirit which has animated many of the proceedings concerned with this bill was carried with conservative support <e>", "<cs> my lords when the present government came to power their social policy could have been scribbled on the back of an envelope <e> <s> rolling back the frontiers of the state included and indeed largely depended on rolling back the welfare state <e> <s> welfare was seen as mollycoddling and general enfeeblement through handouts of personal initiative <e> <s> personal responsibility and self-help were to be applauded and encouraged <e> <s> the dispensing of welfare does not in the neo-classical economists view of the world create wealth <e> <s> first we need more wealth and then can we afford the frills <e> <s> that broadly speaking is what was scribbled on the envelope and the message has not changed much though there have had to be certain adjustments to emergency conditions such as the temporary short-time workers scheme and the expansion of special programmes for the young unemployed <e> <s> and the cost of unemployment has of course risen inexorably all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness allow me to intervene <e> <s> it was not my noble friend who said that our party was all things to all men it was the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in the debate on the queens speech at the previous session and the noble lord lord perry was making the point that this was no longer the case <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to be the first to congratulate the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> i say the first because i am sure that she will receive many more congratulations during the course of this debate <e> <s> she is the chairman of the manpower services commission committee for scotland and is very active in scottish affairs both secular and religious <e> <s> her knowledgeable and constructive contribution particularly in relation to education and training has given us a taste of something that i know that all of your lordships will want to be able to repeat again and i hope that the noble baroness will frequently give us the opportunity in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for having introduced this important debate <e> <s> i want to apologise to him in advance because i am afraid that i shall have to be absent from the chamber for an hour or so owing to a previous commitment but i shall certainly be back to hear the winding up speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he say a word about the quota scheme for employment and the governments response to the latest msc proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this bench would also like to thank the noble earl for repeating that statement <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl two or three questions <e> <s> have the government taken on board the recommendation of the committee of your lordships house that registration should be voluntary only for the first month and thereafter become compulsory <e> <s> have they given any consideration to our paragraphs and in which we recommended that voluntary registration should not lead to staff cuts for some of the reasons advanced by the noble lord lord rochester <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that per cent <e> <s> of the per cent <e> <s> referred in the question of the noble lord lord harris of high cross is in fact a repayment for a previous shortfall <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to express my gratitude and that of my noble colleagues to the noble lord lord banks for introducing this debate with his usual unrivalled command of this complex subject <e> <s> perhaps it is the very complexity of it that has deterred more people from putting their names down <e> <s> unemployment commanded speakers recently and disablement over a few days ago while the welfare state and social security has mustered only <e> <s> yet it would be a pity if this subject were always to be confined to a handful of regulars and i am delighted to see that the noble earl lord onslow for example has put down his name together with the noble lord lord harris of high cross

cable television <e> <s> perhaps i may direct her attention to that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for one brief moment <e> <s> he said that when calculating the number of people in the poverty trap there had been a tendency to exclude lone parents with two children <e> <s> surely if you get the case which i believe to be true that a woman can earn or a week and be no better off until she earns a week she is essentially if she is a lone parent with two children in the poverty trap <e> <s> therefore she does not work at all <e> <s> that is what the paper was talking about and that is one of the cases where she is saying that it is in the poverty trap and the government are saying that it is not in the poverty trap <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way again <e> <s> in his reference to the proposals i put forward i think he used the term vastly expensive <e> <s> in fact i was at some pains to explain that the interim proposals in our green paper are specifically designed to be feasible largely within existing resources and with only a very small charge on the psbr <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for explaining the order and the regulations <e> <s> i want to put one or two questions <e> <s> on the order in paragraph we read that the flat rate of contribution the voluntary rate is to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to write to me on the point that i raised about the class contributions and why they have been raised by the amount of approximately per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether any additional direct broadcasting to venezuela is planned for next year in view of the th anniversary of the birth of bolivar who of course came to england in and derived most of his political ideas from reading hobbes and locke <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may ask a supplementary question while in no way dissenting from what has been said by the noble lord lord byers will the government undertake to do everything in their power to see that the msc does not embark on a collision course with the local education authorities as collaboration is of the essence in this field <e>", "<cs> i too wish to add my name to the chorus of support <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness has shown great restraint in specifying three years <e> <s> parliament is criticised for requiring too many reports <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord wallace of coslany in this amendment <e> <s> looking at the schedule there is the phrase old age which is not defined disablement which is capable of definition and past or present mental disorder which is also capable of definition <e> <s> so one of the three main conditions

i take his point about the difficulty in keeping a register of all persons whose applications have been refused but would it not be possible to keep a smaller register of those who have had their application accepted and later cancelled <e> <s> those are the ones in which we are perhaps most interested <e>", "<cs> in his departmental consultation will the noble lord take care to draw the distinction which i strove to make between refusal of a licence which might be on technical grounds for example the unsuitability of a building and cancellation through malpractice <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken and to the noble lord lord trefgarne for his reply <e> <s> i must confess that i still feel that the government have not got it quite right <e> <s> i should like to stress that the main burden of my amendment was the recommendation for primary care committees at <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trefgarne is perfectly correct <e> <s> i was about to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i was interested in his remarks to the noble lord lord hunter <e> <s> he seems to have rather played into my hands when he confessed that it will be the district health

secretary of states patronage and this seems to be a further example of it <e>", "<cs> may i ask the exact scope of the phrase deliberate abandonment <e> <s> that seems to be very wide open <e> <s> i am merely asking for information <e> <s> is there any normally held view of what that means <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord answer just one point <e> <s> i take the point he made about the ring but let us take the case of an elderly person moving into care who has for example a daughter or a niece who is just setting up house <e> <s> if that elderly person gives to that daughter or niece some furniture to the value of let us say a few hundred pounds is that considered to be the deliberate disposal of assets <e>", "<cs> as there seems to be considerable feeling about this in the committee would the noble lord consider taking this clause away to see whether he could redraft it to take account of the points raised by the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith <e>", "<cs> my lord has the noble lord any figures that he can give the house on the results of the dhss fraud squads investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that the fraud squad were carrying out an investigation into

noble lord <e> <s> i take the point about the relative smallness of the lord chancellors department <e> <s> the noble lord has given the committee an assurance that the clerks will be involved purely in administrative matters that is as amanuenses and that the department plans a review of the new system after two or three years <e> <s> i think that two or three years may be a little long and those of us who are interested in these matters will certainly want to keep an eye on how the system is working <e> <s> in the meantime in the light of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely happy with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it seems to me that the procedure suggested by me would be perfectly adequate <e> <s> i do not want it to be thought at all by the committee that i am trying to interfere with the attendance allowance in fact i think its use should be extended and that is what i was striving to achieve <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said however on a review of the whole question of adjudication procedure probably it is not necessary for me to press this amendment at the moment <e> <s> i should like to read

to the matter <e> <s> but i reserve the right obviously to return to the matter on report stage subject to reading what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>",

parliamentary purposes but it will not be of much assistance to the ordinary beneficiary <e> <s> i hope that we can hear something from the noble lord about his departments plans in this respect <e>

areas <e> <s> may not failure to take up or stick to a course be due to some inadequacy in the design of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reference of the noble baroness to cultural

explained the order <e> <s> we particularly welcome the effects of the order on hedgerow protection <e> <s> it is always a difficult balance as we all know between agricultural and environmental interests but this seems to us to be a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i should like to associate ourselves with the remarks of the noble lord lord wigoder <e>

to put a considerable strain on their patience with us on our return <e> <s> in the meantime we wish them and all your lordships a very happy christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the noble lord lord glenarthur was kind enough to write to me recently saying that in april the standard rate of ssp at will be the same as the rate of sickness benefit payable to a man with a dependent wife and two children <e> <s> can she tell me whether the same ratio will apply to other groups of claimants and what the effects of tax will be on those groups of claimants <e>", "<cs> my lords it is abundantly clear what the purpose of the bill is and the means set out to achieve it <e> <s> it is also clear from what my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley has said that it is hard to disagree with the purposes for which the proposed grants might in the secretary of states view be used <e> <s> they include such unexceptionable projects as innovations and improvements in the curriculum pilot schemes in developing records of achievement the implementation of the recommendations of the cockcroft report desirable development in the management of the teacher force i am not quite sure what that means those are the secretary of states words but it sounds a good thing the support of special educational needs including the provision of micro-electronic aids for handicapped children and the encouragement of developments in information technology within non-advanced further education <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who were not previously very familiar with these matters are grateful to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his explanation of the purposes of the bill <e> <s> we understand from him that planning permission has not been required for development carried out by the crown itself and that it is not the intention of the bill to alter this principle <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he told me that the regional health authorities would

lord lord elton <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the noble earl for repeating that important statement <e> <s> it is a statement on training but it has important effects on education as well <e> <s> we are certainly not against central government initiatives in the national interest but we have some quite serious reservations about the constant whittling away of local education authority funds for government-favoured projects in schools and we also share to some extent the concern of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down could he comment on the national training authority and say whether it will consist simply of existing members of the manpower services commission or whether there will be some amplification of it to cover the various interests <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take up the noble earls remark that there is no additionality in the funding referred to in this statement that it is a straight switch of million from the local education authority account to the manpower services commissions account is it not a pity that these important initiatives have not received a little more pump priming from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl told us yesterday that some youths are now engaged on the youth training scheme and i believe that the governments original aim was does it not give a little latitude perhaps for some diversion of resources into a second year for some of these young people <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are also grateful to the noble earl for explaining i was about to say whisking through these regulations <e> <s> we are not of course discussing the substantive legislation but from the outset we on these benches have had very serious reservations about

children in real schools whose education obviously should not and cannot be disrupted <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> we certainly will not enter into a passage of arms on a statistical detail because i think basically we are both saying the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down in view of his remarks that there are no new resources for the

children progressing right through the schools the total number will grow to nearly <e> <s> is that no longer the governments objective <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for repeating this statement <e> <s> we should like to include our voices in the tributes that have been paid to the late sir arthur armitage whose social security advisory committee has done such valuable work <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to our debate <e> <s> we on these benches are grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for having introduced this important subject <e> <s> at the outset i should like to say that we the alliance parties can claim a proud record in this field <e> <s> it was a liberal member of parliament the honourable member for the isle of wight who promoted the housing homeless persons act which made it obligatory for local authorities to assist homeless families <e> <s> it was a liberal-controlled council in liverpool which was singled out for praise by the campaign for the homeless and rootless for its actions in that field <e> <s> only yesterday the honourable member for southwark and bermondsey mr

is included on the marshalled list at no <e> <s> <e> <s> i understand from the instruction we have had from the government that we may debate these two amendments together <e> <s> i am inclined to prefer the amendment which the noble baroness and her friends have put down to that put down in the names of my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley and myself because it is slightly more specific <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for that explanation if i understood it per cent <e> <s> like the noble lord lord stewart of fulham i should like tomorrow to look at what the noble earl has said <e> <s> but two points immediately come to mind <e> <s> the first concerns what the noble baroness lady cox said about there being no shortage of good ideas and that therefore there is not likely to be any shortfall in demands on the money and grants <e> <s> that would seem to me to be a very good reason for not rejecting the amendment just in case anything fell by the wayside <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider assisting doctors in this matter by bringing in the recommendations contained in section of dr greenfields report <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the difference between generic prescribing and generic substitution but would the noble lord not agree reverting to his previous answer that section which advocates generic substitution will be of very great assistance to doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some hesitation that i rise to speak in this debate among such a formidable array of local government experts mainly members of the labour party who are committed to the robust defence of the glc and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> the noble baroness to whom we are indebted for this debate has taken this survey as a text and prayed it in aid to some extent in support of this defence which she has advanced in very moderate terms <e> <s> she has said nothing intemperate <e> <s> however i hope she will forgive me if i do not follow her directly into the intricacies of different layers of local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness will give way for a second <e> <s> i do not doubt that there are other people apart from the labour party who are defending the glc <e> <s> i was simply referring to people who are in this chamber this evening and i think that the noble baroness will confirm that most of the participants in this debate are from the labour benches <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give the figure of the total number of unemployed claimants who have been claiming supplementary benefit for more than a year and how many children they are responsible for supporting <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate rises can he tell me about his use of the word disapplying <e> <s> i believe he referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is in order to stick to the noble baronesss question as printed on the order paper has the noble lord comparable figures for community health visits and family practitioner visits <e>", "<cs> my lords the gaps and shortcomings in our tax and benefits system in so far as it affects the blind have been tellingly demonstrated by my noble friend lord banks and by the noble baroness lady jeger and i do not want to repeat what they have said <e> <s> in some ways the blind persons acts and showed by the standards of those times a greater concern with the plight of blind people than we have since evinced for these were in effect blindness allowances or they provided blindness allowances with an age threshold <e> <s> these were repealed by the national assistance act which contained so far as i can see rather weaker provisions concerning welfare workshops meals and recreation and in any case these were not specific to the blind as they included the deaf and the dumb also <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord look carefully at my proposal for an addition under the mobility allowance bring it to the attention of his right <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and for the record may i ask whether i heard fall from his lips the statement that he did not approve of statutory obligations that local authorities would have extreme difficulty complying with <e> <s> in the light of certain legislation on the horizon is that not an interesting proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the most recent figures on the single homeless in london show that some are in hostels and some are trapped in very unsatisfactory bed and breakfast accommodation <e>",

on part-time earnings and how they are affected and to write to me about it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house when north sea oil production is expected to peak <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for explaining this order <e> <s> i simply want to ask him one question about article concerning the noise certificate to be carried <e> <s> article says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his attempt to clarify our understanding of this part of the bill <e> <s> it seems to me that he is still very largely relying upon the unlikelihood of certain events taking place <e> <s> these amendments are designed to plug the gap where something unlikely in his terms takes place <e> <s> it seems to me to be important to establish the principle which the noble baroness lady david was getting at that if only million or million are allocated in one year this is the only amount which is deducted from the totality of the rate support grant <e> <s> i take the noble earls point that this will build up but eventually we shall presumably get to a period in which the whole of the million or whatever it may be will be on offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to put my name to the amendment of the noble lord lord stewart but by some oversight it was not done <e> <s> i think the important point here is that this is not new money it is taken out of the common pot which is used for comprehensive education up and down the country and therefore it would be quite wrong to apply it to schemes in which selective examination is used <e>", "<cs> my lords in our view the noble baronesss new clause is an improvement on the bill <e> <s> in clause the bill reads <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all those who have spoken and to the noble lord lord campbell of croyin particular <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks this is really a question of balance and judgment <e> <s> the noble lord referred to greater restriction and to hampering the secretary of state <e> <s> the secretary of state would undoubtedly get a great deal of advice on the formation of a body of this sort and he might in fact appreciate some guidance in the bill <e>", "<cs> i was about to suggest to the noble lord lord campbell that if he removes subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcnair has already said this is a particularly appropriate debate in which to be able to congratulate the noble baroness lady seear on her election as leader of the liberal party in your lordships house <e> <s> i wish to convey to her our warm and fraternal congratulations <e> <s> the motion speaks of womens choices at work and at home but these are narrowed even further if a woman is suffering from ill health and they are

consultation into the secretary of states proceedings <e> <s> i think that the noble earl will probably recall that in the consultation paper which was issued by the department of education on th march the secretary of state made it quite clear that with regard to special education initiatives the proposals were intended to forge a new partnership between central and local government <e> <s> i hope that that intention has not been lost sight of <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment of the noble baroness goes some way towards achieving that <e> <s> it is a somewhat weaker amendment than those that were moved at previous stages <e> <s> but i think that it fulfils that recommendation on partnership which actually formed part of the governments own consultative document <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask whether he would not agree that the consultative document to which i referred described the proposals as a way of making the partnership between central and local government with regard to educational services more effective <e> <s> would he therefore not agree that it is reasonable to institute some modest machinery to make this possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in fact intend to follow the noble baronesss suggestion of reverting to the matter that i raised at report stage in my amendment which was designed to find out what might happen to any surplus money <e> <s> i carefully read the noble earls reply and i must say that on balance i thought that he largely satisfied my concern <e> <s> he also clarified what would happen to the carry-over of any money which had not been spent <e> <s> this was a useful exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour on a thursday evening your lordships will be relieved to hear that i have cut most of the decorative preamble from my speech <e> <s> but i cannot refrain from saying that this report for which we are so grateful to the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury and his subcommittee is one of the more important reports produced by the eec committee of your lordships house <e> <s> i do not say that all the other -odd red books produced by that committee have not had their importance and relevance but this draws on and refers back to others in the series and presents a coherent <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house whether this useful analytical tool is still in use in the treasury or whether the government are not interested in this type of analysis <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the question displays a rather parochial attitude to the teaching of our language <e> <s> should we not congratulate the bbc on having brought off a successful deal <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the hours that the noble lord has quoted be further reduced if there were fewer unemployed doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that patients often have to wait a long time to see an ent consultant only to be sent straight to the hearing aid department <e> <s> would it not be a good idea if the department encouraged the health authorities in the direction of direct referral by gps to the hearing aid department <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree

this bill do now pass <e> <s> in moving this i had hoped that the noble lord lord glenarthur would declare the governments hand on the bill during the debate on the amendment as we are still not fully apprised of the governments intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest interest to all that has been said by every speaker in this debate on the bill do now pass <e> <s> it seems to me that the objections which the noble lord lord glenarthur has adduced this evening were more precise and specific than those which he advanced when moving the governments earlier amendment at an earlier stage of the bill which was not carried <e> <s> it therefore seems to me to be regrettable as the noble baroness <e> <s> lady lockwood implied that the government did not come forward and clarify their position at an earlier date <e> <s> had that been the case we the sponsors and the government together might well have been able to come forward with an amendment that would have satisfied all the interested parties to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we all owe the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour a debt of gratitude for giving us the first opportunity to debate a document that was produced behind closed doors without any open consultation as the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos said <e> <s> this is no way to go about an important matter which involves both central and local government a number of different professions and the voluntary sector <e> <s> here i beg leave to disagree with the noble baroness who initiated the debate <e> <s> it cuts little ice for the

that reply may i say that i am not sure that the two issues are as separate as he makes out <e> <s> is it not the case that if the government wanted to save some to million a ready means was at hand without raising prescription charges <e> <s> is it not also the case that many hospitals which are cash limited are trying to achieve savings by limiting prescriptions to outpatients and patients on discharge to one to two weeks with a recommendation to gps to continue the treatment <e> <s> is this not a further reason for encouraging generic substitution to limit the open ended drug bill in the family practitioner sector <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that there is no mention at all of coercion in paragraph of the greenfield report that was the word that he used and would he not undertake <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that

department issued a paper favouring this kind of hospital <e> <s> will he confirm that there has been no reversal of his departments general policy on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would like to thank the noble lord for repeating this statement <e> <s> it is indeed encouraging that the secretary of state has responded to widespread pressure for an elected body for education in london <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady david asked is this a portent of things to come <e> <s> i attended a recent ilea public debate and it was quite clear from the comments of all the conservative members that they thought it would be impossible to combine the duties of ordinary borough council and joint education authority membership which must be virtually full time <e> <s>

amendment and to incorporate it into the bill <e> <s> it is true that at an earlier stage i suggested a slightly higher proportion of people with personal experience of disablement <e> <s> i think

of national health service spectacles under the general optical service <e> <s> this in effect busts up the national health service so far as optical care goes <e> <s> i should like to remind members of the committee that at the general election the prime minister pledged that the national health service was safe in her hands <e> <s> this is an integral part of the national health service <e> <s> it is therefore a very curious way of showing that the national health service is safe in the prime ministers hands <e>", "<cs> before he winds up the debate could i ask the noble lord for a clarification <e> <s> i thought he seemed to be implying that the people referred to in this amendment are likely to be covered under paragraph a <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i beg your pardon for not speaking clearly <e> <s> i said simply that i thought i heard the noble lord say that the people referred to in this amendment would be liable or likely to be covered under paragraph a <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this very useful debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton shared my anxieties but felt that the remedies do not need to be spelt out in the bill <e> <s> i am not entirely certain that i agree with him on that <e> <s> i spoke about the constant changes of pre-cataract glasses which might take place once a year but i forgot to mention the point the noble lord made about post-cataract glasses which are likely to need changing even more frequently until the right prescription is reached <e> <s> it seems to me that there has been sympathy for this amendment to all sides of your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble earls pardon <e> <s> clause simply refers to borrowing powers it does not state what the money is to be borrowed for <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i entirely agree with him because that goes back to a point he made earlier about the standard of assessment <e> <s> if it is merely to be the needs-based standard of assessment on the very low threshold written into the schedule we say that that is inadequate because as the noble lord lord ennals implies anyone slightly above that with a small occupational pension on top of the old-age pension immediately loses the whole of any subsidies that that person might expect to receive hence the poverty trap situation <e>", "<cs> then i assure the noble earl that he will find another amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord winds up the debate on the question of the deputising services is not the argument that the noble lord has just advanced equally an argument for accepting amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> at one point the noble lord said that the commercial services were already working well <e> <s> is it not the case that the minister recently had to issue new guidelines because he was so concerned about their malfunction <e> <s> he was trying to arrive through his new committees at a system of better monitoring of these services <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals has now provided him with a very handy amendment which will do precisely that and i wonder why the minister does not accept it <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness lady robson and the noble lord <e> <s> lord ennals have said it all <e> <s> there are only two further points that i should like to add <e> <s> the noble baroness lady robson has talked about the inevitable and natural delays in finding people for all these new jobs and finding the right people which perhaps is even more important <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ennals explains his interest in the new clause i wish to ask him if he can help me understand the case that <e>", "<cs> i should like to say from these benches that we certainly support the spirit of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord prys-davies but we have one or two reservations <e> <s> as the noble earl will be aware i shall later be proposing an amendment along the same lines which refers simply to nurses <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies wants to go a bit further he wants to have two nurses rather than one nurse <e> <s> i think probably that the noble baroness lady cox will be able to comment on this with greater expertise but i understand that there is a technical difficulty in the way in which he has phrased his requirements for a community nurse and a health visitor <e> <s> no doubt she will speak with greater expertise about that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for that <e> <s> that is helpful <e> <s> as he rightly says it only occurs in a small number of cases <e> <s> i think we will be satisfied with that and accept the noble lords word that this is the way that it will be done <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am disappointed <e> <s> as the noble baroness <e> <s> lady cox said this is a supremely uncontroversial amendment perhaps the most uncontroversial that has been moved so far in the whole of this committee stage <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ennals has pointed out we do not doubt the noble earls intentions but we do not know <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord ennals for his intervention and to the noble earl for that crumb of comfort <e> <s> however i hope that that crumb of comfort will become a little more like a proper cookie before we reach the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl talks about the growth of employment would be not agree that in fact there has been a growth in the labour force and that therefore the greater employment is not necessarily going to narrow the gap between those in employment and those who are unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i should like to support this amendment to which my name has been added <e> <s> at the last stage of the bill the noble lord lord bellwin spelt out some of his objections to what in shorthand i may call the priority groups amendment they were mainly financial objections <e> <s> but those objections do not help us to know how the governments own policy of care in the community is to be carried out <e> <s> i have said before and <e> <s> at the risk of boring your lordships i repeat that there is a contradiction between the governments policy to return suitable long-stay patients to the community thus making it possible to close uneconomic old hospitals and the constraints imposed on local authorities who have a large role to play in the implementation of this policy <e> <s> as i see it that is an essential contradiction between two branches or prongs of the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the figure of which i think the noble earl gave was in fact the throughput over a whole year whereas the number of young people actually in place on training schemes was something in the region of according to the manpower services commissions latest quarterly labour review <e> <s> would the noble earl like to comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will forgive me the word he used is entered <e> <s> some of them obviously left too <e> <s> will he look at the mscs latest quarterly labour review in which i think he will find a figure which approximates to the one i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not consider making a beginning by starting with those people who have been long-term unemployed for more than three years and who at april last numbered <e> <s> having taken care of those people would it not be possible then to move on to those who have been unemployed for between two and three years who at the same date numbered <e> <s> could the problem not the approached progressively in that manner <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the noble earl for repeating this extremely important statement <e> <s> we welcome the final decision to merge the gce and cse examinations after years of indecision <e> <s> it was always absurd that they partly overlapped but that the cse was always held in so much lower esteem <e> <s> i have one or two questions that i should like to ask the noble earl <e> <s> in the first place in reference to paragraph relating to the proposed distinction system for grades <e>", "<cs> there is also a subsidiary point here which i should like to make <e> <s> i mentioned it on second reading <e> <s> it was strongly the view of the royal college of general practitioners that it was desirable that the administrative career structure throughout the health service that is to say as between all types of health authority should be flexible so that people should be able to move from an administrative job with a family practitioner committee to one in a district health authority and vice versa <e> <s> if we are going to have difficulty about the transfer of employment from one type of body to another that desirable flexibility will be lost <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord glenarthur will bear that in mind when he comes to answer the noble lord lord ennals <e>", "<cs> i strongly support what the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has said <e> <s> indeed i am in total agreement with everything said by my noble friend lord banks <e> <s> there is only one point which i should like to raise <e> <s> the social security advisory committee has been referred to on a number of occasions in this debate <e> <s> i believe it was the noble lord lord campbell of croy who said that it was broadly supportive of the new scheme but that it had <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with what the noble lord lord banks has said <e> <s> the gneral response to the offer by the noble lord lord glenarthur shows that that is the way in which we should proceed prior to the report stage <e> <s> it might be helpful to the noble lord lord stallard if i make a comparison with what happened on the rates bill <e> <s> several of us had private consultations with the noble lord lord bellwin including the noble baroness lady faithfull to see whether the noble lord could meet us on a certain point <e> <s> the noble lord went a certain way but he did not completely satisfy us and so we later on the floor of the house had a very extended and very full debate and divided on an amendment of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> so the proper parliamentary process was not short-circuited at all <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> i have already said that i am not going to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> but it seems to me that even this brief discussion has turned up a number of problems to which we should address ourselves <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the care he has taken in answering this amendment <e> <s> i take on board some of the points he has made <e> <s> he said that industrial and war injuries cover a wide range of disabilities <e> <s> he said that any loss or impairment however incurred will be considered and that that will of course include the loss of mental faculty although the question of how we are to measure this still seems to me to be rather in the air <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> he says that per cent <e> <s> is sensible and reasonable hut of course it depends on ones interpretation of sensible and reasonable because it may vary a little bit <e> <s> i take his point that you can have per cent <e> <s> disablement as in the case of the blind where people are still able to work <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the question of our disagreement about the disablement line which is what we are talking about at the moment really takes us back to the earlier amendment on the establishment of better criteria <e> <s> if we could establish better criteria for certain groups which do not fit particularly well into the per cent <e> <s> category we might help to take care of the problem to some extent <e> <s> that is something as i have said that we should like to revert to at a later stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord banks has referred to the unstarred question which he introduced on nd february in your lordships house when we last had a debate on this subject to which i also made a modest contribution <e> <s> i think we must say to the noble baroness lady jeger that we are grateful to her for raising the matter again <e> <s> it is obviously not a matter that can be left to lie without any further action being taken <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness seemed to fear that it might not be in order for her to seek to insert this new clause in this bill before the committee <e> <s> i do not think that is the case at all <e> <s> social security bills are notoriously a ragbag of all sorts of measures and i do not think there is any impropriety here <e> <s> the difficulty that faces the noble baroness is that she is in the terms of her amendment asking the government to take the very large number of people off short-term and on to long-term supplementary benefit which is obviously a very expensive operation indeed <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down my suggestion to him was of those over who had been unemployed for three years and i think that they would work out cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the nobleviscount for giving me the information which his noble friend the noble earl lord gowrie was unable to give me off the cuff in a supplementary question which i put to him on th june at col although i must say that i do think that he ought to have had it up his sleeve <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble viscount two questions <e> <s> first to what do the government attribute the relatively poor take-up of a scheme designed originally for young people <e> <s> secondly are the government satisfied that there are sufficient mode b places for those who are not suitable for the mode a schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount able to tell us why there has been a decline in the number to at the end of may from the figure given by the manpower services commission at the end of april of <e> <s> does not the noble viscount agree that there has been a decline over the last two months of people on these schemes <e> <s> can the noble viscount give any explanation for this and would he not think that it might possibly be because of the decline in the number of mode b places <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene in a debate on the data protection bill in which i took no part but as the noble baroness lady faithfull has been kind enough to ask my support for her proposal i thought i should go into the matter a little <e> <s> it seems to me that if the government are intent on safeguarding the confidential information of the health professions they will have to ask themselves whether this phrase health professions is really adequate to the realities of the contemporary scene <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton will of course be aware that health authorities and social services departments are now intimately <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene briefly to say that i had drafted an amendment which was almost identical in terms to that of the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> i think his amendment is a slight improvement <e> <s> as soon as i saw his amendment on the marshalled list i immediately added my name <e>", "<cs> my lords we are reaching the end of a long debate and your lordships will be glad to hear that i have struck out large parts of my speech but i certainly cannot strike out the words that i wish to say to the noble lord lord wells-pestell in thanks for having moved this extremely necessary motion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has misinterpreted me <e> <s> the point of my intervention there was that beveridge foresaw that national assistance would actually decline as a proportion of total social security spending whereas in fact it has not <e> <s> it has constantly increased since his day <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that nurses accommodation is an important part of their working conditions <e> <s> would he undertake to do all that he can to see that no nurses accommodation is unnecessarily closed thus thrusting them on to the open property market at a higher price <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell the house how many small gp hospitals in the central london area have lost their casualty departments recently and what alternative arrangements have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord investigate the point raised in the supplementary question i asked and let me have an answer in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i think this is really squeezing the orange until the pips squeak <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur and the noble earl lord caithness have both referred in the most tender terms to vulnerable people but that is as far as they are prepared to go <e> <s> they say that keener competition will reduce general prices <e> <s> we must hope that they are right and it may well be so but we certainly cannot guarantee that that will be the case regarding the more complex and less mass-produced prescriptions <e> <s> the noble earl says that grants will not be restricted to people on supplementary benefit and that people on other forms of low income will be taken into consideration <e> <s> he then proposes setting up an extremely complicated system of assessment which i should have thought is simply taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few words too <e> <s> as the person who moved the original amendment in committee and who listened with great care and attention to the noble earls reply which i found unconvincing at the time i am delighted to be able to congratulate him on having seen the light <e> <s> it has always seemed to me to be absolutely incontestable for this very important and large section of the health professions that they should be included on fpcs as a statutory right <e> <s> the government have now acknowledged that and we congratulate them <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the noble baroness for having repeated this statement <e> <s> it really is a minimal response to the long and gruelling work of the review body <e> <s> it is a pity that the opportunity was not taken to give some statutory backing to the youth service <e> <s> that is the first failure of the statement <e> <s> as regards the detail of the statement and the experimental projects in managerial innovation can the noble baroness say whether additional resources will be provided for them <e> <s> the statement is not clear on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness be kind enough to write me about my question on the composition of the advisory bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble earl for explaining the regulations <e> <s> certainly the most noticeable thing about them is that the shopping list has become considerably longer than was envisaged when the government introduced the bill <e> <s> the question therefore arises whether the funds will be adequate to satisfy all these aspirations <e>", "<cs> my lords having supported the noble lord lord alport in committee i should like to do so again very briefly <e> <s> in my submission the <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to support the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> we come back to ilea again which under the governments proposals is to be accorded exactly the same treatment as the glc although the government have very different aims for both these bodies <e> <s> so that is the first inconsistency <e> <s> as the noble lord lord alport pointed out all ilea land and buildings are vested in the glc and many large education service contracts are entered into by the glc departments on behalf of ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply want very briefly indeed to support the noble lord lord ennals on this <e> <s> he has set out the position with great clarity <e> <s> he has mentioned the sum involved and the amendment he has moved would remove the retrospective character of the clause and prevent the government from making retrospective adjustments of remuneration to take account of discounts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with my noble friend lord banks in thanking the two minsters on the government front bench for the way in which they have handled the bill and for the courtesy that they have constantly shown to us although in the end we have not managed to make very much impression on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the number of unemployed doctors rose from in to in and that the number of unemployed female nurses rose from in to in <e> <s> is it not likely that this upward trend has been continuing <e> <s> would it not be helpful to revert to the practice of breaking down unemployment figures by occupation <e> <s> if we do not know the facts how can we possibly seek to reverse them <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble earl for introducing a less solemn and technical mood into this annual debate on the up-ratings <e> <s> i am afraid i have one or two slightly more technical questions that i should like to ask the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> in the first place both the noble baroness lady jeger and my noble friend lord banks have referred to

understand that an extension involving them would cost nothing like the astronomical figure which the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> i think it would be in the region of million <e>", "<cs> my lords

unemployed for three years <e> <s> they are in number i understand and this would cost in the region of million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest to the noble earl that the figure of people to

name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him why the government seem to be going back on the stronger commitment given by the secretary of state on th april in another place at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the noble lord lord winstanley suggested the government are thinking of cash limiting general practitioners is this not

assimilating a great deal of material in a rush <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether or not it is the case that the advisory body for research councils initially guaranteed level funding to the medical research council for but that the outturn in

government professing commitment to the pursuit of excellence are contributing to the brain drain unless of course they are to review their policies <e> <s> is it not the case that there are important commercial spin-offs from medical research as in the case of the promotion by seltec of monoclonal antibodies <e> <s> following what was said by the noble lord lord ennals will the noble earl reaffirm his undertaking to bring to the notice of the secretary of state the widespread concern about this matter which has been expressed on all sides of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down <e>", "<cs> would he not agree that that represents a cut in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to wish noble lords a very happy and well deserved recess <e> <s> we hope that noble lords on the other benches will not hold it against us that we were responsible for the debate this afternoon <e> <s> i think as the noble lord lord diamond said it has been well worth while <e> <s> finally we would like to associate ourselves with the remarks of the deputy chief whip about the staff <e> <s> we really could not function without them and we hope

ec <e> <s> would he not <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord seebohm for this excellent report and we also have been privileged to listen to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord young of graffham <e> <s> i am not worried about his lack of portfolio because i think it is probably exactly what is required to cover the span of activities which need to be drawn together and we are fortunate to have him in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the noble baroness refers to the relationship between voluntary welfare organisations and governmental and other public bodies <e> <s> before concentrating on that i think it is worth drawing attention to the very important and developing role of voluntary bodies in local economic development and job creation

understand that legislation will be required to bring these transistional arrangements into effect <e> <s> i also want to say that so far as i can see this does not help us on the specific point i am making about the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> all that is clear to me is that the procedure provided for in section can only operate if an authority applies for redetermination under subsection in which case charities can write to the secretary of state in support of their case <e> <s> however it appears that not a single rate-capped authority i have checked this today has applied for redetermination for the coming year <e> <s> so where does that leave charities which find their grant reduced or eliminated <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord also write to me about the specific question i asked him on the precise mechanism of the operation of section <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has told us that the authority for the new ilea will come in the abolition bill <e> <s> can he tell us what other details will come in the abolition bill <e> <s> shall we know about the numbers for each borough and the method of election <e> <s> does not this timing give the secretary of state time to issue a consultation document on these important matters that is the numbers of representatives from each borough whether there will be any co-opted members and the method of election

maintenance grants has been steadily eroded <e> <s> yet more and more students are being forced to use part of their maintenance money on buying books as a result of the enforced cutbacks in library purchases <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no mention in the gracious speech of social policy and this is not perhaps surprising if there is no legislation in this field on the way unless perhaps something is to come forward in the other measures <e> <s> however this does not excuse the government for their lack of interest in what my noble and learned friend lord wilson of langside has called the social fabric <e> <s> indeed the absence of concern for the grievous social problems facing the nation is what emerges so signally if one reads between the lines of the gracious speech <e>", "<cs>

nurses pharmacists are all wanting to help and to collaborate when they know what the governments thinking is and that in the meantime they are simply stalled <e> <s> finally will the noble lord undertake solemnly before the house that this green paper when it does finally emerge will not be a late sudden publication followed by a mere month or so for response and that a proper period for consultation will be given <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not accept that surely the point of a green paper is that it is green <e> <s> it does not have to be cast in concrete <e> <s> is it not the case that what we are expecting are the governments preliminary reactions in the whole of this very important sphere in order that those of us who are interested in that sphere and

there be such a delay on the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount perhaps undertake further consultation with the library committee <e> <s> some of us are not clear as to where

for debates of our own choosing <e> <s> fortunately the noble lord lord sherfield has been able to obtain an earlier date than we could have offered <e> <s> we congratulate him on that because there is real urgency in arousing the awareness of the public and of the government to the severe threat to our basic research base which could have very important implications in the future for the health and prosperity of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the withdrawal of the note discriminates against men because heavy coins do great damage to pocket linings <e> <s> does he not think that this is likely to lead to an extension of male handbags and in this case will male handbags be permitted in the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the

should remain a statutory obligation <e> <s> can he tell us whether he would have to bring in primary legislation in order to bring about this change <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that the voluntary agencies are better able to provide this service <e> <s> i ask him to read the very interesting briefing paper issued by the campaign for single homeless people char which says <e>", "<cs>

this temporary closure would have had to be had this windfall not appeared out of heaven and is it not the case that some people would have died as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not maintained that the increased costs to which the noble earl referred arise in some cases from the need to update the universitys programme and that if it does not get this money it will not be able to bring its programme up to date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply but may i ask her this

of to for post cataract or lenticular glasses as they are called and when the provisional scheme comes to an end and the national health provision is removed altogether they will then be faced with private charges for that type of spectacles in the region of to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that what she has announced to us is a very complicated means tested scheme <e> <s> as it is intended to be provisional and the government have announced that they intend to proceed to a system of vouchers will she represent to her right honourable friend the need for a higher value of voucher for complex lenses when a voucher scheme is introduced <e>", "<cs> as a footnote to what the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale said it is my recollection of our debates when the mental health amendment bill was going through the house that it was the intention to enfranchise the people to whom the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale referred <e> <s> i hope very much therefore that on this day when the noble lord the minister is so to speak on the bridge or perhaps on the tightrope between the two departments he will take advantage of this occasion to give sympathetic consideration

noble lord lord rodney not be found out of that amount <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness elaborate on her monosyllabic reply to me and indicate why the centres indicated by the noble lord

disappointing <e> <s> i think that some noble lords will resent the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to move the remaining five motions <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like

that not the reason for publishing it <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the two-week board and lodging limit for young persons seeking employment in certain areas is impossibly restrictive and should be increased to four or six <e>", "<cs> my lords the dominant mood not the only mood but the dominant mood to emerge from this long debate has been one of deep unease expressed on all sides of the house over this bill for which the government claim a mandate but which goes so much against the spirit of our constitution <e> <s> what appeared glibly in a few lines of a manifesto was turned into an ill-assorted ragbag of undemocratic procedures for which not even the claim of superior efficiency can be sustained <e>", "<cs> at this stage my lords <e> <s> i just want your lordships to be aware that something over million of grants to voluntary bodies doing social cultural and ethnic minority work of acknowledged value much more cheaply and effectively than could

in your lordships house and which i think comes within the general terms of the motion put down by the noble baroness to whom we are all extremely grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government lift the absurd ban on the import by british booksellers of books from the argentine <e> <s> this ban has absolutely no effect other than to prejudice the british book trade <e>", "<cs> my lords is

welcome as other noble lords have the noble baroness to the dispatch box to steer her first bill <e>", "<cs> when the secretary of state accepted the principle of an elected body for inner london education many of us rejoiced that the evident wishes of londoners had prevailed and that a proper vehicle was on offer for giving them effect <e> <s> the publication of the bill as the right reverend prelate the bishop of london has said dispelled that illusion for what is proposed here is subject to so many controls and restrictions that the new body will be little more than an agency of central government disguised under a democratic facade <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl leaves that point he gave an unequivocal yes to my question whether the authority could be abolished and the election suspended if all its powers were removed <e> <s> however that is not what i understood the noble lord lord campbell of alloway to say <e> <s> may we have clarification from the government front bench

suspended by order <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would he not agree that the action of this bill and the transport bill as he has outlined it to us and when it comes to us coupled with the precept control in this bill would be likely on the whole to diminish concessionary fares for elderly people <e> <s> that being the case do the government not agree that they ought to keep this area under review <e> <s> what would they do if they found that concessionary fares were being diminished across the country <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to everyone who has spoken in this short and

say to him quite clearly there is no intention here to create a further new centralised body <e>", "<cs> we should like to have seen the matter handled within the slightly wider context of the amendment which i moved before dinner but in view of the fact that that amendment fell we certainly wish this one well <e>", "<cs> the new clause proposed by the noble lord lord hayter particularly affects grants currently made by the glc or the metropolitan counties for charities working on a wider than borough or wider than district basis <e> <s> this is clearly the type of charity that will be most at risk after abolition of the upper-tier authorities <e> <s> the suggestion that the smaller councils freed of the precepts of their larger regional parasites will joyfully and collectively assume the responsibility for funding to a comparable extent existing london-wide and county-wide voluntary activities is frankly nave and can only be received with scepticism <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as regards general expenditure under clause i understood the noble lord to say that no limitation would be put on this by the secretary of state under subsection in

him to do it now <e>", "<cs> we must look at this exchange and some of the exchanges in the earlier debate <e> <s> as this is or would be government induced expenditure in other words there is a government carrot in it why should this type of expenditure be different from the urban aid where so much urban aid spending is disregarded for penalty purposes <e> <s> i do not see the difference <e>", "<cs> as my name is also on this amendment i just want to say that my understanding of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hunt is that it simply wants the mechanism to be in place <e>

the noble lord for example that two districts out of four in south yorkshire would be able to bounce their brethren into a scheme is not in fact the intention behind the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall read carefully what the noble lord says to see whether it embodies the assurances i hoped for and i may come back to this at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs>

of five <e> <s> that is because of the rounding upwards principle which would have to apply <e> <s> if the system proposed by the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour were adopted it would arise in

be a part iv body within the terms of the act <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter also argued that <e>", "<cs> my lords i requested the leave of the house <e> <s> will the house allow me a minute <e> <s> i shall pass on if i may simply from the points i was making concerning the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to the important points that the noble lord lord elton made <e>", "<cs> my lords that was my intention with the permission of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords if that ruling is accepted may i make the one point <e> <s> we shall then test the opinion of the house <e> <s> it was simply that the noble lord lord elton accused me of in effect reverting to the umbrella authority which would have covered the arts and recreation <e> <s> i want to assure him that all i have done is to take the parks amendment to which i spoke at committee stage and to add to it the green belt <e> <s> as regards what type of animal is proposed <e>", "<cs> it is already as i have said a part iv body subject to the finance provisions of clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage my noble friend lord hunt moved an earlier version of this amendment and he has asked me to say how much he regrets not being able to be here this afternoon <e> <s> on the earlier occasion he made out a very powerful case and the noble lord lord elton in his reply concentrated on the problem of trying to combine a mandatory scheme with a voluntary lead borough arrangement <e> <s> so long as a lead borough or district could be designated only with its consent there was no way of ensuring an effective scheme and if no lead borough was willing to be designated one could do nothing about it <e> <s> that problem it seems to me has now been dealt with in the amendment of the noble baroness lady faithfull by providing that if no lead borough comes forward to be designated the secretary of state shall himself perform the functions of a lead district until such a time as a borough is encouraged to come forward <e> <s> therefore the mandatory shall in the amendment can be made to apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i admire the ingenuity as always of the noble lord lord elton in presenting his arguments <e> <s> of course i accept that the government have already done a great deal more than they intended to do in the first place in the shape of transitional funding for certain projects <e> <s> i accept that county-wide and london-wide bodies are eligible under clause <e> <s> i would make no point against the richmond lead borough arrangement and i am very glad to hear that it is taking shape <e> <s> but i am saying and i find it difficult to go back on it that even successful voluntarism is going to need some help to prevent a sudden slump in perfectly good projects <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard this as a rather special occasion <e> <s> we have been able in one afternoon to enjoy no less than four notable maiden speeches which have blown a real breath of fresh air into the usually hermetic atmosphere of the social security fraternity in your lordships house <e> <s> it is rather strange that the government front bench should not have more supporters behind it <e> <s> you would have thought that they would have seen this as an important occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness seriously say that the government have no policy on the distribution of pharmacies across the country <e> <s> is it not the case that they declined from something like in to just over in <e> <s> since then there has been a slight rise <e> <s> if they fall back again is this not likely to be at the expense of rural populations and elderly people <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the amendment of the noble baroness points up a genuine cause for public concern <e> <s> in particular if there is any threat of manpower cuts in the fire service i think that that would give rise to very serious public concern especially in the light of recent experiences and worries felt by people about sports grounds <e>", "<cs> i recall the reference of the noble lord lord mottistone to this clause on second reading <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> there are not many microphones around here in this gap <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> it shows the beginnings of an awareness of the problems being created by the new rules <e> <s> to that extent as far as it goes we welcome it <e> <s> but one has to say that it seems to have been prompted by some tragic instances which have taken place over the last few weeks and which have been reported in the press <e>", "<cs> i have given notice of my intention to oppose the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> clause covers several pages of the bill <e> <s> it concerns the abatement of invalidity allowance and so on where the beneficiary is entitled to an additional component in the pension or to a guaranteed minimum pension <e> <s> the governments proposal in this bill is that in future invalidity pensioners will not be able to receive both the age addition and the earnings-related component on top of their basic pension <e> <s> in april per cent <e> <s> of all invalidity pensioners were receiving both additions <e> <s> that implied then that about claimants would be affected by the change and i understand that in fact the number now stands at <e> <s> therefore these claimants will lose the smaller of the two additions that they receive <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for answering the debate though i am disappointed that the government are not going to withdraw the clause when such very good reasons for doing so have been given from various quarters of the committee <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her rather tortuous argument which i shall of course read with the attention i always pay to her remarks <e> <s> just listening to what the noble baroness was reading out has not immediately convinced me <e> <s> she spoke about a measure of equality but it seems to me that the amendment is introducing a greater measure of equality than that which is in the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> it has always seemed incomprehensible to me that people on lower wages should be assumed to have fewer expenses when sick than people on higher wages <e> <s> sickness is sickness <e> <s> i should have thought that the demands on the family are exactly the same <e> <s> there is another severe defect in statutory sick pay <e> <s> as it is often lower than sickness benefit it means that more people are forced to rely on supplementary benefit <e> <s> that money will still have to be paid but it is coming from the supplementary benefit rather than from the sickness benefit source <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said that he thought that there was a misunderstanding on this point <e> <s> i doubt that because local authorities are well versed in these matters <e> <s> he referred to abuse and we agree with him for we do not want abuses <e> <s> i said at second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords as the consultative process came to an end on st may which is a month ago can the noble lord tell the house what proportion of the responses supported the ideas for reform set out in paragraphs and of the consultative document <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also should like to thank the noble lord for repeating this important statement <e> <s> we are certainly able to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what further sales are envisaged of large old psychiatric hospitals <e> <s> can she further give us an assurance that whatever is realised will be reinvested in facilities for the elderly the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that brief but not unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> i have had longer replies which have been less satisfactory <e> <s> i was glad to hear that it is the firm intention i think that those were the noble baronesss words of the secretary of state to make regulations and that before he does so he will consider what has been said on the matter in this house <e> <s> i look forward very much to the appearance of the regulations in due course <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the noble baroness has made her this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that one of the most alarming developments of the past years has been that the proportion of personal wealth tied up in house ownership pensions and life assurances has risen from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> is it not therefore rather a pity that the white paper has missed the opportunity to introduce some fiscal incentives for investment in small and family businesses along the lines for example of those at present afforded to housebuyers <e> <s> would it not be possible to look again at the business expansion scheme which has become a tax haven for the rich and to redesign it somewhat more in favour of the small businessman <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone agrees that something needs to be done about the use of wage rates but as my noble friend has indicated the removal of all young people under from any regulation is an extremely draconian measure <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that in paragraph of the governments white paper an alternative to the complete exclusion of young people was advanced this was to put an upper limit on the rate that the councils could set for them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that some special arrangements were agreed for the teaching hospitals within the rawp formula and is it not important that these should be honoured <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble baronesss pardon <e> <s> i simply asked whether it is not the case that some special arrangements were made for the teaching hospitals within the rawp formula and whether it is not of the greatest importance that these should be honoured <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the voluntarist approach which has been the governments line since the abolition of the industrial training boards but do not the figures that he has given the house show that that has turned out to be inadequate in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords surely as several noble lords have suggested homelessness begins at home <e> <s> can the noble baroness say what is the current position over the dhss resettlement units for the homeless which the government are planning to close and what progress if any has been made with voluntary bodies on filling the gap <e>", "<cs> my lords although this is a one clause bill designed to give legal effect in the united kingdom to the accession treaty of spain and portugal to the european community and is thus a routine measure it would be a pity for it to slip through your lordships house this afternoon without any sense of occasion <e> <s> the noble baroness has already ensured through her speech that this will not happen <e> <s> she has hailed it as an important event <e> <s> we on these benches agree with her and we welcome the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for giving us the opportunity to debate these important subjects which did not receive much attention in the debate on the loyal address <e> <s> there is always a great deal of argument accompanied by claims and counter-claims on health service expenditure <e> <s> the government say they are spending more than ever before in real terms <e> <s> the noble baroness has just been making such claims in her speech <e> <s> despite the bullish talk about spending at the macro level this happy scenario is all too frequently not reflected at the micro level <e> <s> for example the medway district stands at only per cent <e> <s> of its rawp spending targets <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals was talking about reform of rawp <e> <s> only this month a man who has had an accident at work is to go before a court and faces the loss of his house <e> <s> the reason is that he has been off work as a result of the accident and is awaiting an operation on his knee <e> <s> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try another microphone to see whether it picks me up better <e> <s> i was saying that in the medway district a man who had an accident at work is going before a court and faces the loss of his house because he has been off work as a result of the accident and is awaiting an operation on his knee <e> <s> the consultant cannot promise him anything better than a three-year wait <e> <s> so he can give no assurance to his mortgage company about a speedy return to work which might secure him a stay of execution <e> <s> in the same district a woman who needed to have a broken bone reset in her foot had her operation deferred six times because of pressures from emergencies motorway accidents and other casualties <e> <s> she was in constant pain throughout this long ordeal <e> <s> this is the reality of the health service in the medway towns whatever the rhetoric of the government <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government not aware of the <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by apologising to the noble baroness lady macleod of borve <e> <s> i should like to assure her that i was not intending to steal her thunder <e> <s> there was a confusing exchange of messages as to who had cancelled <e> <s> it was the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood and not herself <e> <s> could i also say to the noble baroness lady hooper in congratulating her on her first appearence in a winding-up speech that if she cannot hear me as happened when i spoke from this place in the last health debate will she please let me know and i shall move up higher <e> <s> there is a gap between the microphones here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend lady seear for giving us the opportunity for this debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord annan in his bracing speech made a number of strictures on the governance of higher education <e> <s> i see that he has a debate on this subject in the no day named list and we must hope that he gets a date for it so that we can discuss that further <e> <s> whatever the deficiencies to which he drew attention the main deficiency in higher education is that there is not enough of it as i think he recognised too <e> <s> there is <e>", "<cs> bracing my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords since the question mentions savings is it not the case that savings have been achieved by the bloomsbury health aurthority by the closure of whole wards in central london all over christmas <e> <s> what emergency measures will the government take to remedy that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the noble earl for explaining these proposed regulations <e> <s> we have no objection in <e>", "<cs> my lords normally on these issues the alliance speaks with one voice but i think that at christmas time it might perhaps be allowed two <e> <s> on behalf of the sdp i should like to wish noble lords of all parties and none a very happy christmas and an enjoyable recess <e> <s> this session to date has provided the whips with a fairly easy life as so much of the business has been concerned with issues of conscience on which traditionally we in the opposition parties have a free vote <e> <s> however this has not meant that debates have been any shorter because many of your lordships quite properly have extremely active consciences <e> <s> there have thus been some fairly late nights which our admirable staff have borne with their usual fortitude <e> <s> i should therefore like to extend to them our grateful thanks and warmest wishes for a very well earned christmas break <e> <s> we really depend on them so much that no occasion should be missed for acknowledging this debt <e> <s> as the chief whip said we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude and this is one occasion on which we agree with the government per cent <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord mcintosh whose amendment i certainly support is right not to specify absolutely that there should be national minimum standards laid down <e> <s> that indeed may not perhaps be the way to go about it but i should like to remind the noble earl of his speech on second reading on th january at col when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has mentioned additions which have been approved <e> <s> can she say how many applications were made <e> <s> can she also tell us how the balance between generic substances and branded drugs is working out under the new system <e>", "<cs> my lords the most substantial and controversial part of this bill is undoubtedly contained in part ii but before getting to grips with it i should like to make some brief comments and ask one or two questions on parts i iii and iv <e> <s> as regards the obligation to set a rate by st april we do not oppose that but as the noble lord referred to the existing obligation on precepting authorities to meet a deadline can he say whether they too will be covered by clause and if not should they not be so covered <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the code of the institute of public relations <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether they would have any protection under clause the same protection as is provided for the rating authority in case of emergency an epidemic or something of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches thank the minister for repeating the answer to the private notice question <e> <s> it is of course true that severe weather payments made under the old scheme received considerable criticism because the trigger could work at say minus degrees in plymouth but it would have to be minus degrees in scotland <e> <s> however what we have now appears to be worse <e> <s> according to yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again but since the noble lord assured me that those who make payments in advance by slot meter or by buying solid fuel are not necessarily <e>", "<cs> as my name is attached to the amendment it might be convenient if at this stage i gave the view on this matter from these benches <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what if anything the government are doing to help and encourage general practices to play a greater part in community medicine and in particular in relation to cervical cancer which i understand is now assuming endemic proportions <e>", "<cs> from these benches we should be happy with either of the two amendments <e> <s> the councils duty to inform the public on local government issues is threatened by the whole of clause <e> <s> ideally we should prefer to see the clause removed altogether <e> <s> however the committee has before it two proposals that go a long way to solving our difficulties <e>", "<cs> very briefly from these benches we should like to support the noble lord lord ardwick in his amendment <e> <s> it seems to us fairly important that clause should be widened to require the secretary of state to consult bodies representative of council employees <e> <s> these officers will have the difficult task of interpreting the code often in circumstances of high pressure from other officers from journalists and of course from their elected members as the noble lord lord ardwick has already explained <e>", "<cs> it is always dangerous for a layman to come between noble lords learned in the law but i still find it extremely difficult to understand if as the government argue no inflence can be exerted on the judiciary by the existence of a code what the value is of having a statutory based code at all <e> <s> we continue to argue that a professional self-regulatory code operated by the ipr in agreement with the local authority associations would do just as well <e>", "<cs> i did not in the least wish to impugn the good track record of the noble lord lord elton on tabling his amendments but i wished just to make sure that he keeps it up to the mark <e> <s> obviously we await the amendment with considerable expectation <e>", "<cs> with permission i shall try to answer the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> we are not wedded word by word to the amendment as it stands <e> <s> objection has been raised from other quarters which i also respect about the six-month period specified <e> <s> certainly we would not go to the stake for that <e> <s> it would be a matter for discussion <e> <s> also the figures that the noble baroness quoted are exactly the same as those that i have mentioned <e> <s> there is no dispute between us on that <e> <s> what we are talking about is perfecting the system or bringing it up to its maximum perfectibility given its very successful track record in the majority of cases <e> <s> i certainly do not dispute the figures with the noble baroness <e> <s> as for the wording of the clause that is something for discussion if the government will eventually take it up here or in some other vehicle <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord elton for his reply <e> <s> i have accepted the imperfections of the clause as drafted <e> <s> i take the point that there is no right of appeal which seems to be wrong <e> <s> i am also fully aware that the select committee of another place is due to report shortly and that widdicombe is also investigating the whole question of the right of challenge of the citizen <e> <s> obviously we shall look forward with interest to both of those reports <e> <s> however if we see no action in the offing we shall be inclined to come back to this in some form or another <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall convey that to my noble friend lord winstanley <e> <s> the noble lord will no doubt convey the same sentiment to his noble friend lord sandford <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what arrangements the government are making to monitor the results of their television campaign which i think is separate from the school video campaign but which may also be supposed to be directed at young people <e> <s> have they any results yet from that <e>", "<cs> my lords we all start i think from the common ground that we are in the throes of a drug epidemic which is fuelled and spread by the ready availability of illegal narcotics and a vulnerable population <e> <s> both supply and demand factors are abundantly present <e> <s> on the law enforcement side the government made some very foolish cuts in the customs and excise service prior to which may have been partly but only partly repaired <e> <s> that is important because although seizures by the police account for more than three-quarters of the total numbers of seizures the customs account for per cent <e> <s> of the volume seized which is of course the more significant measurement <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house whether any help is being given to people after cataract operations when they may need replacements for their glasses two or three times within a year <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> we welcome the fact that there will be no move on dental charges <e> <s> the last uprating was sufficient to constitute a serious deterrent to the use of dental services <e> <s> there has been some evidence that the present level of charges has been detrimental to preventive dental treatment <e> <s> we think that that decision is right <e> <s> for the residue of the optical service which applies only to children and supplementary benefit beneficiaries it seems also right that charges should be frozen <e> <s> we agree with the noble lord lord ennals on both those points <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord ritchie said at the beginning of the debate there is a great deal that we can welcome in the bill although it seems to me to be full of flaws and to suffer from serious omissions and so i venture to think that it will attract rather a lot of amendments <e> <s> we certainly welcome the reconstitution of governing bodies so that no single element will predominate <e> <s> the aim is clearly the depoliticisation of education with which we agree <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and before the noble lord lord hayter decides whether he is going to divide the house on this amendment perhaps i may ask one or two questions <e> <s> as the minister knows it has been common for district councils to make their voice heard on matters that may not be strictly related to their functions such as public transport local hospital services water and sewerage which the noble lord himself mentioned and others <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord rises to reply is it the case as the noble lord lord mottistone has suggested that a voluntary organisation whose aims and objectives are to campaign for a certain purpose and which receives let us say as the <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for this amendment which i think comes in response to amendments along the same lines moved by my noble friend lord winstanley during the committee stage under clause and a similar amendment which i moved under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord elton for his thorough response to the amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lords lord sandford and lord mottistone who supported it <e> <s> the noble lord lord sandford from the great background of his knowledge gave some much more concrete instances of legitimate activities which local authorities would be inhibited from carrying on if this amendment was not passed <e> <s> i think that was a very useful contribution to the debate <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mcintosh has said this is not an entirely new idea <e> <s> indeed the allliance included it in its manifesto for elections to the inner london education authority a copy of which i have before me <e> <s> so i am not vying with the noble lord for the parentage of the suggestion but <e>", "<cs> after an extremely interesting debate and before the noble lord decides what to do about the amendment i should perhaps say that i feel that a number of valid points have been raised <e> <s> i would have preferred to go back to something nearer to the noble lord lord taylors distribution of membership of governing bodies <e> <s> i am still concerned about the proportion allocated to teachers in the governments proposals in the bill <e> <s> i feel that this is a matter to which we could come back at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness for not having directed my remarks to her instead of to the noble earl at her side i was unaware that she was going to answer the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful for her remarks <e> <s> i turn first to the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh although i should say at this point that i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> i shall certainly consider the noble lords point before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh mentioned the swann report <e> <s> it is entirely correct that swann was very concerned about this matter but i think i am right in saying that swann made no specific recommendation and was unable to reach a specific conclusion on how to take care of it <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beloff pointed out the amendment as drafted is extremely vague and i accept that it is a probing amendment <e> <s> for example what is the local community and what are ethnic minorities <e> <s> do they include irish people <e>", "<cs> this is a happy occasion and i am extremely grateful to the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> i knew that his heart was in the right place and that it would show sooner or later and it has shown on this amendment <e> <s> i would agree with him that it will be necessary to write in some mechanism to draw the line between practicality and impracticality in the case of the short-term-stay hospital schools and the long-term-stay hospital schools <e> <s> i have no doubt that the government with their ingenuity will be able to do that <e>", "<cs> if i may add to what has been said by the noble lord lord renton it seems to be perfectly clear that subsection is concerned with regulations that <e>", "<cs> just as the noble baroness was not surprised that i moved the amendment in the terms that i did i am not surprised that she has advised the committee to reject it <e> <s> i did not intend to press it at this late hour i simply wanted to air it <e> <s> i want to discuss the matter again with my noble friends before we get to the report stage of the bill and on those grounds i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am in agreement with the noble lord lord mcintosh in that respect <e> <s> when he explained the reasons behind the wording of amendment no <e> <s> he won me round to it <e> <s> i am bound to say that it seems better to take account both of avoiding expense where that expense is unnecessary and casting ones net wide enough to make sure that one gets everybody in <e> <s> in the light of this debate and perhaps after further discussions with the noble lords lord mcintosh and lord renton i may return to this point at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to associate myself very strongly with the remarks of the government chief whip and the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> we would wish particularly to thank the staff for all their endeavours on our behalf and to wish them a very well-earned and peaceful recess <e> <s> i should like also to wish noble lords of all parties and of none a very restful and happy recess in preparation for the rigours of which we have been warned by the government chief whip <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any reason why the institute should not retain its present status but also run a trading account <e> <s> furthermore if the government are determined to go down the privatisation road will they consider a management buy-out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to the noble earl but could he answer my first supplementary which was as to whether there was any reason why the institute as at present constituted should not run a trading account <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the noble lord the chief whip will tomorrow table the motion necessary for the time limitation <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord renton it has been agreed i understand through the usual channels that amendment no <e> <s> a should be discussed with amentments and a <e> <s> this has been circulated to all the party officers <e>", "<cs> if she will forgive me the name of the noble baroness appears on the circulation list of the document i am looking at <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the national health service amendment bill now before parliament provide an excellent vehicle for extending its provisions slightly to do precisely what the noble baroness suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords after the recent cold spell in february can the noble baroness tell the house whether the government are to review their arrangements for special emergency payments in such situations <e> <s> i have read the guidelines <e> <s> they are extremely confusing and give rise to random results <e> <s> will the government take that to heart and look at their guidelines <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment of the noble baroness although it has to be said that it has resource implications <e> <s> that is probably the argument we shall hear from the government <e> <s> however even if the government do tell us about the resource implications i hope that they will not for that reason dismiss the idea behind the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too am puzzled by the noble baronesss reply <e> <s> i always appreciate her clarity her exposition and the charm of her delivery but i feel that the governments position here is extraordinarily weak <e> <s> i am not striving to move against the freedom of governing bodies to take the decisions that it is appropriate for them to take and that the bill wants them to take <e> <s> but i find it very difficult to understand how it can be argued that you can have some schools in the country where there should be an appeals procedure laid down in the articles of government which might vary from one set of articles to another set of articles <e> <s> indeed there is nothing in the bill which prescribes that there needs to be any appeals procedure at all and that on my reading of clause is purely optional <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for that <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for his support <e> <s> in view of what the noble baroness has just said i do not think it would be right for me to press the amendment at this stage because i think that possibly a gleam of light is now i entering into the governments thinking on the matter <e> <s> we may hope that they will come forward and <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for giving me the governments position which he has explained very fairly <e> <s> i must confess that i am still left with some worry <e> <s> the noble earl says that needs vary from time to time and from area to area which is no doubt true but in my view it does not in fact take into account the desirability of giving all teachers the right to in-service training in the interests of their own career development and their own effectiveness <e>", "<cs> i am not out of sympathy with the spirit of the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> she has spoken correctly of the increased responsibilities that are likely to devolve on clerks under the bill <e> <s> i am slightly worried however about the accessibility of clerks <e> <s> in my experience clerks to governing bodies tend to be professionals who have to be approached through their office maybe a solicitors office <e> <s> it may not always be possible to get through and some delay may be experienced <e> <s> i am not casting any aspersions but it is i believe a fact <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness envisages that there would be some obligation of accessibility or availability on clerks in conjunction with the statutory remuneration that she proposes for them <e>", "<cs> i have greatly admired most of the noble lord lord mcintoshs contributions to the discussions at this committee stage of the bill and i have agreed with a great deal of what he had to say <e> <s> on this occasion i am not sure that i go along with him <e> <s> it seems to me that he has pointed to the existing clause <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the noble baroness for repeating this long-awaited statement <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that it has been two years in the pipeline so certainly we were entitled to expect something which we could get our teeth into and we seem to have received it <e> <s> i understand that there is a joke going round in the medical profession that this green paper is referred to as a gangrenous

concept <e> <s> i do not think that that can be put down as trivial <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> he has pointed out that there has been a great deal of discussion of the idea of appraisal in principle and he has pointed to various discussion and background papers <e> <s> however we are now in the area of a statute and that statute is extremely sketchy in this respect <e> <s> therefore although i am grateful for the noble earls attempt to satisfy me i am bound to say that i do not think that he has done so and i am inclined to test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for the care he has taken in his reply <e> <s> i have accepted from the outset the technical deficiency of the amendment <e> <s> the noble earl seemed to be concerned about the possibility of a sheep and goats result from this amendment in that it would be difficult to distinguish between those parents groups which should be assisted and those which should not <e> <s> it could be done by establishing special funds for special areas where there is a genuine crisis which is i think almost universally acknowledged particularly in the inner city areas <e> <s> you could do it on an urban aid basis <e> <s> therefore there would not be discrimination between those and perhaps more prosperous middle-class areas <e>", "<cs> i am of course grateful to the noble baroness for trying to satisfy the point that i made but she has not done so <e> <s> i feel almost as indignant as did the noble lord lord mcintosh on the related amendment that he moved earlier our <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it has been agreed on all sides of the house that my noble friend lady seear has done us a service in providing us with the opportunity for this debate and not least in providing an occasion for my noble friend lord kirkwood to make his maiden speech which he did with lucidity and authority <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has referred to the business expansion scheme can he say what changes have been made to it and with what result <e> <s> is it not the case that there was some criticism of it in the earlier phases as being not adequately funded <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that proposals very similar to this were advanced in the liberal yellow book of <e> <s> have not the government taken rather a long time to catch up <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i was right in understanding the noble earl to say that the government would listen to representations from the local authority associations on adequate

would also like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> i must say that i agree with the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl reply to the question i asked on the subject of research <e> <s> who will take positive judgments on the quality of research and on the balance of that research as between basic and applied <e> <s> will the judgments be taken by civil servants or by paying attention to the guidance given by the advisory body <e> <s> with respect to the noble earl he did not pick up that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i often find myself in agreement with the right reverend prelate but i do not on this occasion <e> <s> as i understand it and the noble earl will correct me if i am wrong i think that the act allows for governors at plus the age which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is advancing in colleges of further education <e> <s> there therefore seems to be no good grounds for discriminating against those of that age who remain inside the secondary system <e>", "<cs> my lords it is appropriate that at this stage i should express my thanks to the noble earl for taking to heart the point that i made both at second reading and at committee stage about the position of parents of children at maintained boarding schools who were previously excluded from the right to elect their parent governors <e>", "<cs> my lords before making up my mind perhaps i could ask the noble baroness one thing with the leave of the house <e> <s> i take her point that this is written into the bill but you have to know your way around the bill pretty well to find out where you are covered if you want to use the proportional representation system <e> <s> that is why i suggested that it he written more prominently on the face of the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for the tiny way that she seemed to come towards me <e> <s> i should like to assure her that i do not want to get pr a bad name so i am not going to divide the house at this stage <e> <s> but i shall read the debate and perhaps come to a final decision at the last stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i ought to explain that i did not move my amendment no <e> <s> because i withdrew it really in favour of lord mcintoshs amendment no <e> <s> which on consideration after reading the debate at committee stage i think is an improvement <e> <s> my amendment at that stage was for an obligatory postal ballot but considerations of expense were indicated and as the noble lord himself said on that occasion obviously parents coming together at meetings can clearly vote on the spot in a secret ballot <e> <s> therefore it seems that the postal ballot should be there as an alternative for those who could not get to the meeting <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has come up with the right answer <e> <s> i cannot see what the government have got against it and i very much hope that they will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i detect that she seems to be giving me half a loaf <e> <s> obviously i shall want to look carefully at what she has said <e> <s> it certainly was not my intention to press this amendment at this time of night and she has fulfilled exactly what i hoped the government would do which was to let me know where they stood on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i shall certainly withdraw the amendment but not with any undertaking that i shall not come back <e> <s> i find it very surprising that the noble baroness should use the word superfluous when the experience of parents has been extremely adverse in these matters over a long period of time <e> <s> i found that an odd adjective to use <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is anyone in the chamber tonight or in the house if it were fuller who would disagree with the absolute requirement of freedom of speech particularly on a university campus <e> <s> therefore obviously all right-minded people will be in sympathy with the intention of the amendment <e> <s> the only reason i rise is to query whether in fact it is really cast in exactly the right form <e> <s> i refer particularly to the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord shepherd replies may i ask the noble lord the chief whip whether in that case the government will undertake to carry out full consultations before redrafting any clause to be presented in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that <e> <s> i do not think that one can describe it as a blueprint if one is simply trying to establish a very broad framework within which certain procedures ought to happen <e> <s> as drafted local authorities would be able to establish their own appeals procedures <e> <s> there is no rigid system which is set down in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> my understanding is that at present the costs of training educational psychologists are fully recoverable on a per cent <e> <s> basis under the act and that that arrangement is threatened by the current bill <e> <s> i fully understand the desire for local authorities to have a reasonable degree of decentralised decision making in this matter <e> <s> however i should like to remind the noble baroness of a letter written by the british psychological society to sir keith joseph when he was secretary of state <e> <s> the letter was written on th april and in it they urged on sir keith a number of considerations which i hope very much the new secretary of state when he comes to review the matter will take very seriously into consideration <e> <s> among their submissions was the following point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i must confess that i am not entirely happy <e> <s> certainly the experience of parent groups has not been as happy as the answer of the noble baroness would lead one to suppose <e> <s> they have found a lot of obstruction on this matter <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the secretary of state will not approve proposals when proper consultation has not taken place but that is of little comfort to parents who are not privy to the mind of the secretary of state or to the advice that he has received <e> <s> i agree that we are possibly entering a slightly new ball game with the recent coming into operation of the local government access to information act <e> <s> but i hope very much that the government will keep this matter in mind <e> <s> it is all very well to say that the high court decision has supported the parents contention that they have a right to this information <e> <s> legal proceedings are extremely expensive as i have said on a number of occasions and in many cases are beyond the means of the interested parties concerned <e> <s> i do not think that is a great deal of help to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> on those grounds i shall not press the amendment this evening <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long and very thorough debate and i do not want to go over all the ground again <e> <s> i shall try to summarise our overall view and put down some markers for committee stage <e> <s> i believe that there will be a lot of amendments and if the government frown on this and mutter about sitting into august or a long overspill they should rethink their programme and not bring so much contentious legislation before us in one session <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say what if anything his department is doing towards the sponsoring of training in languages which is surely of the essence as regards the tourist industry <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the answer in the form of a statement but frankly this does not take us very much further than the press reports that we were all able to read this morning in the national press <e> <s> the statement that the noble baroness has just repeated on mr paiges resignation vindicates the argument that we advanced from day one that it was most ill-advised to go for the full implementation of the new management structure on a nationwide scale without a prior pilot scheme in one or more regions <e> <s> this is a point we made at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness has accused me of making a mountain out of a molehill does she agree that the best course for demonstrating whether or not that is so would be to hold an inquiry and see what comes out of it <e>", "<cs> i think we are in a rather unsatisfactory situation as the noble lord <e> <s> lord williams of elvel has just underlined <e> <s> the noble baroness in her reply talked about the intention to use the powers in paragraphs or that regulations were likely to do this that or the other and that unit trusts and other types of institutions might qualify <e> <s> if they did qualify they would be subject to the existing protections which apply to their operations <e> <s> the noble baroness admitted that the occupational pensions board does not have sufficient powers or staff at present and they would have to be increased i do not know whether that is mentioned in the explanatory and financial memorandum <e> <s> she referred also to the financial services bill and said one reason why it was necessary to leave all these regulations so vague is that <e>", "<cs> i must say that i still find this situation deeply unsatisfactory <e> <s> what the noble baroness is asking us to accept is a long stop which is not in statute but in regulation and at the entire discretion of the secretary of state <e> <s> i think that is most unsatisfactory <e> <s> for example if the financial services bill comes to us with a provision for a cooling-off period to be only days and we think it would be more appropriate to have or days in this bill we cannot have that because it is not in the statute and we are dependent upon the secretary of states good nature for him to come along at some later stage and introduce this <e> <s> i really think this a very unsatisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> i revert to one or two of the anxieties that i expressed on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble baroness has told the committee that it is the intention of her amendment to beef up the occupational pensions board for those new responsibilities but some doubts must remain as to whether it is the only appropriate body to be active in that area and whether the securities and investments board is not a more appropriate watchdog <e> <s> even with the proposals of the noble baroness one wonders whether the opb has sufficient muscle to do what is expected of it in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble baroness a question <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to the consultative proposals that will be issued later on <e>", "<cs> i should like to seek some clarification from the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> the suggestion put forward certainly by the national association of pension funds and other interests is that this clause is a welcome simplification <e> <s> however i am informed that the intended simplification will not be achieved unless the clause applies retrospectively to th april and that is because the conditions are most arduous where early leavers exercise options to take a transfer or a buy-out or where schemes are required to notify rule amendments in accordance with section of the pensions act <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i should like to support this amendment because it brings us back to the area of consumer protection to which i was referring when earlier we discussed schedule <e> <s> as written this clause is purely permissive <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides what to do with her amendments i am rather inclined to stiffen her resolve <e>", "<cs> i shall move along to the end of the bench and perhaps the noble baroness can hear me better <e> <s> i will remember that in future and move to the end of the bench <e>", "<cs> did the noble baroness say that was the maximum penalty <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what to do with his amendment perhaps i may ask the noble baroness to clarify one point <e> <s> she is very much attached to freedom of choice and i am much in agreement with her in most circumstances <e> <s> the amendment of my noble friend lord banks would give members of contracted out occupational schemes the capacity to make additional voluntary contributions to a personal pension plan that is not contracted out that is to a different scheme <e> <s> that would seem to me by definition to be an extension of choice <e> <s> however i believe that i heard the noble baroness say that in the last finance bill those avcs could only be made within the existing scheme <e> <s> that would seem to be a narrowing of choice and i should like clarification as to whether that is the case <e> <s> if it is then it does not seem desirable and amendment no <e> <s> of my noble friend lord banks does seem to be desirable <e>", "<cs> on these benches we should like to support the noble baroness on this amendment and the categories which she wishes to exclude <e> <s> it seems to me particularly important that if one is to abolish the best-of--years rule one must take into account those who have very low earnings or no earnings or are in other special situations <e> <s> it seems to me to be entirely inequitable that those years should have to be counted in for the qualifying period <e> <s> therefore on those grounds we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating this statement <e> <s> we accept in principle that it is not sensible to have two separate but intertwined systems of student support and it is the case that students have been bandied about between two departments for long enough so we welcome the move towards a single system of support <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the noble earl for repeating that important statement <e> <s> the thrust of the statement is <e>", "<cs> we on these benches should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> our name is not attached to it simply because there is a convention of a limit of four names for the proposers of amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals has already mentioned the severe loss that will occur in one case under the governments proposals from down to and there are a great many other cases which could be advanced <e> <s> in one case the loss could be from down to in another from to of course they vary according to circumstances and in another from down to in another from to and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also very much welcome the statement <e> <s> it is the culmination of a movement to that end which has extended over a number of years <e> <s> the government say that they are making the extension irrespective of the european court decision but it is widely expected that it will go against them <e> <s> it seems to me that they are right to pre-empt it and to take the honourable step of extending the payment to married women <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word here because i think the noble baroness the minister has put us in a bit of a quandary <e> <s> she has made a welcome announcement concerning the method of payment of family credit and it is indeed the case arising from her statement that the secretary of state has honoured the undertaking he gave at report stage in another place to look at the method of payment again that is to say whether it could go straight to the mother for which there was a great deal of support <e> <s> obviously we welcome that and we are delighted that the noble baroness will be introducing an amendment to that effect later in the bill <e> <s> that is one thing but at the same time we want to be clear that that of itself does not address the concern expressed in this amendment about the provision of free school meals <e> <s> that is a slightly different point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene before the noble baroness proceeds further <e> <s> it is quite correct that the ideal policy of the alliance is what the noble baroness has stated but the benefits proposed under our scheme are considerably higher <e> <s> it certainly does not mean that we support what the government have done here which is in effect discriminatory as between poor children in households in work and poor children in households out of work in other words giving free school meals for one group and cash payments for the other <e> <s> that seems to us to be discriminatory and illogical <e> <s> the remarks of the noble baroness refer only to the implementation of our policy when we are in a position to put it into practice <e>", "<cs> as amendment no <e> <s> has by the usual channels been grouped with this amendment perhaps i may be allowed to say a few words about it because to all intents and purposes it has exactly the same effect <e> <s> the amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend lord banks <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way perhaps i may remind him that in fact your lordships <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those who have spoken in this short debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has mentioned the building societies bill and that might indeed be the proper vehicle under which some new arrangement can be devised <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will tell us whether the government are considering making any provision in that regard in coming to some new arrangement with the building societies in return for the new privileges which are being granted under that bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides what to do about her amendment no <e> <s> it seems extraordinary to hear the noble baroness the minister boasting that the government have retained the blindness addition under the new arrangements when that remains still stuck at a week where it has been in my recollection for a great many years <e> <s> had it been increased in line with inflation it would have been eight or ten times i cannot remember how many times that amount <e> <s> so that does not seem to me to be a very good ground for self-congratulation <e> <s> neither in fact does it meet the point raised by the noble baroness lady fisher because the partially sighted do not get it and it does not act as a passport to the disabled persons premium <e> <s> also in previous debates we heard that the disabled persons premium would cause considerable losses for a wide range of people that is to say it would if it were not for the amendment of the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> so i do not think that the answer given by the noble baroness lady trumpington was a very good one <e>", "<cs> may i ask about the blindness addition <e> <s> i thought the noble baroness said earlier that <e>", "<cs> to give a concrete instance to the noble baroness lady carnegy as i understand it a volunteer who volunteers four days a week and whose bus fare costs a day spends a week <e> <s> if these new proposals come into force it would appear that the maximum reimbursement of expenses which such a volunteer could receive would be and that he or she would therefore be worse off out of pocket in addition to undertaking four days of unpaid work on behalf of the community <e> <s> that is the position as far as i understand it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wigoder in his eloquent and convincing speech referred also to amendment no <e> <s> in the names of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the noble baroness to clear up something for me and to enlighten me as to what system of repayment of loans is envisaged under the social fund <e> <s> would the social fund become in effect a preferential creditor with the right to take payments at source out of benefit each week <e> <s> am i right in reading the governments intention in that way <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baroness <e> <s> however i should like to make a slight correction to what she said about the period during which the blind addition has not been changed <e> <s> in fact it goes back to apart from a p rise on the introduction of decimalisation in

<e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies may i add something which is germane to what the noble lord said <e> <s> on an earlier amendment i made a note that the noble baroness said that the budget will be handled flexibly so that it does not run out before the end of the year <e> <s> can she expand a little on what she means by that flexibility <e> <s> will that be done by scaling down means for example so that if someone has a specific need one can meet only per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of it according to the time of the year <e> <s> can the noble baroness expand on that a little <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies she seemed to suggest that this amendment would alter the relationship of the social security advisory committee and the government <e> <s> it is clear if she looks at the amendment that there is no intention to return to the previous system by giving it the same sort of executive powers as the old supplementary benefit commission <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness would be the first to recognise that the social security advisory committee has much to do with an increasing mass of regulations on which it comments either on its own initiative or at the request of the secretary of state <e> <s> normally there is i understand a quarantine period of one year before the social security advisory committee can begin to scrutinise regulations under a new act of parliament <e> <s> this may be appropriate for relatively minor legislation <e> <s> we are however confronted with the introduction of a completely new system what the noble lord lord ennals called a new venture <e> <s> it seems important therefore that there should be no quarantine and that the committee should have the necessary resources to carry out a proper monitoring exercise and report back <e> <s> this would not in any way distort the relationship between the committee and the government <e> <s> i hope that the government will look on it rather favourably <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord stallard said these two amendments approach the problem of the funding of funerals from two slightly different angles <e> <s> i agree with him in his comments on the dignity and respect which are vital to proper burial arrangements <e> <s> the noble baroness misinterpreted what i said <e> <s> my amendment is trying to get the security of knowing that assistance is available <e> <s> that is what is required in order to enable the deceaseds relative to go ahead with making the necessary arrangements <e> <s> frankly i find it rather difficult to understand why the government do not like my amendment because it targets on those in need <e> <s> i find the argument of the noble baroness on the enormous costs which might result from this new clause to be absolutely extra-ordinary <e> <s> it is surely most unlikely that people would claim assistance under this clause where there was no real need <e> <s> i was extremely surprised to hear the noble baroness say that she would do it herself <e> <s> i found that most extraordinary <e> <s> this gives a cynical view of the way people might behave in these circumstances <e> <s> i do not accept that at all <e>", "<cs> i simply wish to support the noble baroness in the amendment <e> <s> the retail consortium has also been in touch with me and i shall not repeat what she said on its behalf <e> <s> the argument is totally valid <e> <s> the proposals make a complete nonsense of the principles embodied in the governments programme to lift the burdens of businesses and small businesses in particular <e> <s> incidentally it is not only the retailers who are concerned it is also the pharmacists the self-employed and small businesses in general <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the noble baroness i note that she said that some noble lords might want to elaborate briefly that is a possibility <e> <s> and there are one or two comments that should be made <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of last-minute changes of business i wonder whether perhaps we could reach an understanding that all the opposition parties are consulted before last-minute changes of business because they of course can be equally inconvenienced with the official opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord trefgarne has said that i moved the same amendment in committee and that is perfectly true <e> <s> it was pressed to a division there <e> <s> i think therefore that there is no impropriety here <e> <s> possibly we may now need to draft a different amendment for third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of noble lords have drawn attention to the fact that child <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also welcome this series of amendments <e>

concern to the council and its employees over the past two or three years a matter of which i have given notice to the noble baronesss office <e>", "<cs> my lords broadly speaking we support the aims of this bill although our level of enthusiasm varies in the three main parts and we question in two clauses at least the means by which the government seek to achieve the aims <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that that is an improvement but it is hard to see how national members will be able to travel round the country attending regional appeal panels and it appears that there is no ultimate court

impression is that the governments proposals do not remove all the unease which has been expressed and my suspicion is that what the government are proposing falls a good deal short of a proper national appeal system <e>", "<cs> it really was rather extraordinary to hear the noble and learned lord lord denning whom we all respect so much arguing along the lines he did considering his own distinguished contribution to the assimilation of community law into the law of the land <e> <s> once we joined the community and reaffirmed this in there really was no alternative but to respect the

opening hospital premises to the rating system <e> <s> i would point out to him that the amendment says in its very first line <e>", "<cs> as we so enthusiastically supported the noble lord lord ennals on the last amendment and with such resounding success by which i am delighted i thought i should say that we on these benches are in some difficulty over this amendment <e> <s> in this country the problem is not that there are too many pharmacies but that they are wrongly located <e> <s> as i understand it one of the objectives of the bill is to try to secure some relocation of pharmacies rather than have a drop in the total number <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do can he clarify one matter for me <e> <s> is it not the case that he wants to strike out the word only <e> <s> in other words the bill would read <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i should have thought that the government having gained their main point on the essential balance in the bill in the vote on the last series of amendments would be well advised to fall over backwards to counter any possible accusations of bias or vested interest that there might be in the system <e> <s> to plead that a simple notice in a local newspaper or a local trade journal will cause an enormous expenditure just does not hold up <e> <s> i believe <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies perhaps i may say that a powerful case has been put forward against having three local voting pharmacists <e> <s> it seems to me that the government may not have properly prepared this part of the bill <e> <s> i understand that the pharmaceutical society has suggested that of the three pharmacists on the sub-committee one should be nominated by the society itself and should not therefore be a local pharmacist <e> <s> this would reduce the local pharmacists representation to only two members of a sub-committee of seven <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have given any consideration to that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness as far as she went <e> <s> she did not go very far but i understand that that was slightly difficult for her <e> <s> she said that no amendment to the bill was thought necessary <e> <s> it was important to raise the matter so that we could extract an answer from her that we can read in <e>", "<cs> i have to agree with the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> we are rather groping in the dark <e> <s> a few shafts of light have been shed but i am not sure that the whole scene is yet illuminated <e> <s> i associate myself with the request made by the noble lord lord ennals for circulation of the guidance which would be helpful <e>", "<cs> we believe the noble baroness when she says she has deposited something in the library <e> <s> as we did not know that she had deposited something in the library that does not help us very much <e> <s> it would be helpful if she would circulate a copy of the guidance to those who have taken part in this debate before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> again i am trying to find grounds for thanking the noble baroness for trying to help us and i am struggling a little <e> <s> the noble baroness has told us of the aspirations towards a substantial strengthening of the scheme and a guaranteed minumum income a substantial improvement on the present scheme <e> <s> this is no doubt the case on paper <e> <s> but the real question is the one raised in my opening speech will the funds be there <e> <s> the noble baroness says that this is not a matter for primary legislation <e> <s> i think that one must agree with her there <e> <s> however our degree of support for the primary legislation depends very much on our confidence that the government have worked this out properly have the correct figures and know where the money will come from for their proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that answer which is spiced with good intentions but one would like to ask her what resources she is putting behind that <e> <s> is she aware that of the women in this country who annually die of this disease per cent <e> <s> have never been screened and that practically all those deaths could have been prevented <e> <s> is she also aware that there is a pre-cancerous epidemic of a new and more virulent strain largely among young women in the to age group which is likely to lead to a doubling of mortality within years unless urgent steps are taken <e> <s> can she perhaps tell us a little more about the progress of the new computerised call and recall system that was ordered by mr kenneth clarke in <e> <s> can she tell us whether we are on course with that programme <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house whether the government have carefully studied the bmas recent report on cervical cancer screening and whether they agree with any of the conclusions <e> <s> does she recall that the bma recommends three-yearly screening for women between the ages of and and that we have not yet even met her own departments guidelines for five-yearly intervals <e> <s> will the government very seriously study this report and draw the appropriate conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to add our appreciation of what the noble baroness has done <e> <s> my name was associated with that of the noble lord lord ennals in the amendment as was the name of my noble friend lord winstanley <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord harris of high cross has referred to a more rational location of pharmacies and also to essential small pharmacies suggesting that the government plan may have the effect of easing some of them out <e> <s> i should like to revert briefly to the scottish dimension and in particular to essential small pharmacies in scotland a matter which vexed your lordships and indeed aroused some indignation at committee stage <e> <s> first i have to thank the noble baroness for arranging with her noble friend lord glenarthur to write to me as the noble lord did <e> <s> i should like to express my thanks in person to the noble lord too <e> <s> he has i believe copied the same letter to a number of noble lords attaching a note explaining the current difference between the english and the scottish schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i ask the noble lord before he sits down whether he would agree that it is very unlikely that scottish pharmacists will oppose the government raising their contribution just on this scheme from to without changing any of the other arrangements <e> <s> would the minister agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all agreed that the bill leaves this house distinctly improved <e> <s> the noble baronesss claim to have behaved in a flexible and responsible manner is i think largely justified <e> <s> we have also had the notable example of a new axis formed between the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble lord lord ennals <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government taken note of the suggestion of the chairman of the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee that free condoms should be made available in all high street chemist shops <e> <s> if the government are aware of that suggestion are they considering it <e>", "<cs> my lords by mutual agreement with my noble friend lord hooson and with the leave of your lordships i shall speak now and the noble lord lord hooson will speak in my place on the list of speakers <e> <s> i am sure that we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies for introducing this important topic for debate <e> <s> he has given us an admirable exposition of the current situation and all the facts are available in the very useful briefs which have been issued by the bma the national association of health authorities and the committee of vice-chancellors and principals so i shall not go into them in any detail <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether she will pass on my suggestion that academic funds and sift funds should be canalised through a new co-ordinating committee <e> <s> i have thrown that in perhaps rather late in the day but i wonder whether she would bring it to the attention of her right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a few minutes in hand and i want to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this important debate <e> <s> i was glad to hear the noble lord

if the numbers were wrong they need help <e> <s> it must be remembered that they are in the condition they are because of the imported factor which had to be imported because we did not have the facilities to make it <e> <s> it is a consideration that the government must bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill was rushed through the other place with such unseemly haste that we must be grateful that the leader of the house i am glad to see him in his place did not move a similar business motion here <e> <s> i think that he showed his usual wisdom in not doing so as i am sure your lordships would have resisted it <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware i am sure they are of the work being done by mr malcolm rees on a sample of patients at various london hospitals which i understand is likely to work out at a cost in the region of to <e> <s> are they also aware of the forecast made by professor maynard of the york university health economics centre which also came to

in scotland which last week experienced temperatures of and i think degrees below did not qualify because the monitoring stations were in a coastal area <e> <s> should not the whole monitoring system also be revised <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness just answer my question about whether savings of act as a disbarment to people who are otherwise qualified and whether this is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall intervene only very briefly in this debate <e> <s> with his usual expertise the noble lord lord banks has covered almost all the points about which i should have spoken if he

process for the public and that they will be relieved that the shift has now entered its final phase <e> <s> they will at least be in a better position to evaluate the real value of benefits and to judge whether they are being treated fairly <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with all other noble lords in paying tribute to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment because it attracts me on the grounds that it seeks to introduce some balance into this bill <e> <s> whether this years settlement is imposed or reluctantly accepted it is quite clear to us on these benches that there must be some <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ritchie decides what he will do about this amendment in relation to the question asked by the noble lord lord renton am i not right in thinking that the advisory committee is not due to come into any operational role until well after the current years settlement which i think i am right in saying is st october this year <e> <s> in that case there would be plenty of time to trawl for opinion concerning its composition and to have it set up well in time for the purposes set out in the bill <e>", "<cs> it is right to say as the noble lord is well aware that a body exists that has already been referred to during this committee stage <e> <s> that is the national confederation of parent-teacher associations with over million members <e>", "<cs> i was rather alarmed to hear the deputy chairman say that if this amendment were agreed to amendment no <e> <s> which according to my understanding has been grouped with this amendment would not be able to be called <e> <s> i say that because parents are not mentioned in lord belsteads amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble baroness parents were brought into an earlier amendment which was not accepted concerning the choice and the recommended people to belong to the advisory committee <e> <s> when she says that it is not within the province of parents to have anything to do with pay and conditions i agree that the secretary of state does not have to accept their recommendations but there seems to be no good or just reason why they should not make them known <e> <s> if such a provision is not written on to the face of the statute how are they to make them known <e> <s> will they just write in and get an acknowledgment slip a printed thing saying your communication has been received and noted <e> <s> is that the plan <e>", "<cs> i should not have said this was mere political gamesmanship <e> <s> i should be very surprised indeed if parents were not concerned <e> <s> i think they will be extremely concerned <e> <s> i am suggesting that a body of or million people should be able to put a view no more no less <e>", "<cs> after that short debate i am perfectly happy to withdraw my amendment and to accept the governments amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am not terrifically impressed by that argument <e> <s> it seems that if the secretary of state is to set up a committee and then immediately emasculate it we could almost do without it altogether <e> <s> however i shall certainly not press the amendment at this stage of the evening <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what the noble lord has said and reconsider my position at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend has put his finger on the main point <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead referred to the ugc and to the advisory board for the research councils which he says work perfectly well <e> <s> but we must remember that here we are dealing with a much more politically sensitive and in his words inflammatory situation than is likely to arise from the recommendations of either of those bodies <e> <s> we are dealing with teachers and literally millions of school children <e> <s> although the noble lord said that there may not be controversy within the committee there may certainly be controversy in the country <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> it is certainly not my intention to introduce any mechanism which would mean that teachers were delayed in receiving their first back payment <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord says million is a large sum of money and there is an increase of per cent <e> <s> over a period of something like two years <e> <s> however i think i heard him say it was possible that some kind of consultation would still be continuing after the bill receives royal assent <e> <s> i hope i understood him from that to mean that if there is any life at all in any type of consultation the government will stay their hand <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for what the noble lord has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think if i may say so that the argument against the negative procedure is the one advanced by the noble lord lord henderson when he said that the secretary of state is over this period in the unique position of acting entirely alone <e> <s> he has not yet had the benefit of his advisory body coming into being <e> <s> so over a period of something like six or seven months he is acting entirely alone and entirely on his own say-so <e> <s> furthermore the type of order that he is introducing or will be introducing will be breaking new ground <e> <s> that would seem to me to be another important argument in favour of the affirmative procedure <e>", "<cs> yes i thought i had put my finger on a technical hitch in the bill and i certainly welcome the noble lords assurance that the first order will not contain any settlement which will run beyond st march <e> <s> i welcome and accept that assurance from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that it was the noble lord lord beloff who will be speaking in a moment who first placed this problem before members at second reading <e> <s> my recollection is that the noble lord lord belstead said that he would certainly study the matter to see what could be done <e>", "<cs> before leaving that point the noble baroness appeared to cast some flicker of a doubt on whether the word reasonable was the right one <e>", "<cs> she did not <e> <s> i certainly had it on good authority that the phrase full and proper opportunity would be preferable and a safeguard against any hostile union perhaps trying to block participation or whatever it might be <e> <s> this is advice that i have received <e> <s> i pass it on to the government and to the noble baroness lady cox for what it is worth <e>", "<cs> i confess that i am surprised that statute law embodies these instances which the noble lord lord elton and the noble baroness adduced <e> <s> i had forgotten schedule of the local government act <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the secretary of states recent visit to san francisco i think this was one of the matters he went into there can the noble baroness say whether the government will make available to health authorities additional money where they feel it is necessary to assist the foundation of a hospice <e> <s> will she not also agree that a great deal of the cost of the terminally ill suffering from this unfortunate disease would be better borne by the hospice movement than by the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at what has been said after my noble friend lord rochester had i thought clearly pointed out to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby that this is not an open <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always anxious to be persuaded by the noble baroness <e> <s> she is in her nature so persuasive <e> <s> but i am afraid i must tell her that on this occasion in fact she has not persuaded me <e> <s> it is quite true as she says that subsection reads <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a nice point of interpretation but i do not think it can be said that the matter is in fact per cent <e> <s> clear <e> <s> it is possible that the subsection d might be interpreted in the way that the noble baroness has said but it seems to me to be equally clear that it could be interpreted very much <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to have come to a ground of interpretation which is causing the house a little difficulty <e> <s> i hesitate to cross swords with the noble lord lord elton who always brings such a lively and accurate intelligence to all the proceedings in which he is involved <e> <s> however subsection opens with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is giving me an absolute assurance i remind your lordships that in my opening remarks i said that if i was given an absolute assurance i would not press the amendment <e> <s> on the basis of what the noble baroness has just said i am bound to accept that she has given me an absolute assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very hard to understand how the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has been able to suggest that the secretary of state and the government are actually marginalised in this amendment in which it is stated very firmly that it is incumbent on the secretary of state to bring <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i should have thought that the phrase so far as is practicable could well be expanded to include such a proposal as an independent review body which has been put forward from these benches on which the secretary of state would have an input at various stages <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to raise one specific point with the noble lord lord belstead of which i have given his office notice <e> <s> it is the interpretation to be put on the new clause moved as the noble lord will recall at the committee stage by the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> i supported the noble baroness on that occasion <e> <s> i have had a number of letters as probably have other noble lords from the various teacher associations in further education because this is the clause which refers to further education in which they express considerable doubt as to how they will stand under the clause as it is now written into the bill <e>", "<cs> the main objection to the formula funding triggered off by this clause and described in more detail in schedule is that it over-rides the redetermination procedure in the rates act so that all flexibility to take into account special circumstances in different areas and different types of authority is removed <e> <s> pledges given under the act are frankly being torn up and under the bill as drafted authorities will not be able to enter into discussions on a proposed maximum rate <e> <s> for previously rate-capped authorities expenditure levels are frozen for newly capped authorities it means a per cent <e> <s> increase and there is a flat per cent <e> <s> increase for all police authorities regardless of their particular needs <e> <s> therefore we argue that these formulae are excessively rigid <e> <s> the bill as drafted means that it will be impossible for the secretary of state or the authorities to make adjustments once the bill has been passed without new primary legislation being introduced <e> <s> that seems unsatisfactory for the secretary of state for the authorities and if i may say so for parliament itself <e>", "<cs> while agreeing with a great deal that the noble lord lord underhill said i want to talk mainly about amendment no which deals with ilea <e> <s> i understand that the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs will also give her partys position on that <e>", "<cs> i always listen to the noble baroness with care because she usually talks a great deal of sense <e> <s> but i should like to ask her on this occasion whether she agrees that if the government do not make special allowances to ilea to cover the secretary of states new round of teachers pay awards which is the situation we were debating while she was out of the chamber precisely the problem she fears will come about <e> <s> the precept added to the rate which is paid by the elderly people she is so concerned about will rise <e> <s> therefore this is an argument in favour of at least helping ilea to cope with the secretary of states new pay awards <e>", "<cs> i should of course not speak for the minister but what i thought he said was that that is already covered in the formula to be applied to ilea in schedule <e> <s> in my speech and i think also in the speech of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs we cast doubt on that proposition <e> <s> indeed we are eager to hear from the noble lord lord skelmersdale on that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord winds up with respect to the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord bellwin it is not only a question of time but also a question of money <e> <s> if you have a matter of weeks to decide how you are going to implement a change or a cut of or per cent <e> <s> maybe you can do it but if you are required to implement a whopping per cent <e> <s> cut it will certainly take you two or three months to work out how you are going to do it and even then you may not be able to do so <e> <s> i think the time and money factors must be taken together <e>", "<cs> i did not in fact put a rosy view of ileas performance <e>", "<cs> we should also like to restate our dissatisfaction with the schedule <e> <s> it is obviously right to speak on the schedule rather than on the motion that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> in combination with clause the schedule leaves absolutely no machinery for taking account of special or changed circumstances <e> <s> it must be a disadvantage for the secretary of state to have to come back to parliament for any change that he wants to make or is forced to make during the coming financial year <e> <s> there is no presumption on past performance that the government are right and that they may not have to come back to parliament yet again <e> <s> on those grounds therefore clause and the schedule seem to be unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two brief questions <e> <s> taking up the cervical cancer point it is very welcome that the government have recognised the spread of the disease in the earlier age range towards <e> <s> but whereas the figure of million is attached to the breast screening proposals there is no figure in the statement attached to the action which is recommended for cervical cancer screening <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will say a word about that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness did not answer the question about additional funding for the cervical cancer programme <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the effect of this reduction that patients are often kept waiting with their bags packed for weeks on end before they are admitted and that when admitted they are often sent home again because the bed is still occupied <e> <s> even if they are admitted and treated are they not then frequently discharged when still too frail and at a time when friends and relatives are not ready to receive them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says the these proposals have been under consideration for some time <e> <s> can she go a little further and say for how long and when some resolution might be arrived at <e> <s> is there any real reason why mobility allowance should be confined to those who are self-propelled when those who cannot be self-propelled are often in even greater difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords the technical reasons for the introduction of this bill have been explained by the noble baroness and they were also set out in the notes that her department was kind enough to circulate <e> <s> it all sounds simple but it raises a number of quite important questions <e> <s> first there is the matter of how the error that this bill corrects came about <e> <s> it stems from an all-party amendment successfully moved and carried by my noble friend lord wigoder which if preserved in the bill would have introduced an independent right of appeal and made the social fund subject to regulation rather than the secretary of states directions and guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should also like to put one question <e> <s> perhaps i may thank him for attempting to give us as full an answer as he possibly could to the questions that arise in a very tricky field in which even the old hands often get extremely confused <e> <s> the point which i wish to put to him concerns the under- question <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble baroness for repeating this statement <e> <s> it is certainly welcome that the secretary of state has agreed that the top of the basic salary scale shall be increased from to <e> <s> but it does lead one to ask why if the secretary of state was going to move towards the position of the larger unions over the main professional grade he did not make this move earlier because that would have been much more likely to lead to an agreed settlement <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said it would have made the imposition clause in the act unnecessary <e> <s> if he is prepared to be flexible now why was he not prepared to be flexible then <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal briefly with one point that the noble baroness made <e> <s> she suggested that the answers to some of the detailed questions i raised could be found in schedule to the order <e> <s> it is precisely because the answers are not there that i put the questions to her <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble baroness that now that the consultation process is being opened up these are matters on which clarification will be sought <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether the adjudication officer will still seek leave to appeal once the government have already overturned the decision of the commissioners <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better to wait for the result of that appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the important fact is that the number is approximately doubling every months <e> <s> my figure for is <e> <s> that leads us inevitably to the conclusion that if this progression continues we shall have about cases in <e> <s> although three-quarters of the cases so far have been in the london regions can the noble baroness say whether the government are aware of the rise in other regions particularly oxford and the west midlands and whether they will be helping those regions to the same extent as they are helping the london regions which are suffering most of the burden at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was whether the regions which i mentioned will be getting any new money in view of the rising incidence of aids in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords my name also appears on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i will be very brief <e> <s> laymen perhaps should not step in where lawyers disagree but laymen have as much concern for the constitutional proprieties as professionals because the constitution affects us all and we all live under it <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord tells me but i should much rather have the rider that the noble and learned lord lord silkin wants to add to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has introduced this amendment extremely fully <e> <s> what she has proposed to the house is in effect a sort of shopping list <e> <s> one has to recognise however that this shopping list is permissive on the secretary of state <e> <s> it is not obligatory on him but it would at least enable him to take account of one or more of the factors listed in the amendment <e> <s> this of course he cannot do at the moment because he has made himself a prisoner of his own formulae <e> <s> he has boxed himself in deliberately of course but i very much question whether this sort of rigidity is desirable <e>", "<cs> i am fully aware that clause and the schedule attached to it deal with rate-capped authorities <e> <s> but can the noble lord tell me that it is any less likely that homeless people will move into a rate-capped authority and become a burden on it rather than an un-rate-capped authority or that children in a rate-capped authority do not have to prepare for gcse as well as those in other authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord rises to reply i should like to say that we on these benches are also extremely concerned about the additional power which the noble lord seeks to import into the bill at third reading <e> <s> it would seem to us that the powers the government have equipped themselves with in the bill are perfectly adequate <e>", "<cs> all the arguments have been extremely ably put by my noble friend lord mcgregor and other noble lords <e> <s> from the number of noble lords who have spoken in the short debate on this amendment i am sure that the noble baroness will be aware that there is an area of genuine concern <e> <s> it seems wrong that the passport to this benefit should be based purely on the parents circumstances for anything to happen in other words that they should be in receipt of supplementary benefit <e> <s> we should be concerned with the mother and the child <e> <s> that point has been made by practically every noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord lord hesketh for having explained the introduction of these regulations <e> <s> once again this is the result of a government error in that they originally laid them by the negative procedure which was incorrect under the act which was passed only last year <e> <s> they have now taken the opportunity to make one or two adjustments bringing them forward again under the affirmative procedure <e> <s> i am bound to say that that does not give one very many grounds for confidence that the stated intention in the original green paper on the reform of social security to which the noble baroness referred and which preceded the act was to make social security legislation much more compact clear and manageable <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very short amending bill and therefore we had very little chance of making any impact upon it <e> <s> regretfully the only amendment moved by my noble friend lord mcgregor of durris on the question of the under- mothers the government did not accept <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will undertake to keep their position under review <e>", "<cs> my lords may we take it from the answer given to one of the supplementary questions of the noble lord lord mellish that the government have revised their view of the utility of small gp and community hospitals and will now reverse their policy on the closure of such facilities <e>", "<cs> i was about to come to the intervention of the noble lord lord lucas in which he mentioned the sum of million <e> <s> i think he said that that would have been the difference if licences of right had not operated over four products <e> <s> if i am right and if i did not mishear him that appears to me to affect a fairly limited part of the spectrum <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what i thought i heard the noble lord say and what i believe i reproduced in my own words <e> <s> i am certainly grateful to him for repeating it but it still does not seem to cover the whole of the field that is relevant in this matter <e>", "<cs> if i may be allowed to continue both sides have overstated their claims and that is why i want to be closely associated with neither <e> <s> common sense and the future development of cost-effective prescribing requires that there should be a healthy generics industry <e> <s> i have accepted somewhat reluctantly that licences of right should go but it is extremely important that the generic companies should not also go to the wall <e> <s> there should be some incentives for the maintenance and improvement of generic production in this country <e>", "<cs> may i briefly respond first to the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> he has misunderstood the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> it does not compel doctors to adopt a generic equivalent <e> <s> it allows them to specify the branded name and to continue with the branded name after years if they so wish <e> <s> it is mandatory on the pharmacist if the doctor has not so specified but it is not mandatory on the doctor <e> <s> therefore i do not see this as an additional burden on doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the justification sought by the noble lord lord ennals is to give the new authority more money and special responsibility for aids prevention and education <e> <s> while we on these benches

dies on st march and the new body does not come into being until st april which is the day of the debate in your lordships house will the noble baroness give an undertaking that sufficient copies will be available for the purpose of the debate in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not dissent from what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said about the importance of polytechnic-industry links does the noble baroness accept that it is important that some form of local authority link and linkage with the local authority education system should be preserved <e> <s> in that connection is she aware that the national advisory body is either on the point of publishing or possibly even has just published a report on the governance management and status of polytechnics <e> <s> will that be taken into account before firm decisions are made on the matter <e> <s> is the noble baroness also aware that an independent body under the chairmanship of sir alistair pilkington is sitting to investigate polytechnic local links <e> <s> before firm decisions are taken in this matter i ask that those contributions be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords a commentator suggested recently that after the royal family the national health service was our most popular national institution <e> <s> the number of speakers this afternoon has given some credence

title to post-school <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall not be as helpful to him as i ought to be <e> <s> i want briefly to try first to appraise the governments approach to higher education as outlined in the white paper and then to touch on some specific concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i want briefly to ask the noble baroness a couple of questions of which i have already given her notice <e> <s> the first relates to my noble friend lord youngs concern which he expressed at second reading that mandatory rather than voluntary reporting might undermine the principle of confidentiality and therefore fewer people might come forward than at present <e> <s> will the government undertake to keep a sharp eye on any evidence that the bill is having such a counter-productive effect <e> <s> if it were we might need to reconsider in the next parliament the whole question of mandatory reporting <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how the activities of the new health education authority will be affected by the sex education provisions of the recent education act particularly in relation to aids <e> <s> will the new authority have any funds for this principle and will its writ extend to schools <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate the noble lord this being my first opportunity on his new post <e> <s> i should also like to ask the noble lord why he left out the figures for <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl say whether or not the government have been approached by the british medical association suggesting a pilot scheme for adequate compensation on a no fault basis <e> <s> if so what has been the governments reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the organisation to which he has just referred has on its books only doctors who are prepared to give independent advice in these cases <e> <s> there is extraordinary difficulty in piloting claimants through the courts in cases where costs sometimes rise to or <e> <s> in addition cases can take five to seven years to reach a conclusion <e> <s> will the government take this seriously into consideration and look into the matter <e> <s> will they also receive evidence from this small but devoted charity <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us a little more about the resource implications <e> <s> surely the only requirement in sections and is that local education authorities should collect certain information and pass it on to their own social services departments to see whether young people leaving school or further education require further service in the community <e> <s> that does not seem fantastically complicated or expensive <e> <s> will he say what the implications are <e>", "<cs> my lords it is right to put on record that the bill was originally introduced by mr tom clarke in another place and not by mr alfred morris as the noble lord lord cledwyn said inadvertently <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord satisfied that an adequate supply to meet this demand will be available <e> <s> i understand that it will be in the region of needles a year <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that contrary to the length of time advocated by the noble viscount the government have in fact introduced a tendency towards four-year parliaments <e> <s> would they consider going a stage further and seeking fixed terms in order that we may avoid the damaging pre-election uncertainties that we had the last time <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also thank the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> we have not dissented from the governments mainstream plans for polytechnics <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord lord mcintosh i find this emergency statement rather puzzling in one or two respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i

benches i thank the noble earl for his very succinct explanation of the order <e> <s> in principle we have nothing against it because it seeks to implement the original intention of the european community which is to have a free market in goods capital and labour <e> <s> we are hardly there with goods yet but it is good to know that we are making progress in other fields <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what proportion of the core curriculum the government are proposing to devote to modern languages <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government stimulate this process out of the fund which the secretary of state has set aside for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reassurances are certainly encouraging <e> <s> does not the minister agree that there is a great strain imposed on the finances of the riverside authority by its leading role in the treatment of aids particularly at st stephens <e> <s> does not the minister further agree that if sufficient money is not provided for this purpose it will have an adverse effect on the authorities of other hospitals and this could possibly feed through in the long run to westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the minister for her speedy overview of the quite substantial changes to the regulations <e> <s> at the beginning of her speech she gave the house some figures <e> <s> it would certainly be interesting to learn a little more about the main categories of bids which have proved popular with local authorities and how they have been met <e> <s> i do not expect her to supply this information this evening but possibly she can point the house in the right direction otherwise one can put down a question for written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the supplementary question of the noble baroness lady carnegy will the noble lord say whether the government intend to reply to the national confederation of parent-teachers associations report on parental perceptions of tvi <e> <s> i understand that it was commissioned in combination with the manpower services commission and therefore it would appear that a government response would be appropriate <e> <s> will the noble lord comment on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that medical advances inevitably give rise to greater demand and expectations which cannot possibly be met simply out of so-called efficiency savings <e> <s> can he say what plans the government have to take into account medical advances in their future funding of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords we obviously have a great deal to digest in this white paper so this is not an appropriate moment to ask a lot of questions <e> <s> however there are a couple which i should like to put to the noble lord and the first is this <e> <s> will the setting of targets for family doctors to achieve higher levels of vaccination immunisation and cervical cytology screening lead the government to look again at the no-fault compensation idea <e> <s> is this not particularly relevant in relation to vaccination and immunisation if there is an intention that a larger section of the populace should receive these services <e>", "<cs> my lords some doctors own their own premises and are also self-employed <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord williams decides what he wishes to do let me say that i also find my hackles rising somewhat on the point of accessible by <e> <s> i am in agreement with the noble lord lord kilbracken on keeping good transparent english in the statute <e> <s> the verb to access is clearly a jargon term and i would submit that it is unwise to have it on the face of a statute <e> <s> could we not get round the difficulty by using the phrase capable of access by and then we should not be introducing into the statute the verb to access <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that it is the universities themselves which have made the first response to the acard report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord agree that the governments recent white paper on primary care raises that question by recommending a further extension of immunisation <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the only way of eliminating the marginal tax rates of more than per cent <e> <s> to which he has referred is by introducing an integrated tax benefit system <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether there is any time limit on a temporary closure <e> <s> is it not the case that some temporary closures are simply turning into <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the intention to make some special arrangements for nurses under the poll tax <e> <s> otherwise there will not only be a lack of nurses in this speciality but in all branches of nursing

partially sighted <e> <s> normally i am extremely sympathetic to anything promoted by the noble lord <e> <s> i well recall his long and ultimately successful battle with the public lending right which i fully applaud <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> perhaps i may give a small statistic <e> <s> there are blind people who are too poor to pay a tax <e> <s> some of them make very considerable use of tapes <e> <s> therefore this additional p on each tape would make a considerable difference to their circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should also like to thank the noble lord for his lucid explanation of the amendment regulations <e> <s> we entirely take the point that this applies to a short period from the end of this year until the coming into effect of the new income support arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us have supported the noble baroness in her idea of checkups at the workplace and possibly in mobile units <e> <s> the noble lord said that one-third of a million pounds had been allocated to each regional health authority <e> <s> can he say whether that is in addition to the general health budget <e>", "<cs> my lords

like to ask the noble lord whether he could clarify some of the figures for me <e> <s> perhaps it is my fault but it seems that this statement is not quite so explicit as government statements usually are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i should be very happy if when he has read the <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench i should like to follow my noble

again if not in his accustomed place lending his counsels to the conduct of the house <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i must differ to some extent with the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth in respect of his amendment <e> <s> the clause which we are considering is what one might call son of northfield <e> <s> the measure proposed was moved in a private members bill by the noble lord lord northfield but as the noble lord lord lucas said it fell <e> <s> it was put forward in that way because the government did not at the time have outlined any legislation on intellectual property <e> <s> it has now appeared as a government measure in this compendious bill with the difference that the retrospective element of the northfield proposals has been dropped <e> <s> in my submission to the committee that is a slight improvement <e> <s> i have some queries about the clause as a whole but i believe that it has emerged in a cleaner version as written into the bill at the moment <e>", "<cs> the intention of the amendment with which i have some sympathy seems to be to preserve licences of right in respect of branded products with an uninterrupted market monopoly of years <e> <s> the noble lord lord rea gave the instance of the case of zantac <e> <s> he has also given some figures of potential savings for the national health service <e> <s> noble lords who are interested in the nhs will attach importance to that <e>", "<cs> i just wanted to say why i had added my name to the list of noble lords who are opposing this clause <e> <s> i think i should describe my opposition as being of a probing nature <e> <s> the last time round the course the main question was the cost to the national health service and i think that was not properly resolved at the time <e> <s> the figure which comes to my mind and the noble lord lord beaverbrook will correct me if i am wrong is that the government forecast a cost of between and million over years <e> <s> that was the sort of figure which they were mooting <e> <s> i think that is obviously not realistic <e> <s> the simple instance which the noble lord lord rea gave as the cost of zantac would be way above that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that rather than continue with the warfare of statistics we should be looking at what is happening on the ground <e> <s> the evidence before all our eyes is that a vast number of needs are not being met <e> <s> would this not be an occasion to take a fresh look at the question of national health service funding possibly through a royal commission <e>", "<cs> a great deal has been said about the arts with which i largely concur <e> <s> i simply want to touch briefly on one point which has been raised only in passing by my noble friend lord ritchie of <e>", "<cs> my lords fortunately i have two minutes left in which to thank speakers on my own benches and on all sides of the house who have participated in what i believe has been an extremely constructive and varied debate <e> <s> practically all the main topics associated with aids have been touched upon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords and baronesses who have taken part in this very short debate <e> <s> i may say to the noble baroness lady blatch and to the noble lady lady saltoun that i do not agree that the matter i am trying to introduce is subsumed in the clause as it is written <e> <s> noble lords from the medical profession who are present in the chamber would confirm that treatment is normally the province of a medical doctor <e> <s> prevention is also a function of the primary health care services <e> <s> it can of course be promoted by public health campaigns but they usually take the form of television or leaflets and do not normally comprise counselling <e> <s> after all we are only talking about a matter of interpretation and we are not all that far apart <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that from the noble earl <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he has said and the assurances he has given <e> <s> on that note i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the two matters are surely connected <e> <s> will the noble lord say whether the restriction on the use of military aircraft will have any effect on the arrangement for joint civilian use of the airport <e>", "<cs> my lords if a satisfactory agreement on civilian use is reached and it is approved by the gibraltar parliament is there any prospect of lengthening the runway <e>", "<cs> my lords have not the government acknowledged in committee on the education reform bill in another place that in the case of large schools in particular groups of schools a specially trained person will be required to manage the financial side of things <e> <s> are the government suggesting that the cost of this necessary training should fall on local resources <e> <s> or will there be special funds provided <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the last and final stages of aids make it rather difficult for aids patients to be treated in normal hospices <e> <s> are the government thinking about the likely increase of patients and the further support which will be needed for this type of initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord undertake that some allocation will be made from the special funds for the reduction of waiting lists to redress this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the government propose to disregard entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords clause <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the scheme will not come into operation until the bill receives royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords in a debate on the national health service anecdotes seem to be in order <e> <s> recently i spent a brief spell in st thomass hospital as an nhs patient <e> <s> the ward i was in had been re-opened for a couple of months presumably with a small dollop of the governments waiting list fund in order to clear the backlog of operations <e> <s> the man in the bed next to me had been waiting for two years i was lucky there was no such pressure on my specialty <e> <s> the nurses all wore different coloured uniforms white green cerise very pretty and when i asked the sister why she said they are all agency nurses wonderful girls but they dont know where anything is when they arrive <e> <s> in two or three weeks they would be gone because the fund would have run out the guillotine would fall and the ward would close again <e> <s> there had not even been time to clean the windows so that the view across the river to this temple of wisdom which might have been some solace to the inmates was sadly blurred <e> <s> i yield to no one in my admiration for british improvisation in times of crisis but it seems an odd way to run a health service in a period of prosperity and peace <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me perhaps i may point out to him that parties from all sides of the political spectrum have taken ideas which have been previously advanced by the alliance party <e> <s> it makes very good sense to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is perfectly reasonable but will the minister confirm that it is the policy of the government to make gibraltar as self-supporting as possible and that joint use of the airport will be conducive to that <e> <s> secondly this is an important point if the people of gibraltar do not agree through the election to the arrangements for sharing the airport can the noble lord say what effect that will have on the bilateral agreement of nd december between the british and spanish governments whereby i understand spain was induced to join the european air fares package <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not answer my second supplementary question <e> <s> what will happen if the people of gibraltar reject the agreement <e> <s> what effect will that have on the european air fares agreement <e> <s> will the effect be to unravel the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the london authorities alone are spending million a year buying-in agency nurses <e> <s> is that not a very strong case for increasing the attractions for nurses in the national health service <e> <s> is it not further the case that the project referred to by the noble baroness is being studied by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us chapter and verse for his rather <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have much to add to what has already been said <e> <s> these occasions inevitably give rise to thoughts of how such matters might be better ordered and how a more rational and fairer system might be brought into place in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it has indeed been a privilege

however in <e>", "<cs> my lords we also would like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for steering us rapidly through these five sets of regulations <e> <s> we certainly welcome the concessions that he has indicated in respect of the macfarlane trust to the haemophiliacs and also the independent living trust fund <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that most other nations within the european community make special arrangements for such children <e> <s> will the government study those arrangements to ascertain what can be done on our part <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to outline briefly and broadly where i and my colleagues in the sdp stand on this bill particularly in relation to schools <e> <s> later today my noble friends lord flowers and lord perry of walton will apply their great knowledge and experience to the provisions for higher and further education <e> <s> tomorrow my noble friends lord young of dartington lord hanworth and lady stedman will address various topics that fall within the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies from the official opposition front bench may i make this point <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david moved this series of amendments with no reservations she is fully in favour of them and clearly hopes to carry them <e> <s> conversely the noble lord lord joseph has put the committee in something of a difficulty <e> <s> he told us that he really prefers another batch of amendments which we are not at the moment discussing but which if we reach them we shall listen to with great interest <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord the leader of the house help us further <e> <s> he has explained to us the technical reasons why it is not possible for the noble lords lord peston and lord joseph to move these amendments <e> <s> can he give us an assurance that through the usual channels attempts will be made to see that these amendments or their equivalents can come up at report stage at a suitable time so that they can be fully discussed <e>", "<cs> the amendment is important in that the noble lord lord peston has introduced for the first time this evening the question of resources for the implementation of the national curriculum assuming that it stands in the form that the government propose <e>", "<cs> we seem to have another rather ill-assorted series of amendments <e> <s> i should like to revert to the general scope of what was proposed by the noble baroness lady lockwood <e> <s> as far as i understand it she wants in amendment no <e> <s> to bring technology into the core curriculum and in amendment no <e> <s> to reduce the number of obligatory foundation subjects to four only allowing an element of choice as to the other three <e> <s> that seems rather a good idea <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness if i am correct in understanding that there is a whole group of amendments which appears to have been agreed informally between the government and the opposition <e> <s> it started with amendment no <e> <s> which was lord ritchies amendment and then came amendment no <e> <s> which was the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s>

the noble lord lord sandford said <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be extremely helpful if we could have some idea of the remit which has been given to the various subject areas working parties before we come to the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope it will be with the agreement of the government front bench and the noble baroness that i am both supporting her amendment and speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> which attaches itself not to the same place but to the national curriculum council <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a cross-curricular matter and with due respect to the noble baroness perhaps we should revert to it at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> the place i have chosen is perhaps slightly better than the place that she has chosen <e> <s> at present i am simply advancing this as a probing amendment but it is an important amendment on which i should like to have some answers <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down will she clear up one point of doubt

whether if amendment no <e> <s> is not accepted such practices can be carried on after the bill is passed <e>", "<cs> as the noble earl lord baldwin has already pointed out clause which we have not yet reached says that the core subjects and the foundation subjects shall <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble baroness mentioned the case of the parents in lewes <e> <s> despite the admirable intentions behind the movement towards empathy introduced and referred to by the noble lord lord joseph and which in principle i entirely support there is evidence that it has been abused <e> <s> a case in point is that of the lewes parents <e>", "<cs> i believe that a committee of both houses of parliament is considering how the event whether glorious or otherwise should be celebrated <e> <s> i used the word glorious in its popular conception and i am not giving it any other weight <e> <s> whether glorious or otherwise there is no doubt that it was an extremely significant event in english history and i believe that the teaching of it should have come before that of the history of the labour party <e> <s> perhaps it is a minor detail but in such circumstances i should have liked to have a choice about the course my child might have studied and the examination he might have taken <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i realise that she is not able to add anything now but perhaps she will look at what i have said and come back to me <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i undertake to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i have listened to the noble baroness with interest <e> <s> she talked about the very great freedoms allowed within the national curricular framework <e> <s> however many believe that these freedoms will not exist <e> <s> alternatively we believe that they might exist if some of the amendments that we have been proposing at an earlier stage such as allowing a menu of foundation subjects or matters of that nature had been accepted <e> <s> these would have allowed a great deal more room for this type of individual development <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps he will clear up a doubt in my mind <e>

"<cs> i agree very much with most of what the noble baroness lady young said <e> <s> whether the busy energetic people who are likely to become governors of schools will be able to afford the time for these training courses raises some doubts in my mind <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that the government might consider some other method of disseminating the necessary guidelines and information for potential governors in written form <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would help the committee if the minister could tell us whether it is the view of the government that the provisions of the education act concerning children with special educational needs will be preserved in their entirety under the bill at present before the committee <e> <s> if that is so does the minister not agree that in certain circumstances that could impose very difficult decisions on the governors who will decide on the deployment of the devolved finance <e> <s> if the obligations on the educational system with regard to children with special educational needs are the same as in the act then there may be some very tough decisions arising as to whether they are to be implemented at the expense of other things in certain determined schools <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord could clarify that matter <e>", "<cs> before the government give their view on this amendment moved by the noble earl i wonder whether i might ask him why he has not thought fit or why he finds it difficult to include the self-employed in his scheme <e> <s> it seems to me that there are many self-employed small businessmen who might be ideally suited to be school governors and it should not be impossible to devise some system which would take account of their particular position whether on a standard flat rate or in relation to earnings <e> <s> would the noble earl agree if the government smile on this amendment that some such measure might be taken for the self-employed <e>", "<cs> this seems to me to be a very sensible series of amendments <e> <s> they are of a nuts and bolts nature but at this stage of the bill it is very important that the nuts and bolts work <e> <s> i support the amendments <e>", "<cs> the right

look at it there is little variety in the bill choice i submit equals variety <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hylton has largely said what i wished to say <e> <s> it seems totally illogical to include

offered by the noble baroness in her speech but i must say that they seem to be restricted to a very modest level of interim funding while the institutions concerned seek private sponsorship <e>",

lords it does not seem to me that this is the right bill on which to raise a wide-ranging discussion on the future funding of the national health service <e> <s> but it is valid to criticise the introduction of the new charges under the bill at a time when a major government survey of the methods of funding the service is under way <e> <s> there are many views and variants in the air which we

clause <e> <s> as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on aids i am usually pretty well apprised of such matters but i am bound to say that i came across the clause for the first time this afternoon <e> <s> it seems to me that the government ought perhaps to have thought about the matter sooner and produced it at an earlier stage of the bills proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down we are on report and i should not abuse the rule he mentioned the authority of a medical practitioner as being the key control in the case of private clinics <e> <s> does he also agree that the availability of pre-test counselling is a key control which the government should seek to impose upon such private clinics <e> <s> the second point which i do not believe he answered was what requirements will be made of private clinics to report unnamed results to aid in the epidemiological plotting of the disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked two questions <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the key control as being the authority of a general medical practitioner <e> <s> i asked whether he agreed that another key control would be the availability of pre-test counselling in a private clinic <e> <s> my second point referred to the epidemiological reporting of the results on an unnamed basis <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister write to me on my final point <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of newspaper reports that only had been disbursed by th october will the government bring pressure to bear on the trustees to see that they get on with processing this money which after

of the measures in this statement in particular those concerning cold weather and the motability improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble viscount for repeating that important statement <e> <s> the urgent need in higher education as has been said by all speakers so far is to widen access and to increase the age participation rate <e> <s> despite its relative generosity compared with other countries the present grant system has not succeeded in encouraging participation by lower income families <e> <s> the parental contribution element often causes family friction in higher income groups <e> <s> to restore the eroded value of grants and expand higher education at the same time would be enormously expensive <e> <s> we therefore accept that some reform is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will forgive me if i do not follow previous speeches on the very important series of home office bills which were mentioned in the gracious speech nor indeed the noble earl lord perth in his very natural concern with scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that her answer means that the situation remains the same as that outlined in the written answer given to me by the noble lord lord glenarthur on th april <e> <s> he stated that <e>", "<cs> my lords does that not therefore mean that the gibraltar government are failing to implement the governments policy of becoming more self-supporting by passing over the benefits which would accrue to them from that arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord put a percentage figure on the take-up of family credit and in so far as there is a shortfall can he say what steps the government are taking to remedy that <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for explaining the orders with his usual lucidity <e> <s> i have only three points to make <e> <s> the first concerns the allocation to the <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench we should like to be associated with the remarks made by the noble lord the government chief whip and the other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> we much appreciate the noble lords good wishes to his political opponents which we warmly reciprocate for the period of the truce before us <e> <s> we should like to be especially associated with the words of appreciation for our staff without whom we could not function and we thank them for their tremendous long-suffering patience with us <e> <s> finally we should like to express our great appreciation for the work done by the yeoman usher of the black rod <e> <s> he has been in post for years and we shall certainly miss him sorely <e>", "<cs> perhaps it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to that amendment which bites on the same line and touches on the same subject matter <e> <s> the amendment seeks to bring greater clarity i think i heard the noble and learned lord refer to the need for greater specificity to the grounds for taking care proceedings and to reduce the likelihood of an order being made on inadequate grounds <e> <s> after all the aim must always be to ensure that the removal of children from their natural parents takes place only as a last resort <e>", "<cs> i am happy to assure the noble baroness that her comparison is precisely what is contemplated in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for what he has said about the monitoring of the social fund <e> <s> i wish to put it on record that the community grant element in that fund is restricted in the first place to people moving out of institutions or residential care <e> <s> secondly it is restricted to vulnerable groups such as the disabled the elderly the mentally ill the handicapped and the chronically sick <e> <s> thirdly it is restricted to families under stress the category i believe that will probably most apply in the case of children being taken into care <e>", "<cs> in view of those remarks i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think am the first layman to speak in this debate <e> <s> that is perhaps a rather daunting prospect since all five previous speakers have been luminaries of the medical profession <e> <s> of course this bill concerns us all as members of the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this bench should also like to thank the noble lord for repeating this extremely important statement <e> <s> in some respects the tone of the statement is rather strange <e> <s> on the first page it refers to a change of pace rather than any fundamental change of direction yet on the last page as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has already pointed out it claims to be the most formidable programme of reform in the history of the nhs <e> <s> those two statements do not appear to be entirely compatible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his reply <e> <s> on the question of the european conventions of course i accept what he has said <e> <s> i take the point that a court might well regard it in the best interests of the child to remain on foreign soil after a certain time <e> <s> however he also said that this is a strong ground to encourage people to get on with the matter quickly <e> <s> that takes me back to my initial difficulty <e> <s> in the absence of an order it may be extremely difficult to do so <e> <s> therefore while i fully accept what he says about this position on this matter i am not sure that it entirely helps the problem that i am addressing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to read very carefully what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> was also expecting some concrete examples in which the vigilance of the court has been eluded which did not reach me in time <e> <s> therefore the most sensible thing for me to do is to read the evidence when i receive it and possibly come back on third reading <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord stewart of fulham for introducing this important debate <e> <s> it takes me back like a familiar tune to the debates which took place in your lordships house during the passage of what is now the education reform act <e> <s> noble lords may remember that we on these benches did not agree with the other opposition parties on every amendment <e> <s> once or twice we voted with the government when we thought that they were right producing shock-horror reactions on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the islington sixth form centre of which i have the honour to be a governor has achieved a very impressive increase in the staying-on rate through an imaginative mixture of academic vocational and craft subjects <e> <s> would he agree that that is the way to go ahead rather than making a rigid divide between the school and the fe system which is rather the tendency of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady turner to whom we are so indebted has cast her net wide <e> <s> i shall concentrate on only one area of her motion namely community care particularly as it affects the elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down again will he remind the house of what his noble friend lord hesketh said on st february about community care because some of us were not in the house <e> <s> as that was the ministers only reference to the topic does he not agree that that was a slightly dismissive treatment of a matter which falls squarely within the terms of the motion <e> <s> are we not entitled to a straight answer on the griffiths report <e> <s> it is not a frivolous question <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asking the minister to reply to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in the debate on the order and i shall not do so at length <e> <s> however i am impelled to make two or three comments as a result of a letter received today from the association of district councils of which i have the honour to be vice-president <e> <s> practically all the points of substance have been made by the noble lords lord graham of edmonton and lord tordoff <e> <s> one objection that has leapt to my eye is the case of a couple with two children under the age of <e> <s> they would be penalised if they had a third bedroom <e> <s> as a result of the order a school child studying for a-levels would be expected to share a room with a toddler <e> <s> can your lordships imagine that with the complexities which now face students studying for a-levels and gcses <e> <s> there would be inadequate study space in the home and from the educational point of view that is a strong objection <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is to write to the noble lord lord tordoff on that point will he send a copy of the letter to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the griffiths report has been in the hands of the government for more than a year <e> <s> although we entirely accept that the issues raised are complex will the minister give us some indication of when we might expect a response <e>", "<cs> my lords i recently heard the secretary of state for education and science express a very ambitious aim for numbers in higher education <e> <s> he wanted to see student numbers double to million over the next years <e> <s> on that occasion mr baker applauded the polytechnics for their growth over the past decade <e> <s> he used that as something of a stick with which to beat the universities over the head <e> <s> in my view that is not a fair or fruitful line to pursue as the universities are changing and adapting too <e> <s> also it side-steps the main questions of how expansion is best achieved what the barriers are and how they can be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words about the so-called social dimension mentioned by my noble friend which has suddenly emerged as an elixir newly discovered by the labour party though not apparently by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and has correspondingly become the subject of bitter denigration by the government <e> <s> i do not believe that either of these reactions is justified by proposals for a social charter as far as we know them at present although we have yet to see the final version of the solemn proclamation of fundamental social rights that the commission wants to propose to the council <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on this bench i also wish to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> he need not worry that i shall subject him to a similar barrage of questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston was quite right to say that this is not the occasion to debate the merits or demerits of the scheme although we on these benches feel strongly that a graduate tax which was the scheme that was also approved by the vice-chancellors would have been a great deal fairer and a great deal simpler and cheaper to administer <e>", "<cs> i support mainly the amendment tabled by the noble duke <e> <s> as some members of the committee will be aware for the past two or three years i have had some connection with the problems caused by the aids epidemic <e> <s> it is particularly in that connection that i wish to speak briefly <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord considered that even if a social security bill is introduced next year which on past performance as the noble lord has said is extremely likely a whole year will have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> however is this not an excellent time with a change at the top in his department for us to pause and to take stock of a project which london may live to regret <e> <s> does not the noble lord agree that the whole concept of a victorian zoo with bored and under-exercised animals on view in cages is outmoded <e> <s> if the larger animals are moved to whipsnade there will be plenty of room for the excellent project of a childrens zoo <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take those factors into account <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear following the intervention of the noble lord lord peyton which one respects that we are in a state of considerable confusion <e> <s> some people think that there will be a theme park others think there will not <e> <s> may we ask for wider consultation <e> <s> after all this is not any old planning permission <e> <s> this is a major development in a royal park <e> <s> may we have the whole thing out in the open <e>", "<cs> my lords in one sense it seems superfluous to be debating these regulations this evening after the secretary of state has declared his intention to impose them and the decision of the family doctors professional bodies not to leave the nhs or to go slow as a result <e> <s> i assume that the noble lord lord ennals in accordance with the usual practice of the house is not going to push his prayer to a vote <e> <s> if i am right what the noble lord has given us and we must thank him for this is the opportunity for a few reflections on this less than happy episode in the governments relations with general practice <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege on behalf of this house to congratulate the noble lord lord walton of detchant on his lucid and authoritative maiden speech <e> <s> i had the privilege of sitting on a board chaired with exemplary firmness purpose and lightness of touch by the noble lord so i am especially delighted that his skills and expertise will now be available to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords this splendid noble lord if i may be allowed to creep in under that umbrella will certainly speak briefly <e> <s> many noble lords present in the chamber this evening will remember the passage of the mental health bill in <e> <s> that legislation subsequently became enacted in <e> <s> it is quite true as the noble lord lord mottistone pointed out that it had a strong emphasis on patients rights and on civil liberties <e> <s> moreover bodies such as justice were very active in promoting those aims throughout the bills passage <e> <s> most of us at that time felt when the bill was enacted that we had an enlightened act of which we could be proud <e> <s> that is certainly my recollection of those days <e>", "<cs> i came off the fence <e>", "<cs> my lords the background to this debate is sombre <e> <s> in britain per cent <e> <s> of children leave school at compared to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start with one point upon which i and my colleagues are in agreement with the government <e> <s> we agree that if a dramatic expansion of higher education is to take place there will have to be some contribution from graduates whose earning power has benefited from public funds <e> <s> however from that point on we part company with the government on two grounds <e> <s> the first is the nature of the bill which is brought before us today to which the noble earl lord russell has objected so eloquently <e> <s> he is right that it is an appalling bill which virtually cuts this house out of the legislative process <e> <s> it does not contain a single word of detail about the proposed scheme even in the schedules <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever may be our differences on education policy and i do not propose to follow the noble earl lord longford in his passage of arms with the noble lord lord annan there is one aspect upon which everyone seems to agree namely that the number of those staying on in full-time education after the age of is insufficient and that our student population as a whole is insufficient to provide the skills that we shall need to survive the full implementation of the common market and competition from newly industrialising countries with labour costs lower than our own <e>", "<cs> i have been encouraged by the general tone of the debate <e> <s> there has been support for the amendment or for the spirit of it from all sides of the committee <e> <s> several members of the committee made the point that the expansion of higher education for mature part-time students will be crucial to the achievement of that expansion of higher education as a whole to which we all aspire <e> <s> that point was made from all sides <e> <s> it was made by the noble lords lord glenamara and lord carr of hadley and the noble viscount lord eccles <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to me to be an important amendment and i think that the noble baroness has made an almost overwhelming case for it <e> <s> there are two bodies of opinion about this bill <e> <s> there is the opinion of the government who bold that the scheme which they are proposing will not impede greater access or deter wider participation in higher education <e> <s> there is another equally well-informed some would perhaps say better-informed body of opinion which harbours severe doubts about this and feels that there is likely to be a deterrent effect upon the expansion of higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness lady blackstone decides what to do with her amendment perhaps i may ask the noble baroness lady blatch to clarify an interesting phrase which fell from her lips <e> <s> she mentioned the governments intention that eligibility for the loan should be cast more widely than eligibility for the grant <e> <s> will she tell us what categories of student she has in mind <e> <s> is she thinking of mature students or part-time students <e> <s> that would materially affect the feelings of many of us about the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she will tell me whether she could write to me and summarise the position <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a report in todays issue of <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to begin with the nice things to thank the noble earl and the noble baroness lady blatch for their unfailing courtesy and for the extent to which they have tried to help in some of our concerns <e> <s> but they have been operating under considerable constraints as has already been pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill will shape the face of the national health service and the quality of health care in this country for several years to come at the very least and possibly for much longer <e> <s> even if there were a change of government it will not be possible to throw into reverse the whole of this vast and complex service nor would it be right to do so <e> <s> this places an important duty on us to see that the bill leaves this house with some significant improvements <e> <s> i think that is the way ahead that the noble lord lord winstanley wanted to adopt <e>", "<cs> i am fairly grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i should stress that i do not intend to press the amendments <e> <s> however i should like to clear up one confusion which has arisen <e> <s> he seemed to suggest that in these amendments we were detracting in some way from the role of the dha <e> <s> that was not the intention <e> <s> concerning the purchaser and provider under the proposed structure we would maintain the internal market because one district would be free to trade with another <e> <s> therefore there would be some operation of the internal market in some inter-district trading <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that clarification <e> <s> i shall study his reply with great care when it is printed in the <e>", "<cs> the committee is becoming completely bogged down with the question of representation <e> <s> i disagree with the noble lord lord rea in that i am in favour to a certain extent of the separation of the function of purchaser-provider <e> <s> therefore to that extent i am sympathetic with the government <e> <s> but you could not have any purchasing body in any other business in the world which did not actually have expert purchasers <e> <s> surely that is the point <e>

noble lord lord nelson of stafford <e> <s> i should like to quote but one passage from the report <e> <s> paragraph reads <e>", "<cs> i have a slight difficulty with these amendments <e> <s> they are less prescriptive in form than the idea that was originally discussed of an experiment in two regions and over a defined period of three years <e> <s> to that exent i find the main amendment more attractive <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston was right to refer to the group of amendments as dealing with quality of service and the amendment

accreditation proposals which i and the noble lord lord walton put forward <e> <s> she did not mention them in her reply <e> <s> as they are the least bureaucratic and the most economical of all those which have been proposed it would be interesting to have the preliminary view of the government on the matter before we decide what to do at the next stage of the bills proceedings <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support the amendment <e> <s> in times gone by my party had a commitment to a national health service development fund with the somewhat ambitious sum of million <e> <s> various national health <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies would it assist the committee if the government were to issue a statement on which sections of the consolidation act are not repealed under this bill <e> <s> there seems to be an area of doubt <e> <s> there are various references in the schedule but it seems to me from reading the act which is still in force that section involves the requirement on the secretary of state to provide a comprehensive national health service for the united kingdom or perhaps for england and wales i do not remember the exact words <e> <s> those sections of the act presumably remain in force <e> <s> much confusion would be removed if the government would tell us what legislation has been repealed and what has not <e>", "<cs> i have a certain amount of anxiety on this point although i support the idea of the fund-holding practice in principle because i believe that it can lead to considerable extension of the flexibility of primary care <e> <s> however i am rather anxious about the situation when very expensive therapeutic drugs have to be prescribed <e> <s> in my capacity as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on aids i am thinking particularly of a drug like zidovudine which may be prescribed for someone who is hiv-positive or an aids sufferer <e> <s> that drug will have the effect of keeping such a person out hospital <e> <s> of course hospitalisation would incur far higher costs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble lord lord monson

tremendous howlers can pass under ones nose without one noticing them <e> <s> the noble lord is perfectly correct <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> section of the local government finance act concerns not so much the purely audit function of the audit commission but the studies which it is able to make on aspects of government policy <e> <s> i tend to agree that the word merits is perhaps inappropriate in regard to questioning the merits of the policy objectives of the secretary of state <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peston said that is not the intention <e> <s> but it seems to be rather cutting ones nose to spite ones face not to listen to a watchdog when it says hey secretary of state have you thought about this <e> <s> the secretary of state might be inclined to say that it was an interesting suggestion <e> <s> if section studies are not available for the national health service that situation cannot develop <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> members of the committee may recall hat when we last discussed this topic i moved an amendment concerning the accreditation of hospitals <e> <s> i was supported by the noble lord lord walton of detchant <e> <s> i believe that many people considered that to be a much weaker amendment than the one which the noble lord lord young of dartington is now proposing <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord

disorder covers both the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill <e> <s> i read the clause as meaning that the mentally handicapped are excluded from the bill <e> <s> if the government are going to re-examine it i hope that they will bear that point in mind <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord henley replies to the debate perhaps he will clear up something for me <e> <s> he mentioned that there were to be increases in income support in the three bands of and respectively <e> <s> i believe he said that that would affect people and would cost about million <e> <s> but he also said that the social security bill which we have not yet discussed will give the secretary of state powers to take local conditions into account when setting levels of income support <e>", "<cs> i find it hard to imagine that the government could actually refuse this amendment for the reasons which have already been well stated <e> <s> one consideration that we must take into account i hope this is in the governments mind is the sheer volume of the number of people affected <e> <s> according to a reputable article in <e>", "<cs> i always listen with great respect to everything said by the noble baroness lady faithfull about social services <e> <s> however on this occasion i am not inclined to follow her <e> <s> she is quite correct that the government proposals for arms length inspection units have some positive features <e> <s> they would inspect and report on both local authority and independent residential homes <e> <s> it was intended that they should include inspectors recruited from outside the social services department and from former home owners <e> <s> therefore there are certain encouraging developments <e>", "<cs> my understanding the noble baroness will correct me if i am wrong is that the inspectorate is responsible to the secretary of state but that it cannot initiate inspections of its own volition it has to be called in by local authorities which desire to have their services looked at <e> <s> is not that the current position <e> <s> if so have the government any plans for strengthening the role and the powers of the inspectorate <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to lengthen this discussion but my name is attached to the amendment and i fully support it <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do will what the minister has just said extend to homes with fewer than four residents <e> <s> have i understood her correctly <e> <s> subsection includes the words <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord peston indicated in his opening remarks amendment no <e> <s> c to which i am speaking has been grouped with the previous amendments on the ground that it concerns grants to voluntary bodies <e> <s> the amendment seeks to deal specifically with the problem of voluntary organisations whose catchment areas cover the boundaries of more than one local authority and who will find themselves in danger of closing as a result of the new system of community care funding <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the wording of the two amendments is practically identical <e> <s> however if the noble lord will permit me i should like to speak to my amendment as there is a slight nuance of difference <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like to speak now to amendment no <e> <s> which has been grouped with the amendment moved by the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> it is indeed almost identical in its wording to <e>", "<cs> i made that point <e> <s> i congratulated the government on including that subsection <e> <s> the query that i then put to the minister was whether that provision extends beyond carers and relatives to voluntary organisations such as the terrence higgins trust making a claim on behalf of the patient <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will recall that the objections advanced to previous ideas on evaluation and pilot schemes were that they would in effect paralyse development in other parts of the service while the pilot scheme or evaluation was taking place <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals knows that on those grounds i was not happy with his original idea that there should be a series of pilot schemes in two regions and that the remainder of the national health service should stand still while progress was monitored over a period of three years or something of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting discussion on the question when is an authority not an authority <e> <s> the noble lord lord henley is correct in saying that my principal objective was to pave the way in the not too distant future for the amalgamation of district health authorities with family health services authorities <e> <s> he assures me that subsection will not prevent that but that primary legislation will be required <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps encouraged by us they may do better next time <e> <s> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment on reading the evidence of the secretary of state to the select committee on science and technology on th april on which they issued a supplementary report <e> <s> i was struck on reading mr clarkes reply on page of the supplementary report by the extremely wide range of responsibilities put on the director of research and development <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel a little less grateful to the minister than i frequently do for his replies which are always lucid and often helpful <e> <s> first it must be recognised that the genito-urinary clinics play a very important role in the reduction of venereal disease and particulary in the relatively successful containment of the aids hiv epidemic in this country which has commanded admiration from many countries abroad <e> <s> anything which <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall see where we all are a year after the implementation of the bill <e> <s> we shall see whether waiting lists are much as they are at present as i suspect they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> he has tried to come some way towards me <e> <s> i do not believe that he has quite taken on board my argument that the average length of survival dictates the financial position <e> <s> i gave figures to show that in many cases if not the majority it does not reach six months <e> <s> it is an argument that ought to be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an important point <e> <s> we should like to see the form in draft before it is agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble baroness will be surprised to receive from me as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on aids a brief probe as to what the position would be if the therapeutic drug bill for a particular patient on a drug such as zidovudine for example exceeded a year <e> <s> that is a figure which i believe has been mooted in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i understand that <e> <s> however i am sure that she is also aware that there are therapeutic drug treatments which can be expensive <e> <s> they may almost reach that figure <e> <s> will they be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords as the only remaining member of the famous five who has not yet spoken perhaps i may be allowed to make a few remarks about the amendment <e> <s> i cannot remember who first coined the phrase famous five but it is very appropriate <e> <s> i believe that it is the first time that an amendment has had five sponsors in your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps it will become a precedent <e> <s> the whole issue of quality assurance has united those who dislike the bill very much those who quite like it and even some who like it very much <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i wish to remind her of my question about her statement that there is nothing to prevent the group from initiating activity <e> <s> i made the point that the governments amendment contained nothing to that effect <e> <s> subsection c of their amendment no <e> <s> refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord henley for his reply <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord mottistone that amendments nos <e> <s> and had to be read together <e> <s> the first restores the full power of section to the audit of health service bodies <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> then restricted that power in the way that i described in other words inhibiting the questioning of the merits of policy objectives of the secretary of state <e> <s> in fact it would not have undermined the compromise that was achieved by mr andrew mitchell in another place but would have slightly extended it <e> <s> that is my understanding of what the effect of these amendments would have been <e> <s> so the noble lords criticism of the amendment on those grounds does not stand up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has explained the two amendments so well that there is very little to add <e> <s> i have added my name through the concern that i have with the treatment of people with hiv and aids in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the guidance the noble baroness said that alcohol and drug related diseases will be included <e> <s> will hiv and aids conditions also be included in that guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments put forward in favour of the amendment are unanswerable <e> <s> however one broader consideration arises <e> <s> with present demographic pressures in the population it is inevitable that new people will come into this field with the aim of opening new residential homes <e> <s> the bill itself will mean that with the closure of their own homes local authorities will license more homes in the private sector <e> <s> it is therefore important that the undoubted need for more homes should not become an excuse for lowering standards <e> <s> that would be grossly irresponsible <e> <s> the expanding <e>", "<cs> my lords we have read many things in the white paper which are not in the bill <e> <s> i agree that not all of them can be there but the spirit of some of them could perhaps have been reproduced rather more accurately on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> she has stated that the matter that i have raised will form part of guidance <e> <s> she has given me some slight reassurance on the strength that is to be attached to it <e> <s> i shall read carefully what she has said and i shall read the draft and decide whether it is necessary to come back to the matter at third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words about amendment no <e> <s> ba which has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord has recognised the importance of the continuity of care across boundaries <e> <s> however i do not think that the rest of his response was quite what i had hoped for <e> <s> i take his point that a change of circumstances may ultimately not lead to the same assessment because residential accommodation may turn into day care or vice versa <e> <s> but what worries me is his suggestion that an application should be made in good time for assessment <e> <s> i do not know how long on average those assessments will take <e> <s> in an earlier amendment a time limit was suggested which so far as i know has not been accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords the previous debate to which the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale referred hung on an amendment which i had tabled at that stage and as he said it was rather muddled up with a batch of other amendments which were not strictly germane to it <e> <s> i am therefore glad that the noble lord has put down a separate amendment this time and we can discuss it fully and without other complications <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness finally sits down perhaps she will explain how money can change hands if confidentiality is of the essence and the person seeking advice is not prepared to divulge his or her place of residence <e> <s> that is the essence of walk-in services <e> <s> what incentive is there for the local authority to provide such services in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not persuaded <e> <s> we have agreed that medical records <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing the amendment the noble baroness has evidently not want to discuss it again today <e> <s> i want to make my position clear particularly as i have withdrawn a number of amendments which i had originally tabled to the government amendment <e> <s> when we last debated this matter on th june i put to the government a list of matters which i hoped would come within the purview of clinical standards <e> <s> they included control of infection investigations of deaths investigations of accidents readmission rates the use of blood peri-operative deaths waiting lists medical audits and hygiene food and so on <e> <s> on that occasion i was glad to get an encouraging response from the noble baroness who said <e>", "<cs> my lords as other noble lords have been asking questions of the minister before she finally retakes her seat i trust that i may ask her one further question <e> <s> my question is but a brief one <e> <s> none of us wishes to unpick the agreement which has been painstakingly stitched together with the royal colleges <e> <s> if the government were to refer back to the royal colleges before third reading and convey the strongly felt view of this house that this body should have power to initiate inquiries is the noble baroness saying that they would be seriously likely to reject outright a proposal which would actually strengthen their hand and that the whole structure would fall apart as a result <e> <s> i find that conclusion extremely hard to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to everyone who has taken part in this short debate <e> <s> it certainly has been a genuine cross-party issue <e> <s> i am happy to count among my supporters three noble lords on the government back-benches <e> <s> that encourages me to think that i am on the right track <e> <s> as the noble lord lord carr of hadley said the issue of confidentiality is vital to many aspects of the future health of the whole country <e> <s> statements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> she has gone a little further than her noble friend did on an earlier occasion <e> <s> i shall obviously read with very great care what she has said <e> <s> once the bill has become an act i shall keep an eagle eye on these issues and return to the matter in other parliamentary forms if it comes to my notice that matters are not going as well as they should <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her response <e> <s> in fact it is the second occasion this evening that i have been grateful to her <e> <s> i hope that we shall continue in this manner throughout the rest of the bills proceedings <e> <s> she has gone a considerable way towards allaying some of my concerns <e> <s> i was especially encouraged to hear that the noble lord lord pitt who is sitting behind me in the chamber is chairing a unit which is looking into such matters <e> <s> i was also glad to hear about the extra staff among whom there are significant numbers of people of commonwealth origin <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion the noble baroness has given me a little less joy than she did on the previous two amendments <e> <s> i suppose that i cannot expect to be lucky all the time <e> <s> however this is an important point <e> <s> i wish to assure the noble lord lord renton that there is no obligation in the amendment to make an authority carry out an assessment within days <e> <s> it simply means that a person has days in which his existing assessment can apply <e> <s> the new local authority obviously cannot be dragooned into providing an assessment before it is ready or able to do so <e> <s> the intention of the amendment is to provide a period of grace or a breathing period for someone who is trying to escape from intolerable conditions of harassment or threat <e> <s> that is the point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer first to the point raised by the noble lord lord butterfield <e> <s> i do not think that the amendment would interfere with the extremely valuable collection of epidemiological evidence to which he referred <e> <s> that would not be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another all-party series of amendments <e> <s> i confirm that as the noble lord lord ennals said the noble lord lord walton who had to leave to catch a train told me that the conference of the royal colleges was concerned with three issues <e> <s> those were publication that the advisory group should be able to initiate inquiries on its own initiative and that not enough importance is given to prevention under the general concept of clinical standards <e> <s> however the third point is not the subject of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the government team for their courtesy during the hours of the bill which the noble lord lord ennals mentioned <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble baroness lady blatch on her first major bill and the way in which she has handled it <e> <s> she has been extremely helpful to many of us <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have often been told that guidance will be given on various aspects of the bill will the noble baroness tell us whether if the provision is not to be embodied in the bill there will be any guidance that covers the point <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept that i have been in the printed paper office within the last half hour but the only thing i could acquire was the extremely defective and imperfect version of the regulations that was referred to by the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> if we were to approve this draft we should approve on page the noble lord lord peston pointed this out something which is entirely out of place <e> <s> part v appears to come before part i it is impossible to proceed on this basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the deputy leader of the house has told us that it is only a question of manuscript amendments <e> <s> what about page <e> <s> at the top of the page is part v and the heading <e>", "<cs> my lords practically all the points have been made which need to be made but the general point remains that the detailed administrative procedures set out in part v are quite unnecessarily cumbersome <e> <s> the noble baroness lady white has already referred to the existence of the ucca form on which a great deal of this information is to be found so why a wholly different process of an eligibility questionnaire is necessary i do not understand <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness enters upon her peroration as she has dealt with most of the detailed points that were made perhaps i may ask this <e> <s> will she take into account the point that i raised about the unnecessary complication of the particulars to be verified by the institutions of higher education with particular reference to passports <e> <s> if she cannot answer that question immediately i ask that she writes to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to make a statement but to ask a question <e> <s> the noble baroness will remember that during the passage of the bill a great deal was made of guidance and what would appear in that guidance <e> <s> a letter then went out asking for contributions to this consultation process by th august and the noble baroness lady blatch will remember that she asked me whether i would like to contribute to that consultation process <e> <s> is that consultation process going ahead or will anything that we have sent in simply gather dust on the shelves of the department meaning that we can spare our breath until later in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the minister for repeating the long and important statement and wish to put forward one or two points <e> <s> employers will now receive only per cent <e> <s> of their ssp costs as against an undisclosed future benefit <e> <s> has the scheme been discussed with any employers associations particularly small employers associations <e> <s> obviously the disregard in the care allowance rising to is to be welcomed as is the pensions premium increase <e> <s> however i notice that the increases for residential care at only and for terminal homes at only are far less than the rpi <e> <s> will the minister comment on that particularly the latter case and tell me why he believes it to be fair <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the real answer to the question of the noble lord lord merrivale is closely linked to the question of the airport <e> <s> if gibraltar were seen to be moving more towards sharing the airport with the spaniards there would perhaps be movement as regards the ferry service too <e> <s> are not the two matters connected <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that it is the governments intention to continue the waiting-list initiative that is to say to direct earmarked funds at this specific problem and will there be another tranche <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that if there is any change in the future and the beds are used as private beds the hospital will have to make a refund to the charities which contributed money for a different purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government make it easier for schools to offer vocational courses such as btec alongside a-levels <e> <s> that is apparently rather difficult under the terms of the education act <e>"]
