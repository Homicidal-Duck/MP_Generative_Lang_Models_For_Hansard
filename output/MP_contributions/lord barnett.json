["<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the kind reception that i have had since my introduction last week <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury who has just said such kind things about me <e> <s> i am very grateful for the early opportunity of making my maiden speech in what is an important debate <e> <s> i understand that i am supposed to be non-controversial <e> <s> that is difficult at any time but in a debate like this one either comes down in favour of full membership of the european monetary system against it or does not bother coming down at all <e> <s> either way is bound to be controversial to some extent <e> <s> i will promise your lordships that i will try to make this brief controversial contribution as non-controversial as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will forgive me for making another maiden speech so early after my first from the back-benches <e> <s> i do not know whether it has anything to do with the fact that my first maiden speech did not entirely agree with everything that is in my own partys policy <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to tell us why he is comparing the position with rather than with say an earlier year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord to convey my congratulations to the chancellor of the exchequer on having taken creative accounting to new heights despite his past criticism of my own modest efforts in this direction <e> <s> your lordships will want some time to study this lengthy statement and indeed the public expenditure white paper to which it refers but i hope that i shall be allowed to ask just a few questions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should be obliged to have one clarification <e> <s> he told us that on economic pricing on energy the industries would have increased the prices without any cabinet instruction <e> <s> is that really the case <e> <s> were there no discussions and no instructions from the cabinet to the industries <e> <s> would they have made these increases without any dispute between the secretary of state for energy and the chancellor or without any public expenditure discussions at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have the opportunity of opening from our side in this debate and i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter on choosing this important subject <e> <s> also i feel perhaps a little inhibited in criticising anything he had to say because i have always had enormous regard for him <e> <s> i served under him when he was chairman of the public accounts committee a position which i later filled and there is the fact that like myself he is also a former chief secretary to the treasury <e> <s> so it would be very nice to agree with him this afternoon <e> <s> however i am bound to tell your lordships that there is very little i found in his speech that i could agree with as i hope to indicate <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords really i am surprised at that statement from the noble lord <e> <s> i doubt whether the noble lord lord king of wartnaby would argue that it is only because of something which may happen this year next year or some time in the near future that he has achieved whatever success he has <e> <s> i doubt whether he would assert that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it really true that if the health authority sells a property the benefit goes to the treasury rather than to the health department <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his answer to his noble friend will be generally recognised as the standard formula of treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord really saying that he is pleased with the balance of trade excluding north sea oil <e>", "<cs> my lords so could the noble lord tell us <e>", "<cs> why the situation does not improve <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will wish to congratulate the noble lord lord diamond as i certainly do for raising this important topic <e> <s> it is sometimes thought of as being a highly technical topic only of interest to a small number of people <e> <s> in fact it is a subject that should be of greater interest to this house and to the other place than next weeks budget <e> <s> however it usually is not <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that the house will be grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> it is a pity that some of his friends in another place did not take the same attitude <e> <s> however as i say i am not a vengeful man <e> <s> the central question that we are debating is whether it is correct to say as lord diamond states in his motion and has repeated in his speech that the proceeds of asset sales are being used for current spending <e> <s> i do not think it will be disputed by the noble earl the minister that the government are technically treating the sale of public assets as what is called negative expenditure <e> <s> indeed on the question of asset sales i should like to quote from page of volume of the public expenditure white paper recently issued <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am about to say perhaps will not please the noble earl quite so much as he found it at the time when i did sell them <e> <s> at that time we were having a few little local difficulties with the imf and the outside world as my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones will recall <e> <s> but in the calm of your lordships house i hope that we can look at the situation rather more rationally than perhaps we did even around that very intelligent cabinet table at the time <e> <s> the plain fact is that the sale of those shares the sale of shares now and the sale of public assets now do nothing whatever for the real economy and do great harm if we imagine that such sales will help or affect the real economy <e> <s> let me make it quite clear that i am not suggesting that in view of what the treasury and civil service select committee indicated in their report namely that if it were treated in the way in which they have suggested it would mean that there had been a growth in public expenditure as a percentage of gdp the government should cut public expenditure <e> <s> on the contrary i think that the government should increase public expenditure in the capital field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to welcome this bill on behalf of the opposition <e> <s> it seems if i may say so to the minister and to your lordships a sensible if modest reform of an act of <e> <s> the minister referred to the situation as being a sort of historical curiosity <e> <s> i suppose if we were to dispose of all historical curiosities going back to we might be here for a long time but i certainly would not wish to detain the house on this particular bill <e> <s> it is welcomed by the opposition <e> <s> as the noble minister has said it is accepted and welcomed by the officers pension association and i gather everyone concerned with this particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the noble earl dens the truth of the situation <e> <s> is it not a fact that during the course of a public expenditure exercise the government decided to increase the external financing limits of the nationalised industries some of whom therefore had to increase prices higher than they themselves would have liked <e> <s> what is the difference between that and an indirect tax increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by joining the noble lord the minister in congratulating the noble lord <e> <s> lord obrien and his committee on a most excellent report with a first-class analysis which i personally found very useful and helpful especially the tables <e> <s> while i share his regret that it was not more widely recognised <e> <s> i hope that it will become more widely recognised for the excellent report that it is <e> <s> i would also like to join the noble lord the minister in congratulating the noble lord lord obrien on the way in which he introduced the debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that everybody who has taken part in this debate or who has heard any part of it will wish to join me in congratulating my noble friend lord beswick both on his excellent motion and on the way in which he introduced it <e> <s> i doubt whether anybody will disagree that it has stimulated a remarkably fine debate made all the better by the intervention of my noble friend lord soper who made a quite remarkable speech which speaking for myself i thoroughly enjoyed <e> <s> i would not seek to emulate it <e> <s> during the course of my remarks i hope to deal with some of the practical problems of the day <e> <s> servants of the church are required to deal with these problems and to receive remuneration from rents and interest is something with which my noble friend would probably disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the noble viscounts comments <e> <s> during the course of my remarks i hope to show that that is very far from being the case <e> <s> if we were to judge by the state of the equity market now and say that everything in the garden is marvellous we should be very foolish indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the need to increase the limit as the noble lord the minister has indicated but i wonder whether he can tell us given the fact that inflation is scheduled to be at per cent <e> <s> by why he has chosen to increase the limit to rather than to say or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships will appreciate that the imf were very sensible to move away from gold francs to sdrs given that everybody in your lordships house and the country at large will understand the difference between gold francs and sdrs <e> <s> but i wonder whether the noble baroness can tell us what assumptions the government made in deciding to increase the real amount to sdrs <e> <s> i wonder whether at the same time she can also tell us how this compensation level for non-international traffic compares with other western european countries in respect of this particu-lar form of travel compensation for death and injury <e> <s> also what representations if any has she had from those who might possibly be affected by this increase in the level of compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the noble lord the minister said will he confirm that the governments own assumptions judging from papers issued recently indicate that unemployment will not fall during the life of this parliament <e> <s> in those circumstances would it not be more honest to concede that situation so that at least alternative plans can be made to ensure that the present appalling levels of unemployment are reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords why then did the treasury make those assumptions <e>", "<cs> my lords as the existing simple economic policy for bringing down the rate of inflation has had the disastrous effect of rapidly and massively increasing unemployment could the noble viscount give us one good reason why the continuation of that policy will now bring down the rate of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister confirm that robson rhodes recommended that there should be a change to only for discussion <e> <s> they did not recommend that a change should be made <e> <s> would the noble lord the minister also tell the house whether or not we and small firms are to treat the experiment seriously when in addition to high interest rates already being charged the new scheme suggests that there should be an additional premium of per cent <e> <s> would that not seem to indicate that the only people who will apply are those who are even more desperate and that the losses to the public will be even greater <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister is saying that the scheme has been so successful why has he decided to increase the premium on the interest rate to per cent <e> <s> which will obviously make it much less successful <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of durability of which the noble viscount spoke does he accept that there is no way that this can be thought or said to be durable without control over expenditure <e> <s> nothing whatsoever has been done or said in this statement to deal with that vital area and in particular the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount confirm that we have agreed to increase vat own resources to per cent <e> <s> regardless of what happens at the finance ministers meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords as nobody really understands these matters other than the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne and perhaps the noble viscount who answered the question in the first instance would it not perhaps be better to ignore these aggregates as most people around the world are now doing and to concentrate as for example are the united states on expanding our economy and reducing unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the anxiety of the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne who asked the question well placed <e> <s> is not the answer given by the minister that the totality of borrowing is the same but that its constituent elements have altered in that private borrowing has gone up and corporate borrowing has gone down <e> <s> is not that the wrong kind of mix to put it in its simplest terms <e> <s> would not we prefer it to be the other way round <e> <s> do not those <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he intends to reply to the debates on the assumption that amendment no <e> <s> was carried and is therefore part of the bill and that every other amendment stems directly from what is now in the bill or whether he intends to say on every occasion that we must wait to see what the government propose to do <e>", "<cs> nobody is accusing the noble lord personally of being unhelpful because from my brief experience in this house i know that he is a most helpful minister <e> <s> but the noble lord lord boothby <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin with an apology to your lordships in that unfortunately a long-standing engagement may mean that i shall not still be here at the end of the debate <e> <s> i should however like to start by sincerely congratulating my noble friend lord wells-pestell on the excellent motion that he has introduced and the manner in which he has done so <e> <s> i am sure that the house will be grateful to him and also to the noble lord lord banks for his contribution <e> <s> i wish that i could say the same about the speech of the noble lord lord cockfield <e> <s> i fear however that it was both irrelevant and complacent to a degree that i have rarely heard in any debate <e> <s> that is not to say that i am not grateful to him for reading my book so carefully and quoting from it so selectively <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord and to his staff for the way in which they have selected the quotations <e> <s> i hope that he continues to derive much pleasure from the book <e> <s> the only things that he did not mention were the date of publication the title and the name of the publisher but i shall refrain from doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that it would be more honest to concede that on the governments existing policies whether stable or otherwise the governments own internal forecasts are that unemployment will continue to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin as others have done by extending my hearty congratulations on the quite excellent maiden speech delivered by the noble lord lord king of wartnaby <e> <s> we are members of different political parties but it is quite clear from his speech that we agree very much on the need to see a successful and strong british economy and british industry <e> <s> i believe that the house listened to him with enormous interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i perfectly understand <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i am sure they would rather have had an opportunity to tell the government what they thought of them on an earlier occasion but it will come equally well on st august <e>", "<cs> let us pretend that we are in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not overlook that <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> one must recognise that as a straight fact <e> <s> commodity prices have been held very low but the chancellor was aware of that too when he made his economic forecast <e> <s> it has not been just in the last week or two that commodity prices have reached their present levels <e> <s> they are low and one is aware of that <e> <s> what i am saying is that with some of the things that have happened to exchange rates and interest rates and other factors in the economy it is almost inevitable that inflation will be somewhat higher <e> <s> i am not for a moment suggesting that it will rise back to some of the very high levels that we have known in the past but certainly it is bound to be higher than the chancellors forecast on which he based his assumptions <e> <s> that is a serious matter for the economy which we have to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very interesting point but in the interests of fiscal neutrality would it not have been simpler to scrap this allowance <e>", "<cs> just look at the economy my lords <e>", "<cs> that was five years ago my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords noting that the noble earl endorses the views of his right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy does he also endorse the views of the chancellor of the exchequer that virtually any expense would be worthwhile on an industrial dispute no matter at what level in order to ensure the closure of what he calls uneconomic pits <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that some of us listened with some astonishment to the speech we have just heard from the noble lord lord cockfield <e> <s> i know the sun was shining at least it was when we started but the degree of complacency was quite unbelievable <e> <s> the speech would have been listened to with outrage and astonishment by the near million people outside who do not share his complacency because they are not free to work <e> <s> really it was a quite astonishing catalogue of complacency one that has rarely been heard in this house i should have thought or indeed in any other <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> i have always told the noble lord that we should pretend that we are in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not saying that but i do not know whether those comments obviate the need for the noble lord to make a speech later <e> <s> there will be some who will hope that that will be the case <e> <s> i certainly was not advocating what the noble lord has put forward <e> <s> i was careful to say that i do not believe that joining the full exchange rate mechanism of the ems is a panacea or a full answer <e> <s> there are still other problems which face this country and which would face this country whether we were in or out <e> <s> but i do believe that it would be of some help <e> <s> i know that the noble lord is a great supporter of mr gordon pepper and so he will be very interested in the second suggestion of mr pepper which i propose to quote for his benefit and i hope for the benefit of the noble lord lord cockfield and the house <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl mean that there are no circumstances in which we shall join the exchange rate mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords answer mean that the government have no intention of imposing vat on construction work <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble earl in congratulating the mover and seconder of the motion for a humble address <e> <s> i am sure that all who heard or read their speeches will have welcomed them <e> <s> i also join with him in congratulating the noble earl lord stockton and welcoming in advance the speech which i am sure everyone is waiting to hear <e> <s> for my part i am grateful to him for adding slightly to the audience we might otherwise have had <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate this afternoon is about efficiency in government and the civil service <e> <s> i must say we have just had a devastating example of how not to plan public expenditure <e> <s> i should like to begin my remarks if i may by joining in the congratulations offered by the noble earl to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in choosing this subject for debate today <e> <s> i am also very happy indeed to follow him as i have followed him both as chief secretary to the treasury and as chairman of the public accounts committee <e> <s> if i may say so i was delighted to do so in both those roles <e> <s> like him in both those roles my experience was that i found the civil servants who were working for me at that time were loyal efficient and dedicated <e> <s> that applied to both private secretaries and to other officials <e> <s> certainly they showed great impartiality of a political kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear the noble earl say hear hear <e> <s> because that is not quite what he said if i may quote him in an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the noble earl was better today and i am delighted to have the withdrawal of his article in <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been quite a remarkable debate and i should like to begin as others have done by congratulating the noble earl lord kinnoull on introducing it to your lordships house <e> <s> a number of your lordships and the noble lady lady saltoun have supported the coin although i must say that i thought the strongest case was made by the noble lady lady saltoun who said that you could save a life by maintaining the coin <e> <s> as i have said it has been a fascinating debate <e> <s> about the only case that i can think of for justifying maintaining the coin as opposed to the note is if i thought that a lot of people were going to be shot in their pockets <e> <s> this has also been a well-informed debate because among those who have contributed has been the noble lord lord obrien who actually signed the notes for so many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted particularly what the noble lord said perhaps longer than months so presumably this matter has been <e>", "<cs> my lords do i take it that the noble earl the minister is not giving us the full figures and that the reason for not giving them is nothing to do with national security <e> <s> does he recall the words of his right honourable friend the chancellor who said some time ago that he considered the cost of the strike a worthwhile investment in financial terms <e> <s> would the noble earl rather not agree as a civilised man that the whole dispute and the closure of uneconomic pits could have been carried out much more cost-effectively at a minute percentage of the present cost and without doing such enormous damage if it had not been for the provocative appointment of mr ian macgregor <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the congratulations to the noble lord lord diamond for initiating this important debate <e> <s> i found his views somewhat unusually extremist in seeking to blame the government for almost everything under the sun including what has happened to the exchange rate <e> <s> i was rather surprised <e> <s> i am sure his leader would not like it <e> <s> i wish that i could agree with the noble viscount lord trenchard in the qualified guarded optimism he expressed about the state of british industry <e> <s> while you can do a lot with statistics there is little sign that british industry is proving to be as competitive as he seemed to imply <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl says when we can afford them <e> <s> it is interesting to note that the noble earl feels that we cannot now afford lower interest rates and we cannot afford tax cuts <e> <s> i am sure that the chancellor will probably agree with the noble earl at least we assume he will although he would not want it known that his fellow economic cabinet minister has just told us that we cannot afford them because in a couple of weeks we may get them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is amazing how government economic policies can change by the minute in this country by the whispered utterance of the noble earl <e> <s> however we shall wait for th march for that <e> <s> we were told by the prime minister or at least as the noble lord lord diamond said in statements being issued from no <e> <s> that it did not <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord who is usually very certain of most matters i am not so certain about this <e> <s> i was quoting the prime minister having indicated that the markets feared that the government were weakening in their resolve on inflation <e> <s> they knew about the fiscal adjustment of course they did that was available from the moment the chancellor published his public expenditure figures and everyone knew that <e> <s> however despite knowing the fiscal adjustment as he and i know it like old friends there is a very big difference between that and the chancellor saying that he has it in mind to reduce taxes by billion <e> <s> that is a very different situation <e> <s> that is not only my view it was the view of the prime minister that there was this weakening of resolve <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is giving us a very interesting clarification of the governments policies in these few regards <e> <s> therefore is he saying that the exchange rate and interest rates are not something that the government intend to have anything to do with but they will leave them to the markets <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that the noble earl the minister has a better case than usual for not replying to a specific question would it not have been better and more straightforward had he said that in fact business advertising is already subject to vat since it is part of industrial costs and is passed on to the consumer in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord ezra on raising this most important topic <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend lord rhodes was able to give us a few words using his own long experience in industry and trade <e> <s> i want to make it quite clear that i am only too well aware of the problems that ministers have in making progress in this area <e> <s> anybody who has attended council of ministers meetings would not wish to criticise a fellow minister or a successor minister for not having made progress <e> <s> in those days it was not even ministers <e> <s> i am very much aware of the problems and i do not want to say to the minister or the government that they are to be seriously criticised because we have not got a fully integrated market at the present time <e> <s> the noble lord lord bethell talked about bureaucratic bottlenecks <e> <s> i wish they were only bureaucratic but i fear it goes rather deeper than that as i am sure he will <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware and i am sure he is that in the past the public accounts committee has frequently criticised the <e>", "<cs> particularly deserves to be condemned because he has i regret to say i very much regret to say planned a budget that will leave million if not more unemployed a year from today <e> <s> that is why although not asking all your lordships to agree to that proposition i hope that you will agree with what i have had to say <e> <s> my lords i beg to move for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an excellent debate and i should like to thank everybody who has taken part in it even if i did not agree with everything that was said <e> <s> i will come back if i may in the few minutes at my disposal to one or two words that the noble lord lord young has just said <e> <s> but i should like to begin as everyone else has begun by congratulating my noble friend lord murray of epping forest on an excellent first contribution to our debates <e> <s> i have known my noble friend for some time <e> <s> we did not always agree <e> <s> occasionally when i was cutting public expenditure he thought that i should not have done so <e> <s> nevertheless we got on excellently as i did with most of my colleagues at that time <e> <s> whatever else one can say about my noble friend lord murray his contribution to that government to the nation and to the nations wellbeing goes without saying and everybody who has contributed to this debate has paid tribute to that contribution <e> <s> speaking for myself and i am sure for everyone else i am delighted to see my noble friend looking so much better fully restored to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply to some of the points that have been made in the debate <e> <s> i am sorry the noble viscount disagrees with me but i should like to say one or two things about what the noble lord lord young has just said <e> <s> i hope he will not mind that <e>", "<cs> my lords the other point i should like to take up which came from the noble lord lord young is his reference to the need for low unit costs <e> <s> of course he is quite right that is the need <e> <s> but he like others constantly talks about the need for low wages <e> <s> you can have very high wages and low unit costs as he himself concedes and indeed in west germany one sees that is the situation <e> <s> i see i am wearing out the patience of some noble lords <e> <s> it only remains <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too well aware of the noble viscounts record on the subject of patience and impatience and i appreciate what he says <e> <s> but as i understood it i had until <e> <s> <e> <s> i have two more minutes to go and i was just coming to my peroration so he will be very happy indeed to hear that <e> <s> the point that a number of noble lords have made including the noble lord lord marsh and one or two others and which is central to the debate is that you cannot borrow your way out of unemployment <e> <s> that is a view with which i entirely agree <e> <s> but the same cannot be said about a psbr which is the same level as last year <e> <s> for those reasons i think the governments economic policies and the chancellors budget deserve to be condemned by anybody who is interested in the subject of unemployment <e> <s> the noble viscount now wants me to speak again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl clarify the governments position <e> <s> are the government seeking to persuade the ec that the government should be allowed to increase the threshold beyond the rate of inflation or are they content with the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that it is not the practice to hypothecate revenue receipts but would it not have been much more sensible in economic and social terms if in this instance the government <e>", "<cs> i believe the lord is in danger of giving the house a misleading picture <e> <s> he talked about public funding of voluntary organisations and quoted the example of the united states <e> <s> but the per cent <e> <s> to which he referred also includes substantial public funding because it is wholly allowable for tax <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble earl will say hear hear from now on because that is rather different from what he said the other day in my absence unfortunately <e> <s> in col of <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for saying hear hear but the noble earl got it wrong on two counts <e> <s> for that public statement he has written a personal apology to me for getting the page wrong but he got more than the page wrong as i have already suggested <e> <s> he was referring to page of the book <e>", "<cs> the noble earl really must not misquote <e> <s> i am sorry he has not got my book there <e> <s> what i was saying in that paragraph to which he is referring was that i certainly was in favour of using measures like squeezing local authority expenditure by reducing the rate support grant but nowhere at all in that chapter of my book or in anything that i have ever said and i hope that the noble earl will agree because i do not wish to pursue this at too great a length at this hour of the night would there be support for the idea of compulsion from whitehall where officials cannot be aware of the detailed needs of local authorities <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord will be too surprised if i tell him that i do not find his reply at all satisfactory <e> <s> indeed his reply seems to indicate to me and i should have thought to most noble lords a lack of confidence in the legislation itself because it is a fact as we all know that single-function authorities are more likely to turn out to be pressure groups for particular items of expenditure whereas it would have been much better if one had multi-function authorities county-wide <e> <s> but the government had decided by a simple sentence in the manifesto to abolish those without having thought through what they will put in their place <e> <s> but they did not abolish the functions may i finish the sentence <e>", "<cs> i shall give way in a second but if i may finish having decided to abolish authorities but to keep functions the government have not known precisely what to do with those functions <e> <s> that is why they are in the shambles that they are in at the present time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is in danger of getting as angry as his noble friend lord gowrie <e> <s> he should not get too upset about these things <e> <s> he must be prepared to accept that not everybody agrees with what by bringing in a few hundred members he was able to persuade the house to vote for that he is not able to persuade everybody else of the truth of what he says <e> <s> the plain fact is that i do not accept that argument and neither does anybody who has really studied the matter <e> <s> the plain fact is that the government are retaining functions and do not know where to put them <e> <s> that is why they have residuary authorities that is why they have joint bodies and all the problems that we are now discussing <e> <s> the noble lord knows the situation and he must not get too excited about it <e>", "<cs> i do not expect the noble lord to accept what i say <e> <s> we are debating matters about which we disagree and he must therefore accept that there are many others who do not agree with what he has said for the last three weeks <e> <s> the fact that he has <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elton will not be surprised to hear that i do not find his reply at all satisfactory <e> <s> however not wishing to upset him again at this hour of the night i will not press this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> this is a very important clause and i hope that your lordships will not mind if i say a few words about it <e> <s> in the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there must be very few countries around the world <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too congratulate the noble earl on this scheme <e> <s> that is rare as he appreciates <e> <s> with his other treasury hat on would he care to give an assurance to the house that none of these funds will be taken into account when the treasury come to make allocations to the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i asked a straightforward question and i am asking the noble earl for that assurance <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join others who have congratulated the noble lord lord thorneycroft on introducing this motion and on the way that he introduced it <e> <s> as has been said he did so moderately indeed he was so moderate that he was even kind to the prime minister who after all has not been altogether kind to her predecessors in government in either party <e> <s> so it was very kind of him to be kind to the right honourable lady <e> <s> but while he was moderate there was one phrase that he used which i hope on reflection he might even care to reconsider <e> <s> i took it down because i was surprised that he used it <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the way the noble lord has just put it and indeed i shall be coming to that <e> <s> i entirely agree with the way the noble lord has now put it <e> <s> my noble friend lord bruce of donington dealt primarily with the first half of the motion the process of returning parts of the public sector to the private sector <e> <s> i want to deal if i may with the second part of the motion which was dealt with again briefly just now by the noble baroness lady seear and a number of other noble lords that is to say how can we produce more efficiently as a nation how can we create the wealth which we can then decide in our different ways how to distribute <e> <s> that is the side of it that i want to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement made by the chancellor of the exchequer in another place <e> <s> it was a very long statement and there are lengthy documents to go with it <e> <s> also there is to be legislation so i am sure your lordships will want more time to study all that has been put forward in the documents and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the hear hears from the front bench opposite <e> <s> i leave aside whether noble lords who are now saying hear hear would persist in those arguments if they were sitting on these benches <e> <s> but the government and the noble lords who have spoken in that vein are wrong on the issue <e> <s> i accept that the government and both houses will abolish the glc and the metropolitan counties but they have not abolished the functions that still have to be administered <e> <s> they have proposed under the bill that such functions should be administered in certain ways <e> <s> i shall try to explain to your lordships that this is not the most cost-effective way of administering those authorities <e> <s> it is not only right that your lordships should consider these matters constitutionally but if we did not consider them we should not have a role to play <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly reply to the noble lord and others who have spoken in this debate let me make it quite clear as i did at the very outset of my remarks that i am not proposing to alter or amend or suggest to the house that it should amend the decision taken to abolish these councils <e> <s> that was not and is not my intention <e> <s> but as i pointed out right at the outset what parliament and the government have not done is to abolish the functions and services and we are talking in this debate about how best they should be managed and administered <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the noble viscount agrees with the noble lord lord cockfield <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i find the contributions of the noble lords lord harmar-nicholls lord campbell of alloway and in particular lord boyd-carpenter rather sad <e> <s> there seems to be a reflex action of support my government right or wrong <e> <s> one day they may find themselves in a situation when even the government will recognise that the amendment which is being moved so well by the noble lord lord diamond has some validity and should be accepted <e> <s> i hope this might be the right occasion for that to happen <e> <s> i must say to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter one of my predecessors both as chairman of the public accounts committee and as chief secretary to the treasury for him to lambast the noble lord lord diamond and myself over the growth and lack of control of public expenditure comes a little ill <e> <s> when i left office it was billion which i thought was a lot of money <e>", "<cs> my lords it was higher and i am happy to tell the noble lord that i managed to reduce it under a labour government <e> <s> i am obliged to him <e> <s> however i am particularly unobliged to him and to his noble friends for the way they have disagreed with the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i am a relative newcomer to this noble house but i must say that to argue that the traditions of this house are that we should not perhaps debate these things on gold cup day or that they come a little late in a bill no matter how good and therefore we should dismiss them is rather an odd argument for any debating chamber and particularly so for your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the opposition perhaps i may thank the noble lord the minister for his statement and for the lengthy white paper that goes with it which will obviously need a little time for study <e> <s> is he aware that the opposition support and always will support measures that will provide real help for industry generally and for small companies in particular <e> <s> the statement says that the country needs more jobs <e> <s> few will disagree with that expression <e> <s> but if the noble lord detects any scepticism in my remarks or anybody elses i am sure he will recognise that the gimmicks we have seen in the past such as enterprise zones have done little or nothing to help industry whether small or large and that in some cases they have been a positive hindrance <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> perhaps i may say to him that each successive piece of information we hear is turning this incredible affair into not far short of a scandal <e> <s> it was always difficult to understand how such a large proportion of a banks loans could be lost so quickly but now we are told there is to be a police inquiry and there is another possible legal action in connection with a claim against the auditors <e>", "<cs> i should like to say at once that i am delighted to support the noble lord lord gridley in <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> it is important if we are to accept the noble lords advice and leave it to report stage to know whether he is telling your lordships that the insurance company negotiations could conclude with giving the kind of assurances that other noble lords and i have sought in the debate this afternoon <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene as he was so kind as to exclude me <e> <s> probably he meant his criticism to say present company excluded <e> <s> but may i say to him that not only does the amendment not seek to wreck the bill it effectively assumes that the bill will become law <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has as usual been very courteous <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for the way in which he has responded particularly in his concluding remarks <e> <s> in those circumstances i am sure that your lordships will feel that the house should have an opportunity to consider the matter again <e> <s> because it will be a couple of months before we reach that stage i believe one or two points of clarification still need to be placed on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell us what has been happening to m m m psl psl and psl and which of them the government think is right <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot help but sympathise with the noble earl <e> <s> he has to defend the indefensible <e> <s> he did so this afternoon by choosing his own three questions to answer ignoring all the many others that are being asked not just in your lordships house but throughout the country <e> <s> as his speech showed the noble earl has to pretend that everything is getting better while maintaining that anyone who disagrees with him is being both irresponsible and party political <e> <s> if it were not that one had sympathy with the manner in which the noble earl addresses your lordships house one would see how ludicrous the argument is <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why the noble earl for example wants to support the government it is not because he believes it it is just because he is a member of the government <e> <s> that is the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i was going to deal with what mr manser said rather than with who he is and then perhaps the noble earl will deal with the matter <e> <s> in his booklet he says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl clearly was not listening <e> <s> he was looking at his brief <e> <s> i did not say that the money supply was too tight <e> <s> i said for obvious reasons the reasons i stated that you cannot measure it <e> <s> i do not know whether it is too tight <e> <s> what this goverment are saying is that it is not tight enough and that we must have higher interest rates <e> <s> that is what i said <e> <s> you can take whichever money supply measure you like <e> <s> your can take sterling m as a measure of the tightness of money supply and find that it is too loose you can take mo and find that it is too tight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has misunderstood what his own chancellor has been saying <e> <s> the reason why he has been seeking to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to the noble earl that i do understand that what the per cent <e> <s> rate of tax does to top pay hurts but of course if those in the public sector at a lower level on the salaries scale who have been spoken about in this debate received percentage increases of the same level as those granted by the top salaries review body they still would not be above the per cent <e> <s> tax rate <e> <s> we are talking about unfairness that is the case that has been made by all those who have spoken in favour of the amendment and it is something that the noble earl simply does not seem to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at the minister <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord tordoff made a straightforward and fairly simple case for which i should have hoped noble lords on all sides including ministers would have had a great deal of sympathy namely the interests of employees some of whose rights are being removed by the bill unless the amendment is carried <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would care to deal with this particular point he has talked about the great difficulties that there would be if employees exercised the option of this amendment but if there were such great difficulties about exercising the option why have the government agreed to give that option to employers who may equally exercise it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister really telling us that the treasury in considering the public expenditure exercise does not set external financial limits that take account of prices so as to ensure that the public expenditure figure comes to the one it had in mind in the first instance <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i do <e> <s> but can the noble lord the minister confirm for your lordships better information that the treasury in fixing these external financial limits is not primarily concerned with commercial matters but concerned with public expenditure exercises <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said earlier that all that the government could do was to create the right economic conditions <e> <s> the government have now been in power for some six-and-a-half years and they have created only a huge increase in unemployment <e> <s> can the noble lord say when shall we see any real improvement in those economic conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement made by the chancellor but perhaps will regret that he has to be saddled with defending it for whatever the chancellor says a record level of unemployment is hardly a vindication of his policies <e> <s> indeed one can only note with astonishment the briefest of references to unemployment in such a lengthy statement <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a lengthy debate and we have heard in the course of it three excellent maiden speeches <e> <s> the noble lord lord wolfson spoke with great clarity in a most distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> he brought to our debate the huge experience he has of running a highly successful company <e> <s> i know that all noble lords who were present to hear his contribution were delighted to do so and will look forward to hearing him speak again often <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate that the noble lord would not wish to be rude to his noble friend or indeed to anyone else would he not also agree that the plain fact is that with this year a exemption limit and next year a exemption limit there will be very few owner occupiers who will be paying capital transfer tax and equally if it goes to either a widow or widower whether it be million or more there will be no capital transfer tax payable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be obliged if the minister would rectify his previous answer because i fear that it may be misleading <e> <s> i am sure that the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell us how this fits in with government policy in relation to pay restraint generally <e> <s> will the directors concerned also be receiving redundancy pay <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking the noble lord the minister for repeating the chancellors statement <e> <s> i also welcome those parts of the statement which give statutory backing and strengthening of the rules on notification including the fact that it will be a criminal offence recklessly to mislead <e> <s> many people will be surprised that it is not already a criminal offence recklessly to mislead <e> <s> the statement also talks about appropriate penalties and i wonder whether the noble lord the minister could tell us what the chancellor had in mind in that respect <e> <s> however would the noble lord the minister accept that it was not the rules alone which led to the johnson matthey scandal but the failure by the bank of england adequately to supervise what was going on that was the real problem <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister care to tell his noble friend now what is the level of public expenditure as a percentage of the gdp by comparison with what it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the minister is prepared to express a personal opinion about one coin which may not be universally accepted or even accepted by the research body that has been set up will he accept that whatever is done about the coins something needs to be done about the notes <e> <s> for example will he agree that is far too high a level for a starting point for notes <e>", "<cs> my lords given the finite nature of the oil reserves in the north sea would the noble lord the minister care to spell out for us the case for selling more for less against selling less for more <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to say a personal thank you to all noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> they have already been referred to by the noble lord the minister in his winding up and by my noble friend lord williams of elvel in what i thought was an excellent speech as did many of my noble friends in the debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords surely even the foreign office must have some concern for the second half of the question namely world stability <e> <s> does not even the foreign office have some discussion with the treasury about the dangers to world stability the effect on the banking systems of countries like these in the developing world and the effect on the banks in the western world <e> <s> therefore can the noble baroness answer the second half of the question about the governments policy in relation to the implications to world stability <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that most people will accept that the chancellor made a not unreasonable assumption of dollars a barrel for and on the exchange rate that he had taken <e> <s> on the other hand does he also accept that if it turns out that the chancellor has been too pessimistic which may well be the case he will return to the house with a new budget given that he has lost on his assumption billion <e> <s> will the noble lord on this occasion press his right honourable friend rather more than he did last time to ensure that he does something for the people for whom he has responsibility namely the unemployed rather than for those on rather higher incomes <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister share the concern of the united states government about the dangers to the international debt problem and particularly to the whole of the banking system including uk banks from the collapse of the price of oil <e> <s> is it not rather silly of this government to sit back and do nothing at all while that danger exists <e> <s> would it not be better at least to join in talks to try to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble lord propose to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the judgment mean that we are now likely to be flooded with inflatable rubber sex dolls and the vacuum flasks that we read about in the report of the court <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm whether it is a fact that under existing law there is nothing to prevent uk manufacturers producing and marketing these products <e> <s> this is at the heart of the problem <e> <s> will he tell us whether it is the governments intention to introduce new legislation or to amend existing legislation as was suggested which is perhaps not years out of date in order to ensure that we are not flooded in the way that the customs and excise found so offensive to public morality <e> <s> in the circumstances would it help your <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be recalled that the prime minister was delighted to boast that the pound was very strong which it was in to <e> <s> are the government now pleased that it is lower <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us whether what she was saying about cost-effectiveness of public expenditure means that there has to be a net saving from this expenditure despite the fact that it could bring enormous benefits in regard to hypothermia the subject which the noble lord lord winstanley raised <e>", "<cs> my lords while no one would wish to accuse the noble lord of deliberately misleading the house by giving incorrect statistics he will know well that you can do a great deal with statistics <e> <s> would it not have been fairer to give the real figures <e> <s> the underlying fact is that the seasonally adjusted figures of unemployment show an increase <e> <s> would it not therefore have been simpler and more honest if he had simply told the house that on present economic policies unemployment will continue to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords if the management is that good why did not the government agree to the management buy-out <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to comment on a letter in todays edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept that the million that i quoted was not my figure <e> <s> it was the chancellors in the red book at the time of the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lords catalogue of statistics <e> <s> among them would he care to add what has happened to the average taxpayer during the period since namely whether they have or have not had their tax and national insurance increased or decreased <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister believes so much in the purity of supply and demand why is he spending billion in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is a question not of who signed the cheques but of who authorised the signing of the cheques which involved expenditure which was per cent <e> <s> greater than the marketing budget <e> <s> the noble lord said in his earlier reply that it was not properly authorised <e> <s> who authorised it <e>", "<cs> my lords will it not be sensible to caution those with limited capital namely the vast majority of working people in this country about risking very limited amounts of capital by investing them in shares <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall the chancellors first budget in which he made what he thought was to be a strong case for fiscal neutrality that is to say company directors should not have complex matters intervening in their decision-making processes and they should not be burdened with tax incentives which he sought to remove <e> <s> is it now the chancellors case or the governments case that the principle of tax neutrality has been dropped or that it is different as between individuals and companies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that this tax incentive will be for only a few years or has the principle really changed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not a little foolish to take too much party political credit for having reduced the net budget contributions given that despite all the juggling with figures which he announced initially in the net contribution was substantially higher than it had ever been <e> <s> would it not be better if we concentrated on trying to obtain major changes in the agriculture budget which would generally help this country and indeed the community <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting that the noble lords recent interview was truthful if somewhat insensitive may i ask him this question <e> <s> would he not accept that those who are having a good time are doing so at the expense of the unemployed given that the growth of earnings has been so much in excess of inflation and indeed of productivity <e> <s> in those circumstances what does the noble lord propose to do other than exhortation to help the situation <e>", "<cs> i must say to put it mildly that i was somewhat disappointed at the ministers reply i thought i had already quoted extensively in advance what he was going to say <e> <s> i had not seen his brief <e> <s> it is rather a pity that he then proceeded to read it out after i quoted what i expected him to say and then quoted the public accounts committee response at the time <e> <s> the minister talked about introducing commercial practice and said that it would therefore be wrong to accept this amendment <e> <s> but i made it absolutely crystal clear that neither i nor i imagine the noble lord and the noble baroness who supported my amendment in any way wanted to do anything about the principle of the governments bill in relation to commercial practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i should start as many do on this sort of bill by declaring an interest not as a director but as a lender or investor and borrower not necessarily both at the same time <e> <s> your lordships will have appreciated that the noble lord the minister was obviously obliged to go through the parts of this rather lengthy -page bill <e> <s> your lordships will be pleased to know that i do not feel i have that same obligation <e> <s> i have noted the reference to the new clause in relation to auditors that the government have in mind to introduce <e> <s> i would declare an interest in the sense that it is the same profession to which i have given some service over the years although i do so no longer in that way <e> <s> your lordships will i am sure be very interested in the problem that will arise out of the wording whatever that may be of the new clause when we see it in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been more accurate if the noble lord the minister had actually complained about the growth in earnings which are doing so much damage to the real growth prospects of the economy and the likely effect on unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether his answer means that once the discretionary payment has been agreed by the department there is no delay <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may try to persuade the noble lord to do so <e> <s> does his reply mean and it seems to me very reassuring which i am sure will delight your lordships that the contributions that the government make under this scheme are not cash limited <e>", "<cs> i am sure the committee will be delighted with the response <e> <s> if this is the way the government propose to proceed with all or our amendments we shall make very rapid progress <e>", "<cs> i should

legislation indeed i doubt whether they have ever been in legislation such words <e>", "<cs> if that is the advice that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor seeks to give then i am bound to say that my experience of obtaining financial advice would make me feel i would rather find it elsewhere <e> <s> i do not say that as a legal judgment <e>", "<cs> with the greatest possible respect if the noble and learned lord had heard what i said earlier he would realise that what i was saying was that professional solicitors acting for a house buyer whether that buyer is purchasing through an independent solicitor or through a building society would give precisely that security without the matter necessarily involving a conflict of interest <e> <s> that was what i was arguing <e>", "<cs>

improve competition wherever possible <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i say at once that i appreciate and understand why the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor was unable to speak in the debate <e>

appreciate that this is only a drafting amendment but i hope the minister will understand that for the rest of us in the committee this certainly applies to the opposition and i imagine to others when we see government amendments of the size and quantity that we have in the case of this bill there are nearly government amendments it takes us some time to check them to see whether they are drafting amendments <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord will understand that without going through the amendments one by one we cannot find out which are drafting amendments which are minor amendments and which are substantial amendments <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> it is difficult for us to work in this way <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister has probably gone too far anyway <e> <s> he is quite right it is a local planning permission matter but it could go to the secretary of state if whoever has been refused planning permission wants to appeal <e> <s> that is my understanding <e>",

involved today knows we have not in any way sought to delay the bill <e> <s> indeed we welcome the bill and if it is at all possible then we should like to get it on the statute book before the house

entirely take the point of the noble lord <e> <s> lord plummer and i hope we can still achieve what is required <e> <s> certainly we shall not do anything to delay the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the answer of the noble lord the minister mean that he would prefer those in work not to have it so good <e>", "<cs> it is a simple question that i wish to put to the noble lord <e> <s> i wonder

minister has given us may i ask whether he can explain to those of us who are less sophisticated in these matters so that we may understand more clearly why manufacturing output is still below the level of which was not itself particularly high <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to give us his definition of dubious schemes drawing perhaps on his experience of government schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> if he is inclined to carry out an inquiry will he bear in mind that there are in your lordships house some noble lords who think that anything to the left of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the chancellors difficulty whichever way he moves in respect of the underwriting <e> <s> but i am sure the noble lord will accept that the most serious problem relates to the tighter monetary conditions that prevail as the chancellor indicated in his statement and which would be even tighter if the accepted the advice given by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> i leave that aside <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the government are still committed at least in principle to the internal market proposals put forward by their former colleague lord cockfield <e> <s> if so how does the minister expect that to have a chance of succeeding without some degree of flexibility in the governments policies in those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords in returning to the debate on the european communities committee i am happy to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord plumb on a most excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will have been delighted to hear him and will look forward to hearing him on many future occasions given his expertise his knowledge and experience in this important field <e> <s> i certainly shall and i am grateful to him for the contribution he made to our debate <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i must tell him that the fact is that one cannot control it in that way precisely because of the reasons i gave <e> <s> one would need to have the kind of supplementary budget that we have had over recent years because there will be people within the agricultural community who as the noble lord would be the first to agree we must help out of particular difficulties <e> <s> so my answer to that point is to say that no that is not a solution much as i should like to it be <e> <s> as he knows throughout much of my political life i have tried to control public expenditure <e> <s> i did not have always the degree of success that i should have liked although i am happy to say that i left a percentage of gdp in public expenditure lower than it is likely to be in the current year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord hanson in his attempt to support the government <e> <s> i am always interested to hear his support for the government but i should just have thought that occasionally he might be slightly more discriminating in that support <e> <s> tonight even with his support he was not able to agree with his noble friend the minister in the words that the report was discredited <e> <s> i noted that he could not quite bring himself to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept the points that the minister has made perhaps i may ask him whether he can tell us why these price increases did not start last year <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a powerful case made out to deal with this serious problem by using whatever moneys are available to raise the tax threshold rather than to cut the basic rate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state accept that given the still fragile situation following the crash growth in the world economy including that of the united kingdom could yet be rather lower than has been forecast <e> <s> in those circumstances whatever the political case for tax cuts does he accept especially as he is secretary of state for trade and industry and given the worry that there is in industry about the balance of payments inflation and interest rates that at the present time it would be better to have an increase in public expenditure especially in the field of capital investment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that the figure of billion or approximately three-quarters of per cent <e> <s> of gdp which the chancellor has forecast for the autumn is not especially excessive in current circumstances <e> <s> indeed it is well within our capacity to sustain <e> <s> however does the minister also accept that there is genuine concern in many quarters in the city and elsewhere about the level of consumer demand <e> <s> is that concern shared by the department of trade and industry and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always had a considerable affection for the noble lord lord joseph and in another place i occasionally agreed with him <e> <s> he will not be too surprised when i tell him that i occasionally agreed with him today too but not a lot as the rest of my speech will make clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not disagree with that <e> <s> however the noble lord was not disagreeing with the point that i was making <e> <s> i do not believe that these entrepreneurs require a lower rate of tax than per cent <e> <s> certainly when most of them start they do not pay anything remotely like per cent <e> <s> in tax <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord the secretary of state intimated to british aerospace <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise the fact that those who had some responsibility in this area but who failed to do anything about it will readily acknowledge as do i that the chancellor has sought to grasp this very difficult nettle <e> <s> on the other hand will he also accept the fact that the new married couples allowance goes some way to negate the advantages contained in the proposal in that there is still a substantial difference between men and women <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that your lordships recognise that fact <e> <s> i should also like to put to the minister that in the red book the chancellor states that in the second year of introduction the proposals will cost billion of revenue and that is based on the existing capital and income distribution which will change when tax avoidance opportunities are recognised <e> <s> in those circumstances can we at least have an assurance from the government that that is only a transitional arrangement and that it is their intention to move towards real equality between men and women in the tax field <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister prepared to explain the underlying principles of this policy <e> <s> will he explain why it is apparently a good policy to build some new factories but a bad policy to build more <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clarify the somewhat ambiguous first reply he gave to my noble friend lord bruce of donington <e> <s> he did not ask whether the government wanted to restrict themselves in removing zero-rating but whether the government would be willing to compromise in any way on this subject in order to achieve the internal market by <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether the government consider that the present exchange rate against the deutschemark and the dollar is sustainable <e> <s> if so why were interest rates reduced last week <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that on monday he told your lordships house no doubt the house was pleased to hear it that the chancellor had intervened by reducing interest rates to maintain the sterling exchange rate at a sustainable level <e> <s> do his answers mean that the government or rather the chancellor still proposes to intervene in that way and that he now considers that sterling is at a sustainable rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the minister about the goodness so to speak of having more shareholders <e> <s> nevertheless will he accept that it is not necessarily a good thing for someone who has the whole of his career invested in his own company as an employee to also have a major part of his own limited capital in that company <e>", "<cs> i refer to the speech of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham a few moments ago on the constitutional or as he called it non-constitutional niceties of the bill <e> <s> the committee will be aware that we are all extremely fond of the noble and learned lord but i believe that we are also aware that not often and even his best friends will tell him is he the first person to admit that he could just be wrong <e>", "<cs> however when noble lords opposite cheer i hope they will wait a moment <e> <s> as i say the wrong question has been put to us today <e> <s> it seems to me that the real question today is should we replace a bad tax with a worse one <e> <s> and it is a worse one <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment further upon the point he made about fiscal equality and simplicity in tax system <e> <s> does it mean that he is personally in favour of improving the personal tax system in terms of fiscal equality in the same way as the chancellor has done with company taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state care to tell the house how he believes that personal tax cuts in the budget will be helpful to this years deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government truly committed to the internal market in if so why will there need to be any customs officials <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that most people believe that our reserves are more than adequate even to have a balance of payments deficit up to billion <e> <s> however while his noble friend the secretary of state is away will the minister take the opportunity to tell us what the department really believes <e> <s> without upsetting the prime minister too much is it not true that in the department of trade and industry there must at least be a twinge of concern about the fall in the level of exports from britain <e> <s> in those circumstances does not the minister believe that the exchange rate would be a little better if it were lower <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister place more reliance on the statistics of his department than apparently the department of trade and industry is prepared to place on its statistics in relation to imports <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the pleasure of hearing the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor open this debate <e> <s> i wish to welcome him to our financial and economic debates and if i may congratulate him on his delivery <e> <s> the delivery of the noble and learned lord is always very good but this time he did not try too hard to convince us that he believed in every single word that he was uttering <e> <s> however at the same time i hasten to assure the noble and learned lord that i agreed with some of the things that he was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the governments commitment to the environment includes a willingness to increase public expenditure where required <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that i broadly agree with his reply <e> <s> on the other hand in the light of what the chancellor said in his exhortation to individuals not to borrow so much money would he care to give some advice both to companies and to individuals on whether borrowing at the present time despite high interest rates would be in the best interests of a capitalist economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that i am vice-chairman of the bbc and i hope that the noble lord lord buxton and your lordships generally will understand if i concentrate my remarks on the white paper proposal as regards the bbc <e> <s> i should say at the outset that the bbc welcomes the responsibility laid upon it by the white paper the responsibility to fulfil a special role in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords given the governments philosophy in this sphere why is the minister seeking to interfere with a private companys judgment on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state recognise that most of us disagree with the views of the noble lord lord jay on the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state will recognise that most of us disagree with the noble lord lord jay and his views on the common market <e> <s> nevertheless will the minister accept that the chancellors views on a high exchange rate are unlikely to help the balance of trade either with the common market or with anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have the first opportunity to congratulate the noble viscount lord trenchard on a most excellent maiden speech <e> <s> if i could stop the clock so to speak i should be delighted to say more about his speech <e> <s> i am sure that it will be especially helpful to all noble lords because it was made with his clear knowledge and experience which will be of great use to all members of this house who wish to speak on and take an interest in this important subject <e> <s> i am sure that we are all most grateful to him <e> <s> listening to his speech was made all the more pleasant for me because i agreed with so much of what he said <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords will want to join me in congratulating him on his most excellent speech <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear him speak again on frequent occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that there would be an even greater benefit to the taxpayers and the community as a whole if instead of reducing the national debt the resources had been used to improve the quality of life for everyone by spending the money on the environment general infrastructure and so on <e> <s> is that not the policy of the chancellor <e> <s> is it not part of his policy not to reduce the national debt or is that not a policy with which the minister agrees <e>", "<cs> my lords declaring a non-financial personal interest as a trustee of the va may i ask the minister whether he will accept that it is better for the public to have an opportunity after some months to see the beauty and true splendour of the faade of the va which would not be available without those funds <e> <s> does he further accept that however horrible the noble lord lord st john of fawsley finds them the scaffolding would not be particularly attractive either <e>", "<cs> my lords could we take it that the reason why the government do not propose to privatise the bank of england is that they see no good reason to do so <e> <s> if that is the case does it represent a major change in government policy given that they have never before needed good reason for privatising anything <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us whether he or any other member of the government believes that mo or any other wider measure is an adequate measure of money supply <e> <s> if they believe that do they believe that that is the only thing necessary to control inflation regardless of other indicators <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that most of us would agree that the prime minister has every right to take advice from whatever source and to reject it or accept it as she wishes <e> <s> on the other hand does he also accept that it is positively harmful to sterling that next door to the chancellor of the exchequer should be working a man who clearly has alternative views to those of the chancellor <e> <s> would it not therefore be helpful if he could confirm today that it is not just a matter of entering the exchange rate mechanism when the time is right but that there should be two clear conditions <e> <s> the first would be very clear that is to say when there are free flows of capital and secondly when inflation here is broadly in line with the average in the european community <e> <s> are those the only two major reasons <e> <s> it would be positively helpful to sterling if he were able to confirm that that is the case and there are not other reasons why the prime minister would not allow the chancellor to enter the exchange rate mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords does the ministers answer mean that the poll tax is a tax rather than a community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords however inaccurate the figures can the minister confirm that it remains the governments policy to have those inaccurate figures in surplus some day <e> <s> indeed is it not correct to say that the governments policies are to reduce the amount to negligible if not nil proportions in order to get that surplus that the government would wish to have <e> <s> can the minister confirm that however long and painful it will be and even if the efforts go beyond a general election the government will still wish to pursue a surplus on the balance of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why further payments would have jeopardised the deal if these had nothing to do with the deal because it had already been settled <e>", "<cs> my lords as the post office is a public monopoly and therefore the responsibility of the government why should it deteriorate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return the minister to the question on the order paper in particular his first answer <e> <s> was he strictly accurate in that reply <e> <s> he said that he could not give us a figure because it was not known how much british aerospace would have available under their tax liabilities <e> <s> surely he will know how much relief was available under the deal regardless of how it was to be used <e>", "<cs> my lords can we take it from the noble earls first answer that high interest rates are good for business and that therefore the government have no intention of reducing them or seeking to reduce them <e> <s> he seemed to imply in that answer that was a good year for business despite the high rates of interest <e> <s> i accept that high interest rates can have an impact on inflation and demand but does he not think that it might be helpful to the government and make them slightly less unpopular if they thought of other methods such as taxation which might be less unfair and less damaging to the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister qualify the government policy in relation to personal savings in general and premium bonds in particular <e> <s> for example is it the governments view that they do not need to worry about the very considerable fall in personal savings from around per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of personal disposable income because total national savings have remained steady at around per cent <e> <s> is that the real reason <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there would be better prospects for a stable exchange rate if we were to join the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> noting the governments view that inflation is a key factor in their decision arising from the statement in madrid will the minister confirm to us that the exchange rate level at any particular time will not be relevant to the decision and that the only relevant consideration will be the inflation rate <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers reply can he explain why the monthly balance of payments figures are shown as being broadly in balance rather than showing a surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government have an exchange rate policy would they care to tell us whether interest rates are being kept high because of market forces because of the need to bring down inflation or because of the need to defend the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise and agree with the minister that without knowing much more about a european central bank it is impossible at this stage to decide whether or not one wants to join it <e> <s> however can he say whether the government are in favour in principle of joining a european central bank <e>", "<cs> my lords if the point made by the noble lord lord mccoll is correct and the minister agrees with it is it not a serious matter <e> <s> should it not be reported to the public accounts committee and the national audit office <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that he gave a very interesting answer just now <e> <s> is it the governments policy to use underlying interest rates for the purposes of calculating when the time is right to join the exchange rate mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the minister disclaim all government responsibility <e> <s> did the government not set a financial figure for the post office leaving it to the post office to decide how to meet that figure <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will not mind if i say a word at this point <e> <s> i have restrained myself throughout the debates on this broadcasting bill <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that as vice-chairman of the bbc i have to declare an interest <e> <s> i shall not vote but i hope that the committee will not mind if i say a word on the subject which as the noble lord lord wyatt said is very important <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not concede that we have ever distorted the truth in the way that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i was about to spell out how we try to ensure that the guidelines are adhered to <e> <s> we are debating the amendment that the noble lord has just moved and why i believe that in no way can it be an answer <e> <s> the reason is very simple <e> <s> anyone who knows anything about broadcasting knows that you cannot legislate in detail for impartiality <e> <s> it is quite <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i unreservedly welcome the governments decision at last to join the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> i equally welcome the change in the condition laid down in madrid to that of a prospective rate of inflation <e> <s> however will he accept that if the expectations about the prospective rate of inflation are not realised we shall be heading for very serious economic conditions <e> <s> therefore will he give the house an indication of the treasury view on when we can expect to meet the original madrid condition that our inflation rate should be that of the average in the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this a strange and in many ways a sad debate <e> <s> there is no disagreement on any side of the house that due impartiality is a serious matter in broadcasting <e> <s> that certainly applies to governors of the bbc even the wobbly ones to whom the noble lord lord wyatt referred <e> <s> as i have said on previous occasions opponents of the governments amendments including the bbc agree with the need for due impartiality to be taken very seriously indeed <e> <s> the essential disagreement i must tell the noble lord lord wyatt and the government is over trying to legislate to cover every set of circumstances <e> <s> that is the real problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting that the noble lord should mention that because i was about <e>", "<cs> my lords the straight answer to the question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish mainly to speak to amendment no <e> <s> but i should like first to say a brief word about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford in the spirit of what he is trying to achieve <e> <s> he wishes to ensure that we have the maximum impartiality in programmes both in the itc and the bbc <e> <s> as i said previously i do not dispute that indeed it is our primary concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear to the noble lord parliament is sovereign <e> <s> it can do what it likes <e> <s> i am not standing on that argument <e> <s> what i was saying was that at this stage at the very end of the bill to seek to override the charter would not seem to be a sensible way to behave <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister still recommend people to buy british goods even where the imported equivalents are much cheaper because of the present exchange rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the reduction in the deficit this year <e> <s> however it is still even at that rate running at over billion a year <e> <s> would the minister care to give the governments view as to whether their plan is not to relax the tight monetary control until the deficit is eliminated altogether or whether as with interest rates and inflation when we join the erm the intention will be to take the prospective reduction of the deficit into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house said that the summit did not take final decisions <e> <s> does he think that it was helpful to the national interest for the prime minister to take the attitude that she did given that she says in the statement which he has repeated that the national interest will also prevail among other countries and that the only two areas where she expressed disagreement concerned the date and the single currency disagreement and even that was qualified <e> <s> does he still believe that the attitude adopted by the prime minister was really in the national interest in view of the negotiations that are to take place in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in total disagreement with the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e> <s> i am not sure whether my noble friend lord jay would agree with what was described as the liberal element of the debate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend agrees with something i have said which is good to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made that clear certainly the committee has done so <e> <s> we must have a central objective of where we are going otherwise what on earth are we doing <e> <s> i agree with that central objective and that is why i say that these are non-issues <e>"]
