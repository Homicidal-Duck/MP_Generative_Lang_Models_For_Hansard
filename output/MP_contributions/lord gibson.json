["<cs> my lords i shall be brief because i think your lordships will agree that enough has been said already this afternoon to convince all of us that the bill will need a great deal of work in committee if it is to achieve what surely <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a real privilege to be allowed to be the first to congratulate the noble baroness lady airey on her maiden speech which was so perceptive so stimulating so interesting and at times so moving <e> <s> it is also a very exceptional pleasure to me personally because her husband was one of my oldest friends and our friendship went back to our schooldays together <e> <s> i only wish that he could have been here this afternoon to listen to her <e> <s> how proud he would have been of her as proud as we are delighted to have her among us <e> <s> i hope that she will deliver speeches on many and varied subjects <e> <s> we shall benefit greatly if she will <e> <s> before i address myself to the bill may i just apologise for a very long-standing engagement which i feel i must not cut and which may necessitate my leaving before the end of the debate <e> <s> i shall read with great attention the reports of the speeches that follow my departure <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> this fund is not going to start life with great resources <e> <s> it is all the more important therefore that its standing and authority is as high as we can make it <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support the noble earl <e> <s> there may well be occasions when this would be a tactical advantage although one appreciates the argument which the government have put forward <e> <s> it is a pity that the government do not feel inclined to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is obviously pointless to press this amendment <e> <s> we have been given very satisfactory assurances <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to say that i do not understand the point about the finance act which surely applies to the in lieu procedures whereas i was trying to extend the duty to the trustees in the exercise of their functions <e> <s> i should have thought that what was sauce for the ministerial goose was sauce for the trustees gander but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by asking to be forgiven <e> <s> i have an early evening appointment which might prevent my returning in time for the winding up though in view of the number of speakers it is possible that i shall return in time <e> <s> however if matters turn out otherwise i hope that the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> i will try to take the advice of the noble lord lord foot in his two committee points <e> <s> it has the extra advantage that it enables one to be brief which is doubly important with a list of speakers as long as that which we have this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i want to support the amendment for the very simple reason that the national trust of which i have the honour to be chairman holds as the noble viscount lord ridley has said these islands <e> <s> they are sites of special scientific interest grade and it is our duty to preserve the ecological balance on these islands <e> <s> the reason why i am particularly anxious to support this amendment is that if we were to accept the view and if the government were to press the view that this was not an appropriate bill in which to incorporate a minor change to the conservation of seals act and we had to wait several years five or more for that change to be made there might well not be a soil cap left for the national trust to preserve and we should find ourselves inalienably preserving some barren rock in the north sea which seems to be a pointless exercise <e> <s> i hope your lordships will give consideration to that point <e>", "<cs> i want to give general support to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord craigton <e> <s> there seems to be some confusion about how special scientific sites are actually designated <e> <s> i do not think that they are designated as such <e> <s> some noble lords who are present are on the nature conservancy council while i am not but i understand that the council simply tells a planning authority what it regards as a site of special scientific interest and the planning authority then has to observe that before giving planning permission <e> <s> but of course all those changes which take place outside of planning control are not affected <e>", "<cs> while i am in total sympathy with much of what the noble lord lord melchett has said and have been throughout these debates i feel that this amendment goes much too far <e> <s> that one would have to ask a bureaucrat before one could cut down a tree in a wood and that one could not thin the conifers in ones mixed plantations which are very likely nurses to the hard woods is really taking it to absurd lengths <e> <s> i for one would find it quite impossible to support the amendment as it stands <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak on this clause because i spoke about the need for a reserve power on clause and it can be assumed that if i thought it were necessary there i should think it necessary here but what the noble earl lord de la warr has just said provokes me into making a quick reply <e> <s> first may i say that of course we all agree that conservation by voluntary means is infinitely preferable <e> <s> nobody i think questions that and that is how it will be except in the very occasional case <e> <s> i think that it will always be like that if the reserve power is taken <e> <s> i do not think that we shall ever get to the point where we need to use it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to express not only my own gratitude but also that of the national trust for the governments understanding of our problems in the farne islands <e> <s> their acceptance of this amendment will make our task so much easier <e>", "<cs> my lords one always prefers the voluntary approach <e> <s> i very much hope that the governments voluntary code of practice will be enshrined in legislation but that in any case it will be adopted <e> <s> the issue is whether or not we should have a reserve power <e> <s> what i find so difficult to understand in the argument put forward by the noble earl lord ferrers is that we are jeopardising the goodwill of the farming community if we take a reserve power <e> <s> this does not apply in any other sphere of national life and i cannot see why it should apply in this one <e> <s> i want a reserve power so that the kind of case illustrated by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge cannot happen <e> <s> it will happen increasingly seldom if there is a voluntary code of practice but it will happen sometimes and it ought to be prevented <e> <s> i hope very much that noble lords will support amendment no <e> <s> a if it is pressed because i cannot see otherwise how we can halt the speed at which sites of special scientific interest are disappearing <e> <s> i should have been much readier to support only the voluntary code of practice if we had not been told at what a very great rate the sites of special scientific interest are disappearing <e> <s> we simply cannot afford not to have the reserve power but i hope that it will hardly ever be used <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i could ask a question to clarify a point that i do not understand <e> <s> is he saying that if we give the possibility of protection to all the sites we must have the resources to implement that protection <e>", "<cs> my lords in support of what the noble viscount has just said we must distinguish between the forestry commission of today and the forestry commission of or years ago <e> <s> in my contact with them through the national trust i find them extremely constructive about the landscape nowadays and that should be placed on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords i was pointing in the direction of the noble viscount lord massereene <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gisborough said the forestry commission already pay attention to the factors mentioned in this amendment <e> <s> they already have regard to these considerations <e> <s> on the general grounds that parliament should explicitly acknowledge this wider background against which the commissioners formulate their policy this amendment should be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave my views and those of the national trust for england wales and northern ireland there is a distinction i cannot speak for the national trust for scotland about this on amendment no <e> <s> and was chided i thought a little harshly by the noble earl lord mansfield for what he referred to as an unfruitful intervention because the national trust was going to be discussed later <e> <s> while we have received these very welcome assurances which i would point out are an improvement on our present position and therefore we have to be grateful for them i should have been happier if amendment no <e> <s> had been acceptable to the government because it would have brought under parliamentary scrutiny the directions about which i received these satisfactory assurances <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is quite right <e> <s> perhaps the minister would like to speak to this himself but his assurance was that planted land leased by the national trust to the forestry commission would not be assigned without the agreement of the national trust <e> <s> i think the present situation is that it could be leased without the agreement of the national trust <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> my difficulty with this amendment is that i cannot understand what the word it means in the second line <e> <s> the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> it could mean either <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave as the noble lord lord ross has referred to me may i make one point <e> <s> it is just that we are not talking about inalien <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to deal only with the environmental side of the argument of the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> if he is right in his belief that the chilterns are being raped for whatever purpose then the national trust would be derelict in its duty in not opposing to the utmost any proposal which would have that effect <e> <s> there are three members of your lordships house here tonight who are connected with the national trust lord esher who is in his place and is down to speak is chairman of the region of the national trust in which this land lies lord bishopston who is a member of the executive committee and myself who am chairman of the national trust <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord goodman appears to have forecast noble lords have clearly said it all <e> <s> it is late and it is unnecessary to repeat what they have said <e> <s> i want only to give my support to it <e> <s> the fact is that the recommendation coming as it does from a team for which in most of its manifestations i am sure your lordships have very considerable respect is so preposterous in this instance that i cannot help believing if i dare that the heat that we are generating is not necessary because the government have no intention of accepting it <e> <s> but i dare not think that altogether and we must go on generating the heat until we are sure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the national trust has always fought to protect land in its care when it is of high landscape value and will always do so that it is only when it is of low landscape value that it will consider granting a lease if a compulsory purchase order is threatened and that when it makes that decision it does so on environmental and not on political grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my own welcome to this bill in principle and to the idea behind it namely that conservation and related matters is a field in which the direct responsibility of government can sensibly be reduced <e> <s> i think in this field the job can probably be done better by independent boards whether of trustees or of managements leaving aside their controversy for the moment because they can be given a degree of flexibility which is greater than that which is feasible for any integral part of government service <e> <s> one has only to recall the straitjacket in which the director of the victoria and albert museum found himself not long ago when there were cuts in civil service manpower imposed by the treasury <e> <s> if he had had the authority to impose equivalent cuts in general expenditure at his own discretion he would have secured much better results in terms of the museums capacity to serve the public and at no greater expense to the public purse <e> <s> so the question to ask about this or any other exercise in dis-establishment is whether we shall get greater flexibility without greater cost <e>", "<cs> in putting my name to the amendment i am certainly not criticising the way in which our great museums now work and i believe that the truth is that both the systems can work perfectly well <e> <s> i support the amendment because it addresses itself to the central question of how policy is formulated and since we are legislating for another generation i should prefer to have a system that could be introduced where circumstances and personalities so permit <e> <s> i do not want to change the situation overnight <e> <s> what is proposed in the amendment would be permissive in the case of the co-opted staff though not in the case of the director and i support it <e> <s> the amendment addresses itself to the question of how policy is formulated <e> <s> it should be formulated as it is in all successful organisations with which i have ever had anything to do by discussion between the non-executive members of the board and the executive <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the concept of following the pattern of the museums <e> <s> if in fact it was proposed to give the new commission the power to determine the pay and the grading of its own staff with the freedom that i should like to see it given then i should be much more inclined to support the proposal that the staffs pensions should be funded separately but since they are tied in with the rest of the civil service because of the treasury consent that is necessary for the determining of their pay and emoluments it seems to me only logical that they should be tied in as regards their pensions as well <e>", "<cs> i said at second reading how much we on the national trust hope that the historic buildings council will be continued under another name and that as little change as possible will take place because the council has worked so well and we have so much for which to be grateful <e> <s> while that certainly is our hope nevertheless in pursuance of to me the much more fundamental matter which the noble lord lord kennet has put forward i feel strongly that the commission ought to be left alone as much as possible to make its own arrangements <e> <s> i hope that we shall bear that in mind as we go along at every stage <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what the noble lord has said but i think that it is extremely important <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always agreeable when people who are not normally allies find themselves together however fleetingly <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and i have had many disagreements in the past about appointments <e> <s> they were enjoyable at the time <e> <s> i am particularly enjoying being in agreement with him this afternoon though probably our reasons are different and i fear that our agreement may not last <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord is that of course this procedure is followed at present <e> <s> it is followed at the british museum <e> <s> if however you are legislating for the future it is better rather than instituting a system which has to be overcome in practice by a system of committees to institute a choice so that those museums and institutions which are currently run by the trusteeship system can choose whether they want to change to the other system <e> <s> the whole point about this is that both systems can be made to work <e> <s> i find it very difficult to share in the passions so clearly evident on both sides of the argument <e> <s> which system you adopt is not of great importance provided that you ensure there is a point at which the outside people let us call them the non-executives come together with the staff <e> <s> although i come from finance and industry i am not ashamed of it and do not feel that because of my commercial background i am frustrated in the other bodies that i serve on <e> <s> there is no great desire on my part nor i am sure on the part of the noble viscount lord eccles to get our fingers on the power and we do not feel frustrated because of not being able to do so <e> <s> i always found that it was quite easy to do so <e> <s> in the national trust of which i am chairman we and the staff come <e>", "<cs> yes but so does this <e> <s> why not allow both to exist <e> <s> there are advantages in having people of equal status sitting round a table their appointments deriving from the same source <e> <s> if that is what they want why not allow them to move to it <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment may i add that people want to do this kind of work for love and would be content with quite modest remuneration which i am sure is all that the government would wish to offer <e>", "<cs> i put down my name to this amendment because of the principle that if a tenant is to accept specific responsibilities for conservation which are liable to reduce the earning capacity of his holding those responsibilities should be compensated for by a lower rental <e> <s> it is one which the national trust of which i am chairman has been applying in a great number of cases where it requires tenants to give conservation a priority that may affect the earning power of their holdings <e> <s> the national trust has a great deal of experience of trying to combine conservation with good husbandry <e> <s> it has nearly acres of agricultural tenanted land which is about two-fifths of its total holding <e> <s> on its total holding there are some sites of special scientific interest so it is a matter of great importance to the national trust <e>", "<cs> my lords i want primarily to talk about the performing arts <e> <s> i suppose like the noble lord lord cottesloe that i also am a back number having been chairman of the arts council in the mid-s but i still have a connection with the arts through the royal opera house of which i am a director and glyndebourne and one or two other institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just point out that i did not destroy opera for all <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is possible that this estate having paid a day in interest during the one and a half years or so that this great property has been on offer to the government may be feeling that it has had enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for raising this matter <e> <s> i am also grateful for the opportunity it gives me as chairman of the national trust to state the trusts views which have not always been clearly understood <e> <s> i think it is clear that no change in the tax laws is needed <e> <s> there is nothing in the present law which would prevent the government from accepting what we call by way of shorthand non-heritage land as an endowment for this house if they pleased <e> <s> but what i understand the government to be saying is that the case of hardwick which has been quoted as a precedent when non-heritage land was accepted as part endowment for the house is not an appropriate precedent now because in those days there was no national heritage fund and this is now the appropriate national pocket to draw upon for conservation or preservation purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not my intention to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to add my voice to those already raised in congratulating the noble viscount lord blakenham on a very fine maiden speech <e> <s> i think the conventions of your lordships house prevent me from referring to him as my noble friend which he certainly is <e> <s> perhaps i may call him my noble kinsman by marriage which he also is <e> <s> he is also a colleague <e> <s> we have been together in business for many years and i can tell your lordships that the wisdom experience and perspicacity which he brings to that he will bring also to your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that his major responsibilities in business will not prevent him from addressing us frequently <e>", "<cs> my lords having done a five-year stint in the early s as chairman of the arts council i know how difficult it is to alter course at all without a significant increase in resources and how easy it is to <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself stimulated and encourged by the account of the state of the arts generally that has been given by the noble earl the minister <e> <s> i would not dispute a word of what he said in that respect <e> <s> but that does not alter the fact that the serious moderate people who run most of the arts organisations in this country are worried that they have no political axe to grind that their fears are perfectly genuine and that there is a perfectly genuine cause for them <e> <s> i shall return to that subject in a moment <e> <s> however before i do so i should like to say that in the circumstances it gives me great pleasure to offer the government from the bottom of my heart a genuine bouquet <e> <s> i refer of course to the million which they have given to the national heritage memorial fund to secure the future of the three great houses which the noble lord lord donaldson mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the order of my speech has not made it clear that it is a substantial quantum increase for which i am asking <e> <s> that is what i would have hoped that the minister for the arts would also be asking for <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that last minute rescue operations of the kind which we have seen recently and which are certainly very acceptable when they occur are nevertheless not the best way of dealing with a problem which is continuous and certainly except in respect of timing largely predictable <e>", "<cs> my lords short debates are good for self-discipline but there is not much time for perspective <e> <s> as a former chairman of the arts council for five years and of the national trust for nine i should have liked to pay tribute to this government and to previous governments for what they have done through public funding in both those fields the arts and our heritage and i should like to elaborate on that <e> <s> however since there are only a few minutes one has to concentrate on ones brickbats rather than ones bouquets <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only say that economies have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest interest to the speeches made in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> some have referred to the environment on a global scale <e> <s> however i should like to return in the few minutes that are permitted to me in a short debate to the way in which agricultural and planning policies affect our countryside <e> <s> i am very glad that this debate is taking place before the end of this parliament <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the noble baroness lady stedman for introducing the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having been in my place when the noble earl moved the amendment <e> <s> i noted what he said and i am in total sympathy with it <e> <s> i noted the governments objections too that the intensification would be difficult to monitor and therefore to apply equitably with reasonable economy and also their apprehensions in regard to ec legislation <e> <s> but the noble baroness declared that the governments mind was not closed <e> <s> and since then we have had maffs consultation document <e> <s> this too does not exclude the possibilities behind the amendment but the paragraph on de-intensification and this is what worries me is so slight and the emphasis in the document as a whole so strong on reductions in area rather than in yield that i am not surprised that the noble earl has returned to the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord lord st john of fawsley that one thing that the government have clone for architecture is to appoint him chairman of the royal fine art commission <e> <s> they could not have made a better choice <e> <s> i cannot <e>", "<cs> i have put my name to the amendment simply because i believe that the words as they stand are too restrictive <e> <s> if the word music had been left out the word art could have done duty for the arts as a whole <e> <s> in specifying music it leads one to interpret the word art in the way in which the noble baroness has suggested <e> <s> it is a semantic matter and i hope that the government can accept it <e> <s> it is a small matter but a very important one <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for inflicting an unscheduled speech on your lordships <e> <s> this morning i telephoned the whips office but without the usual and expected result <e>", "<cs> my lords i must add my thanks to those already expressed by other noble lords to the noble lord lord blake for introducing this fascinating subject in such a compelling way <e> <s> his speech was all the more compelling for the moderate way in which he spoke <e> <s> i agreed with everything that he said including his request for a little more <e> <s> i remember being told by my grandfather when i was <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i cannot speak for the national trust but i ask him to accept that his statement that the national trust has closed its books in respect of houses is an exaggeration <e> <s> the true situation is that it does not seek to acquire further houses <e> <s> it hopes that other solutions can be found but that is one of two longstops english heritage being the other <e> <s> it is always ready to play its part if it is found necessary <e>", "<cs> absolutely my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the works of art sub-commmittee always looks with the greatest care and constructively at any suggestion made by any noble lord whether made to your lordships house or to the committee directly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord annan reminded us in his admirable speech how this row began <e> <s> i think it is also important to remember the background against which it has developed a background which has been there for several years <e> <s> the background is that throughout the world of academic scholarship there is a general apprehension that a utilitarian view of the value of places of learning is gaining ground in society generally and in government in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords it is widely felt among scholars both within and without universities that studies which do not lead to visible material progress are not as respected as once they were and no longer receive the priority that once they did <e> <s> whether these fears are justified or not is not a subject for debate tonight <e> <s> their relevance this evening is simply that they exist and in the va they are largely the consequence of inadequate public funding in recent years for the basic purposes of the museum <e> <s> this shortfall and its consequences have been emphasised by the museums and galleries commission in its report on our national museums <e>", "<cs> i am very much encouraged by the ministers reply <e> <s> in the circumstances perhaps i may be allowed to express my gratitude for the support that the amendment has received <e> <s> on the basis that we have plenty of time to consider this an assurance that the minister has already given so that if we feel it does not go far enough to meet our concerns we can come back to the question as i know the minister intends i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the sub-committee on works of art in this house has on more than one occasion drawn the attention of ministers to the ill effects of this delay <e> <s> has the <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that the va is no longer the governments responsibility will he confirm that when the government disestablished the va as it were it was no part of their intention to escape responsibility for it <e> <s> will he further confirm that if that had been their intention they would have endowed it as they are doing in the case of ham and osterley although i do not know whether they are doing so adequately <e> <s> in that case they would have endowed it but they did not do so <e> <s> they accepted responsibility for it and continued to fund it <e> <s> surely the minister cannot say that it was nothing to do with the government therefore and the question then is whether the funding is adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that everyone will agree that it has been a very interesting debate for which we are primarily indebted to the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> it is not always a pleasure to be placed at the end of the debate for the obvious reason that what one wishes to say has often been pre-empted by other speakers <e> <s> nevertheless on this occasion it is a particular pleasure for me because i follow the noble lord lord charteris <e> <s> i can therefore say that in my judgment the best work in the field of the arts that parliament has done for as long as i can remember was the creation of that fund <e> <s> not only is the fund a very good idea but as chairman of it the noble lord has conducted it extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to say that i think we have made up in quality for what we have lacked in numbers of audience <e> <s> almost everyone has spoken of the importance of the arms length principle and almost everyone if not everyone has spoken in favour of the principle of devolution <e>"]
