["<cs> my lords it is always a privilege to follow the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge <e> <s> at this time of the evening i do not think that i should be expected to say very much and i shall say very little which i think will not disappoint your lordships <e> <s> i must say three things to begin with <e> <s> first i wish to thank the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for introducing what i think he described as this unattractive but not unimportant subject <e> <s> i think that the country is divided into those who think it is important and those who think it is unimportant <e> <s> no one who has spoken in the debate thought that it was unimportant and i think that most of us would agree that the subject itself is unattractive <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that he mentioned very truly that the noble baronesss remarks had received substantial support from speakers both in front of him and behind him <e> <s> would it not be fair to add to the record that they also received support from those on the right and the left i would refer to both the second speech that of the noble lord <e> <s> lord byers and i think the seventh speech that of the noble lord lord roberthall <e> <s> i think that is worth noticing <e> <s> it is something rather unique about this debate <e>", "<cs> may i in a very few words also support this amendment on the grounds that although the phrase monopoly situation could mean something i do not believe it means anything in this bill <e> <s> if i were to say that the noble lords on the front bench opposite had a monopoly of wisdom or that the liberal party had a monopoly of virtue i might be challenged on both points but one would know what was meant <e> <s> the only sense of a monopoly situation then would be that the front bench was a monopoly situation or that the liberal benches were a monopoly situation <e> <s> otherwise i find it very difficult to understand that the word adds anything at all <e> <s> i hope that the minister will support this <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord answers may i make only one suggestion <e> <s> if there is a difference between a monopoly and a monopoly situation the wording might be altered to monopolistic situation on the grounds of monopoly restrictive practices and so on <e> <s> that would make an adjective instead of what i think the noble viscount has at the back of his mind this very confusing use of two long nouns which nobody quite understands <e> <s> what the difference is we shall learn later on <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question that could affect my vote on this <e> <s> it may sound a trivial grammatical one but the word shall occurs three times <e> <s> all governors shall receive a handbook with which i entirely agree they shall perform their duties and the local education authority shall make provision <e> <s> i quite agree with the first and the third shalls but i wonder whether how they shall perform their duties is not meant to be how they should perform their duties i think it makes a difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know if this is in order but the noble lord lord wells-pestell has very kindly allowed me to say a few words <e> <s> the subject of this debate is old age including incontinence <e> <s> i am not continent enough to refrain from saying how much agree with everything the noble lord lord hylton said and how grateful i am to him <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady trumpington on what i thought was a superb maiden speech <e> <s> it will read extremely well tomorrow <e> <s> she said her tiny hand was not frozen <e> <s> i do not know whether it is tiny but certainly it was not frozen <e> <s> i think that making a speech in a house as empty as this after everyone has sat up all night would make most peoples hands freeze <e> <s> it did not do so in her case <e> <s> i say this without any prejudice because i believe she has some association with cambridge just as the noble baroness lady faithful <e> <s> has some association with oxford i do not express any preference <e> <s> the noble baroness may even have had some association with eton although i suppose that is not very likely <e> <s> i agree entirely with everything she said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite understand how one can agree with the philosophy of this if one also agrees with the noble lord lord derwent who made a perfectly clear point that it means nothing <e> <s> i should have thought that the philosophy ought to mean something and these three things are only considered desirable and are not considered to be mandatory <e> <s> it is desirable that one should have some general knowledge of education and with great respect to the noble lord lord derwent that does not mean that one was educated oneself <e> <s> so was i and so was he and with what results in my case <e> <s> it means that one has had some opportunity or attempt however unsuccessful to educate other people <e> <s> i should have thought that personal links with the relevant school does not simply mean that i happen to have been at charterhouse or gutta percha or eton or wherever it was it might mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i will say two things <e> <s> many of your lordships want to speak and above all we want to hear what the noble baroness is going to say after an exhausting time <e> <s> i want to say how strongly i agreed with the noble lord lord houghton in one thing i am afraid it was only one thing when he said that this is a very difficult and a very delicate question <e> <s> i strongly disagreed with him and agreed with the noble lord lord wells-pestell when he said that this house was not in a position to pontificate <e> <s> my latin is very rusty but pontificate as i understand it means bridge building <e> <s> is that not right <e>", "<cs> i did not mean to say anything on this amendment but i should like to join in supporting it heartily for two reasons <e> <s> first as a member of the liberal party i believe in helping small businesses <e> <s> secondly for a very long time my father was concerned with the legal and general <e> <s> for a number of years he was its chairman and when he retired he was made president <e> <s> i believe that he would have approved very strongly of this scheme and he was a man whose opinions i greatly respected <e> <s> but above all if it helps small businesses i should be entirely in favour of it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask in great ignorance about one point that i did not understand in the noble viscounts very clear speech <e> <s> i understood him to say that this amendment which he agreed is suggesting that this should be an aspect of good business practice is carried out by all companies all the time <e> <s> but i understood him later to say that it would be a bad thing to put it in the bill because there might be a moment when the board did not want to put it in <e> <s> i am not sure how those two statements are reconciled <e> <s> i can understand that it is unnecessary if they all carry it out all the time but i find it difficult to believe it is unnecessary if the situation might be otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord whether the test of reading applies only to english and not to welsh <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assure the house as did the noble lord lord boothby that i am not going to make a speech <e> <s> what i have to say will be very short <e> <s> i did not put down my name to speak but when i saw that there were only three speakers on the list i thought that i would try to find something to say about a subject on which i feel strongly <e> <s> then it struck me that three speakers from the liberal benches would unbalance the debate <e> <s> however there have been excellent interventions from the noble lord lord duncan-sandys and the noble baroness lady phillips so i do not feel that if i speak i shall unbalance the debate <e> <s> as this is a debate about balance one does not want there to be an undue number of people putting forward the same point of view <e> <s> one thing one can say in favour of these benches is that usually we put forward different points of view but on this occasion we do not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as a very ignorant layman ask a <e>", "<cs> i know very little about this matter <e> <s> i am not a married man i am not a doctor and i am not a politician <e> <s> with great respect although i would have voted against many of the previous amendments if this one is put to the vote i am inclined to vote for it on the grounds that it seems to me unfair that if i had a secretary or assistant to whom i was already married i would not be entitled to financial reimbursement <e> <s> this would also apply if i later married my receptionist or secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord mowbray answers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl the minister agree that if the noble baronesss statement was correct as i am sure it was his reference to a constant figure did not include constant running water <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to concentrate on a very few facts <e> <s> shall possibly say something controversial because i want to put in at least one word for english as it is spoken or written at present while allowing full scope to many of the reforms which the noble and learned lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he explain not to this party or to the house because it would take too long but at some future time how one occupies a mirage of the middle ground <e> <s> does it mean occupying the mirage or the middle ground and apart from how it is done which is the stress on the mirage or the middle ground <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord belstead answers i do not know whether it is worthwhile putting it on record as the subject of proportional representation has been raised that the number of members on the conservative side the number of members on the labour side and the number on the liberal side are exactly equal at the moment <e> <s> that is a rare occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate i do not think anyone wants to hear anything except the three winding-up speakers particularly the noble earl lord longford so i should like to confine myself to three points only <e> <s> first i should like to thank the noble earl for introducing this debate which is a particularly suitable one to introduce in this house which i believe is called the house of peers <e> <s> i know that that to many people has an unpleasant connotation <e> <s> it means house of equals <e> <s> all peers are not equally equal but i cannot think of one who is more equally equal than the noble earl lord longford <e>", "<cs> my lords in connection with one point that the noble lord lord belstead made may i make one suggestion <e> <s> the word indecent is a very important one in this bill as distinct from obscene <e> <s> the difference is that an action can be perfectly decent in one set of circumstances and indecent in another <e> <s> it is not indecent to take off ones clothes before getting into the bath if one is alone but it would be indecent to take them off before making a speech in your lordships house <e> <s> the difference with obscene is complete because if we may take something which we would all agree is obscene sexual satisfaction from torturing a cat or a bird or a human being would not cease to be obscene if it were done privately it would if anything be more obscene <e> <s> therefore as this is a bill about indecency that word is vital to it and i should like to join with everyone else in expressing support for its use <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in favour of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> in reply to the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard i would say that there is a difference between standing and sitting <e> <s> it has been seriously suggested that certain noble lords in this chamber should be allowed to sit but not allowed to stand up and speak <e> <s> i would submit that these matters are quite different <e> <s> whether it is right or wrong to have sitting peers <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is nobody else present on the liberal benches and this is not a party issue i should like to take the opportunity to say two things <e> <s> one is to congratulate the noble lord lord nugent on a bill in respect of which as i think he knows i approve of everything except that in my opinion which is not a liberal opinion it touches only what i may call the tip of the viceberg <e> <s> the only time i intervened in the debates on this bill was to try to stress the fact that this is a bill about indecency and not obscenity and i entirely agree that that is a much more difficult matter which as has been agreed all round the house should be taken up by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not know if it is relevant but i have only twice been upset and overturned completely in a motor car and neither time was i driving <e> <s> the second time was on a private road when i was rather rashly asked to act not as a kind of baby-sitter but as a semi-instructor to a learner driver a rather timid middle-aged lady <e> <s> i tried to impress upon her that when one was approaching a right-angled turn one should go very slowly and turn into it <e> <s> she was doing admirably until a friend of hers who had taken her out said you are going much too slowly <e> <s> so the next time she was approaching a right-angled turn on to a private road i said i presume mrs h you are not going into that turning <e> <s> she said i am <e> <s> it was much too late of course <e> <s> we landed upside down in a ditch with a crash of glass and such is the peculiarity of ones <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister in a position to assure the house that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord quoted the book of <e>", "<cs> my lords i would support this amendment <e> <s> i can see that there are two points of view as to whether parents should have any say in this or not but if as i strongly believe they should i cannot see that it could possibly be fairly done without an amendment of this sort by which they are allowed to see what goes on <e> <s> i can see no objection to that <e> <s> i support the amendment very strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords time is getting on and i am incapable of making a short speech <e> <s> therefore i shall not try to make a speech at all but make just a few disjointed remarks <e> <s> of all the speeches i have heard i agree with almost all of many of them although there were a few things that i disagree with <e> <s> perhaps i might say to the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard that the only thing i disagreed with in what he said is that pornography is a new industry <e> <s> i should have thought it was one of the oldest industries in the world <e> <s> of course it has always been with us and has always made a certain amount of money <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord nugent pointed out very clearly in his excellent opening speech it is now making money on a different kind of scale and in a different kind of way as compared with what has happened in the past <e>", "<cs> my lord before the noble lord sits down will he agree that whether or not democracy is a new thing it is a very old word <e> <s> it is an older word than tory <e> <s> it was coined in bc <e> <s> the word tory was not in use in the year ad and in those days it applied to certain irish ragamuffins who wanted to defend their own rights against the landlords <e> <s> simply on this point of words would the noble lord agree that democracy is an old idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the last back-bench speaker in the debate and i shall relieve your lordships by saying that i only put down my name at the last minute <e> <s> i intended to be brief but i shall be even briefer because everything that i intended to say has been said in particular in one speech much better than i could say it <e> <s> i think that everyone has already thanked the noble lord lord davies of leek for introducing this extremely important subject <e> <s> i agree with everything that the noble lord said and what has been said by most speakers with one reservation that is in the part of the noble lords motion which refers to the extension of family planning <e> <s> this is not be <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord raglan sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> he says that nationalism is the most dangerous and poisonous form of war <e> <s> would he say that it is more dangerous and poisonous than imperialism <e> <s> would he not agree that there is a difference between the two that the urge to protect ones own country from something that rightly or wrongly one dislikes is very different from attempting to spread ones own ideas through other countries <e> <s> would he agree for instance that joan of arc was a nationalist but not an imperialist and that napoleon was more of an imperialist than a nationalist because he was born in corsica <e> <s> is it not slightly confusing not to compare nationalism with imperialism <e> <s> they are very different things and i believe that the last few weeks in the falkland islands have been showing that quite clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords time is getting on and i agree with the noble earl lord longford whose <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put on record as one of the seven people present that i hope everyone will read this very important debate tomorrow as they have not had the opportunity through no fault of their own of listening to it today <e> <s> i thought that someone should say that in view of the fact that the house is so thinly attended <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down as he has mentioned my name may i assure him personally that i have not changed by views in the least from the time when i opposed that bill at the start and i very much agreed with what the right reverend prelate said <e>"]
