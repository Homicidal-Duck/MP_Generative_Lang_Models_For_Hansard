["<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his encouraging answers may i ask him to urge her majestys government to recollect that the costs of reclaiming the countryside when once it is lost are immeasurably greater than those of preserving it initially <e> <s> will he further bear in mind that the countryside is a resource which is already in desperately short supply and for which in the present era of increasing leisure there is an ever increasing demand <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to join with the noble lord lord wells-pestell in thanking the noble lord lord cullen of ash-bourne for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> with regard to both the content of the statement and the very complex and lengthy report to which it relates the noble lord will understand that we will wish to study these very carefully before coming to final conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords as the mover of this motion it would normally be appropriate for me merely to say a few quick words of thanks to all those who have spoken congratulate the maiden speakers which i shall do with all possible warmth in a moment and then beg leave to withdraw the motion and sit down <e> <s> however may i crave the indulgence of the house and say that these are not entirely normal circumstances for me in that this is one of the two debates in this house for which my noble friends on this bench are allowed to choose the subject <e> <s> normally it would be the practice of the house for one of my noble friends to say a few words so as to tie up the ends above the line as it were <e> <s> however as i informed the house my noble friend lady robson of kiddington was suddenly snatched to the grass roots of the health service to deal with a very urgent hospital crisis and was unable therefore to perform this function <e> <s> then my noble friend lady seear who was to take her place was suddenly taken ill and had to go home <e> <s> therefore we had nobody in that particular position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> with regard to the brief quarrel if i may so describe it between the two front benches naturally i took no part in it because it happened after i had spoken <e> <s> i will only say this the subject of private practice cropped up <e> <s> i have no brief for private practice but i would say both to the noble baroness lady young and to the noble lord lord wells-pestell that the one thing that private practice does is to act or it can act as a very sensitive barometer of what is happening in the public sector <e> <s> that is true not only of health but also of education <e> <s> when one suddenly sees a growth in the private sector and a growth in the demand for private practice then one should start to look immediately and carefully at what has happened to the public sector <e> <s> it is my honest view that for those who wish to get rid of private practice there is no better way than to improve the health service <e> <s> where hospitals are new where waiting-lists are short where doctors lists are manageable one looks in vain for private practice <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering this matter further may i ask the noble lord whether he would bear in mind that the clocks have a ready ability to tell us how long a noble lord has actually been speaking but they cannot possibly tell us how long he seems to have been speaking <e> <s> which is often a rather more important consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by thanking the noble lord lord walston for giving your lordships house an opportunity of debating these two subjects agriculture and pollution with which the report deals both of which are of immense importance to our nation and indeed to the world as a whole <e> <s> i am sure it is appropriate that a debate of this kind should be introduced by a noble lord whose experience wisdom and expertise in the field of agriculture is immense and indeed almost unrivalled in your lordships house <e> <s> i have read many of his writings on this subject with great benefit and i hope i am the wiser as a result but your lordships will understand that i am also a little diffident in following him <e> <s> on a massive comprehensive and complex report such as this one can either make a long and detailed speech dealing with its many aspects or a short speech merely indicating ones general attitude and focussing attention on one or two specific matters <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will be relieved to learn that i shall endeavour to do the latter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin what will be a very brief contribution to this little debate by proudly donning my national health service spectacles <e> <s> while i shall be brief i must thank and congratulate the noble lord lord rugby for drawing the attention of the house to some very <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise but briefly to indicate the support of my noble friends on these benches for the noble lord lord derwent in his motion that your lordships house do disagree with this amendment <e> <s> like him i shall resist the temptation to stray into the merits of the case but since the noble lord lord cullen touched upon them briefly let me just say this <e> <s> we in your lordships house seem to have occupied a great deal of our time recently in discussing restrictive practices of one kind or another operated by the professions <e> <s> as a doctor i should like to make it entirely clear that i personally have no wish whatsoever to place obstacles in the way of other people coming along and doing work which i might otherwise have to do myself <e> <s> nor do i want to say anything in particular about acupuncture save that it seems to me to be very effective on chinamen but not particularly effective elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little to say on this bill at this stage save to give it the warmest possible welcome on behalf of my noble friends on these benches <e> <s> naturally i would wish at once to thank the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton for explaining the broad implications of the bill and some of the details of its proposed working so very succinctly and so clearly <e> <s> i would also wish to thank the noble baroness lady stedman for underlining some crucial points and perhaps doubts in her own inimitably clear and perceptive manner doubts which i think we all have to bear in mind <e> <s> in particular i would underline what she had to say about the need to preserve some of the elements of our industrial archaeology scattered about perhaps in parts of the country in the north which are not at once recognisable as places worthy of preservation but which frankly i think need very careful thought <e> <s> one can wander about the pennines and see strewn around the history and origins of <e>", "<cs> my primary concern at the moment in this matter is this rather odd entanglement with the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster being included <e> <s> but quite clearly it is a matter which on some future occasion might require an amendment to the act itself <e> <s> the secretaries of state concerned and the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster are subsequently referred to throughout the bill as the ministers <e> <s> is there any fundamental reason why we cannot call them the ministers to start with <e>", "<cs> before we leave this matter surely if the words which the noble lord lord reigate would like deleted meant anything at all any clear meaning which they did have seems to me to have been totally obscured by the addition of the words or otherwise <e> <s> persons who are connected by residence or otherwise with england wales scotland and northern ireland respectively <e> <s> i cannot think of anybody to whom that might not possibly apply <e> <s> but i wonder whether the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton could tell us what he and his colleagues have in mind when they talk about or otherwise <e> <s> is it by birth <e> <s> are we back to grandfathers or paternity or whatever <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is taking this back to look at it again i hope he will bear in mind that it might be considered desirable or even essential for somebody to acquire rights over other land not wholly as the noble lord appeared to think for the purpose of extinguishing them <e> <s> i think he should look at the other side of it <e> <s> there may be many circumstances in regard to access and things of that kind where the need to acquire rights over neighbouring land is not solely for the purpose of extinguishing them but for the purpose of allowing others to use them in a different way <e>", "<cs> i really must support the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and the noble baroness lady birk on this particular amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton has arrived at the committee today with a difficulty for every solution <e> <s> he told us earlier how very important it was not to include any unnecessary words whatsoever in the bill <e> <s> now by his own words he has made it utterly clear that this subsection is unnecessary <e> <s> he has told us over and over again how sensible the trustees will be he has told us that the trustees will be entirely free to seek the advice of the treasury and he himself has demonstrated that this subsection is not necessary <e> <s> if as he says we should not include unnecessary words in the bill why does he resist us when we try to help him to remove some <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment very much on the lines outlined by the noble lord lord vaizey <e> <s> i believe that it is absolutely essential that the choice of the person for this important and onerous office must be as wide as it could possibly be <e> <s> i am not saying that it will necessarily fall on to somebody who will need payment <e> <s> i do not think that the government would be wise at this stage to narrow down their choice when as they know and as the noble lord has said so often we are relying on getting people as trustees and as a chairman in particular of quite unusual ability expertise and dedication <e> <s> it may well be that they find somebody who does not require and does not need payment <e> <s> at this stage to narrow the choice would be very ill-advised <e> <s> i too hope that this amendment will be looked at with sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i too in the briefest possible way should also like to express my support <e> <s> i think the amendment meets in an admirable fashion all the points that were put from various parts of your lordships house during our last debate <e> <s> i am absolutely delighted that the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton has received it in such an amiable and kindly fashion indeed he dealt with this in a very kindly manner at an earlier stage and i think it shows that he may be going to do likewise tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not rise before on this amendment because i had no wish to impede the progress of this admirable bill particularly on an amendment with which every noble lord seemed to be in total <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness in this amendment which is very modest in relation to the one which was pressed in committee <e> <s> at the end of the day it merely provides for the remote possibility should it prove to be necessary of remunerating the chairman <e> <s> i think that the government would be very unwise to resist this amendment <e> <s> as i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must begin by thanking the noble lord lord dulverton for giving us the opportunity to debate this immensely important subject <e> <s> in private talks and discussions i have had with him i have already learned a great deal about forestry and i am quite sure i have learned a little more from him today in this debate i am sure we all have <e> <s> i must at once join other noble lords in congratulating our two maiden speakers <e> <s> the noble lord lord gibson-watt conies to us with immense experience not only in forestry but in all countryside matters and i am quite sure that your lordships discussions of countryside matters will be immeasurably enriched by his presence here <e> <s> i greatly enjoyed what he had to say to us today <e> <s> the noble viscount lord devonport comes as visible proof of the possibility of integrated agriculture and forestry <e> <s> i was most interested to hear what he had to say particularly with regard to demonstration farms <e> <s> from his own demonstration farm i am quite sure a great many people will learn a great deal and i have no doubt that we shall learn much from him on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i provoked the noble lord i must not pursue him too far down that course but i realise the case to which he is referring <e> <s> it is one in which we had agreed a policy with the national parks committee indeed totally agreed a policy in which there was a presumption against afforestation in a certain very small area <e> <s> later the national parks committee reversed its decision a decision which it had formerly agreed with us <e> <s> however i entirely agree with the noble lord as regards what he said about the need to try to resolve these conflicts at a very early stage and the need to create a situation in which there is not uncertainty and in which people really know where they stand <e> <s> i am sure that anything that i can do and all noble lords can do towards that end will be helpful to us all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that under the previous government the minister of state in the department of the environment wrote to the chairmen of public bodies owning and managing land in designated areas of the countryside with instructions that due consideration should be given to the purposes of designation in the management of that land <e> <s> may i also ask the noble lord whether that instruction is endorsed by the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in my capacity as a medical practitioner i have had occasion to send several noble lords from your lordships house to westminster hospital for emergency treatment and the fact that several of those noble lords are sitting with us in the chamber today is surely eloquent testimony to the importance of that august institution <e> <s> with regard to the medical school from which i benefited greatly in post-graduate study may i ask the noble lord whether the government in considering the flowers report will carefully bear in mind the view that when it comes to medical schools bigger is not necessarily better <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that it is now time that i endeavoured to draw your attention away from prisons and into post offices places that are occasionally equally overcrowded but which i hope are otherwise superior in many respects <e> <s> it is a great pleasure to me to follow the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i should like to say straight away how grateful i am as i am sure is the whole house to him for giving us the opportunity to debate a matter that is of the utmost importance <e> <s> lord campbell of croy will remember that some years ago we worked together closely in another place on matters to do with the post office and i hope he will remember also that on those occasions we found ourselves in agreement on all the matters that he raised <e> <s> perhaps noble lords will be glad to hear from me now that i agreed with every single word in lord campbells very interesting speech which i hope your lordships will recollect clearly after the interval that we have had since he made it because he drew our attention to some very important themes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure and indeed an honour to follow the noble lord lord hill of luton on a subject in which he has a great personal interest and involvement and of which he has almost unparalleled experience and expertise whether inside or outside your lordships house <e> <s> the question he has asked the government seems to me to be both highly pertinent and very urgent <e> <s> also as he has said himself it raises questions of principle which should be of the greatest possible concern to noble lords in all parts of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be good enough to bear with me i shall come to that although i do not think we can go in this way into the whole question of broadcasting its organisation and financing on an unstarred question <e> <s> however i will come to that question and of course it is an important one <e> <s> as things are i think we have to accept the situation in which we are placed and we have to ask the questions which inevitably arise from it <e> <s> i should like to add two supplementary questions to those put so very eloquently by the noble lord lord hill of luton <e> <s> first is the bbc making its cuts in the right way and in the right places <e> <s> secondly and in my opinion very much more importantly are we satisfied that the licence fee is the best or indeed the only acceptable method of financing public broadcasting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recollect that i said that together the bbc and us and by us i meant government as a whole we ought collectively to decide <e> <s> it has to be that kind of decision <e> <s> it has to be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one final and simple question <e> <s> irrespective of whether the money is enough and irrespective of the difficulty of index linking or finding other means does the noble lord agree that a situation in which the bbc is deeply dependent on the government of the day on a continuing basis for its housekeeping really is a situation containing very great dangers <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise straightaway to the house for not notifying my intention to say a very few words on this bill in sufficient time for my name to be added to the list but i have taken the precaution of having a word with those concerned and other speakers and i hope that i will have the indulgence of your lordships house in this matter <e> <s> perhaps i might earn that indulgence if i am extremely brief as i intend to be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware of the strength of feeling on this matter among doctors nurses other health service workers patients and indeed potential patients which means almost everybody <e> <s> is the noble baroness also aware that the message from your lordships house the last time we discussed this matter was no flowers by request <e> <s> will the noble baroness recognise that morale in this hospital will not be restored unless government reassurances are much more positive than those we have so far heard <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if before the noble baroness the minister replies i make it clear that we on these benches have no very special fears about clause although i take the point made very clearly by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany with regard to the possible effects of official action on voluntary activities by friends of hospitals and people of that kind <e> <s> i share that possible anxiety although i cannot go with him in his fears that the area health authorities might dream up highly imaginative schemes and launch into extreme eccentricities with regard to strip shows and so on <e> <s> indeed if i had any fears it would be that they would be perhaps too little imaginative rather than too much <e>", "<cs> let me move on <e> <s> i have risen before the noble baroness replies merely because there is one point on which i should welcome a reassurance <e> <s> this is a matter which was raised at second reading and it is one on which i think fairly positive reassurances were given <e> <s> nevertheless i believe it would be helpful to your lordships committee if we could be reassured again on one particular point <e> <s> i should not like to think that there was any possibility whatsoever of a health authority that was particularly successful in raising money by these means later being penalised because consideration of its finances was taken into account by government in allocating resources of another kind <e>", "<cs> i should like to press the noble lord a little further on the point i raised with him and to which i know he referred <e> <s> in quoting ministers in another place i understood him to say that there was no question whatever of funds allocated to the national health service being reduced in respect of funds raised in this way <e> <s> that i fully accept <e> <s> my question was a rather more specific one <e> <s> if an individual health authority is unusually successful and raises a large amount of money itself as a result of its own initiative or the generosity of the people who live in the area is there any question whatsoever that that particular health authority might be penalised in its requests for funds out of the gross allocation to the national health service <e> <s> this is a slightly different and much more specific point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be permitted before the noble baroness replies to say a few words in support of the noble baroness lady masham who moved this very necessary amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may say a few words about the history whereby we have arrived at this absurd well-nigh gilbertian situation under which a doctor or a group of doctors or a partnership can employ a receptionist or secretary or nurse and can now gain something like per cent <e> <s> reimbursement of expenses of that employment from central funds <e> <s> but if one of the doctors displays an interest in that receptionist beyond a professional one and finally as the noble baroness has said marries her then suddenly the practice must pay the whole of the cost <e> <s> that is an absurd situation <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness without any undertaking or commitment has undertaken to look at this subject again might i ask her to look at one particular point while she is doing that <e> <s> she said that efforts are being made to assist in rural areas where a gp is on his own and his wife is the only person he can get to help him <e> <s> would she bear in mind that not only in rural areas but in cities and urban areas the vast majority of doctors work in groups or partnerships and in such groups or partnerships there is inevitably a very firm discipline exacted by the other members of the group or partnership as to how much is paid to the wife of any particular doctor <e> <s> this is a discipline which exists and i think it should be borne in mind <e> <s> in the vast majority of cases if doctors employ their wives they are people doing full-time jobs on behalf of a group of doctors <e> <s> if the person happens to be married to one of the doctors the whole practice is penalised by not being able to claim reimbursement <e> <s> will the noble baroness look at that factor and bear in mind that a fairly firm control is exerted by the other people in the partnership who will not allow an individual doctor to overpay his wife merely because she happens to be his wife when she is just one of a number of employees of that practice <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to join with the noble lord lord wells-pestell in thanking the noble baroness for repeating this important and interesting statement made in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do my best this afternoon to resist the temptation to raise committee points many of which are floating about in my mind since there will of course be other and perhaps longer opportunities to do that <e> <s> therefore noble lords will be glad to hear that i shall do my best to speak briefly on the broad intentions of this bill <e> <s> in that connection i am very grateful indeed to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in commending the noble baronesss amendment to the house it would appear that i have already brought upon myself the ire of doctors and doctors wives who have already written to me accusing me of being something of a renegade <e> <s> i would say in supporting the noble baronesss amendment that i have not changed my views one jot or tittle since i expressed them to your lordships in committee recently <e> <s> i believe that this act of discrimination against a small number of extremely hardworking women ought to be removed as speedily as possible <e> <s> this is an anomaly which ought to disappear <e> <s> however i am genuinely persuaded that the means of removing this anomaly that the noble baroness has brought forward although it may he in the nature of the inevitability of gradualness probably offers the best hope of getting the thing done <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for repeating this statement may i join with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in asking the noble and learned lord whether he does not agree that friday morning is not really at short notice the most convenient time at which to marshal the kind of advice necessary in order to deal with a statement of such immense importance as this <e> <s> the noble and learned lord will realise that we shall wish to study this statement very carefully <e> <s> in the meantime may i ask him whether he is aware that there are noble lords on these benches who take the view that we weakened our jury system somewhat by introducing systems of majority verdicts <e> <s> thus we welcome this statement in so far as it makes clear that we will not weaken the jury system further by jury vetting save in cases in which national security is involved <e> <s> may i ask the noble and learned lord whether we will have an opportunity of considering these matters in much more detail at a later stage when we have had more warning <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord hill of luton has spoken as he has for it enables me to cut short my remarks and merely to agree strongly with what he has said <e> <s> with the noble lord <e> <s> lord hill of luton i agree with lord donaldson that the technological developments which are on the horizon and are perhaps close and about which the noble lord lord willis warned us so graphically at second reading as did the noble earl lord de la warr are matters of the utmost significance and matters which clearly will have to be kept under the closest possible scrutiny of parliament during the coming years <e> <s> if it is thought that some kind of review body inquiry committee or what-have-you to watch over those kinds of technological developments is necessary in order to feed information to parliament for the scrutiny it will have to carry out that is one thing <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord hill of luton has said if we are to set up yet another body to scrutinise the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to take issue very briefly yet again with the noble lord lord donaldson of kings-bridge especially on a matter on which i think we are substantially in agreement <e> <s> i certainly share his view that the fourth channel should carry an adequate supply of programmes dealing with matters like international news and world current <e>", "<cs> as the fourth signatory to the noble lords amendment and in order to make it utterly clear that this is an ecumenical exercise coming from all parts of your lordships committee perhaps i may make my position clear <e> <s> i certainly share the view expressed by the noble lord lord aylestone that in general if one gives broadcasters or people the responsibility for looking after programmes and providing programmes they ought not to be hedged around with instructions and restrictions and one thing and another <e> <s> in general we have to trust the broadcasters <e> <s> if at the end of the day we find that we cannot trust them then we get rid of them and get some others we can trust <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the assurance that he has given an assurance that he has given twice <e> <s> i am reminded of the words of lewis carroll in the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question arising from what he has said to us <e> <s> the noble lord in resisting this amendment has prayed in aid the report of the younger committee on privacy <e> <s> may i ask him whether from that i am entitled to assume that he or the home office now accepts the report of the younger committee on privacy as a whole or is it merely that it is convenient to clutch at this particular aspect of the report at this particular moment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ponsonby said that he hoped the government had got it right <e> <s> perhaps it is only fair that i should warn the noble lord that i personally take the view at present that it is possible that on certain aspects the government have got it wrong <e> <s> however perhaps i may assure the noble lord that i shall not weary your lordships committee at length particularly at a time when your lordships time is under very severe constraints <e> <s> however i think that i should put up a marker with regard to certain of my doubts <e>", "<cs> the noble lord undertook to reply to the points that i put to him on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords should it be necessary will the noble earl draw the attention of british rail to the fact that is to be the year of the disabled and will he express the hope that perhaps british rail will do even more than they are now doing in regard to concessionary travel arrangements for disabled persons <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> as one of the signatories to this amendment i should like to say that the noble lord lord ferrier has done us all a service by raising this matter three times on second reading at committee stage and again now <e> <s> no doubt following the excellent advice of lewis carroll in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene very briefly <e> <s> noble lords will remember that i moved an amendment substantially in this form at the committee stage asking that at least one member should have substantial experience <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one final question i would like to put to the noble lord lord belstead before we come to a conclusion as to whether the proposal he has put forward is reasonable or not <e> <s> it seems to me that what the noble lord said in his reply related entirely to this complaints commission set up as an independent avenue to which people can complain and frustrated people will wish to feel that there is an avenue of complaint to people other than those complained about that the complaints procedure provides remedies <e> <s> in suggesting that that remedy should now be opened up to the dead or recently dead however recently or for a limited period and i am not at all sure that i regard that as acceptable it seems to me the noble lord overlooked the fact that there is an avenue of complaint at <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady young for repeating this very important statement made in another place and we too would wish to join with the noble baroness and with the noble lord lord wells-pestell in paying a tribute to sir john boynton and his colleagues for their truly remarkable work <e> <s> the noble baroness agreed that this has not been a committee which has sat in a committee room perusing papers it has been a body which has more or less taken up residence in rampton has wandered about at all times of the day and night often unannounced and has acquired a very full knowledge and understanding of what goes on at rampton and for that i think noble lords in all parts of the house should be very grateful indeed to sir john boynton and his colleagues <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness would agree that we might also <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the motive behind the noble viscounts very well-intentioned question in connection with his answer may i ask the noble lord to bear in mind that overheating or too rapid reheating of cold elderly people could in fact be a potent cause of circulatory failure and indeed death <e> <s> what is really necessary for elderly people is good food warm clothing and an adequate standard of living <e> <s> we really should bear in mind that there are grave dangers in merely heating them up <e>", "<cs> my lords i too begin by paying tribute to the two very distinguished maiden speeches we have heard today <e> <s> i do not know what the collective noun is if there is one for a brace of yorkshire agricultural earls <e> <s> whatever it is the noble earls lord halifax and lord peel did us proud <e> <s> i sympathise with lord halifax in having been translated by local government reorganisation from being a yorkshireman into what he called a humbersider but worse things can happen a few yorkshiremen have found themselves being lancashiremen <e> <s> when i was in saddleworth recently i asked one of them whether it made much difference and he replied that he thought the weather had improved a bit so if one can get used to that one can get used to being a humbersider <e>", "<cs> my lords we have arrived at the time of night when those speaking below the line as it were must try to dismiss the universe in a few easy phrases <e> <s> this is an immense subject but after the splendid speeches that we have had and today we have not just had well-intentioned speeches we have had knowledgeable and very well-informed speeches there is really almost nothing left to be said <e> <s> however even at this late hour i must thank the noble baroness lady masham for providing an opportunity for your lordships house to show itself at its very best <e> <s> nowhere was that better illustrated than by the splendid maiden speech of the noble viscount lord mersey who focused his own and your lordships attention on crucial aspects of a very important subject indeed and a potent cause of disability throughout the world leprosy <e> <s> after that splendid maiden speech i speaking as a doctor will leave your lordships house rather better informed than when i came in and that is not a very common experience for me <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us are entirely happy that these decisions should be left to local authorities provided that the local authorities take the right decisions <e> <s> when the local authorities take decisions which are manifestly wrong then we are not quite so happy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while many of us from the north are deeply concerned about the plight of our textile industry many of us are utterly opposed to tariffs and protectionism but believe that unfair competition is a very different matter <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that subsidised supplies of energy are a form of very unfair competition and that the fact that we took too little action over unfair competition from portugal and other places in the past does not mean that we should turn a blind eye to what our american friends are now doing <e>", "<cs> my lords if the old government that gave the pledge subsequently returns to office is the pledge as it were ressurrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i shall be excused if speaking below the line as it were i introduce some new thoughts on this subject at this late stage <e> <s> i shall probably find it necessary to do that because i say with great respect in some ways the motion of the noble lord lord beswick is defective in that it focuses our attention on the wrong issues <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter described it as peculiar and to that extent i am with him <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to lord beswick for what he said and the way he said it and i agreed with much of what he said <e> <s> in particular i agreed profoundly when he said that we should not turn the debate into an argument about the relative merits of nationalised industries and private enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl replies i wonder whether i might add one brief point in support of the arguments already advanced on this amendment by my noble friend lord tanlaw <e> <s> my noble friend has reminded the house of the alarming increase in muggings attacks robberies and other kinds of maltreatment of elderly people and others living alone by bogus callers of one kind or another and some of those bogus callers who have gained entry to the homes of elderly people have in fact done so disguised as meter readers <e>", "<cs> i too feel a little uneasy about acquiescing too precipitately in this particular course of action <e> <s> perhaps i am a little confused after the lengthy excursions that we made some time ago into the noble viscounts bog <e> <s> i am trying to collect my thoughts <e> <s> it seems to me that in acquiescing in this amendment we are immediately closing the door on a number of other possibilities on which i would have preferred to indicate my support such as amendment no <e> <s> and so on which will not be able to be moved <e> <s> therefore i am bound to say that i and i think some of my noble friends on these benches would side with <e>", "<cs> i must take issue with the noble earl when he tells the committee that there has been a lot of consultation <e> <s> what has happened is that the department sought advice from many bodies the countryside commission the nature conservancy council and various voluntary bodies received advice and then took no notice of it which is precisely why there are so many amendments on the marshalled list <e> <s> if the noble earl calls that consultation i cannot go far with him in that direction <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply to which i listened most carefully <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord with very great care and i will come straight away to one part of his answer namely that he felt that essentially the countryside commission was an advisory body and should not be given an executive function <e> <s> let me hasten to say that my purpose here tonight is not to do anything to defend the dignity or enhance the prestige of the countryside commission <e> <s> it is merely to do what i can to preserve and protect limestone paving <e> <s> i am bound to take issue with the noble lord for a moment when he says it is not appropriate for the countryside commission to have executive functions <e> <s> it has the statutory duty of designating national parks and of designating areas of outstanding natural beauty it has a statutory duty to carry out certain experiments it has a statutory duty to provide and run administer and finance information services in national parks <e> <s> it seems to me that these genuinely are executive functions <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies finally it might be helpful if i were to add a word <e> <s> naturally as i am no longer the chairman of the countryside commission i am not in a position to commit it to any course of action nor indeed am i in a position to say precisely what it might or might not do <e> <s> but i am bound to say that from my experience of the commission it would be very glad indeed to have this responsibility placed on its shoulders and would certainly undertake it gladly <e>", "<cs> i must say that the noble lord has said enough to make me rather worried about the governments intentions with regard to the future of the countryside commission and it does seem to me rather odd that he should say that the commission should not be a party to certain management agreements and that really we should have nothing to do with them when we are at the moment in fact grant-aiding them and paying public money to them <e> <s> i cannot say to the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne that i am wholly satisfied with his answers but i shall look at them carefully <e> <s> i am grateful to him for those answers and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> well i will say from my point of view that i had the feeling that the noble earl would be endeavouring to transmit to members of government the anxieties felt in various parts of the committee <e> <s> i am now hoping that we can be persuasive with the noble earl once again and that he will listen to <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for his reply to which i listened with care and which i shall read with even greater care <e> <s> i fully acknowledge that the amendment is defective in a number of ways and in any case could not have been pressed for a variety of reasons <e> <s> i also accept that it would not be appropriate at this stage to try to bulldoze into the bill quite extensive provisions of this kind <e> <s> but i hope that by moving this amendment i have alerted your lordships committee to the fact that there are areas of countryside in great britain which are under very serious threat and which will undoubtedly disappear unless something is done <e>", "<cs> i think the noble earl should be in no doubt as to the universality of the support in your lordships committee for the points made by the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> may i say from these benches that i agree with every word of the noble viscount <e> <s> having agreed with him i see no point in repeating those words <e> <s> however it may help the noble earl to realise that there is support for this point of view in all parts of your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> there is just one aspect which has not been referred to and perhaps i can raise it now so that the noble earl can reply to it <e> <s> i have already said that i do not believe clause can work without the back-up power in reserve which is referred to in this amendment <e> <s> i would also say to the noble earl that it will not work without money <e> <s> we have already heard about the agreements that have been negotiated so far <e> <s> i entirely agree with those noble lords who say it is not going to work unless there is adequate and wholly fair compensation <e> <s> the haddon hill agreement covers acres and cost rising to in because it is index-linked and it lasts for years <e> <s> with the glenthorn agreement in return for leaving acres unploughed and re-routing the south-west long distance path the owner receives per annum <e> <s> that lasts for three years <e> <s> since there are about acres of exmoor which is of the highest landscape value those agreements might cost up to a year at present value <e> <s> so clause cannot work unless money is supplied and i hope that the noble earl will tell us that the necessary funds will be supplied if we are to pursue the matter via this clause <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for that very sympathetic and if i may say so very understanding reply <e> <s> before i seek leave to withdraw the amendment as i presently shall though it will be necessary i think for the noble baroness to seek to withdraw her amendment to my amendment before i can do that i would say merely this to the noble lord <e> <s> i think it is right to say that the present arrangements do not invariably work entirely effectively because a secretary of state has other matters on his mind <e> <s> he cannot be thinking in detail about every national park and there are of them constantly and sometimes the names that emerge are not always entirely suitable <e> <s> they emerge from some recess within the department <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> again before the noble lord replies and i beg his pardon for delaying his reply i think that the waters and we are talking about waters have been a little muddied by the recent comment by the noble lord lord melchett with which i agreed when he referred very clearly to the enormous amount of very valuable work which has been done by the forestry commission with regard to the provision of recreational opportunities <e> <s> i hasten to say that there are some regional water authorities which have done likewise <e> <s> the record varies from area to area but in certain areas there is not the slightest question that <e>", "<cs> before we leave the matter it seems to me that in supporting the amendment the noble lord lord craigton did so because he felt that the original wording of the act was no longer in tune with what is actually happening <e> <s> i entirely agree with him <e> <s> whether this amendment improves that wording i am not quite so sure but the whole point is that if you take the wording of the act a duty to encourage a proper standard of behaviour on the part of persons and so on there are different ways in which that can be done <e>", "<cs> i listened to the noble earl most carefully and i understood him to say that he fully understood and that he would see to it that it was understood that there was grave anxiety about clause <e> <s> he made no mention whatever of clause <e> <s> is he aware that the anxiety about clause is equally grave and very similar to the anxiety about clause <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly merely in the hope of setting straight somewhat the record with regard to the comments made by my noble friend about the regrettable failure of the countryside commission of which i was then chairman to reply to one of the very many welcome letters which it frequently receives from mr grant king <e> <s> i am very sorry that apparently there was a failure to reply to that particular letter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i too can thank my noble friends lord beaumont of whitley and lord avebury and his friends and relations in various parts of your <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord buxton of alsa <e> <s> how glad i am to see him returned from his foreign travels in time to take an extremely active part i hope in the further stages of the wildlife and countryside bill when it returns to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may now return to the rather more tranquil waters under the control of the british waterways board <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i too should like briefly to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for giving us so clear an explanation of the purpose of this limited although very necessary measure <e> <s> i should also like to indicate our general support for the measure <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl lord caithness responds i hope that if the government accept these amendments that does not mean that the united exercise involving the noble lord lord houghton might not take place at a later stage because i believe we still need to return to the other matters <e> <s> like the noble lord i was by no means satisfied with the answer given to us on that but i was entirely satisfied with the course of action which the noble lord lord houghton proposes to take <e> <s> therefore if the government are going to accept these i hope they would be under no misapprehension that all our fears and apprehensions in regard to the other matter were therefore at an end <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving further thought to this matter would the noble lord the leader of the house bear in mind first that when members of this house become ministers they often have to give up other forms of regular employment secondly they may suddenly become unemployed as a result of a general election in which they played no part and thirdly some are of an age which makes it difficult for them to take up the threads of some former employment <e> <s> does not that mean that they should receive some kind of severance pay as do members of another place who fall by the wayside <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down when he tells us that his colleagues around him do not believe in compulsion may i remind him that some years ago a government of another party from that of the noble earl introduced the highway code which was purely advisory and could not be enforced but that later a conservative government found it necessary to introduce legislation to make it legally enforceable <e>", "<cs> my lords since the whole process was initiated by the borough of barrow-in-furness that clearly would be the district and the local planning authority would be whatever the local planning authority happened to be <e> <s> it cannot be an authority which is not a planning authority <e> <s> i think in this particular case it is the planning authority in which the site of special scientific interest happens to be situated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to the noble lord opposite for the sympathetic nature of his reply and indeed for the very careful consideration which has obviously been given by the government to this amendment since it appeared on the marshalled list at committee stage <e> <s> i am also grateful to other noble lords for their support and to the noble lord lord melchett for what he said <e> <s> he has made a number of very important observations regarding what are genuine problems not only at barrow-in-furness but in all sssis which are situated very close to urban populations and to recreational areas <e> <s> these are problems which will have to be dealt with in some way or another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that the noble viscount takes such an optimistic view of the future resources of the countryside commission so that they will be appointing this officer that officer and the other officer <e> <s> if we are to accept and it appears that the government do now accept that the whole question of the preservation of these remarkable limestone pavements is not purely a matter of flora and fauna and the very unusual biological developments which occur from plants which grow within these crevices in the limestone but is also a matter of the preservation of these limestone pavements on landscape considerations then it would be absurd if one was to ignore the governments statutory advisers on landscape matters who are in fact the countryside commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not dream of ignoring the county planning authorities for a moment <e> <s> i am taking issue with the noble viscount merely on the narrow point that he is apparently objecting to the introduction of the role of the countryside commission in a matter in which limestone pavement is to be protected on landscape grounds rather than on purely conservation grounds <e> <s> that would he quite absurd <e> <s> i have no quarrel with him on his other argument <e> <s> i have no wish to enter into disputes between counties and districts on these planning matters but i must insist that if it is to be accepted by your lordships house that for limestone pavement an unusual and remarkable feature of our landscape and also an unusual and remarkable habitat for certain plants we are to take into consideration landscape considerations one cannot ignore the governments statutory advisers on landscape matters namely the countryside commission <e> <s> my understanding of the noble viscounts observation was that he objected to the interpolation of the countryside commission in this matter <e> <s> i cannot go with him on that and i doubt whether he will find many other people who would so so <e>", "<cs> my lords i wait to see what the noble lord lord inglewood decides to do with the amendment <e> <s> i do not entirely disagree with what the minister said and as he has given such a sympathetic and co-operative reply i am sure that in the governments consideration of the whole matter they will wish to reconsider this aspects of it <e> <s> this is not a question of quangos <e> <s> i was going to tell the noble viscount that it takes two to quango but perhaps i had better not <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to what the noble lord lord melchett said <e> <s> while i agree with him that this is an amendment which should be agreed to i should assure him that what he hopes will happen will in any case happen <e> <s> as a former chairman of the countryside commission i think it is right to tell your lordships that the commission are utterly determined to take steps of this kind whether or not they are enshrined in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the government will do a great deal to cure the impatience of the government chief whip to which the noble baroness lady white referred by accepting the amendment which i hope they will <e> <s> i was immensely encouraged when the noble earl lord peel advised us to accept the amendment since i felt that some farmers might be a little suspicious bearing in mind that this is to do with grants <e> <s> but knowing the noble earl to be a suspicious yorkshireman and he having advised your lordships to accept the amendment <e> <s> i feel optimistic <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had so many happy disagreements with the noble lord lord stanley of alderley on this bill that i am a little reluctant to tell him that i totally agree with this amendment lest that should immediately tempt him to withdraw it without more ado <e> <s> i have some personal experience of a very beautiful dry stone wall being replaced by a post and wire fence <e> <s> i really think that while the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby may be right in that this merely requires the minister to pay due regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer so far as it goes may i ask whether he would not agree that if we have to plan for major unemployment in the future it is surely very much better for all those concerned and for society as a whole that these enforced periods of leisure should come at the end of the working life rather than at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords if jobs are to continue to be in very short supply is it not high time that we started dividing such work as is available a little bit more fairly throughout the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill replies and decides what steps he will take with regard to his amendments i should like to put one point to him which i think he may not have considered <e> <s> my understanding of the rules governing supplementary benefit is that any person in receipt of supplementary benefit is barred from receiving a rate rebate or a rent allowance <e> <s> indeed there have been many occasions on which i have had to advise certain elderly people who are in a borderline situation that they are sometimes very much better off by forgoing supplementary benefit and then claiming rate rebates and/or rent allowances <e> <s> i think that unless this particular matter is cleared up there could be a difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble earl lord longford with his very timely and if i may say so very necessary unstarred question <e> <s> i must be mindful of the fact that this is an unstarred question and not a major debate for were it the latter i would have no difficulty in detaining your lordships for some hours on a subject in which i have been deeply involved for many years <e> <s> i think the noble earl will forgive me if i say that we share the same disadvantage in that this is a subject about which we both know rather too much and therefore we have to be very careful in trying to concentrate our remarks into what is proper for an unstarred question <e> <s> i think that in the main all i would wish to do would be to amplify one or two points in the noble earls unstarred question and perhaps point to some of the areas in which the government might care to search for some of the answers <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and we must leave adequate time for the important debate which is to follow on the prayer book particularly when i bear in mind that for some of the people who are utterly dependent on government and local government personal social services there sometimes seems to be little left but prayer <e> <s> i hope that this debate may give them some other things on which to depend <e> <s> it would be a very great waste if such an excellent and well-informed debate with speeches of such high quality were to have no practical effect on anything or anybody <e> <s> it is my earnest hope that the government will think again <e> <s> to be honest and why should i not be so <e> <s> my worry is not their hearts but their heads <e> <s> at the beginning of this debate the noble lord lord wells-pestell raised the question of whether noble lords opposite were indifferent to or ignorant of the plight of some of the disadvantaged people in society <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the intervention by the noble lord <e> <s> it shows that he is listening with such care that perhaps there is hope that when he has heard the argument he may change some of his views <e>", "<cs> my lords with his vast experience of this place the noble earl lord mansfield will know perfectly well that the fact that a bill is extremely short does not necessarily indicate that all the speeches about it will be equally short <e> <s> i must say at the outset that i greatly mistrust very short bills <e> <s> frankly i do not altogether trust some long bills either <e> <s> but it is only fair at the outset to make it absolutely clear that my noble friends and i are not entirely happy with this modest but somewhat ill-defined measure <e> <s> here i very much echo some of the words spoken by the noble baroness lady jeger on her first appearance at the dispatch box <e> <s> i should like to say how well she has done and i am sure she knows that she has our very best wishes in her new capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl to which of these amendments he has the most objection <e>", "<cs> as a manchester man i feel i should almost ask leave to intervene in a debate on a scottish local government bill <e> <s> perhaps i might plead in excuse that i am one of the few if not the only one of your lordships to have played the bagpipes at the braemar gathering <e> <s> perhaps i ought to admit that i only learned to play the bagpipes in order to annoy my scottish cousins <e> <s> having said that i feel it right to indicate that my noble friends and i from these benches would be most anxious to support one or other of these amendments and we would try to support whichever one we thought was the strongest <e> <s> as the noble lord lord chelwood has said that is probably no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many doctors believe that the kind of safeguards to which he referred are not really necessary for the narrow range of people about whom the noble lord lord rugby is concerned <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that we once had another safeguard whereby patients had to trudge along to their general practitioners for a little green form known as an osc before they could have their eyes tested <e> <s> it took us years to get rid of that unnecessary control <e> <s> will the noble lord assure us that it will not take years to get rid of this one <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who for many years had to carry out medical checks on workers potentially exposed to asbestos in one of her majestys royal ordnance factories it seemed to me that the main effect of those regular medical checks was to induce a sense of false safety as it were <e> <s> if one found anything one could not do anything for the individual the real safety came from the controls on the use of the material rather than from the regular medical examinations <e> <s> my experience was that once one carried out those examinations the individuals concerned went away feeling the risks had all gone and they need not apply the various safeguards which were urged on them <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him this having made a speech which appeared to be wholly in support of my noble friends amendment and i listened with interest and i agree with everything he said and the speech was in support of my noble friends amendment he then sits down with the words that he cannot support the amendment <e> <s> can be explain that <e>", "<cs> frankly i listened to the reply of the noble earl lord gowrie with some despondency <e> <s> i rise merely to express the somewhat vain hope that some day a government will conduct their affairs in accordance with the political philosophy on which their policies are based <e> <s> we have i think what the conservatives like to call a non-interventionist govern <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for making his position clear and i am sorry if i in any way misrepresented it <e> <s> let me go on with the general theme <e> <s> as some noble lords will know i had the privilege and pleasure of serving for two years as a part-time member of the post office board under the distinguished chairmanship of sir william barlow <e> <s> i am informed reliably i think but i will not say by whom that during the period from st january when sir william barlow was first appointed chairman of the post office until may when there was a general election sir william barlow was called in on three occasions by the then secretary of state for industry mr eric varley for instruction or perhaps a better word would be advice <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds to that point may i raise another to which i hope he may be able to respond at the same time <e> <s> i do not necessarily support this group of amendments as a whole i accept part of what the noble lord said in reply with regard to unnecessary bureaucracy controls and so on <e> <s> the narrow point with which i am concerned is that it is a fact as the noble lord knows very well that the post office act relieves the post office of any common law liability in respect of any damage done or any loss however caused to anything carried through the post <e> <s> they have complete relief from common law liability <e> <s> one cannot sue the post office for negligence with regard to the mail although we know that the post office have now introduced both their own code of practice and certain methods of compensation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his assistance but before we finish with these matters as i suspect we are about to do would the noble lord give an absolutely categorical assurance that there is no question at any time of a licence to the licensee carrying with it the legal immunity which is at present enjoyed by the post office under the post office act <e>", "<cs> before we finally decide that very weighty matter i understand it is possible that the noble lord the minister might have further comments to make on matters which arose under this clause and the earlier clause further information which he might be in a position to give to your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the noble baroness lady trumpington on two counts first for giving us this opportunity to discuss a matter which has been in many of our minds for a very long time <e> <s> secondly i am very deeply grateful to her for having dealt so thoroughly with the present state of the law the absurd anomalies which arise from it and the very clear and urgent need for change <e> <s> the noble baronesss speech has enabled me to do two things which perhaps may appear to be contradictory <e> <s> first to be brief and secondly to broaden this debate into one or two areas which some noble lords may perhaps think do not concern this particular matter <e> <s> i assure them that if they listen to me they will find at the end of the day that they do <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that of those who die from coronary thrombosis about half die within the first two hours and that of those about half die from rhythm disturbances which could be reversed with the right treatment at the right time which is in the ambulance <e> <s> is he further aware that in brighton ambulance drivers have voluntarily submitted to training in monitored heart care defibrillation and so on with quite spectacular results in terms of the saving of lives <e> <s> if that can happen in brighton why can it not happen elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords on the same point if i can still be intervening in the noble lords speech i would just ask whether there are any means whereby the noble lord can confirm that in relation to the kind of difficulty which he said might arise he said unless some difficulty arises the government themselves will not precipitate one of those difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may dare presume to poke my english nose into this wholly scottish matter i should like to support what the noble lord lord drumalbyn has just said <e> <s> i hope very much that the noble earl will agree to reconsider the matter <e> <s> if he is not prepared to do so i hope that the sponsors of the amendment will not withdraw it <e> <s> i think that it should be pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to hearing the noble earls answers to the very pertinent questions put to him by the noble baroness lady masham and the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth <e> <s> these are important questions <e> <s> but in the meantime as one who supported the noble lord lord campbell of croy and others who raised this matter in committee it would be churlish if i did not on behalf of my noble friends on these benches express our indebtedness to the noble earl for what he has done regarding this new clause which is very important and also for the very important assurance that he gave us with regard to steps which will be taken concerning another measure which is shortly to come before your lordships house <e> <s> we too on these benches would like to say to the noble earl how very grateful we are for the steps that he has now taken <e>", "<cs> on the very last point i would say this <e> <s> the insurance companies themselves have got together and have established a fund to which people can apply if somebody is injured as a result of an accident where the driver is not covered by insurance a fund provided by the insurance companies which will see that compensation is paid but that fund is paid for not by the insurance companies but by other motorists <e> <s> it does not come from thin air it comes from premiums paid by other law-abiding motorists <e> <s> i do not think the fact that the insurance companies have erected this machinery which operates very fairly but at some cost in any way excuses us opting out of responsibility <e> <s> i share the view of noble lords in all parts who have said most sincerely that the noble and learned lord should look at this again <e> <s> it is a serious matter <e> <s> we cannot opt out merely because the insurance companies are taking necessary and proper action themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> that indeed was my understanding of the situation and i am glad to have it confirmed <e> <s> having had it confirmed the amendment is not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no way of knowing whether my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran will find the noble earls answer wholly acceptable and satisfactory but i am bound to say that having read carefully the noble earls answer on a previous occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords in discussing this group of amendments so ably and persuasively spoken to <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i intervene to say this the noble lord has made it clear that the government are wholly opposed to the uprating date creeping forward <e> <s> are they equally opposed to it slipping backwards <e> <s> the purpose of these amendments is to avoid slippage in the other direction <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord wallace decides what course to pursue perhaps i may say something else on this matter <e> <s> it seems to me there is one aspect of this very important question of take-up which was not referred to by the noble lord lord wallace in moving his new clause or by the noble lord lord cullen in replying <e> <s> all my experience of investigating the extent of take-up of different benefits a subject in which i have been deeply involved over many years has shown me that time and again we find very substantial local and regional variations <e> <s> i think that that is a most important point <e> <s> it is not actually referred to in the clause though i know there is nothing in the new clause which would preclude the secretary of state from collecting differential figures from different districts <e> <s> i have no doubt that steps will be taken by whatever party happens to be government i believe that there is general concern about the low level of take-up of certain benefits and if parliament goes to the trouble of voting money for the specific help of certain people it should obviously take steps to make sure that those people do get that help <e> <s> if we take things like the attendance allowance the invalid care allowance there is no doubt in the early days there were enormous differences in the extent of take-up between one area and another <e> <s> if statistics are to be collected from time to time as i very much hope they will be and i am absolutely certain that whether or not this new clause is incorporated into the bill ministers either in your lordships house or in another place will be required to make statements because they will make statements in reply to questions which will undoubtedly be put to them i very much hope that those collecting them will make a point of collecting differential statistics because i think there may be some message to be learned there <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise one specific matter arising from the new clause of the noble baroness <e> <s> if i raise it now it might be for the convenience of the committee if the noble baroness or noble lord who is to reply could take on board this point as well <e> <s> i am concerned with the narrow point and i share the view of the noble baroness in general about this of the effect of the savings rule with regard to supplementary benefits for the long-term unemployed <e> <s> i have encountered this so often that i thought that if i raised it now i might receive an answer <e>", "<cs> i have no wish to prolong discussion on an amendment which i am quite sure is wholly acceptable to each and every one of us <e> <s> but i should like briefly to support the words of warning as i think they were put by the noble baroness lady macleod <e> <s> this is a matter to which i referred in earlier discussions when i perhaps took issue with the noble baroness lady masham and i think we substantially agree with one another <e> <s> there is i think a problem in relation to the person who is not visibly disabled <e> <s> at an earlier stage in our proceedings in your lordships house today we were discussing the take-up of various benefits <e> <s> there is no question that there are certain disabled people who are not particularly anxious to carry about a badge despite the fact that the badge is very helpful and who do not like somehow to be labelled as disabled <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness comes to a decision in regard to the amendment i wish to underline something the noble baroness lady young said when she referred to the various organisations which represent the disabled <e> <s> a number of them have done quite extraordinary work in bringing out guide books catalogues and advice for the disabled as to facilities in rest rooms hotels and so on in different areas <e> <s> they have done a remarkable job in investigating inspecting cataloguing and publishing documented information available to the disabled telling them precisely what happens and where <e>", "<cs> having taken some part in the earlier discussions on this matter i am sure it would be remiss of me to allow us to take this decision without first expressing my gratitude and that of my noble friends on these benches to the noble baroness for what she has done <e> <s> i say without hesitation that we regard this new clause as immensely helpful and wholly acceptable <e> <s> i honestly think that the noble baroness and her colleagues really have gone as far as they possibly could <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should merely like to ask the noble earl would he not agree that it is unlikely that we would ever have had the norwich school of painters had it not been for cattle grazing in wetlands in east anglia <e> <s> would he further agree that the cost of restoring unique areas of countryside such as these when once they are lost is immeasurably greater than that of protecting them in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the noble earls reply although i did not have the benefit of hearing my noble friend move the amendment but it seemed to me that the noble earl had a difficulty for every solution <e> <s> i am bound to say that on one or two aspects of what he had to say to your lordships it seemed to me he had been wrongly advised <e> <s> this deals only with letters in respect of which both the sender and the addressee are outside the united kingdom <e> <s> i think that is utterly clear in the amendment and it seemed to me that what it was proposed to do by the amendment was in line with what is generally i think urged within the eec as a whole <e> <s> i was rather disappointed in the noble earls reply <e> <s> i assure him that i will study it with

noble baroness aware that environmental health officers through their central organisation have already indicated their willingness to be designated as access officers and take on these responsibilities <e> <s> is she also aware that the environmental health officers now give advice on home adaptations for the disabled and many of these matters but if they were designated as access officers the public would at once know who is responsible without the cost of an additional penny to public funds or without increasing staff for the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving further thought to this matter may i ask the noble earl to bear in mind that a very distinguished physician the late lord horder after a detailed investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble

of affairs <e> <s> if my understanding of what the noble baroness said is correct i am sure the noble viscount will be correct in withdrawing his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your

bill through your lordships house i should like to place on record my personal appreciation of the sympathetic hearing which the government have given to this bill <e> <s> i should perhaps like to qualify that by saying i rather regret although i understand the governments reluctance to do anything which would circumscribe the freedom of local authorities <e> <s> the government have said that they must not do anything which would interfere with the autonomy of local government although it seems to me that other government departments have sometimes been ready to interfere in local government so far as certain financial matters are concerned <e>", "<cs> my mind is certainly not as open as that of the noble lord lord renton on this point <e> <s> i and my noble friends on these benches would support him entirely in amendment no <e> <s> but i think we should all wish to go further and support the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth in amendment no <e> <s> which goes further

professional reports are just a little misplaced <e> <s> in my view if a person a doctor child psychiatrist or teacher does not have the ability to couch the true facts in terms acceptable to the

same people who are prepared to acquiesce in dismantling the machinery whereby we exert any influence <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be helpful if i indicated that my noble friends on these benches support the amendment very strongly for reasons not entirely the same as those admirably put forward by the noble lord lord underhill although i agreed with everything he said but rather more for the point touched on by the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> if we go back to the days before we came to the concept of a blood-alcohol level as being an offence we were in an area of extreme difficulty because fitness or unfitness to drive was largely a matter of opinion <e> <s> it was also a matter of opinion based on a recollection <e> <s> juries were asked to convict on the basis of an expression of opinion and there was no permanent record at which courts could look which gave incontrovertible evidence of the condition of the driver <e> <s> it was for that reason among others that we moved on sensibly and rightly to the concept of a permissible or impermissible blood-alcohol level and that did an enormous amount of good to get away from perhaps wrongful acquittals and prolonged legal processes which were entirely unnecessary and that change got us on to a much more orderly footing <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to join with the noble lord lord ponsonby in thanking the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> the noble lord will understand that this is a very complex statement with very important

preparations and presentation of reports of this kind <e> <s> i accept that with total disclosure of this kind which i recommend there is the risk occasionally of a parent being disturbed or distressed by seeing the report <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> but if that is the case i say so be it <e> <s> i believe that is the price we must pay for avoiding not the risk but the absolute certainty of very severe damage should there be a general feeling that somehow these reports are clouded in secrecy and cannot be seen <e> <s> i think that is where the balance lies and it is for that reason that i support the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his timely intervention as the first speaker below the line as it were otherwise your

be very brief indeed <e> <s> almost every speech that has been made today and some very interesting and highly well informed speeches have been made has been critical of the governments present

think i need say more about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to do no more than to express the gratitude of my noble friends on these benches to the noble baroness for what she has done in this amendment <e> <s> she knows very well that i might have preferred a slightly different solution but not having been successful in achieving that i do want to say how very grateful i am to the noble baroness the minister for what she has done here <e> <s> i take the view that three-quarters of a loaf which is what we have got is certainly a great deal better than no bread and so we are most

the scope of the ombudsman <e> <s> for them to have to seek out a member of the other place in order to put the complaint is surely undesirable and ought to be unnecessary <e> <s> finally may i ask

these benches are very anxious that today we should proceed as rapidly as possible so that we can arrive at other matters which are perhaps a little more controversial important though this question is <e> <s> i think it right to indicate that my noble friends and i on these benches will be supporting the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i say that merely in the hope that it might encourage other noble lords to do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to express my support for the amendment i might venture to hope that in do soing i shall also have the support of my noble friends on these

of other noble lords <e> <s> certainly we were in a fairly confused state a state of confusion which was perhaps partly added to by the assistance which we received at the last moment from the noble lord the chief whip when we endeavoured to adjourn the house in the midst of one amendment and halfway through another but my recollection is that this amendment no <e> <s> d standing in the names of the noble baroness lady white the noble lord lord hunt and myself was spoken to partly by my noble friend lady white in the course of moving earlier amendments nos <e> <s> a b and c with which it is

repeat the arguments so admirably put by the noble lord lord buxton of alsa and reinforced by the noble lords lord melchett and lord sandford <e> <s> i believe the case is utterly clear <e> <s> this

party and the labour party about the virtues of private landlords <e> <s> i should remind the house that we are not debating the wholly academic question of what a future hypothetical labour government would or would not do about the housing act and shorthold tenancies <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down in the light of what he has said just now could he tell us why it was that he supported the amendment which this order now seeks to vary <e>", "<cs> my lords i must clearly begin like other noble lords by joining in the congratulations which have been offered to the noble lord lord constantine on his maiden speech <e> <s> from the noble lord we had a maiden speech of quite remarkable brevity and in addition of unusual clarity <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will not misunderstand if i say that perhaps those two things brevity and clarity are not altogether unconnected <e> <s> indeed the noble lord will find perhaps he has found as he has listened to the debate today that quite frequently noble lords in your lordships house say some very wise things but occasionally they are a little difficult to find when they are smothered under minutes of things which are not quite so wide <e> <s> therefore the kind of clarity which we had from the noble lord lord constantine came partly from his brevity and it is an example which i should like to follow <e>

stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether he agrees that we are now dealing with a new group of people for whom

savings until those are reduced below the figure of <e> <s> does the noble lord think that it is right that prudent people who have become unemployed through no fault of their own should be forced to spend the minimal surrender values of i their insurance policies before qualifying for supplementary benefit despite the fact that others who own valuable unmortgaged properties do not have to sell those before qualifying <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl bear in mind that as regards those of us who have the outstanding natural beauty of wastwater and ennerdale at heart our enthusiasm for

ponsonby of shulbrede in thanking the minister for repeating this important statement <e> <s> arising from it i should like to ask the noble lord lord belstead two questions one specific and one more

manchester institute of science and <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising at this point i am very conscious of two matters <e> <s> the first is that owing to another public engagement it is possible that i might have to leave before the end of the debate but if i do so i hope it will be understood that no discourtesy is intended to those who follow me and shall read every word with the greatest possible interest though i shall stay as long as i can <e> <s> secondly i am conscious of the fact that this is an unstarred question rather than a debate <e> <s> for those two reasons i shall make a very short speech <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that while it is highly undesirable that agricultural workers should be burned it is equally undesirable that ordinary citizens should be burned <e> <s> does he agree that fire officers locally have an obligation to advise the public about fire precautions and fire prevention and is he aware that when individual citizens seek advice about which fire extinguishers to install the advice they receive is ambiguous and often varies from fire station to fire station <e> <s> in view of the importance of the issue raised by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley can the home office now issue a definitive clear and unambiguous statement so that we all know where we stand on this important matter <e>", "<cs> the committee may

committee will understand that doctors are just as delighted as anybody else to discuss their own ailments and also that my contribution to these proceedings will be somewhat brief this afternoon

very happy <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord elton for his reply and i will study it more carefully at a later stage when i have an opportunity to read it <e> <s> i will also i think it right to say seek further advice from professional colleagues and others as to the extent of a possible undesirable practice actually happening <e> <s> i think the noble lord himself said that in many circumstances it is entirely desirable and even necessary and essential that a certain patient be readmitted for a short term for observation <e> <s> in case it was not clear let me make it clear that i do accept that that may be entirely necessary and therefore must be provided for <e> <s> but i also still have a feeling that there is the possibility of the occasional repeated use of short-term compulsory admission to such an extent that it finally becomes long-term admission <e> <s> i think that is a possible abuse which perhaps ought to be looked at <e>", "<cs> i too initially had certain reservations about this amendment but i am bound to say that some of those reservations and anxieties were somewhat allayed by the explanatory words of the noble baroness lady faithfull

receiving end of the potential patient if i may put it that way is made fully aware of the various possibilities <e> <s> that i am quite sure is admirable and is something which should be supported <e>", "<cs> following the noble lord lord donaldson i am bound to say that it seems to me that we have now finally arrived at the situation when the happy convivial spirit in which hitherto we in your lordships committee have all been so anxious to agree with everybody is at an end <e> <s> i am bound to say personally that i regarded the reply of the noble lord lord sandys to this amendment really as distressing in the extreme <e> <s> it seemed to me that he showed a total inability to understand the feeling behind this particular amendment <e> <s> he used some very strange words <e> <s> in his reply the noble lord lord sandys said this and i quote him i think accurately <e> <s> he said that the public are entitled to be protected from the behaviour of mentally-disordered people <e> <s> the public are entitled to no such thing <e> <s> there is all manner of behaviour that i personally find offensive whether it is by mentally-disordered people or otherwise but i am not entitled to be protected from it <e>", "<cs> on that particular point surely the noble lord lord donaldson replied to that matter by saying these particular matters and i wholly agree with him there are items of nuisance which should be dealt with <e> <s> but does the noble lord not agree that the proper place for those to be dealt with is in the courts and not in the hospitals <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness is likely to seek the committees consent to withdraw the amendment i wonder since we may return to it whether it will be possible for the minister at a later stage because i doubt whether the knowledge will come to him now or quickly enough to be able to find out something about the actual practice at the moment <e> <s> i should be interested to know what proportion of persons at the moment detained under section are persons who have been detained previously under section <e> <s> those are figures which the committee might find helpful <e> <s> i use this opportunity of dropping that thought in the mind of the noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord avebury responds may i ask the minister to clarify <e>", "<cs> going on from there may i ask whether the noble lord would accept that a person who has been a prisoner in a prison and who is transferred to hospital shortly before the expiry of his sentence so that after the time of the expiry of his prison sentence he is in hospital is then a patient detained in a hospital within the very terms which the minister used <e>", "<cs> my lords the time would appear to have arrived when we should leave a subject which perhaps itself one day could lead to questions of civil liability and compensation for personal injury and return to our debate on that very topic so ably introduced by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister accept that front a medical point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in a position to tell the house whether the situation with regard to waiting lists for out-patient appointments at hospitals is as good and as encouraging as that which he has given us for in-patient treatment <e>", "<cs> like the noble baroness lady masham i too support this amendment and also like her i accept of course that amendment no <e> <s> in fact covers very much the same point as that covered by the later amendment

baroness strongly on this <e> <s> i agree with her that had the previous amendment been carried this amendment would not have been necessary <e> <s> but it seems to me that as we have not carried that amendment and as the governments further thoughts that we heard about from the noble lord lord elton have not yet been carried into action this amendment becomes even more necessary <e> <s> i am not sure that the noble baroness is wise not to press it although it would surprise me if she needed to do so because it seems to be such a reasonable simple logical and sensible request that i should have expected the noble lord in relief at not having been defeated on the earlier matter to embrace this amendment with enthusiasm <e> <s> at least i hope so <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord lord wallace of coslany is thinking about his reply perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord elton to explain one point arising from his answer which relates very much to the point which was made by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton said that the government could not possibly agree to the repeal of section here and now and putting nothing in its place <e> <s> for the government merely to <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for the answer he has given <e> <s> i am particularly grateful also and perhaps reassured to learn that he confirms my impression that this device is used only very seldom and indeed is a device that the police prefer not to use <e> <s> in those circumstances perhaps it is not important that i should proceed with it <e> <s> however i am bound to say that i believe there is something of a misunderstanding between myself and the noble baroness lady jeger and perhaps the right reverend prelate too <e> <s> it was not my intention that people who had perhaps been behaving in a disorderly wild or violent fashion and who had been removed to a place of safety by a constable should be sent home in hours <e> <s> my fear is that i am not entirely satisfied that people should be incarcerated in this way for hours purely on the opinion of a constable <e> <s> i should have thought that within that time in cases where further confinement is undoubtedly necessary not only for the benefit of the patient himself but also for the benefit of his family and others there would be an opportunity for the person to he detained further under section or or whatever <e> <s> but in view of the answer i have been given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies as the third signatory to this group of amendments i should like to say a word with particular regard to what was said by the noble lord lord hunter to which i listened with great interest <e> <s> his words are regarded with great respect throughout the whole of the profession and rightly so <e> <s> however i think that it is right for me as another doctor to say that there are two sides to this issue <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunter told your lordships committee that the second doctor as a matter of clinical judgment is perfectly able and perfectly competent to say whether or not the patient is capable of giving consent and that it is better that he should do it because he is able to do it rather than have the mental health review tribunal <e> <s> is it <e> <s> a doctor called as an expert witness who

element which is not a medical element <e>", "<cs> i would be misleading the noble lord which is the last thing i want to do at this late hour if i told him i was entirely satisfied with the reply he has given but i will study his reply carefully <e> <s> i have some doubts about it in particular regarding the definition of medical treatment <e> <s> i understand that the nursing profession are

lord has <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> it is my understanding that it is our intention that all those people should be so covered <e> <s> we are not singling

no <e> <s> b which stands in my name and that of my noble friend lady robson of kidding-ton since this amendment deals with precisely the same point though somewhat differently <e> <s> it perhaps would be sensible if i said something about this amendment before we discuss all three <e> <s> in doing so may i say straight away that i very much share the anxieties already expressed by the noble baroness lady faithfull with regard to the establishment of this new layer of bureaucracy we do not yet know how thick within the national health service which already has plenty of layers of

but let us leave that for the moment <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what was said by the noble lord lord auckland and since there may well be many other members of the committee who hold a similar view in regard to the establishment of the commission would it not be wiser for us to discuss that matter and to extract answers on that subject when we come to discuss whether clause shall stand part of the bill rather than on these particular amendments which seek to establish that if we are to have a commission at least we should have one whose work is public and is under public scrutiny <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a brief word of support for this amendment <e> <s> i do understand that the noble lord lord elton will perhaps be reluctant to widen the activities of the commission <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord elton whether he can answer one specific question in the light of what he has just said to your lordships committee <e> <s> if the bill is to be left as it now is without this particular amendment so that we do not have a provision that requires the commission to have regard to the interests of informal patients and if the commission

children mentally handicapped and otherwise have to remain in hospital for long periods would the noble lord the minister agree that we ought to do everything possible to develop more small family based hospital units and that we ought to do something to halt the continual closure of small hospitals something which has been going on for very many years <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister be kind enough not to forget discrimination against men in terms of retirement age <e> <s> is he aware that women live to a much greater age than men something about which the government

my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley it is clearly my duty to attempt so far as i can to draw together the threads of the many arguments already advanced and where necessary and frankly it has not really proved to be necessary having listened to all the speeches to try to rebut any arguments which have been put forward in a spirit contrary to those of the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords while fully accepting some of the points made by the minister in his earlier replies may i ask him whether he agrees that it would be extremely unwise to start reducing the capacity of our mental hospitals or to start disposing of allegedly superfluous accommodation until we have accurately quantified the real need which must include the numbers of people referred to by the noble baroness who are perhaps in prison who ought really to be in mental hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i always choose my words with care when i speak to your lordships house <e> <s> but on a matter in which i must inevitably speak in part as a doctor with nearly years of active medical practice behind me and i venture to hope a few more years of active medical practice before me perhaps i ought to choose my words with even greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that one cannot do exactly that <e> <s> the noble baroness can go over and over again to opticians who will not issue a prescription for her to take to others <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may have done it i have done it <e> <s> the noble baroness has been around for a fairly long time and it was easy to do it at one time but it is not so easy to do it now <e> <s> i wish <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble baroness would not wish to misrepresent me my lords and i did not suggest for a moment that it was a desirable practice <e> <s> i merely pointed out that it went on and it goes on largely i believe because of the present cost of spectacles <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord elton for directing our attention to amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord will realise was not in fact on the marshalled list at the time that i tabled my amendment <e> <s> had it been on the list and had i then had an opportunity of studying sufficiently what the noble lord has now put down in amendment no <e> <s> it would not of course have been necessary for me to delay your lordships house with the earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must guard carefully against the tendency to presume that i am in the committee stage of a bill i am very conscious of the fact that i am not <e> <s> as this is a comparatively new amendment perhaps i could ask the noble lord lord elton because he will have an opportunity to reply at the end of this brief discussion to explain it a little further <e> <s> we now have the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that every successive bite of the government front bench at this particular cherry has seemed to me to make the arguments for the amendment stronger rather than weaker <e> <s> the noble lord lord sandys began by saying that it was not necessary because every good doctor would do this <e> <s> i was grateful to him for his apparent assumption that all medical practice was good practice <e> <s> how i wish that the noble lord was in fact invariably right <e> <s> it ought to be good practice <e> <s> there are circumstances when doctors with the best will in the world because of staffing difficulties and the kind of <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord kilmarnock on this amendment it really <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt my lords that the noble lord lord kilmarnock will respond in the perhaps expected manner following the ministers sympathetic reply but first perhaps i might remind the house that we are in a sense in a negotiating position here when we debated this issue in committee we said four weeks and the government said whereas we now say eight and the government say they are sympathetic <e> <s> therefore hope they will return with some subtraction from rather than the movement being in only one direction <e> <s> i am sure the minister accepts the point made by the noble lord lord renton that one should not prolong the pet iod unnecessarily purely for assessment <e> <s> on other matters different considerations apply <e> <s> i urge the minister when giving further consideration to this subject which he has promised to do without giving a firm undertaking to try to find the shortest possible period which he regards as satisfactory <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down could he make it clear that the governments only present objection to this amendment is on the grounds of cost <e> <s> are there any other objections at all <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears that i have been caught in the noble lords ratchet and it is not awfully comfortable <e> <s> if i understand the noble lord what he has in mind is that a secretary of state might on some occasions reduce the period and then having reduced it would want to increase it <e> <s> i understand that and it seems entirely reasonable <e> <s> if that is reasonable then of course one does have to leave the word vary <e> <s> i would be happy to withdraw my amendment on the assumption that the word vary remains <e> <s> but my understanding is that the use of the word vary means that the secretary of state having first reduced the period will still have an opportunity to increase it later that appears to he the message behind the noble lords ratchet <e> <s> on that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would endorse every single word that the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> i think that everything that she has said is highly relevant and i hope that it will be listened to <e> <s> but my guess and of course my guess may be wrong is that we shall shortly hear from the minister that the primary purpose of this bill is to increase the safeguards for detained patients <e> <s> of course he will also point out that patients who are at large in the community requiring after-care help and supervision are by definition not detained patients <e> <s> however be that as it may if one looks at the long title of the bill there is nothing there that makes it impossible for us to include some kind of a provision of this type in this bill <e> <s> whether we are <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt very much whether the noble lord lord kilmarnock will wish to pursue the matter further <e> <s> however i am bound to say that i am very glad that he raised it again if only to extract once again the somewhat qualified assurances we have had from the noble lord lord belstead which we did in fact have in a perhaps slightly less direct form at the earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise merely to thank the noble lord lord elton for what he has done <e> <s> of course he indicated at the earlier stage that he might very well take this course and reverse the wording of the amendment so that the emphasis was essentially on consent rather than lack of it <e> <s> having done that i think it is a major improvement to the bill <e> <s> i think it possible that we might hope for certain other improvements but at the outset for myself personally and i am sure my noble friends who have been concerned in this matter and who were responsible for the drafting of our earlier amendments which i think perhaps sparked off this move from the government it would be right if i said a word of thanks to the noble lord for having taken this step which i believe has resulted in a genuine improvement to the bill and will also make its intention much clearer i think to others <e>", "<cs> my lords i really am most grateful to the noble lord lord elton for the manner in which he has replied to this amendment and indeed for the mood which i think he has injected into this very important debate <e> <s> i recognise what he has said and i fully understand that the noble lord lord elton and his colleagues are determined that we should make this part of the bill as good as it could possibly be <e> <s> i understand the offer which he has made to consult with me and perhaps with others about another course of action at third reading and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the right reverend prelate is on much more solid ground than i am on these particular matters and that he knows a great deal more about these different religious sects than i do <e> <s> may i qualify my words and merely say that we take the view that those who refuse blood transfusions on the grounds of religious objection should not be forced to have them <e> <s> that being the case one wonders whether it is right to impose treatment on mentally disturbed patients against their will when those patients are in fact capable of consenting or withholding consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord has noted that the amendment says subject to subsection above and that subsection describes a whole number of circumstances under which a patient must accept treatment in order to protect his life and for various other reasons and therefore this is not a blanket prohibition it excludes the matters referred to in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has given us once again a most thoughtful and sympathetic reply and a reply which shows not only his very deep understanding of the bill but his pretty deep understanding also of our fears about certain aspects of the bill <e> <s> i acknowledge that straight away and i have no doubt he understands that and in itself i think that is cause for gratification bearing in mind that he will have some responsibility for the bill after it leaves this place <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to apologise to the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for appearing not to be attending to what he was saying <e> <s> i assure him that i was listening most carefully <e> <s> i was also at the same time endeavouring to consult with my noble friend in the hope of reaching certain agreements which might perhaps speed the further progress of this bill at a later stage but i assure the noble lord that i was listening very carefully to every word <e> <s> i had in fact noted at an earlier stage what had been done and i formally express my personal gratitude to the noble lord the minister for what has been done in this matter <e> <s> i think it has in fact improved the bill and i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends i should like to join the noble lord lord bruce of donington in thanking the noble lord lord belstead for repeating the statement <e> <s> as the statement mentions this is a matter of very considerable importance with implications for the future of broadcasting and indeed all those who in one way or another depend on broadcasting <e> <s> at the outset we on these benches wish to say how very glad we are to see from the statement that the government have kept an open mind on certain aspects of the matter <e> <s> however that having been said we wonder about the decision to accept rather suddenly without further public consultation the advice of the bbc <e> <s> the bbc has already put forward proposals for two dbs channels and it has been decided that it would be right to authorise the go-ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness lady masham of ilton i see no point in repeating speeches on this subject which i have made before <e> <s> by prolonging the debate i should not be greatly assisting the noble baroness <e> <s> i would merely say at this eleventh hour of our discussion of this matter that as a result of all my discussions and i have had many with noble lords and noble baronesses i do not believe there is a single noble lord or noble baroness in your lordships house who does not believe it to be imperative that adequate after-care services should <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i of course accept that no charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has already suggested that i was unwise to poke my medical nose in church matters <e> <s> not for the first time have i found disagreement within the church on a particular matter <e> <s> but i have gathered also from the remarks of the noble lord lord renton that perhaps i am not wise in poking my nose into legal matters either <e> <s> but if i have done anything i have done him one service <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton at an earlier stage appeared to suggest that in his former capacity as a minister of the home office he personally was responsible for introducing the words substantial grounds <e> <s> i think i have released him from that unfortunate obligation in that i have shown that it came from earlier legislation and that it was not really his fault so that if i have done nothing else i have done at least that <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish if i did not begin by giving my very warm thanks to the noble lord for the statement he made earlier with regard to the action which will be taken in another place regarding the very important matter of the consideration of whether a detained patient is or is not able to give consent or to withhold consent from certain forms of treatment defined in the bill as treatments of special concern <e> <s> i should like to confirm as i have privately to the noble lord that the proposal is acceptable to me and that i and my noble friends are grateful for it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that at the moment there is a rather worrying general increase in the incidence of genetically transmitted diseases of which cystic fibrosis is but one and that that surely means that the government should at the moment increase their investment in genetic counselling services rather than reduce it as appears to be the case is the minister further aware that young people contemplating marriage and some young people do contemplate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that what people do when they are actually at work is every bit as important as how often they miss work owing to a strike <e> <s> is he aware that in many eastern european countries at the moment there are no strikes at all because they are illegal but that the productivity in those countries is extremely low <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many people who would be entitled to compensation do not apply because they mistakenly believe that it is first necessary for somebody to be apprehended and convicted of a criminal offence whereas as the noble lord will confirm all that is necessary is that the criminal injuries compensation board should be satisfied that the injuries have resulted from a criminal act <e> <s> can the government do something to publicise that important fact <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating the government on the reduction of personnel in the department of the environment can the noble earl tell the house how many of those civil servants who have gone were at assistant secretary or undersecretary level <e>", "<cs> my lords while many doctors show no reluctance to make quite heavy charges for <e>", "<cs> my lords in connection with <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that it might be helpful to many hill farmers particularly in the national parks if the planning authorities adopted a slightly more co-operative attitude towards the development of alternative activities which might supplement hill farming in those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that perhaps because of their previous reluctance to take industrial action health workers as a whole are among the lowest paid throughout europe <e> <s> in order to determine precisely where we in britain stand on this matter is the noble lord in a position to tell the house how many health service workers are at present in receipt of the family income supplement which the noble lord knows is paid only to those who in the light of their family commitments would otherwise fall below the poverty level <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is apparently unaware of how many of these people receive family income supplement may i ask him to arrange for his department to collect the information and then study it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount be kind enough to explain further the mechanism whereby a local authority could be required to provide a place bearing in mind that some local authorities do not have any places to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that somewhat grudging reply may i ask him whether as he is apparently unmoved by the consumer argument against serving beer in short measure he would bear in mind that whenever a barman serves beer in short measure he defrauds not only the customer but also because of the way by which duty is levied on beer the customs and excise <e> <s> does the minister find that argument sufficiently compelling to require beer to be served in an oversized marked glass instead of by the brimful measure from which it pours over the sides which is not really an entirely appropriate vessel from which <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might clarify the supplementary i asked in relation to duty my lords <e> <s> i was referring to duty and not to vat and the duty is levied on the barrel at so much per percentage point of specific gravity <e> <s> if a landlord is able to extract more pints of beer from a barrel than there are actually in the barrel which he can do by serving short measure he then collects more duty than he pays and he pockets it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he agrees that the actual demand for hospital care of one kind or another is by no means an accurate indicator of the potential demand <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that when waiting lists for outpatient appointments are long or waiting lists for so-called non-urgent operations are long general practitioners find temporary means of not adding to them which can produce a misleading picture <e> <s> in other words may i ask the noble lord whether he accepts that however effectively hospital workers perform and they perform very effectively indeed the total hospital resources at the moment are inadequate to cope with the total workload <e>", "<cs> my lords while fully supporting the noble viscount in what he seeks to do by means of this question may i ask the noble earl whether he is aware that the national park authorities are of the opinion that green is not an ideal colour for caravans in the countryside <e> <s> is he aware that one cannot pick the right shade of green and that some shades of green are very obtrusive at some times of the year <e> <s> experiments have shown that probably the least obtrusive colours are dark grey and black neither of which is very suitable from a temperature point of view for the occupants of the caravans <e> <s> with that point in mind would the noble earl agree that the best solution to this problem is the very careful siting of caravan parks and assistance with tree planting to screen caravans in the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords while fully supporting the noble lord lord chelwood in this matter is the minister aware that the undoubted increase in wine drinking by the glass to which his noble friend has drawn attention is due in part at least to an increasing realisation by beer drinkers that they are being defrauded of upwards a year in short measure <e> <s> if they are now to understand that they are being similarly defrauded in respect of wine is it not high time that the government acted to deal with both these abuses <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us are becoming increasingly alarmed by the frequency with which the noble lord claps his telescope to his blind eye and sees a false dawn on some remote horizon a dawn which is not seen by the cbi the city the bankers the economists or anybody else <e> <s> may i suggest very humbly <e>", "<cs> then may i ask the noble lord whether he will try the other eye and see things as they really are <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recollect that it is about eight months since this subject was debated very seriously in your lordships house <e> <s> in that debate noble lords from all parts of the house warned the government of the very serious consequences of any cuts in the vernacular services and in particular in the services in spanish <e> <s> is it not ironical that so soon after that debate we should now have cause to regret those cuts and to be suffering from them <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord specifically whether he recollects writing on st june this year to mr waller an honourable member of another place to say that when the government decided to end the services last year this was on the basis that their audiences were limited and were not influential <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the audiences included the king of spain and the leader of the opposition regularly <e> <s> from the figures he has given your lordships house they included more people in spain than those who listen to radio in britain <e> <s> finally may i ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord lord belstead not agree that if the spanish vernacular service goes the spaniards would not listen to the bbcs programmes in english but will listen to the vernacular services put out by the cubans and by the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that this very regrettable strike is by no means the only factor that is having an adverse effect on the work of national health service general practitioners <e> <s> has the noble lord been made aware of the report of the social services committee in another place which draws attention to the very serious effects which the university grants committee cuts are having on university clinical staff upon whom many general practitioners patients are dependent for their clinical care <e> <s> in other words would it not be a little unfair if we laid all that is wrong at the moment with national health service general practice at the door of the present striking health service workers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us would shed few tears if the whole pantomime of duty free goods on aircraft disappeared altogether <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that sometimes the duty free arrangements appear to be what is colloquially known as a rip-off under which our wives are persuaded to buy things they do not want at prices far in excess of those for which they could have obtained the same goods in a cash-and-carry at home <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to preface my brief remarks by thanking the noble lord lord elton for explaining the order so clearly <e> <s> unhappily i was prevented from being here to hear the explanation but i am assured it was very clear and i rise to say that we on these benches welcome the order in so far as it will be of help and assistance to the independent television contractors and other broadcasters at a time of very great difficulty <e> <s> looking at the order and the legislation on which it is based it seems that there is an element of assistance here and a recognition of the special problems they face <e>", "<cs> my lords i am mindful of the fact that this is not a short debate but an unstarred question and therefore it behoves me not to make a speech but merely to elaborate a little upon the noble baronesss question and perhaps add one or two questions of my own <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for drawing the attention of your lordships house to this matter of vital public importance and it is a matter of public importance not of importance merely to those at rampton <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to indicate the consent of my noble friends on these benches to this block of amendments <e> <s> i should like to do two other things but briefly <e> <s> first i certainly join with the noble lord lord renton in what he said about amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i too warmly welcome these <e> <s> i agree with him wholeheartedly that they make an immense improvement on the procedures which we have had hitherto and i think they are warmly to be welcomed <e> <s> i should also like to endorse what has been said by my noble friend lady robson in asking <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the opportunity of welcoming the noble lord lord elton on his return to this territory with which he had became so familiar and with which i may say he really had become so expert <e> <s> i say that without any disrespect at all to the noble lord who has now replaced him in office terms <e> <s> on this particular block of amendments <e> <s> i should like to raise one point which arises in both amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in underlining the remarks made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> this is indeed a very important part of the bill <e> <s> these are the most important amendments from the other place with which we have to deal <e> <s> it will also be remembered that this particular part of the bill was the part that occupied our time in your lordships house perhaps for longer than any other part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to the same plea in other words to double it as it were <e> <s> my anxiety is precisely the same <e> <s> noble lords may recollect that i played a perhaps prominent part in persuading the house to introduce an independent element into the whole question of the determination of a patients ability to consent and the question of whether or not he had consented with respect to the treatments which were then defined as treatments of special concern <e> <s> i think it only right to say that when i was doing that at an earlier stage of the bill in your lordships house i did not have in mind the voluntary patients <e> <s> therefore in many ways i sympathise with what has been said by the noble lord lord mottistone and indeed by the noble lord lord hill of luton though i think that perhaps some of their fears are a little exaggerated in that we have not yet seen what are the precise treatments they have not yet been defined in the regulations and so on <e> <s> perhaps the fears are a little overstated <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps for the record <e> <s> i may say that amendment no <e> <s> refers to the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord will recollect that i asked him some questions <e> <s> he answered all of them except one in regard to the definitions <e> <s> since this is also relevant to amendment no <e> <s> perhaps he could now reply to that question <e> <s> on this i asked whether there was any special significance in the omission of the words psychological consequences in relation to hazardous when there was the inclusion of psychological consequences in relation to irreversible <e> <s> i asked him specifically whether the inclusion of the word psychological in one case and its omission in the other had any particular significance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will realise by now that i have no intention of trying to alter the bill or even to improve it at this eleventh hour but i wonder whether perhaps in his reply the noble lord could be a little more forthcoming as to the possible extension of this role of the mental health act commission in investigating complaints and the possibility at some stage of extending that to voluntary patients <e> <s> as the noble lord acknowledges the bill in fact gives the mental health act commission certain duties regarding the care of voluntary patients <e> <s> that being so surely it is logical that in the end one should extend those duties even to the possibility of the investigation of complaints <e> <s> the noble lord said that various things were being done and it would no be practical to do this at the outset and so on <e> <s> but would he make it clear that it is the governments intention that in principle that extension should be made at some appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords in agreeing to these amendments which i most certainly do and of course i welcome the principle and am grateful to the noble lord for what he said may i say that in amendment no <e> <s> there is a reference to <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord wallace of coslany i would not dream of placing any impediments in the way of this particular commons amendment <e> <s> indeed i welcome the amendment and its effect but i am hound to say that like the noble lord lord wallace of coslany i am a little disappointed because in a sense i felt that the bill as it was before report stage in another place was marginally better <e> <s> i think that it has deteriorated a little and i still feel that there is a distinct risk that certain voluntary patients who are perfectly capable of voting and despite what is in this bill may nevertheless have difficulty in enforcing their right to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches and in addition i hope here that i establish a welcome precedent on behalf of and at the request of my noble friends in your lordships house in the social democratic party i should like to join the noble lord lord wallace of coslany in thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for repeating this important statement <e> <s> in so far as the statement suggests that there is a glimmer of light at the end of a long dark and frankly unnecessary tunnel we welcome it <e> <s> we would ask the noble lord to bear in mind that noble lords on these benches while fully understanding the reasons for the health workers industrial action have never supported that action though we have supported and still support their claim that many if not all health workers are in fact seriously underpaid as evidenced by the large number of full-time workers who are at present in receipt of family income supplement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in a position to tell the house whether any of the who were deported were refugees within the definition of article of the united nations convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my name would have appeared on the speakers list as the first speaker below the line rather than the last speaker above it had i not feared that another engagement on other public business would have compelled me to be absent for the opening speeches <e> <s> my fears proved well grounded and i was not able to hear the speech of the noble lord lord trefgarne in explanation of this bill <e> <s> i am quite sure that he explained it in his usual lucid and clear manner and i would merely assure him that i shall read his words with great care but i should like to apologise to him in advance if i ask him any questions that he has already answered <e> <s> nor did i hear the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and i apologise to him also and assure him that i shall read his words too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for making that point and perhaps we can return to the question of the voluntary bodies shortly <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull said my noble friend lady robson had said that what was being proposed was a good thing to do because it was cheaper <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness said it would save money <e>", "<cs> very well my lords <e> <s> my noble friend actually said that some people said it was cheaper <e> <s> i am one of those who say it is cheaper <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull says it is better <e> <s> i am one of those who say it is better as well so i say it is both better and cheaper <e> <s> so far as cheaper is concerned perhaps at this point i might give a brief example of something that is going on here and now and in giving this example i must stray to the area of the family practitioner committees to which i had intended to refer in any event <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord ponsonby i must begin by thanking the noble lord lord orr-ewing for giving the house an opportunity to discuss a matter of great importance <e> <s> i must also thank the noble viscount lord rochdale for his courtesy and kindness in giving us adequate time to do justice to a subject of great complexity and importance <e> <s> not that there has not been enough discussion already <e> <s> it seems that for many months past some people have been discussing nothing but cable <e> <s> unfortunately it seems that most of that discussion has been focused on the wrong areas on technical questions regarding coaxial copper fibre optics tree and branch systems and the like whereas what really matters are the actual television programmes transmitted via cable who is to make them where are they to be made and what standard are they to be <e> <s> and that has been largely overlooked in the earlier discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must join with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany in thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for the clarity with which he has explained this bill <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord and with the noble lord lord wallace that this is very largely a non-controversial measure an agreed measure but i also agree with lord wallace that it is an important measure <e> <s> as a doctor i think i am right in saying i intend to say it right or wrong that we are a little too fond of separating health into little compartments <e> <s> i believe that dental health is an essential component of health in general and i have always thought that there are many medical conditions which arise from dental ill-health <e> <s> therefore as a doctor i take an interest in what goes on in the dental field <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches and also on behalf and at the request of my noble friends in the social democratic <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asks whether that is true <e> <s> it is true otherwise i would not have said it <e> <s> what always happened in the past was that immunisation for children was provided free up to a certain age <e> <s> the secretary of state for health decided to raise that age <e> <s> it was raised to the age of three or even four for older children where immunisation against pertussis whooping cough could be provided free <e> <s> that was done as the secretary of state explained not for the protection of those children who were being immunised because we recognised that in their case whooping cough was less serious but for the protection of other very young children with whom they might later come into contact <e> <s> therefore we quite clearly have a group of children who have now been immunised not for their benefit but for the benefit of others <e> <s> should it happen that it ultimately turns out that some of those children have been and some may have been i do not know damaged by this vaccine then we ought to realise that we must have a particular responsibility towards those children <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for what the noble lord has said but it will not have escaped the notice of the noble lord or of others in your lordships committee that there have been certain impediments placed in the way of transport authorities providing concessionary rates for transport <e> <s> therefore it is very welcome to hear the noble lords assurance that for these particular purposes obstacles will not be placed in the way of such concessions <e> <s> i will read the noble lords words with care but so far as i have understood them they seem to be entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the noble lords assurance that he will look at this point <e> <s> i do assure him that it really is a serious point and that we have no quarrel with the basic intention behind this part of the bill but we really feel that so far as these old hospitals are concerned taking patients from a very wide area there can be some very serious administrative problems <e> <s> on the noble lords assurance that he will look at that and perhaps produce a remedy for it <e> <s> i should indeed be glad to seek the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall most certainly reflect upon what the minister has said and will also consult my <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that the government have set up an inquiry into the working of that provision of the supplementary benefits rule which the minister quoted because in the view of the government it is not working fairly <e>", "<cs> on a point on information may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> i appreciate that it probably is wise to have this provision and that the barrister advocate or solicitor should be of not less than seven years standing but i wonder whether there is any provision as to the upper age limit whether perhaps he should be of not more than years standing for example <e>", "<cs> and the upper age limit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that in when the post office board contained seven trade union members the post office board decided that it was both feasible and desirable to restore sunday collections and decided unanimously so to do <e> <s> however when the question of sunday collections went to the conference of post office workers in the summer it was turned down by if i recollect correctly something in excess of votes to seven the seven being the seven trade union members of the post office board <e> <s> in the light of that experience would the noble lord agree that while it may be desirable to restore sunday collections and while many old people would like to feel that their week-end letters are being speeded on their way the prospect of their restoration is somewhat remote <e>", "<cs> while i have sympathy with the noble lord lord taylor in what he said about his later amendment i hope he will forgive me if i say that reference to that later amendment rather muddies the water in relation to this specific amendment <e> <s> on that matter before the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe had spoken i was very much in agreement with what lord ross said about the desirability of full consultation with the voluntary bodies but in that argument i was inclined to lean towards the arguments advanced by the noble earl in relation to his limited amendment which says <e>", "<cs> i too hope that in the fullness of time we shall have an assurance that the commission itself will include commissioners i do not say how many of whom some at least will be capable of speaking on behalf of the different voluntary bodies <e> <s> there are slight difficulties in the noble lords amendment in that he merely requires that the secretary of state shall ensure that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ross of marnock decides what course of action he will pursue with regard to his amendment may i say a word which perhaps he might consider in relation to what has been said already <e> <s> i share his view about certain aspects of the amendment that he has moved <e> <s> i think that we can perhaps lean over rather too far in relation to paying people for the kind of duties which in the past were generally regarded as being jobs which people did because they wanted to do them <e> <s> but there is another aspect of this matter which ought to be borne in mind and particularly with a commission such as this on which it is possible that perhaps we may want quite senior medical people or professional people who are in employment to take on the duties of a commissioner for it might be two days three days or even four days a week <e> <s> it might perhaps be necessary before a person could accept appointment as a chairman or as a member of the commission that that person should give up full-time superannuated employment <e> <s> i am aware of cases where this question has arisen and i have a particular case in mind <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with what has been said by the noble lord lord campbell of croy and it therefore follows that i agree with much of what has been said by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i do not want to go into the merits of the argument about the precise wording that is used but in the earlier measure which we dealt with in your lordships house relating to england and wales we spent a great deal of time on this particular matter and the arguments were developed at great length <e> <s> i think that noble lords were satisfied by the force of the arguments <e>", "<cs> in order that the noble earl will be aware that the feeling on this particular matter is the same in all parts of your lordships committee i too should like to support what has been said <e> <s> we have seen a change in attitudes towards the mentally ill throughout the whole of britain in all its component parts <e> <s> there has been a move away from the idea of hospitalisation and institutionalised care for the mentally ill and suddenly community care has become the kind of popular catchphrase that provided these people are in the community there is a general feeling that all is well that we can close down the big institutions and make them smaller and smaller as long as people are cared for in the community <e>", "<cs> my knowledge of this subject is related much more to what is now happening in england and wales than to what happens in scotland but my understanding is that this arose largely as a result of the seebohm report and the move to what are called generic social workers instead of specialist social workers in different fields <e> <s> at one time mental health officers and social workers doing mental health work had a detailed training <e> <s> we then moved to a situation in england and wales in which all social workers were social workers full-stop <e> <s> some of them happened to look after children others looked after the mentally ill and so on <e>", "<cs> the bill states <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i was merely going to say that i am most certainly capable of understanding the noble lord though at this hour of the night i am not wholly satisfied that i totally understand him <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord airedale for his support and for the <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy has raised a matter of immense concern to all noble lords who have the interests of the national health service at heart and i like to hope that that means all noble lords in the house <e> <s> in that case we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for raising the matter <e> <s> before i cover rather different points than those which were raised by the noble lord lord molloy i should like to underline one or two of the matters to which he has alluded <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister in a position to tell the house what progress has been or is being made in the development of a whooping cough vaccine which does not cause brain damage <e> <s> is not progress in that direction every bit as important as progress in the direction to which the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has drawn attention <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we on these benches welcome the steps taken by both sides in this dispute to protect the interests of those who are undoubtedly at special risk <e> <s> going to the more general points made in the answer may i ask the minister if he agrees that our water supply and sewage disposal systems in britain have together done more to protect the public health of our citizens than the work of all the doctors put together <e> <s> in those circumstances it follows that any interference with those services could be catastrophic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i have listened most carefully and i think i can say at once that i do not disagree with a single word the noble earl has said <e> <s> at the same time <e> <s> i cannot see why the words he has said should in some way lead him to believe that he cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> he has said that there will be done precisely what is required in the amendment <e> <s> the amendment is not onerous it does not place a specific obligation on anybody <e> <s> it merely requires that the needs of the disabled should be thought about <e> <s> in so far as i understood the noble earls words to indicate that that would be the position <e> <s> i am reassured <e> <s> i would have slightly preferred to see something written into the bill <e> <s> but in the light of the noble earls remarks and his clear assurance that it is his desire that what i have in mind will in fact happen i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl replies i should like to add a word to what has been said <e> <s> as a former chairman of the countryside commission i have of course <e> <s> no right at all to speak on behalf of the countryside commission as it now is but i am bound to say that from my reading and my study of the amendment i cannot see any reason why the countryside commission would not welcome an amendment of this kind <e> <s> it is of course a fact that the countryside commission has frequently been involved in gardens in one way or another not the creation of the gardens or the management of them but the fundamental part of the countryside commissions statutory obligations is that it must do what it can to promote access to the countryside <e> <s> it often uses that definition countryside to include gardens of the kind that the noble lord has in mind access to the countryside for the purpose of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i am not the only member of your lordships house to be disappointed by the answers given by the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e> <s> i personally felt that the answers he gave were very much the kind of answers which were given by those who resisted the introduction of the designation of areas of outstanding beauty to which the noble lord lord kennet very properly referred <e> <s> the noble lord is entirely right the designation of an area of outstanding beauty does not in some way freeze an area nor does it introduce new planning controls <e> <s> the fact remains that once an area has been designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty it has a remarkable effect on the attitude of ministers from time to time when different departments have to take certain decisions <e> <s> it is not a statutory matter but the very fact that a place has been designated in that kind of way has alerted those with responsibility in other fields to the importance of the particular area <e> <s> i believe that this kind of register would have the same effect <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point may i confirm that doctors greatly value the help assistance and guidance that they get from qualified and trained social workers <e> <s> perhaps i may add that they do not so much value the help that they sometimes get from social workers who have not been trained <e>", "<cs> my lords after a rough calculation it seems that the noble lord lord trefgarne has just moved an amendment which together with the various other amendments to which he has spoken add up to pages of amendments to a bill which itself runs to only pages <e> <s> i venture to say that this almost justifies another second reading debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the noble lord lord kilmarnock from these benches in respect of this particular amendment <e> <s> this does not necessarily mean that i agree with every single word the noble lord said when making his preliminary remarks about the new situation of the family practitioner committees under this bill <e> <s> this is a matter that will be discussed by my noble friends on these benches and by the noble lord with his noble friends on other benches but on this particular amendment we are entirely at one <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes can he tell the house whether the inquiries which his department must have made into this whole matter before framing this legislation have given the noble lord the kind of information which will enable him to tell the house anything about the frequency with which he thinks this power may be required <e> <s> i ask that question because my experience as a general practitioner dealing with old people is that the country s not full of old people with a compelling desire to give everything away <e> <s> indeed my experience is to the contrary <e> <s> can the noble lord say how often he thinks this power will be required <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to protract the proceedings further beyond saying that i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he has done <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker below the line in this debate rather than introduce new themes i ought to focus my words on the speeches already made <e> <s> in that connection i have to apologise at once for having missed the first two speeches those of the noble lord lord bellwin and the noble baroness lady fisher <e> <s> perhaps i will be forgiven when i tell the noble lord that i was engaged this morning on an on-site visit looking into some problems which are aising on the shores of thirlmere which as the noble lord will know is a lake in the lake district national park which happens to be owned and managed by the north-west water authority and i may say managed in a way not wholly suited to those who have the interests of the national park in mind <e> <s> however i have heard all the other speeches and that means that like other noble lords i had the privilege of hearing two most elegant and eloquent maiden speeches from the noble baroness who brings a great knowledge of local government and great feeling about local government to your lordships house and again from the noble lord lord hemingford who brought us his knowledge of the press <e> <s> i think both maiden speakers did credit to our debate and made speeches of a kind that make us all anxious to hear them on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies may i add my support as briefly as i can to what has been said by the noble baronesses lady masham of ilton and lady faithfull <e> <s> this is an important point and i hope that in replying the noble lord will be able to reassure the house on the particular point made by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think i sense that the time has come to return to the amendment moved <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the extremely helpful attitude which the noble lord the minister has displayed throughout the various stages of this bill and his particular courtesy in discussing this matter with us very fully it will be churlish to persevere with the amendment at this stage particularly bearing in mind that our points have been adequately ventilated in your lordships house and may perhaps be taken up in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the noble baroness <e> <s> i would say that the decisions which have to be made particularly medical decisions by the doctors in these cases are desperately difficult decisions <e> <s> many of them are controversial many lead later to a great deal of bitterness and recrimination <e> <s> i do not suggest for a moment that two doctors will necessarily make better or wiser decisions than one but i do say that a single doctor who is the only doctor dealing with the matter will be put in a very difficult position in having to take decisions which are critical and complicated <e> <s> for the benefit of the doctors themselves i think it is helpful that the doctor should have a colleague with him to reinforce him in his belief and in his judgment rather than that he should on some occasions be required to act single-handed and alone <e> <s> it is not that i feel the decision will necessarily be a better one but i believe it will be of <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i associate myself with many of the remarks made by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and in particular his thanks on behalf of noble lords to the minister <e> <s> i echo what the noble lord lord wallace of coslany said <e> <s> i am quite sure that this is now a much better bill which will presently leave your lordships house than it was when it came in <e> <s> that in part eloquently justifies the service which your lordships house gives on matters of this kind <e> <s> your lordships house brings great knowledge and wisdom to bear on these matters and there is no doubt that the bill has been considerably improved no little as a result of lord trefgarnes very helpful attitude throughout <e> <s> not only has he put up with some long speeches from various parts of the house but he has listened to them understood them and taken on board the points made <e> <s> as a result he has effected many improvements to the bill and i too would like to give my personal thanks and those of all my noble friends to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock suffers whatever fate is likely to befall it perhaps i could add a few brief words in support of the theme underlying what the noble lord has been saying <e> <s> he is of course right that we have taken this step with regard to the bill for england and wales <e> <s> it would appear that if we accept the noble lords definition of mental disorder which he has read to us and it is the definition contained in the bill and if we take the general question of mental handicap the justification for paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord ross in thanking the minister for this group of amendments which are a considerable improvement <e> <s> i think i understood the noble earl to say that once we have accepted these amendments we could then have an opportunity of discussing clause as a whole <e> <s> it would seem to me that we shall have an opportunity of discussing clause as a whole only if the noble lord lord ross moves his amendment no <e> <s> which it occurs to me he might not do now that he is welcoming these amendments <e> <s> therefore rather than miss an opportunity perhaps i could say a word about this group of amendments which relate to clause and then it will not be necessary for me to say anything more later <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for misjudging him <e> <s> from our association in another place i should of course have realised that he would inevitably pursue matters to the very end of the road whatever the odds and so i should have known that he was bound to move his amendment <e> <s> i must also apologise to the noble earl for trying to get in my words in the wrong place <e> <s> perhaps he will acknowledge that as an englishman sitting in on the bill i have exercised a fairly masterly restraint in saying very few words <e> <s> i am here only because my noble friends from scotland who normally claim to exercise proprietary rights over anything at all to do with scotland whenever it crops up in your lordships chamber once medical matters are raised seem to disappear from the scene altogether and leave it to me <e> <s> i have tried not to say too much and i do not want to prolong this discussion <e>", "<cs> parliament can have a look at it <e> <s> but it would be nice to know precisely what the secretary of state is going to prescribe <e> <s> from my own knowledge i can say that in scotland many of the hospitals are very much better than some of the hospitals in england and wales but i do not think it possible that anywhere in the united kingdom there would be a hospital where one was unable to get hold of a relatively senior highly qualified nurse if needed <e> <s> the idea that there would be only a junior nurse available i just do not accept <e> <s> i think that there will be somebody of stature and considerable training and that is quite important <e>", "<cs> my lords on that very point the noble lord did say that we have not proceeded with a change in the procedure in relation to the bill for england and wales and he is of course entirely right <e> <s> perhaps he will recollect that it was only as a result of debate and amendments moved in this house in relation to the english bill that we got certain of the safeguards which are contained in this bill in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness in moving the amendment said that she hoped she would have the support of all the members in your lordships house <e> <s> i should perhaps indicate that it at least has the lukewarm support of those on these benches <e> <s> it certainly does not have any opposition <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that this new title perhaps is better in many ways <e> <s> it deals with some of the difficulties to which the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu referred but i am not wholly in sympathy with the noble baronesss desire to drop the word heritage altogether <e> <s> as she rightly said we have been talking about heritage for such a long time <e> <s> it is a pity to say goodbye to the word when we are coming to the title <e> <s> this is the wrong time to suggest another title but had it been possible i would have suggested historic heritage commission the initials hhc not being in any way ambiguous in relation to other existing bodies <e> <s> perhaps that would have been another possible solution <e> <s> but it is too late to have other solutions now and at this stage we should accept the noble baronesss suggestion as being an improvement on the words in the bill at the moment though perhaps we should have liked to see them improved still further <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i would like to join with the noble baroness lady fisher in thanking the noble lord lord bellwin for repeating this important statement <e> <s> we on these benches welcome these three important measures which as the statement says are designed to improve the older industrial areas of our country <e> <s> very welcome though they are i hope that it will not be thought churlish if i suggest that these three measures do not in themselves do anything to combat the major problems with which the older industrial areas of our country are faced namely crime and unemployment <e> <s> perhaps we could suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble duke the duke of grafton decides whether or not to seek leave to withdraw the amendment perhaps i may add a few words of support to what has been said by him <e> <s> the noble earl the minister has said that he accepts the underlying principle that he will take it further and that perhaps amendments along these lines will be made in another place <e> <s> but if the noble earl the minister is to think further about these matters perhaps it will be helpful if i say a little more about the background to the problem <e> <s> it appeared that the minister seemed to suggest that with the two amendments we were almost producing a belt and braces situation in which there was an overlap where perhaps the national trust or some other landowner could be in a position to seek grants from two different bodies <e> <s> if there is an overlap so be it why not <e> <s> what is very important is that we should not have a gap and it is on that point i want to say a few more words so that perhaps the noble earl the minister can consider it when he takes the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely going to underline the words of the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu <e> <s> i am delighted to learn that when the noble lord lord skelmersdale said that this amendment is not intrinsically objectionable he in fact meant that it was wholly acceptable <e> <s> i underline every word that the noble lords lord montagu and lord strathcona said <e> <s> it is important to write this into the bill <e> <s> it will give immense satisfaction to all sorts of people <e> <s> i do not think that it is a sterile exercise i do not think it is just a matter of finding a form of words <e>", "<cs> my lords hitherto i have played a very minor and insignificant part in the proceedings on this bill and i have no intention of trying to play a larger part at this very late stage <e> <s> the burden in so far as there has been any burden on these benches has been borne by my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley <e> <s> had he been here and regrettably he cannot be i am sure that he would have wished to thank the noble earl and other ministers for the unfailingly courteous and conciliatory manner with which they have greeted the various arguments that we have put to them <e> <s> purely personally i think that on a bill such as this we see your lordships house at its very best <e> <s> i have found it fascinating to see the unusual <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain your lordships for more than a moment <e> <s> but it is only right that an english intruder to these scottish matters should say a brief word of thanks to noble lords for the manner in which they have received the intruders contributions on this scottish bill <e> <s> perhaps i should widen my thanks to embrace my noble friends lord mackie lord thurso and lord tanlaw who have absented themselves <e> <s> normally if i dream of saying anything in a scottish bill i bring down the wrath of my noble friends in scotland about my head <e> <s> on this occasion the bill being so very complex and perhaps technical my noble friends from scotland have disappeared from the scene altogether and have left it to me <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord and the government take steps to encourage the extension of post bus schemes to other areas <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that these services are of immense value to people in rural areas which are lucky enough to have post buses such as the lake district and parts of the yorkshire dales <e> <s> since those services are very valuable to people in rural communities and also of immense value to the post office itself would it not be wise to encourage the establishment of more post bus services <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene in this particular debate but i feel tempted to say a word in support of the remarks made by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> i served for some time on wasac the water space amenity commission and in addition in my capacity as a former chairman of the countryside commission i had an opportunity to observe at close hand the apparent change of heart that came over the water authorities over a number of years as the noble lord lord nugent has said <e> <s> he can remember as i can the time when water authority land on the whole was a sort of no-go area <e> <s> you could not go anywhere near the reservoir and you certainly could not bathe in it or fish in it or picnic by it and so on <e> <s> there has been a total change of heart <e> <s> i genuinely believe that has been brought about by the activities of bodies like wasac which is now to go and by the recruitment into the water industry of many staff members at a senior level who themselves have great interest and expertise in such matters as recreation and wildlife <e>", "<cs> as the mover of this amendment obviously i should express my deep gratitude to the noble lord lord bellwin for the statements he has made and for the action he has taken <e> <s> i too should like to underline every word that the noble lord lord sandys has just said <e> <s> i should not want my gratitude to be diminished in any sense by any critical words but i will also associate myself a little with the remarks of the noble baroness lady serota <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has decided not to take a backward step <e> <s> in relation to the very last words that he spoke to us i hope that he will some day take some forward steps <e> <s> i should like to see an ombudsman whose task was to investigate all the statutory undertakers gas electricity and the rest as well as water but that is another story <e> <s> i can only say now that i am deeply grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that while we may very well keep pace with the technological development of our european partners we do not necessarily keep pace with them in the actual provision of this kind of equipment to disabled people <e> <s> for example would the noble lord agree that if every totally deaf person was able to have access to the kind of equipment which is used by mr jack ashley in another place many of those totally deaf people would be able to get and to maintain full-time employment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the management inquiry team will be able to examine the elephant and castle district and the department of health and social security centrally in addition to the hospitals and the health service in the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that perhaps the figures for truancy among teachers are just as revealing about the conditions in the schools concerned as are the figures for truancy among pupils <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord nugent of guildford replies may i make a very brief point <e> <s> i understood that the advice given to us by the noble lord lord bellwin was to the effect that he felt <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment moved by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> it is a simple amendment <e> <s> it does no more than require the water authorities to do in advance the kind of things which they are invariably asked to do when at the end of the day their proposals have to go to a public inquiry <e> <s> every time there is a public inquiry and frequently there is on proposals such as this the questions asked of the water authorities and upon which evidence is given are have they demonstrated the need <e> <s> have they explored alternative sources <e> <s> are they making the optimum use of existing sources of water and so on <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> on that particular matter surely the point made by the noble earl lord onslow was with regard to the surplus water in rutland water which in fact is no longer in rutland water <e> <s> i think that the noble lord the minister has to accept the point that water which may not have been surplus is no longer there because the level has been reduced by about feet <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> perhaps i did not make myself clear and since the noble lord did not understand me it would appear that i did not <e> <s> all i said was that since there has been a reduction in demand for water to which the noble lord has referred and i acknowledge that i also acknowledge that it could not have been forecast alternative uses have been found <e> <s> in other words the kielder reservoir has become an extremely important centre for water-based recreation <e> <s> that is quite valuable and it is a very sensible thing to do with a piece of water that is not now used for the purpose for which it was originally provided <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he explain further the point he made about the noble lord lord melchett confusing the new water authorites with the land drainage committees <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment is perfectly clear <e> <s> it asks for these two people with special knowledge to be on the regional land drainage committee <e> <s> i am wondering if by his words the noble lord was <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure about my noble friends intentions with regard to the amendment <e> <s> i wish to say that i support very fully what my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran has said <e> <s> this is a matter which concerns me as it concerns noble lords in all parties who spoke at second reading on clause and who have spoken on it at other times <e> <s> having listened to the reply of the noble lord my difficulty is that i find that the second half of his speech is in direct conflict with the first half <e> <s> the first half seemed to be totally without sympathy for the arguments advanced by my noble friend but when the noble lord reached the second half of his answer he sounded very much more amenable and understanding <e> <s> i shall want to look very carefully at his speech to find out whether i can see on which side of the fence he comes down <e>", "<cs> i had deduced that this amendment should not be included in any grouping but where there are discussions through the usual channels i should like to hope that usually this bench will be regarded as part of them <e> <s> in normal circumstances i am sure that it would <e> <s> the amendment seeks to deal with what i generally believe to be a nationwide problem <e> <s> as a lancastrian i should confess that information regarding this problem has come to me from yorkshire where i understand the problem has caused particular trouble <e> <s> having said that i think perhaps i may safely assume that the noble lord lord bellwin will know all about the particular problem and may very well plan to deal with it in some way perhaps by accepting my amendment or in some other way of his own <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the care and the detail with which he has replied to this particular amendment <e> <s> i shall read his reply with very great care and i hope that he will also read what i have said with similar care at a later stage <e> <s> but i am bound to say that i cannot accept that his answer is wholly satisfactory in so far as it appeared to suggest that the existing remedy namely an appeal to the secretary of state under section of the public health act was an altogether satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house how many unoccupied dwellings there have been during the same period <e> <s> is it not deplorable that there should apparently be so many empty houses when there are so many homeless families <e>", "<cs> my lords recollecting the recent brief argument we had in your lordships house about our rules of order and bearing in mind the advice recently given to us by the select committee on procedure i must not be too fulsome in my thanks to the noble lord for introducing this subject save to say he has introduced a very important subject indeed <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that it is appropriate that this subject of the partially deaf should be raised in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister replies perhaps it might be helpful to him to know that my noble friends on these benches would also wish to support the noble lord lord sandford in the efforts that he is making to ensure full and free debate on these very new matters matters of substantial importance in this bill <e> <s> therefore we congratulate the noble lord lord sandford on having discovered this device to enable us to do something which we regard as very necessary indeed and we hope that he will be successful in it <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches may i too thank the noble lord for repeating this very important and to an extent reassuring statement <e> <s> the noble lord may care to note that we welcome the statement in so far as it indicates continuing government support for the cab movement as a whole <e> <s> however we regret that the statement of an intention to authorise a six-month grant with a review thereafter cannot of itself end the uncertainty from which the cab movement centrally has been suffering <e> <s> arising from that fact may i ask the noble lord the minister three simple and general questions <e> <s> first do the government accept that the need in our society for the services of the cab has never been so great as it now is <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the minister to say there were obligations on water authorities to have regard to conservation wildlife the landscape and recreation <e> <s> as those obligations are not contained in the bill may i ask him to say in which statutes they rest <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the noble lords encouraging answer to the noble baroness may i ask whether the noble lord agrees that if a long-term unemployed person surrenders an insurance policy in order to qualify for supplementary benefit that person may not be able to get that insurance policy reinstated in november which could in fact be very regrettable <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that the valuation of assets for the purpose of the capital cut-off rule is very much a discretionary matter for supplementary benefit officers and could those officers not be encouraged to exercise that discretion liberally between now and november <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am one of the other signatories to this amendment moved by the noble lord lord sandford it might be helpful if i indicated that the course of action recommended by the noble lord to your lordships house with regard to this amendment is one which my noble friends and i on these benches entirely support <e> <s> we wish to thank the noble lord lord sandford for his indefatigable efforts with regard to this important part of the bill efforts which have resulted not least in part of the bill receiving a very effective scrutiny which perhaps it might not otherwise have had <e> <s> i should also thank the noble lord lord bellwin for having come forward perhaps at the eleventh hour with what appears to be a workable compromise which meets the needs and wishes of so many members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too had not intended to intervene in the debate <e> <s> however as the noble baroness lady birk will recollect it was my amendment to retain the jurisdiction of the ombudsmen in this field which was so graciously acccepted by the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> i am not trying to take the credit the credit clearly rests very much with the noble baroness lady serota in whom there is no greater authority on this subject in your lordships house <e> <s> however i was very relieved that my amendment was accepted <e> <s> i thought that that was the end of the matter but if it now appears that some obstacle could be placed in the way of the aggrieved citizen getting his complaint of maladministration from which injustice may have arisen to the ombudsman then it seems that our previous exercise was in vain <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him however to go a little further <e> <s> does he accept that in real terms the exchequer has lost million in levy from itv between and and that the main factor has been the start-up of channel <e> <s> does the noble lord accept that this is likely to be an ongoing situation whatever happens with regard to the equity strike that anxieties already have been expressed by the iba and others about the reduction in programme output by the itv companies and that any attempt by the government to recoup further finance from the itv companies could have a disastrous effect on programme standards <e> <s> in other words will the government continue to bear their share of this very substantial burden <e>", "<cs>

repeating this statement <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he has noted that i have on the order paper an unstarred question on this subject <e> <s> i wonder whether this statement would pre-empt that particular question <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would care to note that having heard the statement i take the view that it does not pre-empt that unstarred question and that i would

lord northfield <e> <s> i could have listened to him all night <e> <s> in fact for a time i thought i was going to have to <e> <s> i make no complaint <e> <s> the noble lord is a great expert and he put the arguments forcefully <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may say so now but i wish he would go and say it to the thousands and thousands of people in areas that i know who are perhaps not sufficiently aware of that point and who have often been misled <e> <s> the fault may be theirs but there are misunderstandings about that <e> <s> there is an assumption that that is what they must do

noble baroness allow me to intervene on a point of accuracy <e> <s> i did not say direct <e> <s> my actual words were that i hoped that the department would use its best endeavours to persuade local government not to delay their <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish at this eleventh hour to resist these amendments or indeed any of the subsequent amendments to this bill <e> <s> they seem to me to be entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i rise merely to say that the noble lord lord trefgarne at earlier stages of our consideration of this bill reminded your lordships house that we have a dentists bill approximately every years <e> <s> we had one in i think we had one in and we have another now <e> <s> in those circumstances i merely rise to say that it seems to me faintly regrettable that having dealt with this years period dentists bill we have had to deal with its final stages in somewhat indecent haste i make no criticism of anybody for that <e> <s> i merely say that perhaps we might have had an opportunity to consider some of these matters in a little more detail than we can now do <e> <s> perhaps it will be helpful if i indicate as one who <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly on the question that the commons amendments be now considered <e> <s> it seems to me that it would have been quite impossible for your lordships to have agreed that question had it not been

the public bill office <e> <s> they have worked all night to get this vast array of amendments ready for us <e> <s> sometimes we take a little too much for granted the work which is done for us in

very expeditiously if indeed the noble baroness actually did thank the noble lord i think she did so <e> <s> however if the noble baroness did not do so i certainly do <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to take it from the noble viscounts original answer that the junior minister to whom he referred will now be responsible for important matters such as the funding of the national association of citizens

to which there is a right of public access is disposed of to the private sector there will be a continuing obligation on the new owner to maintain that right of public access <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first will the government look again at the rules governing eligibility for the attendance allowance and for the invalid care allowance in so far as they affect mentally handicapped children bearing in mind that those benefits have an important relationship to the possibility of these children being cared for in the community <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord in a position to tell the house that the grants given to voluntary bodies such as the elizabeth fitzroy trust and many others which provide excellent small family-type units for the care of mentally handicapped children will be maintained in real terms and that local authorities will be enabled to pay their share of the support costs for mentally handicapped children who are cared for in those homes without which a much heavier burden would fall on national health service hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have already had the pleasure and <e> <s> indeed the privilege of questioning the noble viscount the leader of the house but perhaps i should say that i regard it as a particular honour as well as a pleasure to follow the noble viscount in a debate upon a subject in which he is obviously an expert and in which he has already played such a major part <e> <s> your lordships are well aware of the efforts of the noble viscount in another place to make absolutely sure that the introduction of this new system a cable network which most of us favour will not be at the cost of some damage to the standards of public service broadcasting a matter which was referred to very dramatically by the noble lord lord hill of luton in an earlier debate in your lordships house <e> <s> your lordships will be very grateful to the noble viscount for the efforts he has already made in that direction and we are very glad to support him now that he is here with us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be reminded by the noble lord <e> <s> all i can say to him as somebody else once said is we must wait and see <e> <s> as i am quite sure the noble viscount knows we on these benches have always supported the introduction of cable <e> <s> the noble viscount followed our activities with great interest before he arrived here <e> <s> we support cable in the main because we believe in the immense advantages to our nation of the interactive services which

conterfeiting of these new coins <e> <s> will the noble lord bear in mind that the director of a government factory which has all the necessary equipment told me recently that he could make these coins at a cost of p each which suggests that a considerable profit would be possible <e> <s> what advice are the government giving to retailers to help them identify counterfeit coins <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for those words which i am still trying to recollect and understand <e> <s> it appeared that the noble lord both agreed and disagreed with me <e> <s> it

deeply grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his brief intervention making the substance of my point rather clearer than i made it earlier <e> <s> that was precisely the anxiety that i had in mind when i moved the amendment <e> <s> i have listened to what the noble baroness said and as i have said i will have further thought about it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord mottistone for giving us this brief opportunity to debate these important orders <e> <s> in saying that the noble lord

noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord wallace on this occasion i too am perhaps more in agreement with the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i hope that that will not make the noble lord think that perhaps he is wrong this time <e> <s> i should also like to make clear that my earlier remarks with regard to the national schizophrenia fellowship were not intended in any way to denigrate the work of that very valuable body <e> <s> i believe that work on behalf of the relatives of patients who suffer from schizophrenia is absolutely essential <e> <s> these people are extremely vulnerable and are often in grave difficulties and in desperate need of help of the kind which i would like to say publicly the national schizophrenia fellowship <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for repeating this important statement

resist that temptation but i must take up one or two points <e> <s> i greatly agreed with the speech of the noble baroness lady macleod and in particular with her plea for a very special hospital in london which is providing for a very special need in a special way <e> <s> that hospital needs special treatment and i hope that it will receive it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the principal aim of the act was to ensure that more pregnancies are terminated under controlled aseptic and safe conditions with consequently fewer abortions and preferably no abortions being performed illegally under very dangerous conditions indeed <e> <s> would the noble lord further agree that the most satisfactory way of avoiding unwanted pregnancies is to provide readily available family planning services and that any attempt to privatise the family planning service or otherwise to remove it from the national health service could have very dangerous consequences indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that anxiety about the future of the national health service is by no means restricted to the trade unions representing national health service employees <e> <s> is the minister aware that in addition the british medical association and the general nursing council are very anxious as indeed are patients and potential patients <e> <s> may i ask the minister to use his influence to persuade his right honourable friend to consult the community health councils who will be able to give him a clear picture of how the national health service now looks to the patients who are having to use it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by thanking the noble lord lord beswick on two separate counts first i obviously must thank him for drawing the attention of the minister and thereby the government to this report which is on a desperately important subject which requires some urgent action <e> <s> the noble lord by his unstarred question has at least enabled the minister to let us know the governments thinking on this subject at this time <e> <s> i must certainly thank the noble lord for that <e> <s> secondly i should like personally to thank him for having played a very important and crucial role in the business of the richmond fellowship inquiry and in the preparation of its report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord soames for bringing forward his very subtly worded motion and for moving it in such persuasive tones <e> <s> some noble lords may have noticed that i had a similar motion though less subtly worded on the order paper but so as to enable the noble lord lord soames to move his motion it was necessary for me to remove mine <e> <s> when there is a motion which has behind it the combined weight of the noble lord <e> <s> lord soames and the noble viscount the leader of the house obviously it is very wise for me to withdraw my motion and having heard the noble lord lord soames introduce his motion i am confirmed in that opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to join with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany in thanking the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves this point i wonder whether he will confirm what i believe to be true so that there can be no misunderstanding that is that in the lake district upland management scheme which was so outstandingly successful there was no element of compulsion nor was there any need for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin my speech this evening with a very sincere apology <e> <s> one or two noble lords may have noticed at the time and it is possible that perhaps even one might recollect that when i first had the honour to be introduced into your lordships house almost exactly eight years ago i was as a result of indulging in athletic activity not wholly consistent with my constitution and my then state of physical preservation suffering from what is known in technical medical terms as a prolapsed intervertebral disc resulting in a paralysis of my fifth lumbar nerve <e> <s> as a result of that my first few weeks in your lordships house were spent creeping about on two sticks and i may say that i felt entirely at home in your lordships house <e> <s> but i recovered <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness in a position to tell the house how much has been paid out in statutory sick pay to married women in full-time employment who have opted to rely on their husbands national insurance contributions rather than to pay contributions of their own <e> <s> if as i suspect the figure is considerable can i ask the noble baroness whether it really was the governments intention when they introduced this scheme that sick pay should now be paid to some people who would not have qualified for sick pay under the old national insurance regulations <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that the noble lord lord mishcon in moving this amendment which he did admirably put both sides of the case <e> <s> perhaps that indicated that it may have been more appropriate if the noble lord sat on this bench and not on the one he occupies now so fair was he in steering the course <e> <s> i listened to the noble lord most carefully and it appeared to me that he was opposed to the idea of the authority being filled up with people having a specific responsibility to represent specific interests <e> <s> the noble lord made the point rightly that if one once spells out one interest that must be represented on the authority then there is an implication that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to prolong this discussion but after all this is committee and is the proper time to settle ones anxieties <e> <s> i am bound to say i am a little less happy than i was about my neutrality towards this amendment since i heard the reply of the noble lord lord elton and the speech of the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> it seemed to me that both rather missed the point <e> <s> i fully understand the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before the noble duke responds to that invitation i wonder whether i could ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> if we are to accept his advice that the power to vary the conditions of a licence should remain unfettered and if we are also to accept as he has advised us that it would be wrong for the licence to specify those matters which could be varied are we not to wonder whether or not there should be some control over certain things which could not be varied <e> <s> for example there could be circumstances in which the authority might decide to vary the area <e> <s> they might decide that the original area was wrong or perhaps they want to let another franchise to another cable authority to do another area and therefore they might possibly wish to vary the geography of the area in which the licence-holder operates <e>", "<cs> in the light of the explanation of the noble lord the minister since his concern apparently is not that an operator should include too little of other things but too much should the wording not be <e>", "<cs> just so that the noble lord can be aware of the strength of the forces ranged against him if they are ranged against him which is not yet known may i indicate that i and my noble friends on these benches fully support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady faithful <e> <s> and the two very important points made in it <e> <s> i agree with those noble lords who have expressed some reservations about the detail <e> <s> i do not disagree with the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it would perhaps be a mistake to insert one per cent <e> <s> half a per cent <e> <s> or any other kind of per <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would allow me to interrupt if he refers to the text he will see that it says of social interest and concern to the local community <e> <s> does he mean that dallas is of interest to dallas <e>", "<cs> i join the noble lord lord mishcon in asking the noble lord the minister to think again and in particular to give what assistance he can in his official capacity in drafting a more satisfactory amendment <e> <s> i find it impossible to believe that the noble lord did not understand the amendment <e> <s> i know that it has certain defects <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will be able to hit on a way to do it and perhaps a better way to do it <e> <s> but i think we know what we want done <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will be aware that the independent broadcasting authority requires television programme contractors to include in their <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from this question and i hope that the noble lord will agree that this relates to it may i ask the minister whether inspections by local fire brigades are carried out at her majestys prisons <e> <s> in particular are they carried out at her majestys prison at strangeways a matter about which prison visitors have recently expressed some anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful as indeed should we all be to the noble lord lord rea for drawing the attention of your lordships to this very important and somewhat neglected subject of food-borne infections <e> <s> i am grateful to him for doing so with such deep professional knowledge and understanding <e> <s> perhaps i should say at the outset to the noble lord that as a professional medical colleague of his i have not to my knowledge

suggestion put by the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe that the government should have further thoughts on whether they could find wording which would be more acceptable to members of your lordships house who i believe are all anxious about precisely the same thing <e>", "<cs> i note the noble baronesss determination a quality which she exhibits not infrequently in your lordships chamber <e> <s> i listened most carefully to her answer and i accept that there may well be difficulties in the light of the matter she mentioned for example some kind of overseas outfit establishing a subsidiary company in britain <e> <s> there may be loopholes if the words were removed altogether but i cannot say that i was wholly satisfied with the words of reassurance that the noble baroness gave to me <e> <s> i may have been wrong but i understood her to suggest that the wording of the regulations which were drafted and then adopted by the iba under the procedures which were earlier outlined to us by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney contained the specific words <e>", "<cs> they ae picked out for the simple fact that they cannot hear <e> <s> they can see <e> <s> i do not think that one can do anything in relation to television in order to assist those who are blind to see <e> <s> but to replace the ability to hear by methods of signing is something that can be done

there are none so deaf as those who do not wish to hear <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl tell the committee if the same people have advised him on how to vote should this amendment be pushed to a division <e>", "<cs> i wondered whether the same people as have told the noble earl that they are going to set up a local advisory committee have also advised the noble earl on how to vote if the amendment is pushed to a division <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i might ask the noble lord the minister to clarify something which arose in part out of the amendments which the noble lord lord glanusk has not moved <e> <s> under clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to pursue it but i am still not entirely clear <e> <s> there is clearly here a power for the authority to insist on the cable operator providing them in advance with certain scripts of programmes <e> <s> that only arises if the cable operator has offended in some way and the authority has reason to believe that they have done this that or the other <e> <s> i was merely wondering whether in this clause or in any other clause of the bill the cable authority has the power to require the cable operators to present scripts of programmes in advance of transmission <e>", "<cs> the matter is of some importance and there are others who have not spoken in the debate who would be interested in precisely what takes place in the correspondence between the noble baroness and the noble lord in trying to resolve this problem <e> <s> there are others who would like to follow these negotiations apart from those who have spoken in the debate <e>", "<cs> i am fully aware that the noble lord lord mishcon has spoken of his amendments as probing amendments but having probed he has elaborated his arguments in favour of the amendments fairly fully and i shall be interested to hear the reply <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he told your lordships committee that the iba had the power to suspend in relation to both itv and independent radio <e> <s> will he confirm that the iba has never in fact used that power <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether in his reply he will consider one aspect of the matter which has not been raised in the speeches on the amendment <e> <s> on these benches we all entirely agree that there must be adequate consultation and close co-operation between oftel and the cable authority and that the difficulty of arriving at a uniformity of decision has to be resolved <e> <s> we support noble lords who say that the situation cannot be left entirely as it is <e> <s> the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe argued convincingly that the cable authority should have more authority than the other authority as that was the way to ensure the maintenance of broadcasting standards <e> <s> the noble earl lord de la warr said that the cable authority should have the overriding control <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as drug advertisements directed at doctors are concerned is not the answer the encouragement of doctors to adopt generic prescribing which would itself have a dramatic effect on drug advertisements <e>", "<cs> my lords generic prescribing is prescribing by the pharmacological name rather than the brand name <e> <s> if doctors prescribe in the pharmacological name there will be less incentive on the drug industry to advertise brand name products <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i was much reassured to learn that this question was to be answered by so fair-minded a man as the noble lord but that i have not as yet derived much comfort from his answer <e> <s> does the noble lord think it right that we should continue with an arrangement whereby if a general practitioner lives with his practice nurse or his practice receptionist he can claim reimbursement of much of her salary and employment costs but that if he is sufficiently unwise to marry the lady he can claim almost nothing <e> <s> is it right that we should continue with that arrangement <e> <s> is it any encouragement to us all to return to victorian values <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that noble lords on this side of the house are always very glad indeed to learn of any generous gesture made by the government at the moment even when as some of us suspected in this case that gesture has been made by mistake <e> <s> but it would appear that this has been done on purpose <e> <s> so that we can know the extent of the governments generosity will the noble lord be in a position to tell us at some time how much the government have taken in by way of increased contributions from these people and how much they have paid out by way of statutory sick pay <e> <s> that

disabled <e> <s> may i also ask him whether as an example to other employers government departments are continuing to employ the appropriate percentage of registered disabled people <e>", "<cs> my

elton that this amendment would cover one matter with which i am concerned <e> <s> as the noble lord lord howard told the house this amendment is complicated and it deals with a number of important matters <e> <s> if the amendment is to be accepted i should like an assurance that it would deal with one important matter which has been brought to my attention by somebody involved in cable services <e> <s> it has been pointed out to me that clause defines cable programme service and in clause we have licensable service and so on but nowhere in that clause is there any reference whatever to interactive services <e> <s> it seems to me that if such services are not included there might be a presumption that they are in fact excluded <e> <s> bearing in mind that the justification for cable at all in many of our minds concerns the future benefits of interactive services i am very anxious that those services should be properly protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord and perhaps i might explain a little further what i had in mind <e> <s> it seems to me that if a group get a franchise for the establishment in the end after broadcasting of interactive services they need to know that they are going to be protected just as for example when capital radio are awarded a franchise to do local radio in a certain area they do not want to discover suddenly that someone else is going to be working in the same area <e> <s> similarly interactive services need the same kind of protection <e> <s> if these people are to make the investment which is necessary in order to mount the interactive services which we all want to see and from which we believe great benefits will flow it is clear that they must have some kind of protection otherwise they will not make that investment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i merely want to ask whether my recollection is incorrect in thinking that he supported legislation which gave unsuccessful applicants for certain jobs a right to know why they had not got the jobs so that they would know that it had not been as a result of discrimination on grounds of sex colour or anything of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it is going to be short because i hope the government are shortly going to accept it <e> <s> perhaps i may proceed on that basis <e> <s> this is a matter we discussed at committee stage <e> <s> noble lords will recollect that this amendment had agreement from all parts of your lordships committee and yet i withdrew it <e> <s> some may ask why did i withdraw it <e> <s> i withdrew it because i did not have the machinery available to me to make the necessary calculation to be certain that i was going to win <e> <s> i thought it would be deplorable if we lost an amendment about the deaf <e> <s> in addition i knew that the noble baroness was sympathetic to the needs of the deaf and i felt that if she and the government were given sufficient time to mull over the matter it might be that after a convenient interval i should get a more sympathetic answer <e> <s> we have now come to the time at which i hope to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> with regard to the tic-tac men the people who sign programmes this is interesting to watch as the noble baroness says <e> <s> it is rather like ballet <e> <s> it is not like the old alphabetic language it is more balletic in terms of the movement <e> <s> it is interesting as a result of using this tic-tac technique in certain television programmes the number of people who now wish to learn sign language <e> <s> they are increasing in number and not just among the deaf but other people <e> <s> this is going to change the quality of life for the deaf <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness tells the house that the cost of providing copies will be disproportionate will the government be prepared to provide copies to people who are prepared to pay for them <e>", "<cs> my lords in his further consideration of these matters will the noble lord bear in mind that if he were to heed the advice of all my medical colleagues about what

positive advice in the james report regarding what to eat is of much greater importance than the view that if we all ate a great deal more fibre we would all be a great deal fitter <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already become clear i think the house not for the first time owes a substantial debt to the noble lord lord allen of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to give an unqualified answer to that question until i know precisely where it is leading me <e> <s> indeed i should like some of the answers to my questions from the noble lord the minister before i finally formulate my firm views on this matter because i still think it is a matter in which we have to balance the risks <e> <s> but i will come back to the noble lords point in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am very anxious that the point i made to the minister should not be misrepresented in any sense <e> <s> i never suggested for a moment that vaccination against diphtheria was carried out for the public benefit rather than for the benefit of the individual <e> <s> nor did i suggest that this was so in relation to tetanus for example <e> <s> the noble lord knows that although the triple antigen can be given with whooping cough diphtheria and tetanus combined it is also the practice very often to give each of these separately <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the time has come when i should indicate that noble lords on these benches are as reasonable as are the noble lords who sit with the noble lord lord mishcon although we have not yet heard whether the reasonableness which the noble lord exhibited on amendments nos <e> <s> and is to be continued on this particular one <e> <s> perhaps i should indicate that we are prepared to support these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to prolong these proceedings unnecessarily but obviously it would be churlish of me not to acknowledge the efforts of the noble baroness lady trumpington and those of the noble lord lord elton in this matter <e> <s> your lordships may recall that i moved a similar amendment originally and i think it is true to say that when the noble baroness replied on behalf of the government at that time most of us knew of her sympathy for the deaf <e> <s> the work she has done on behalf of those with hearing handicaps is well known to all of us and therefore i think we all regretted that on that occasion she had to display some degree of reluctance for not being able to help with the amendment as much as she might have wished <e> <s> we are very glad indeed that she has been able to find a formula which will permit this provision to be appropriately inserted into the bill in the right place <e> <s> it meets the needs of a very large section of the public one that is becoming increasingly larger with hearing impairment and those who are disadvantaged in relation to television and broadcast services perhaps more than any other single group <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to join the right reverend prelate in his plea to the noble lord the minister to find some kind of formula which would enable us to leave this particular part of the bill in a mood of total unanimity <e> <s> it seemed to me that in his reply to the previous amendment the noble lord lord elton really grasped the point <e> <s> he said quite clearly that he wanted to do the kind of things which we said the amendment was designed to ensure were in fact done <e> <s> but he placed all his arguments against accepting those words on the ground that the word proper according to him was a word which was precise specific and capable of rigid definition <e> <s> i feel that perhaps the noble lord was mistaken there <e> <s> it seems to me that what is proper to one person sometimes seems to be grossly improper to another <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i wish to join the noble lord lord mishcon in the well-earned tribute he has paid to the noble lord <e> <s> lord elton <e> <s> we would wish to support that tribute with all possible strength and sincerity <e> <s> the noble lord has been helpfulness itself at the various stages of the bill <e> <s> on these benches we have supported this bill and not because we are desperately enamoured of the prospect of further entertainment channels on television but because we have believed in the benefits which could flow to the community as a whole from the ultimate establishment of a cable communications network in our society <e>", "<cs> will i like it my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his obvious understanding of the complexity of this problem <e> <s> is it not time that we gave up this absurd system whereby beer is sold by the so-called brimful measure so that it is either slopping over the sides onto the counter or being sold in short measure <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the trading standards officers are now of the opinion that beer drinkers are being defrauded of half a million pounds a year in short measures <e> <s> as the government have already acted commendably to protect wine drinkers from being cheated is it not time that they did the same for beer drinkers by making use of the oversized marked glass obligatory <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is not disposed to be moved in this matter by the consumer arguments will he bear in mind that it is the opinion of the customs and excise that the sale of beer in short measure defrauds not just the beer drinker but the inland revenue as well since duty is collected on non <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government require that newly-qualified doctors must complete so many pre-registration posts before they are finally registered do the government not have a clear obligation to see that there are enough pre-registration posts available for newly qualified doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to give an assurance that the government have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not wholly sure that i am altogether wise not to have withheld my fire until we have heard from the minister but as a doctor irrespective of the views expressed by my noble friends on these benches i most sincerely welcome this bill in its present form <e> <s> at the outset i want to say frankly as a doctor that i rather regret that any bill was necessary <e> <s> i would have thought that so far as the medical profession was concerned it was clearly the duty of the general medical council to deal with people who perform mutilating operations of this kind <e> <s> that of course leaves the situation when such operations might be carried out by a lay person and i would have thought that could have been coped with under the offences against the person act <e> <s> but obviously something else is necessary and i believe that this bill meets the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in a position to say how much compensation has been paid out to farmers or landowners to compensate them for not doing things that they never had the remotest intention of doing in the first place <e> <s> does he agree that giving a grant to persuade a farmer to do something is a simple and straightforward matter but that giving compensation to dissuade him from certain action is much more complex <e> <s> in that connection can the noble lord say in how many cases if any where there have been negotiations between a farmer and the department concerned for compensation in this area the department has called the landowners bluff and what has been the result <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset perhaps i should say that the quite extraordinary speed if not precipitancy with which your lordships dealt with the last business resulted in the fact that unfortunately and i apologise deeply i missed the first part of the speech of the noble lord <e> <s> lord rea <e> <s> on the bill <e> <s> i was glad to hear what i believe was the bulk of his speech and in hearing that i think i am right to say that i heard the only full analysis and description of this bill that has yet been given <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather odd that the noble lord should tell the house that it is the governments view that prescription charges should rise in relation to the increase in pharmaceutical costs if one bears in mind that the prescription charge is per item whether the item happens to be a bottle of tablets with each tablet costing or whether the tablets cost only a few pence a bucketful <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give some thought to the reverse of the question of my noble friend lord kilmomock and consider the possibility of a serious inquiry into the real savings that would result from a re-opening of gp hospitals that have already been closed <e> <s> does he not agree that those hospitals achieved excellent results in the limited cases with which they dealt results that compared very favourably with those in general hospitals <e> <s> is he aware that real benefits could arise from the re-opening of some of the gp hospitals already closed <e>",

to fill whatever time is available <e> <s> bearing in mind some of the business which your lordships transacted a little earlier and which took a great deal of the time available i would merely say that my enthusiasm for a scottish parliament has redoubled <e> <s> nevertheless i am very glad that sufficient time has remained for us to give proper consideration to this very important question tabled by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> it is a matter about which we should all be concerned <e> <s> it is also of course a matter in which we are all concerned <e> <s> the cost of drugs is a cost that is borne by us all as citizens and as citizens from time to time we all require drugs <e> <s> therefore anything to do with their safety and cost is a matter which ought to be of concern to us <e>", "<cs> my lords so as to make sure that the new scheme is fully understood for what it actually is will the noble lord the minister confirm that the purpose of the new scheme was not to give people greater help with housing costs but was to reduce public expenditure and to reduce the size of the civil service <e> <s> would he also confirm that while some people as he has rightly said will not be affected others will lose money and that the only group who actually gain from the new arrangements will be the blind <e>", "<cs> i have not the remotest intention of impeding the further progress of this very desirable little bill and therefore i assure the noble baroness and the noble lord that i accept what they have said <e> <s> however the overwhelming argument is the one which the noble lord lord rea has just advanced that here we are dealing with bodies which are being donated for anatomical dissection and for study purposes and that in that particular area at the moment there is no shortage <e> <s> indeed the supply somewhat greatly exceeds the demand <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble lord has said to the house is it not rather odd that the members of the medical research council should be under the impression that the funds have been reduced by nearly million <e> <s> in the light of what the noble earl has said would he draw his recent remarks to the attention of the members of the medical research council so that they can understand the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i have no wish to follow the noble baroness

right to say that we would have preferred the amendment which was passed so overwhelmingly in your lordships house which went to another place and which has now been bounced back in a somewhat different form <e> <s> since we cannot have that we are grateful to the noble earl for his amendment and we will indeed support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble lords will agree with me when i say that my noble friend lord ezra dealt with this important subject not only extremely comprehensively but also succinctly in what i am sure noble lords will agree was an admirable speech <e>

amendment <e> <s> i shall resist the temptation to follow the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in his general remarks about censorshp and the bill as a whole although i am bound to say that perhaps

so that there can be no possible doubt about the extent of support in your lordships house for this amendment may i indicate as briefly as possible that my noble friends and i who sit on these benches

friend <e> <s> i have grave suspicions of non-elected bodies exercising unaccountable power without adequate scrutiny <e> <s> but that is one rather general matter <e> <s> i am sorry to hear from him that the harmonious spirit of co-operation which has begun to develop between the nature conservancy council and landowners farmers and others in the countryside in england and wales has not yet crossed the pentland firth <e> <s> i think we must hope that that mood of co-operation finally arises within the orkneys and <e> <s> indeed in shetland too <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the brief debate at the committee stage on the earlier amendment moved by the noble lord lord monson when he sought to insert the word censorship into the long title <e> <s> i understood the arguments against

was necessary but having heard the reply of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford i am bound to say that i think perhaps it is <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand why he should be so suspicious of the mere interpolation of this single word which seeks to demonstrate more clearly precisely what it is that the bill seeks to do <e> <s> the noble lord lord nugent of guildford has said

indeed the other bill <e> <s> but since this simple word which the noble lord lord monson seeks to insert merely makes clear what is the purpose of the bill i find it very difficult to understand why the noble lord lord nugent of guildford should oppose it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister in a position to tell the house of progress in the setting up of the new consumer consultative committees which i understand the water authorities are now appointing <e> <s> may we know whether the consumers will be given any say in who will be appointed to represent them <e> <s> may we know also whether

merely say that when other noble lords are extremely careful about keeping to their time limit as they have been in this debate that does allow other noble lords to intervene in speeches and i feel that interventions can sometimes elucidate points of immense value and have done so in this debate <e> <s> with timed debates there is a tendency for people to believe that there cannot be any interventions <e> <s> however if there is a gradual assumption that if noble lords make short speeches and there is any time left in the gap other noble lords will rise to their feet to fill it then that i think would be establishing a dangerous precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former medical officer at one of these establishments may i ask the noble lord whether he is now satisfied or perhaps whether the employees are now satisfied with the employment and pensions arrangements for staff in these establishments <e> <s> are there at the moment any unresolved disputes upon which discussions are continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i speak for all noble lords when i say how delighted i was to hear that the noble viscount had been saved those years ago from the surgeons knife <e> <s> the story that the noble viscount told is one which as a doctor i have heard on many occasions <e> <s> but i say that it is an <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a lawyer but to the best of my knowledge which is if i may say so considerable on this point the law does not make it an offence for an unqualified person to operate on a patient <e> <s> the law provides no protection for the person who does that if something goes wrong and it might very well go wrong and of course the person is not qualified to sign a death certificate or to do certain other things which might be a necessary consequence of the action the noble lord referred to <e> <s> but it is a fact that the general assumption that the law somewhere has given doctors a monopoly is false <e> <s> there is no monopoly <e> <s> anybody is entitled to treat patients but a person is not entitled to pose as a registered medical practitioner when he is not <e> <s> he is entitled to treat patients and many do <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord understand that noble lords on these benches are not so much concerned about the method of funding of the bbc external services as about the extent of that funding <e> <s> does the noble lord recollect that the noble baroness lady young gave us full information on that subject on a recent occasion and that she herself appeared satisfied with that information <e> <s> but as we are informed that the bbc external services are not themselves satisfied i wonder whether the noble lord has anything to add now to that reply <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to join the noble lord lord ennals in thanking the noble lord lord glenarthur for repeating this important answer in reply to a private notice question in another place <e> <s> we share the view expressed by the noble lord lord ennals that in recent years the women least at risk of developing a carcinoma of the cervix are women who have been having cervical smears with almost clockwork-like regularity whereas those most at risk have often not been having smears at all and the recall or warning process for those women most at risk of developing a carcinoma of the cervix has been virtually non-existent <e> <s> in so far as this statement and it related action will remedy that situation obviously on these benches we warmly welcome that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very conscious of the fact that this is not a short debate but an unstarred question an unstarred question admirably and if i may say so very professionally put to your lordships house by the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> if i wished to take issue in any way with the noble baroness lady cox in what she said and indeed to an extent with what was said by the noble lord lord rea in his speech i think that in some cases they gave answers to questions with perhaps a greater degree of certainty than i think our present state of knowledge entitles them actually to possess <e> <s> the noble baroness said quite clearly that there is no question that this disease cannot be transmitted by droplet infection <e> <s> she may very well be right <e> <s> i think she probably is right <e> <s> i certainly hope she is right but i should like a little more certainty before we tell people with absolute <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness confirms my view that the state of our knowledge on the length or shortness of the incubation period is extremely limited and that is something about which i should like to know more <e>", "<cs> my lords it would appear that the noble lord lord rea is a rather more willing absorber of knowledge than i am <e> <s> i have heard things too but i do not necessarily regard them as entirely finite and proved for all time <e>", "<cs> my lords are the kits to which the noble lord refers of british manufacture or imported <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has told the house that none of these units would be closed until the discussions to which he referred were completed <e> <s> is it not the fact that the unit at fazakerley on merseyside and the one at walkden in greater manchester have in fact already been closed <e> <s> indeed if they have not actually closed is it not true that they are no longer functioning which amounts to the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that all these things have been prescribed and prescribed recently by doctors <e> <s> he has not been very specific and said which things <e> <s> i have authoritative <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone said that those who support the motion of the noble lord lord ennals as amended by the amendment of my noble friend lord kilmarnock believe that there should be economies but not in this area <e> <s> we believe no such thing <e> <s> we believe very positively and have said over and over again in this house and elsewhere that there should be economies in this very area but not in this way which is a very different thing indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not my fault that we are here at this hour and the noble lord should use his undoubted influence with those who manage government business <e> <s> i intend to say what i have to say and i hope that other noble lords will listen <e> <s> if the noble lord who has intervened does not wish to listen i think that possibly we could do without him when the vote comes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that the mining subsidence act which requires the national coal board to compensate people who have suffered damage as a result of mining subsidence requires the coal board to pay that compensation only when it the national coal board is satisfied that the subsidence is complete <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that the national coal board very rarely is satisfied that the subsidence is complete and that there are sometimes very long delays in paying the compensation <e> <s> an example is in leigh in the county of lancashire where a local authority housing estate had virtually to disappear through the ground before compensation could be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord recognise that the patients concerned were very satisfied indeed with the work done by the home chiropody service which was provided for elderly people in many areas <e> <s> is it not a matter of great regret that the home chiropody service for the elderly has now virtually disappeared <e> <s> can anything be done now to restore the service <e>", "<cs> my lords last week when the noble lord lord ennals protested about the fact that your lordships were being asked to debate a matter of great importance at a very late hour i was wholly in support of the noble lord <e> <s> however i am bound to say to him that on this particular issue i do not think that he is on such firm ground <e> <s> this time we are not debating something that is exactly new <e> <s> the case for fluoridation has been proved beyond all possible doubt for something like years <e> <s> indeed it has already been introduced <e> <s> we are only having this debate as the noble lord lord glenarthur explained in his admirable and very clear speech because an element of doubt has been brought into the law as a result of a somewhat ambiguous judgment in the scottish courts <e> <s> previously there was no question about the legality of adding fluoride to water but a new situation has arisen purely because of what has happened in the scottish courts <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make my position absolutely clear <e> <s> i have the honour to be the present president of the british fluoridation society <e> <s> now that i have said that noble lords will know exactly where i stand on this issue <e> <s> perhaps i had better make it quite clear where the british fluoridation society stems from <e> <s> in the late sixties when the late mr richard crossman was the secretary of state for health and social services he decided that fluoridation was first safe and secondly very advantageous and that we ought to go ahead with it <e> <s> he was also aware that it was somehow rather unpopular and somewhat controversial <e> <s> he was not actually going to do it <e> <s> but he wanted the water authorities to do it and he wanted to change public opinion so that it actually happened <e> <s> mr richard crossman gave a substantial grant to the health education council to enable it to do what it could to change public opinion about the safety and desirability of fluoridation <e> <s> the health education council at that time set up the british fluoridation society which was required to do this work <e> <s> its first president was my noble friend lord avebury who carried on doing that job for many years <e> <s> i recently had the honour of succeeding him <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not privy to the discussions which were going on at that time <e> <s> it dates right back to the s as the noble lord will know but it was decided by the various authorities by the dentists and the other scientists together with people in various government departments at the time <e> <s> they decided that was the optimum level <e> <s> all one wants is an adequate level and there is no point in having a level which is higher than adequate <e> <s> i think that is why it was decided but i was not party to the decision-taking at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i will indeed comment on it <e> <s> the noble lord has said that it is widely believed <e> <s> it may well be widely believed and the noble lord has asked me to comment on this particular case <e> <s> certainly i will <e> <s> many such cases have been put to me over very many years <e> <s> on every occasion i have followed them up with the greatest possible care and i have never been able to confirm any of them <e> <s> i could not say with certainty that what the noble lord has said is not true it may be true <e> <s> maybe he has stumbled on a case that i have never found <e> <s> all i say is that when cases of that kind have been put to me in the past over the last years i have done everything i can to investigate them and all those investigations have proved fruitless <e> <s> but the noble lord having mentioned this case i will most certainly look into it i promise him that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has just answered a question about the number of television sets which are illegally operated <e> <s> what about companies illegally broadcasting <e> <s> will any action be taken regarding the pirates <e> <s> will the question of the pirates be an issue at which the committee can look <e>", "<cs> my lords i must at once join with the noble lord lord ennals in thanking the noble lord lord colwyn for introducing this bill in a mood i would think of benevolent neutrality <e> <s> i would say that on the whole i agree with almost everything the noble lord lord colwyn has said in introducing the bill <e> <s> there are one or two points to which i might return briefly in a moment <e> <s> i also agree substantially with everything that was said by the noble lord lord ennals though perhaps i would not go all the way with him on the matter of secondary smoking which is a slightly separate matter upon which we are not now required to comment <e>", "<cs> i have no wish to prolong the proceedings but unlike the noble lord lord houghton i am in favour of the bill and should like to see it enacted unamended and speedily <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord houghton that we may be in danger of having a second reading debate <e> <s> i understand very clearly the point he has made that there are certain inhibitions on noble lords with regard to second readings and that sometimes other means must be found to register general disapproval of a bill <e> <s> but i should like to say most earnestly to the noble lord lord houghton and to other noble lords who take the same view which is a very different view from mine that i hope they will not seek to make second reading speeches on each and every one of the amendments which have been tabled for the committee stage <e>", "<cs> there are others who have not yet made such an undertaking <e>", "<cs> i readily accept that and have accepted for years that many people hold a contrary opinion <e> <s> i regret that and i hope that as a result of full debates of this kind people will in the end gradually become more informed as to the full facts and become a little more knowledgeable <e>", "<cs> i was going to tell the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter if he will allow me that he has convinced me of one thing which is that i was extremely unwise to intervene at all at that particular time <e> <s> i fully accept that doctors can be wrong and often have been wrong <e> <s> i accept that contrary opinions have from time to time been expressed <e> <s> but on every occasion those contrary opinions have been rejected by orthodox medical opinion <e> <s> the royal college of physicians the royal college of general practitioners the british dental association and all other academic bodies in the end have come out with the view which i express <e>", "<cs> my lords while i fully support the theme underlying the question of the noble earl if the government are satisfied as i hope they are that further detailed investigations are necessary may i ask whether they will see to it that any grants are spread a little more widely and are not given just to this organisation the institute for complementary medicine which as the noble baroness said is by no means the only one in this field <e> <s> could they perhaps take in bodies such as the medical research council which is admirably placed to carry out some of these investigations but which at the moment cannot carry out all the investigations it would wish because of lack of resources <e>", "<cs> like the noble earl lord onslow i should like to support the noble lord lord chelwood on the amendment that he has moved and indeed on the whole group of amendments to which he has spoken <e> <s> in doing so i hope that the noble lord who is to reply will not think that i am being unduly cantankerous if i say that i think faintly it is rather a pity that we should now have embarked on what i believe are four pages of amendments on the marshalled list which collectively deal with a subject of immense importance and one to which the noble earl has drawn attention namely the whole question of countryside in our urban fringes and conservation in the midst of our urban areas <e>", "<cs> i too was most grateful to the noble lord lord elton for the reply he gave to those of us who spoke on these amendments last week <e> <s> i was reassured up to a point but i hope the noble lord will accept that i was not let us say sufficiently reassured to feel that we can allow this subject to go without further words from the government or perhaps without certain further assurances <e>", "<cs> since we are on that particular point the noble lord lord skelmersdale in reply to the noble baroness said that we could not have the one without the other <e> <s> are we to assume from that that if we do have the one we will inevitably and <e>", "<cs> for two reasons i did not intervene before the minister replied to this amendment first because i thought that the speeches i had made on earlier amendments would have made it crystal clear that i supported this amendment and secondly because i thought that we would have a much more reassuring reply from the government <e> <s> but not having had that reply i feel bound to say one or two words <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i am deeply grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for giving us an opportunity to debate a matter of the utmost importance <e> <s> perhaps i could not really say a matter of great urgency since it is a matter which has been with us for very many years and is one about which we have done nothing for very many years <e> <s> since most of the things that i shall say in this short debate are things which i have said before on a number of occasions in your lordships house i think that i can safely undertake to occupy rather less than my allotted minutes <e> <s> the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale having been a member of the pearson commission has a very wide interest in and a very deep knowledge of all these different matters relating to the whole field of compensation for those suffering from personal injury <e> <s> all that i would say on the general question is that we are often so fulsome in the praise that we give to the late lord pearson that it sometimes seems to me that that praise would ring a little more sincerely were we actually to implement the many very wise recommendations contained in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i should regard that as injury time so far as my minutes are concerned but let us proceed <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for the words that he has spoken <e> <s> naturally i shall want to study them carefully <e> <s> but it seemed to me that he gave assurances which on this matter were wholly satisfactory <e> <s> of course i agree that there are many ways of doing the same thing <e> <s> it may be the case that the government have found a better way of making this explicit than the way i suggested <e> <s> i am most grateful and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in the light of what he has said i believe that it would be wise to leave this amendment for now <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> it was amendment no <e> <s> ba which was spoken to together with amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> they are on virtually the same point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dean of beswick must clearly do as he chooses as regards his own amendment <e> <s> we have discussed his amendment along with my own amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> however i point out that it is amendment no <e> <s> b which is at present before the committee <e> <s> if at a later stage the noble lord lord dean of beswick decides to press his own amendment then that will be another matter <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord does not like mud i should not dream of throwing any <e> <s> i would merely say that it seemed to me that the issue had become a little more opaque rather than a little clearer <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord prefers that description <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for that further clarification <e> <s> i should like to seek yet more information <e> <s> if i were right in assuming from what he <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl as i am sure is the whole committee <e> <s> this is an important matter <e> <s> i really would like to support what was said at an earlier stage by the noble lord lord plummer that the success of this whole exercise depends fundamentally on the co-operation of staff <e> <s> we shall not have the co-operation of staff or the continued co-operation of staff unless we have fair treatment of staff on an equal basis for all <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say this <e> <s> in relation to the point that he made that not all doctors agree on this matter i wonder whether he can tell the house any particular matter on which all doctors agree <e> <s> doctors as people do not all agree <e> <s> the fact that one or two disagree on this particular matter does not invalidate the firmly-held belief of the overwhelming majority of doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords i have disagreed with my noble friend on so many matters in relation to this bill that i thought i might rise very briefly to say that i do not for a moment quarrel with him on this matter <e> <s> my noble friend has an admirable record in public life in opposing pollutants of one kind or another and of doing what he can to preserve our environment <e> <s> i hope he will accept that some others of us who perhaps are on the opposite side in this bill have also worked very hard over matters of pollutants and with regard to this bill would not be persuaded had we not looked with extreme care at the possible dangers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that every bit as important as the number of beds available in any hospital or in the national health service as a whole is the number of beds actually occupied <e> <s> is she aware that in the past beds were too rigidly demarcated as surgical beds medical beds or whatever as if they were of different shapes <e> <s> that sometimes led to wastefully low occupation rates and to the point raised by the noble lord lord renton that there were no beds when in fact there were <e> <s> has that problem been overcome <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell us what is the bed occupancy rate in the national health service as a whole as a percentage of the total <e> <s> is she aware of any regions or individual hospitals where bed occupancy rates are low <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that very welcome and reassuring information <e> <s> however may i ask her whether she will impress upon her ministerial colleagues the urgency of the whole matter <e> <s> is she aware that the apparent absence of any clear and easy route for new drugs on to the list is perhaps a disincentive to the manufacturers to provide any new drugs and that that could have an adverse effect on investment <e> <s> perhaps i may also ask the noble baroness if she will make the information that she has just given to the house as clear as possible to all those concerned so that there can be no longer any misunderstandings <e> <s> will she let us know at the earliest possible stage the composition of this committee of review which is surely very important indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the apparent structural ambiguity contained in the question would the noble lord make it clear that the anxiety is not about the standards of hygiene of the members of the two houses but of the fabric of the building and of the facilities and that it is those things which are important in relation to very real hazards such as legionnaires disease <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has replied to all three of these amendments and it seems to me that they are not wholly related or wholly identical <e> <s> i should like to deal just briefly with the first of them <e> <s> we seem doomed to dealing with these staff matters in the middle of the night and frankly i am not at my best in the middle of the night <e> <s> i must confess i am not all that good in the early morning either but that is another matter <e> <s> however since we are dealing with these very important staff matters at this hour i think we really do have to try to deal with them properly <e> <s> i do not think anybody in your lordships house would want it to be thought that noble lords wherever they sit in the house are not very much aware of the anxieties from which employees in the relevant authorities now suffer and that we were not all anxious by some means to allay those anxieties <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness comes to reply perhaps i may make my position clear in relation to the amendment to which <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased that the noble lord lord campbell of croy said what he did because i think it was necessary to say those words <e> <s> i too having been associated with the campaign for the fluoridation of water supplies for some years have not surprisingly received literature and correspondence of precisely the kind described by the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> how right he is to say that this surely exposes some of those campaigners for what they actually are <e> <s> perhaps i could take this opportunity to say that those of us who are in favour of this measure have none of those kinds of criticisms of noble lords in this house who have taken an opposite view in the course of our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to prolong this debate but i feel that i have a duty to support these important amendments from long personal experience <e> <s> i have been watching football on and off rather more on than off at old trafford since <e> <s> on those occasions i have sometimes watched in company with my noble friend and therefore i can confirm from first-hand experience every single word that he has said to your lordships house on these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord misquoted me inadvertently <e> <s> what i said was that it was very difficult to buy drink <e> <s> i did not say that it was difficult to get it or bring it in but it is difficult to buy it which is a rather different thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make two points which have not so far been made in this debate and at the same time i must say that i agree wholeheartedly with every word spoken by my noble friend lord harris of greenwich on this very important amendment <e> <s> i believe as he does that if the government genuinely believe that they will not use this power then they should not retain this power in the bill or should see to it that any extension should be subject to the affirmative process in both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view the advice given to noble lords by the noble lord lord soames was extremely wise that we really should direct our attention to the two choices one choice being that offered to your lordships house in the motion in the name of the noble lord lord soames and the other choice being that contained in the amendment just moved by the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> therefore i do not think that this is the occasion on which we should be debating the general issues which we have debated at length on many occasions in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may now conclude my earlier remarks which were so unhappily interrupted with three short sentences <e> <s> first i hope that all noble lords will vote at the end of this debate believing that whatever decision they take is entirely without prejudice to the decision which the house will later take when it has had the full and final report of the select committee <e> <s> secondly it seems to me entirely appropriate consistent and sensible that those who were opposed to television before the experiment and remain of that mind should support the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> but with regard to the rest particularly those who still remain uncertain i would say that if we would allow the experiment to continue it may permit questions to be answered which are not yet answered and it will also assist us greatly in that later debate <e>", "<cs> before we leave this matter may i say that i listened with great care to what the noble lord lord belstead said and that i accept many of the comments he made about the burdens which we could be placing on the operators <e> <s> briefly i should like to draw the noble lords attention to one aspect of this amendment in so far as it deals with the responsibility of the railways board with regard to bus services which replace railway services when there is a temporary interruption of the rail service <e> <s> that is a special case and it is one that has already arisen <e> <s> it is my impression and i think that there are noble lords present who will know this from their own personal experience that during the temporary closure of crewe station for engineering and other purposes passengers going from manchester to crewe now alight at sandbach and go from sandbach to crewe by bus <e> <s> i am informed that british rail have taken the most active steps to make sure that they can provide transport from sandbach to crewe by buses or by alternative transport <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord just deal with this for a second as it is on the point that he has answered <e> <s> appeal to the secretary of state in relation to disciplinary hearings in england and wales is surely open <e> <s> are we to understand that it is different in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords is the supply situation now such that old stocks of blood products which may have been contaminated could now be destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that oftel now has the duty of fulfilling all the functions on behalf of the users which were formerly the responsibility of pounc before privatisation <e> <s> if that is the case will the government take steps to inform the public and telephone users in general of the new role of oftel so that telephone users can be entirely clear on how they should take their complaints to oftel and how they should make comments to that body <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is the desire of every motorist not to be run into from the rear on motorways can the government do anything to enforce the law regarding the intensity of rear lights which can sometimes in dangerous visual conditions be very dangerous and very disturbing indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in a position to tell the house what progress british telecom has made in the matter of the provision of detailed itemised telephone bills where they are requested <e> <s> progress on that matter would very much increase consumer satisfaction if not necessarily improve service <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us what progress is being made on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker below the line on the list of speakers at the end of a long and complex debate of this kind i am expected somehow or other to dismiss the whole of the universe in a few easy phrases <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord wells-pestell who some four hours ago said that his experience of both sides of your lordships house was that debates of this kind usually turned out to be depressing and useless exercises <e> <s> i think that is right if the motion is drawn too widely <e> <s> here i shall agree strongly and perhaps unusually for me with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> when he criticised the noble lord lord ennals for the breadth of the motion <e>", "<cs> we might then my lords have had an answer <e> <s> i say we might have had an answer but i am not sure because i suspect that the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says tomorrow <e> <s> by doing that we can at least begin to restore the confidence of claimants <e> <s> that is important but we can also remove uncertainty from those on the other side of the counter when the claimants go along to make their claims <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull paid a well-earned tribute to the work of the people in the supplementary benefits departments <e> <s> i know they work under very difficult conditions but those conditions are made much more difficult when they do not know the answers to many of the questions put to them almost hourly by people who themselves are in great difficulties <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady faithfull said claimants are often frustrated and resentful and sometimes they do not behave in a way which is conducive to a happy relationship between the two sides <e> <s> anything we can do to remove that uncertainty would be very valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be easy to do as the noble lord lord orr-ewing suggests and prosecute those who take deliberate steps to make their motor-cycles noiser than they need be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe for introducing these topics in so admirable a manner <e> <s> i wait with eagerness to hear the answers to some of his questions particularly those relating to british telecoms charges <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government any comprehensive advice to offer regarding the installation and use of burglar alarms <e> <s> what steps can be taken to minimise the nuisance suffered by suburban residents from the persistent and presumably fruitless ringing of burglar alarms <e>", "<cs> my lords i must hasten to join the noble lord lord ennals in thanking the noble lord lord mottistone for giving us an opportunity to debate a matter which really is of the utmost public importance <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone has shown a close interest in this matter over many years <e> <s> it was a great pleasure to me personally as a vice-chairman of the parliamentary mental health group to welcome him to our meeting last week <e> <s> it was also a pleasure to note that he came to that meeting not to tell all the professional workers who were gathered together how they should be running their affairs he came to listen and the fact that he listened very carefully was evident in the speech he has made to us in introducing this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must begin as the first speaker below the line as it were in two ways first by thanking the noble lord lord monkswell for his remarkable and welcome brevity in view of the time which has already been expended <e> <s> but i should like to begin as did my noble friend lord harris of greenwich by regretting deeply the enforced absence from this debate of the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool whose advice would have been invaluable on this particular occasion <e> <s> perhaps i could add to that a word of regret that our constitutional arrangements do not allow of archbishop worlock being present with us <e> <s> his advice too would have been invaluable as indeed the work that he has done in that great city of liverpool has been invaluable in these hard days <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps i should use the device so often used by ministers and say that i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i genuinely believe that some of the things the noble lord has said in this debate today are in marked contrast to some of the things he has said publicly in merseyside on other occasions about his colleagues in other parties in liverpool city council <e> <s> i regarded him as a very wise leader of that council and he did an excellent job <e> <s> in particular he did an excellent job by trying to harmonise the activities and the work of people in different parties <e> <s> that is something which we must all try to do when a city is in great difficulties and the noble lord lord sefton tried to do that <e> <s> i am sorry that he now appears to be departing from that course <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to join the noble lord lord ennals in thanking the noble baroness for repeating this very important and indeed alarming statement particularly as i understand she has some difficulties at the moment <e> <s> i hope that the length of the statement it is unusually long indicates the seriousness with which the government regard the contents of the report <e> <s> i should like too to join with the noble lord lord ennals in thanking the chairman mr john hugill and his colleagues for the expedition and the very thorough way in which they have inquired into these extremely complex and difficult matters <e> <s> they have done that with greater expedition than the government have perhaps shown in bringing the report to us <e> <s> it was of course a very small committee <e> <s> in that connection i can perhaps say that the nature of the report points in part to the <e>", "<cs> my lords there was the question with regard to the cleaning and catering services <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was with regard to the position of crown immunity in relation to those cleaning and catering services in hospitals which have been privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble baroness for that informative if not wholly welcome answer may i ask her whether she will persuade her advisers to do their sums again and to bear in mind in so doing the fact that if we are all to have more leisure as a result of new technology which surely will be welcome it is better for the nation that that extra leisure should come at the end of the working life when people have acquired the maturity and experience to make profitable and fulfilling use of it rather than that we should have compulsory leisure at school-leaving age which does not lead to fulfilment but leads to resentment and frustration <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the point raised by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is the noble baroness aware that many womens organisations and i believe the equal opportunities commission are of the opinion that women would support the raising of the statutory retirement age for women as a hesitant small step towards the elimination of this piece of sex discrimination which adds to the the discrimination that already exists as a result of the fact that women on average live about eight years longer than men <e>", "<cs> my lords on rising at this late hour to wind up this debate on behalf of my noble friends on these benches it clearly behoves me to be brief <e> <s> in any case i would not be speaking now on this subject had not my noble friend lord evans of claughton as a result of ill-health been unable to be here <e> <s> i very much regret that his great experience and <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome any steps to improve the security at our airports but will the noble earl comment on the statement by the chief constable of greater manchester that if machine guns have to be carried at manchester ringway airport he would prefer them to be carried by the armed forces rather than by the police <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that when the factors responsible for the high incidence of meningitis are identified in these areas of stroud and gloucestershire the same conditions may exist elsewhere <e> <s> therefore there might be a need for central rather than merely local action <e> <s> does the noble baroness further agree that the reply she has given to my noble friend underlines the statement she made to this house on the report on the stanley royd hospital to the effect that there is an urgent need for a review of the operation of the public health function and of the role of the speciality of community medicine in general <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness misunderstood me <e> <s> i know nothing of kettles or fish <e> <s> i referred to her statement that an inquiry was to take place into the whole function of environmental health and to the role and specialty of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have asked this question on a previous occasion but i should like to ask the noble lord the minister again whether anything can be done to stop or at least discourage the use on vehicles of excessively bright rear lights during times of bad visability on motorways as they are dazzling dangerous and frankly against the law <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would allow me is not the real point whether or not the noble lords contribution on this matter could reasonably be regarded as likely to affect public support for mr blunkett <e>", "<cs> may i intervene on that point <e> <s> the noble and learned lord appears to be suggesting that since certain words have now been taken out of this clause these words in this amendment are no longer necessary <e> <s> is he therefore saying that the government will not seek to re-insert those words which have been taken out <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill comes to reply and to make up his mind as to what course to pursue i should like to say just a brief word on the amendment as one of the signatories to it <e> <s> so far in committee we have become a little too preoccupied about what might or might not happen in certain circumstances in the courts <e> <s> what really matters is what when the bill becomes an act local authorities will do and what they may not do <e> <s> that is very much more important indeed i think it is extremely unlikely that the courts will be greatly troubled in the matter <e> <s> all these arguments about how learned judges will interpret this or interpret that seem to me not to be the real issue <e> <s> what to me is the real issue is whether the bill will stop local authorities doing with public money some things which all of us in all parts of the committee are agreed they should not be doing but also whether the bill could stop local authorities doing some things which they have a duty clearly to do <e> <s> that was our problem with an earlier amendment and it is now our problem here <e>", "<cs> the widdicombe report made it perfectly clear that with the retention of certain words which are not now deleted local authorities would not then be able to do things which widdicombe considered local authorities should actually do <e> <s> here it is a question of us putting words into the bill so that there is not the risk which i think would exist were those words not put in that local authorities might be disinclined to do something which they ought actually to do <e> <s> i believe that without the words which are in the amendment or without some other kind of clarification or reassurance there is a genuine danger that local authorities might be disinclined to carry out work of this kind which i believe and which all of us wherever we sit in the committee believe local authorities should do <e>", "<cs> surely the noble and learned lords argument goes both ways <e> <s> he says that he does not see the point of the amendment and i can well understand that but does he see the point in the subsection that it seeks to delete <e> <s> frankly i cannot see any point in that at all <e> <s> we are dealing here with a part of the bill which deals with material which is published <e> <s> what are the things which can be published <e> <s> leaflets advertisements posters stickers things of that kind <e>", "<cs> i have been listening as closely as i can and i think i understand the noble lord so far <e> <s> i merely ask him one question <e> <s> where material has been published not as part of a campaign but published months and months previously and is subsequently used in a campaign then clearly it escapes from this altogether does it not <e>", "<cs> may i make it a little more clear <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the undertaking which he has given to the committee <e> <s> if i have understood his undertaking correctly it is that he understands that the present situation is unclear and that the government will bring forward an amendment or some process which will at least clarify matters <e> <s> that is something for which i and i am quite sure other members of the committee will be very grateful <e>", "<cs> i should like to say in conclusion that i think that the noble baroness lady david is being a little optimistic when she says that she hopes the government will leave things as they are <e> <s> no government ever leave things as they are and i doubt whether this one will do so <e> <s> nevertheless in view of what the noble lord has said and the manner in which he has said it in a moment i shall most certainly beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> but i am glad that it has been thought about very carefully because the point is of immense importance <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may say a very brief word <e> <s> i was most interested in what the noble lord said about it being the business of the member of parliament to deal with the local problems of local people <e> <s> i just thought i would say <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for correcting me <e> <s> it is my recollection of activities in another place and i am sure it is shared by noble lords who i see around me who have worked in another place that one spent an enormous amount of ones time dealing with problems of constituents that should in fact have been taken to local councillors but instead were brought invariably to the member of parliament <e> <s> i just hope that the noble lord lord mottistone was not trying to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an immense pleasure to follow the noble lord lord john-mackie and his very important unstarred question and perhaps add one or two questions of my own <e> <s> it might perhaps have been a greater pleasure to have followed the noble lord lord stanley of alderley rather than have him follow me i could perhaps then have done to his speech what he may hope to do to mine after i have sat down <e> <s> we can but wait and see so far as that is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point the noble lord is making but he notes too that there are conflicts <e> <s> we are dealing with conflicts <e> <s> i should like to feel that everybody in your lordships house feels that such green belt as we have must be preserved if possible <e> <s> countryside land at the moment is in very short supply in great britain and under ever-increasing demand <e> <s> once lost the cost of restoring it would be absolutely prohibitive <e> <s> therefore we must do what we can to protect it <e> <s> i do not believe that we are protecting green belt land by applying planning restraints to farmers in such a way as to imperil the profitability of their activities on their land <e> <s> we must understand that if we genuinely wish green belt land to be preserved in a form which is desirable in a form which is valuable to other citizens living near it and around it then we must do everything we possibly can to see that profitable farming is maintained and sustained in those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i did not myself ask for planning controls to be extended <e> <s> what i did say was that i knew of an area in which planning control had been applied voluntarily by the farmers and the planning authority that seemed to me to be advantageous <e> <s> however i was not recommending and i should not like to be reported as doing so the application of planning controls to agricultural buildings as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the answer which the noble baroness has given and the supplementary questions which have been addressed to her really underline the importance of resurrecting and re-establishing the old medical officer of health who did such a very important job <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak on this amendment but i really feel that as a result of the speech made by my noble friend on the front bench here i ought to say a word to make it absolutely clear that in general noble lords on these benches are wholly in support of this amendment <e> <s> i must say too that we are in some danger of becoming confused <e> <s> perhaps some noble lords are in danger of becoming even more confused than they were before <e> <s> in part i would blame that if i may with all respect on my noble friend because i genuinely feel that his arguments were directed not at this amendment but at a circular letter which he has received from another source and it is important that we direct our attention exclusively to what is said in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning for bringing forward this new clause because i believe that it points to what i regard as glaring omissions in the bill as it now stands <e> <s> when i first read the original bill and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the noble lord quoted me and he referred to the fact that he hoped that noble lords on these benches would be supporting the government on this amendment <e> <s> this is not a government amendment <e> <s> we have not yet heard the governments attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may at this stage agree wholeheartedly with the noble lord lord elton on one point <e> <s> he said a moment ago that it was his view that your lordships house did not want long speeches at this stage of a bill <e> <s> i would go a little further and say that in general it seems to me your lordships house does not want long speeches at any stage of any bill <e> <s> that having been said i shall do my best to be very brief in shall i say <e> <s> allowing this bill to pass <e> <s> we can do no other than that from these benches <e> <s> i think it is appropriate that something should be said from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am reassured to learn that her majestys government are listening to professional advice on flu vaccine advice with which i may say i agree may i express the hope that the government will also listen to professional advice about the pertussis vaccine <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness what has happened to the home chiropody service which so many elderly people found absolutely invaluable and which now seems to have disappeared from almost every area <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ennals said there are now far more elderly people in society which means that there are twice as many elderly feet <e> <s> many of those feet cause trouble and the right place for them to be attended to is in the elderly persons home <e> <s> what has happened to those home services <e> <s> is there any chance of their being restored <e>", "<cs> my lords i must at once join with the noble baroness lady david in thanking the noble lord lord marshall of leeds for giving us an opportunity to discuss this immensely important topic <e> <s> i say at the outset that it seems to me that this is where we all came in <e> <s> i say that because i am absolutely convinced that each and every one of us has been discussing this very topic from as far back as we can remember in our political lives <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble and learned friend will permit me to intervene also at this stage <e> <s> i did not use the words only one matter i said one matter which is different <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will acknowledge that i stated that this was not the time or place in which to put forward our proposals in detail <e> <s> i said i was not proposing to do so <e> <s> i referred to one aspect of our proposals and merely said it was one aspect <e> <s> it happened to be an aspect of our proposals about which i personally had some anxieties <e> <s> i explained those but i did not go into detail and i do not think your lordships would have wished me to do so on the other aspects of our policy for financing local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained and stated positively that i thought it was absolutely essential that large amounts of money should be shuffled about the country in the way to which the noble lord has just referred <e> <s> i said that it was absolutely essential that there should be an equalising measure that that is central government money by means of grant <e> <s> i explained that and i adhere to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recollect that i put questions to him on this specific matter in a debate in your lordships house very recently <e> <s> is he yet in a position to say whether the government will now take over the very important role of monitoring coastal pollution in an area from cardigan bay to st <e> <s> bees head which includes discharges from sellafield and which was formerly being undertaken by the body to which he has just referred <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee for long at this late hour <e> <s> indeed i resisted the temptation to respond to the speech of the noble and learned lord lord denning on the earlier amendment <e> <s> i believe frankly i shall return to this in a moment that the noble and learned lord if i may say so with the greatest respect was rather confused about precisely what surrogacy is <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ennals i too from this front bench speak for myself alone <e> <s> nevertheless i entertain the hope that many of my noble friends would agree with me <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord feels similarly <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ennals decides what course he is going to take with regard to this clause i would say in response to the noble earl lord halsbury that i do not think that the government would get much helpful evidence as to the balance of opinion in society through a division on this particular clause in a committee with this number of people at this hour of night <e> <s> if my noble friend presses a division whatever the result i do not think <e>", "<cs> i rise to make two points very briefly <e> <s> first i believe that the noble lord lord coleraine both in his amendment and in his speech upon it has pointed to matters of immense importance and very great complexity <e> <s> i agree with much of what he said <e> <s> i agree also that perhaps such matters cannot be dealt with in this particular bill in this particular way <e> <s> perhaps that reinforces my view that we should have waited for a much more comprehensive government bill the one that we hope will presently come forward <e>", "<cs> my lords if there are any noble lords who have any doubts about the importance of the tourist industry to the united kingdom economy those doubts should have been dispelled by the excellent speech made by the noble lord lord campbell of croy when he introduced his motion for which we are all deeply grateful <e> <s> if there were any lingering doubts i should have thought that the splendid speech of the noble lord lord parry would have dealt with them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many general practitioners have been gravely concerned about the risk of hypothermia for elderly people during the recent unexpectedly cold spell particularly bearing in mind high fuel costs and the tendency of elderly people to turn down their heating appliances to dangerous levels <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether she is aware of the new scheme pioneered by the electricity council whereby a single room is insulated and heated <e> <s> this is being explored and pioneered as a pilot scheme in certain electricity board areas and many of us would like to see that scheme extended to other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in some areas there is a strong feeling that insufficient care has been taken to discover whether there is a social need or a strong local demand for the maintenance of a post office before it is closed <e> <s> will the minister use his influence to make sure that steps of that kind are adequately publicised locally so that the local population may make its view well known to those in charge <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak in the gap in the list of speakers i make no apology for my name not having been put down because it was put down but did not appear on the list <e> <s> i apologise most deeply and sincerely for my absence from the early speeches in this very important debate a debate for which we are all very grateful to my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i was engaged in another meeting in this palace a meeting to which i shall presently have to return <e> <s> i shall therefore be very brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely quoting richard coke who is known to the noble lord <e> <s> i was merely quoting what he said about the system of even age single species planting followed by clear felling <e> <s> if richard coke is wrong the noble lord should tell him <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain to the house how he accounts for the totally different picture produced by the two sets of figures that he has explained <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend who asked this question will forgive me if i ask the minister whether he is aware that the present counter system used by the post office is that which was recommended by me when i had the honour to be chairman of the post office boards quality of service committee <e> <s> is the minister also aware that that system was only recommended after detailed research <e> <s> it was found much better to have generic counter clerks doing everything rather than to have separate queues for pensioners and others <e> <s> it was the best system and it has in fact been followed by many banks <e> <s> is the minister further aware that if there are now queues that can only mean either that there are not sufficient people serving at the counter that the post office is not open for long enough or that it is not open at the right times <e>", "<cs> my lords after that interesting unscheduled excursion i feel that i should say to the noble lord lord sefton that i frankly doubt whether the british public would be willing to allow total complete and continuous broadcasting of all the proceedings of your lordships house merely to ensure that the noble lord lord sefton is not upset just occasionally <e> <s> but i am sorry that he was upset and i do remember <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the incident to which the noble lord lord sefton refers <e> <s> i was here at the time <e> <s> i also happened to see the programme <e> <s> i do not know whether it was the bbc or itv and i am not <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments intention to give assistance in this form to this particular group of workers <e> <s> however will the noble lord the minister accept that if the government do that which we would welcome they will then have an obligation to do something comparable for workers in the public sector such as nurses firemen and prison officers whose organisations cannot conceivably make any profits for them to share in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness emphasise that the need for immunisation against whooping cough is primarily in very young children who are particularly at risk from this disease <e> <s> will she also bear in mind that most doctors believe that whooping cough in older children is so trivial a disease that it does not warrant the slight risk in relation to the pertussis immunisation <e> <s> with regard to the risk factor will the noble baroness accept that general practitioners at the moment are in some difficulty because of the different figures being published by different authorities on the precise risk involved in pertussis immunisation <e> <s> it would be immensely helpful if the department were to disclose fully all the information in its possession on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that after that interesting excursion into maritime affairs noble lords will not have forgotten the three fascinating speeches that we heard a short time ago on the important motion which was so ably moved by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> we are all most grateful to the noble lord for introducing such a very important subject <e> <s> as i have said i hope that noble lords have not forgotten the three most interesting speeches that we have heard <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson is to be particularly congratulated for giving this interesting and important debate the international flavour which it undoubtedly needs <e> <s> i was so glad that he referred to the excellent work of sir john wilson and the emergence of the organisation impact following that important meeting at leeds castle because the international dimension in the whole question of the prevention of disability is vital <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is wrong my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that in fact many lives could be saved if the government were to do something to discourage the magpie-like quality with which members of the public hoard the remains of old drugs long after the purpose for which they were prescribed has been forgotten <e> <s> is she aware that some people store them up for use on some future unspecified occasion by which time the drug has decomposed and perhaps become dangerous or certainly has lost any therapeutic powers which it once possessed <e>", "<cs> my lords just for the sake of clarity and for the record may i make it clear that for once i shall not say only for once the position of the front bench spokesman on these benches is precisely the same as that of the noble lord lord ennals the front bench spokesman on the official opposition benches <e> <s> i leave it at that <e> <s> i agreed with every word he said <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i would wish to join at once with the noble lord lord ennals in thanking the noble baroness for repeating this extremely important statement <e> <s> at the outset i should like to join the noble lord and the noble baroness in conveying our thanks from these benches to sir john badenoch and his colleagues for the very thorough way in which they <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the forthcoming debates in your lordships house on the national health service amendment bill to which reference has already been made by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes i think that this is a very timely debate indeed <e> <s> therefore i would say that the noble lord lord hunter of newington has earned our thanks for introducing the debate at this time <e> <s> it gives us if i may say so a first bite at a number of cherries which we shall be chewing over very carefully later on <e> <s> i will leave that bill for the moment save to say that certain of the matters dealt with in it are dealt with comprehensively in this report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> i was most interested to hear what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i know of course that her words are very carefully followed by health authorities <e> <s> i wonder whether on this occasion she could take special steps to make sure that the words she has just spoken in answer to the point <e> <s> i raised are brought specifically to the attention of health authorities because i am bound to tell her that many health authorities are acting in a manner quite contrary to that advice <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the further steps that the government are taking may i ask that they do not overlook the need to increase the availability of rented accommodation for university students in urban areas bearing in mind that many are in desperate difficulties and that some are being outrageously exploited <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i accept what the minister said in reply to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> it would produce a whole lot of bureaucratic entanglements which would be well nigh intolerable for the farmer and the landlord and also for the local councils which would have to administer it <e> <s> i accept all that <e> <s> but it does not seem to me that one necessarily ignores a situation merely because the solution is a difficult one or an awkward one <e> <s> perhaps the simplest thing to do would be to go back to the position before the law was changed in <e> <s> in that connection perhaps the minister could tell us what deprivations and what difficulties there really were for farmers and landowners before the change in the law under the wildlife and countryside act <e>", "<cs> before we leave this matter i do not honestly think that we should allow the extraordinary intervention of the noble lord opposite to go unanswered <e> <s> it appeared to suggest that no one should be allowed on our public footpaths of which there are a great many except members of the ramblers association <e> <s> public footpaths are for the public and not for people who have been on courses of education to this or that college or who have undertaken special courses with the ramblers association <e> <s> the idea that the ramblers association has some kind of public duty to educate each and every person who wanders on <e>", "<cs> my lords although i wish to underline the importance of the matters referred to in the question may i ask the minister to seize this opportunity to tell the british public that the principal sources of radiation to which they are exposed come not from the sources referred to but from diagnostic x-rays many of which are performed not for necessary clinical or medical reasons but for medico-legal and other extraneous purposes <e> <s> will he ensure that patients are told that they are not serving their best interests when they press their gp to send them for unnecessary x-rays and that gps in their desire to be helpful are not serving the best interests of their patients if they accede to such requests <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness stated that the purpose of this advertising campaign was not to persuade heroin addicts to cease using heroin but to dissuade young people from experimenting with heroin thus avoiding the risk of becoming addicted <e> <s> will the noble baroness agree that it would be difficult at this early stage to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign from that point of view <e> <s> does she also agree that a campaign of a very different kind using resources of a different kind will be required to deal with people who are already addicted <e>", "<cs> on this motion i seize this opportunity to ask the noble baroness to expand a little on her answer to my noble friend lord kilmarnock on the last amendment <e> <s> her principal objection to his amendment was on grounds of its greater cost that its cost would be greater than the governments own proposal <e> <s> the committee would find it helpful if the noble baroness would tell us precisely what will be the cost of the governments proposal <e> <s> the government have told us that they intend to pay the equivalent of a death grant from the social fund to many people in need <e> <s> they have not said to how many people such a grant will be paid nor have they said how much it will be <e> <s> if the proposal in this clause is to be of greater cost it would be helpful if we knew how much the governments proposal would cost <e> <s> how much is the grant to be and how many people will it go to <e>", "<cs> i shall be as brief as i can but i share the view expressed by the noble lord lord ennals that it would be neither right nor proper to try to deal with this matter briefly and formally <e> <s> it is a matter about which millions of people are very deeply concerned and they would wish to know that it is being properly considered in your lordships committee and will not care twopence about the time at which it is considered nor do i make any complaint about that <e> <s> i feel that the matter is one of sufficient importance for some of the facts to be put on record <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike my noble friend lord hunt i was deeply interested and involved in this matter when it was discussed in the debates on the wildlife and countryside bill away back in <e> <s> indeed at that time i felt very strongly that the arrangements we came to under section of that act would not be satisfactory <e> <s> i think that events which have taken place since then have shown that was entirely right <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i join the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the minister for repeating this important statement on this very complex and important report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept bearing in mind the amount of time that we now have necessarily to spend in the house that the time is now coming when noble lords should receive some assistance in having their wives visit them in london in the same way that members of another place have assistance for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords were not the government warned over and over again by knowledgeable people that what has happened would <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has worked for many years albeit in a part-time capacity in one of her majestys royal ordnance factories may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is aware that there has been grave anxiety among staff senior staff in particular with regard to superannuation and other long-term employment rights <e> <s> have the government now reached agreement on these matters with the various parties concerned or are they still in dispute on benefits of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords were a thoughtful person wholly unconnected with politics to learn that this evening the day before your lordships disperse for the summer recess the house was remaining here to unsocial hours to debate a new bill dealing with the national health service then such a person might jump to the conclusion that at long last some of the major deficiencies in the national health service of which we are all so very much aware were being attended to <e> <s> not so <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister told the house that pounc were informed of these proposed increases before they took place <e> <s> is the minister in a position to tell the house what advice pounc offered to the post office board <e> <s> can he tell the house why the post office board rejected the advice that was given to them by pounc <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that it is vital that we should preserve a civilised attitude towards mentally abnormal offenders <e> <s> it is not easy to do that if disruptive and dangerous people are released prematurely into society <e> <s> will the noble earl further agree that in considering this matter we must bear in mind the interests of patients these people are patients the staff in these institutions and also the mood of the british public which if affected adversely could be very damaging to this whole issue <e>", "<cs> my lords to add to the point made by the noble baroness what one is concerned about is the durability of the records to which she has referred <e> <s> i for purely personal purposes have been inquiring recently into burial records dating back to <e> <s> were we to have to wait for hundreds of years and then be told that we could have a computer printout i venture to suggest it might not be satisfactory if and when we got it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the log-jam in rheumatology in certain hospitals arises not only from the shortage of consultant rheumatologists but from a shortage of consultant radiologists without whose services the proper practice of rheumatology is impossible <e> <s> in that connection is the noble baroness aware that consultant radiologists do not have to talk very much to patients which means that they can easily leave britain to practise in the ec at higher salaries which is what many of them are in fact now doing <e> <s> finally does the noble baroness accept that however many consultant rheumatologists she is able to appoint that will not solve the problem unless radiological services are adequate <e>", "<cs> it is a great pleasure to support this amendment which was so ably moved by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> speaking for noble friends on these benches i think i am right in saying that we would have preferred the total lifting of crown <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to add two points to those which have been made by my noble friend lord kilmarnock in support of these amendments <e> <s> first the noble baroness referred to the notes of guidance <e> <s> she described them and said that they may well fulfil the purpose which the amendment has <e> <s> she then said that she would be glad to receive suggestions on ways of improving those notes of guidance <e> <s> i was wondering whether the noble baroness will be in a position to tell the committee in a moment by what means those suggestions should be made <e> <s> does she mean here and now or that at some stage your lordships house will have an opportunity of debating the notes of guidance <e> <s> alternatively does she mean that it should be done through some entirely informal method or other approach <e> <s> perhaps she will answer that question in a moment when i have dealt with my other point <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that the noble lord lord ennals is under a misapprehension with regard to what the noble baroness said <e> <s> the noble baroness told the committee that if when this bill is enacted it subsequently transpires that these decisions are taking too long the government will take whatever steps are necessary to remedy that <e>", "<cs> that is rather different from saying that she would consider this suggestion and perhaps allow us to do something about it at a later stage of the bill which is what the noble lord lord ennals appeared to have in mind <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness in her reply appeared to suggest among other things that one of the reasons for resisting this amendment was that it would in some way undermine the essential small pharmacies scheme to which reference has already been made <e> <s> i know that she has already been questioned about the apparent disparity between the scheme as it would work in england and wales and as it may work in scotland <e> <s> also i know that my noble friend lord kilmarnock has the intention of raising the point again later <e> <s> but this perhaps is another time at which i can raise it <e>", "<cs> i have listened closely to that explanation <e> <s> the noble baroness will know that some of the points that she mentioned at the end of her speech are the very reasons why we on these benches were supportive of this part of the bill at second reading <e> <s> nevertheless i must come to the specific point raised in a letter to me and i understand also to my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> it says this <e>", "<cs> in the course of his speech the noble lord lord prys-davies was saying that there was no right of appeal to the secretary of state <e> <s> i am puzzled by that observation because the only parallel that we have to this new machinery is the medical practices committee which exercises precisely the same function in relation to general practitioners setting up in practice <e> <s> the medical practices committee designates areas as open intermediate or closed <e>", "<cs> have i rightly understood the noble baroness to say that clause does not change things <e> <s> it merely legitimises what the government have been doing for years <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the situation to which this question draws attention place intolerable burdens on young people who seek to further their careers by taking posts in london <e> <s> is it not a fact that in london there are far too many houses which have been renovated to such a high standard that nobody can afford to live in them and far too many houses that are so dilapidated that they are not fit to live in <e> <s> is it not economically and urgently desirable that there should be enough ordinary houses in london for ordinary people to live in <e> <s> what is being done to provide them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to prolong this discussion but i hope that the noble lord lord elystan-morgan is right in reading in the countenance of the noble baroness a favourable response which we are shortly to receive because i feel that unless we have a favourable response there will be grave disquiet not only in certain parts of your lordships house but outside it as well <e> <s> i believe that many people feel that the whole of clause was perhaps rather hastily introduced without proper consultation with the various parties who will clearly be affected and i think that there is a great deal of disquiet about the element of retrospection <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is absolutely right in saying that the amendment is unnecessary in that the bill as it now stands is clear <e> <s> however while it may be unnecessary from that point of view there could be a way in which the amendment although not necessary for the purpose of clarity is plainly desirable because of the different flavour it gives to the whole exercise upon which we embark <e> <s> the amendment would alter the presumption <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to go over the ground so admirably covered by the noble lord lord ennals and my noble friend lord kilmarnock <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who lives in part of the lake district which was exposed to the chernobyl cloud at a time of very heavy rainfall may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that what we want to know is to whom we should apply for information about whether or not our water supplies or our land have become radidactive <e> <s> my wife insists that our vegetables and fruit have been chernobyled <e> <s> i cannot dispute that with her unless i have the necessary information <e> <s> i asked the ministry of agriculture about this weeks ago and have heard nothing <e> <s> i could ask my friends at sellafield to do tests but that would be hardly fair since they did not cause the cloud <e> <s> who should we ask <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will recall that on second reading noble lords on these benches gave the bill a cautious welcome <e> <s> we send the bill on its further journey with goodwill but that is tinged with some caution <e> <s> i shall say briefly why in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords while the number of these hip operations has increased greatly which is of course to the credit of all those concerned including <e>", "<cs> my lords while warmly welcoming the very necessary steps that the government are now taking may i ask the noble lord whether he will agree that the most urgent matter is the pioneering and development of a protective vaccine and of a specific therapeutic agent <e> <s> can the noble lord tell the house whether he is satisfied that funds are adequate for that very necessary purpose and that international work in that regard is being properly integrated and harmonised <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind our outstanding success in eliminating lead from other substances such as paint and pencils which were a potent source of lead poisoning in young children is it not regrettable that we would appear to be dragging our feet in comparison with our european partners as regards petrol <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether any delay if there is delay is the responsibility of the government or of the motor car manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there was a time when the noble lord lord hunter of newington had a professional duty perhaps even a statutory duty to advise government on matters such as this <e> <s> at that time i sometimes regretted that the noble lords advice was not heeded as carefully as some of us thought it ought to be <e> <s> it therefore follows that i very much hope that your lordships will heed the advice of the noble lord lord hunter on this occasion because i think it is very good advice indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct <e> <s> there were other obstacles because the independent broadcasting authority would not allow the companies to advertise it nor would anyone else allow them to advertise it as a means of stopping smoking <e> <s> there were many obstacles <e> <s> i was merely making the point that smokers who want to give up sometimes need help <e> <s> some have found snuff helpful <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord hunter wants snuff banned <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not time that we looked again at the disregard figure in relation to supplementary benefit and other benefits so that some people could do a small amount of work and earn a little money without infringing the law <e>", "<cs> my lords the time has come for me to draw this interesting and i believe very important debate to a conclusion <e> <s> i hope that it will prove to have been helpful but time alone will show that <e> <s> as much of the debate has been anecdotal we have heard most important anecdotes from the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee perhaps i may add my own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords in the earlier short debate today which i had the honour of opening the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead apologised to your lordships and to me for not having been here to hear my speech <e> <s> he will realise that i have had no opportunity of avoiding hearing his speech since i had to speak immediately afterwards <e> <s> but he may like to know that i listened to it with very great care and i agree wholeheartedly with his concluding remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords during this lengthy review which has been going on for a very long time indeed will the noble baroness bear in mind the plight of parents with young children who are suffering from diabetes and who have to have insulin injections <e> <s> does she agree that such parents have burdens enough without the added one of having to sterilise syringes <e> <s> if disposable syringes cannot be prescribed on form fp for all diabetic patients as i think they should be can they at least be prescribed for diabetic children <e>", "<cs> my lords as these cases clearly cannot be treated until they have been diagnosed can the noble baroness tell us something about the present cost of diagnosis including screening <e> <s> more specifically can she tell the house the precise cost of an individual blood test for the presence of the virus including the laboratory costs <e>", "<cs> my lords will the enforcement of the new limits be any more effective than the enforcement of the old limits which seems to me to be non-existent <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe who so admirably introduced this debate i shall restrict my remarks to the two subjects for which i have been given specific responsibility by my party in your lordships house that is health and broadcasting and the media in general <e> <s> so far only my noble friend lord grimond has not overrun his time <e> <s> perhaps i may try to follow him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bottomley introduced this important debate with a sincere honest and moving speech on matters about which he rightly feels strongly <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i say that he focused his remarks somewhat narrowly in relation to the actual wording of his motion and i hope he will forgive me if i spread to other aspects of the influence and effects of the private sector or private enterprise on the national health service <e> <s> towards that end i shall divide my speech like gaul into three parts and allowing for these preliminaries that would appear with eight minutes to allow me about two and a half minutes for each part <e> <s> i say without hesitation that if any part exceeds its two and a half minutes i shall take that out of the next part rather than out of the time of the next noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the renovation of empty and dilapidated homes a labour-intensive activity <e> <s> are not the materials needed all home <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris of high cross has introduced a desperately important subject and one of great complexity <e> <s> listening to him i felt at times that i was listening to the secretary of state for the environment mr nicholas ridley because their views seem so alike in so many ways <e> <s> in fairness to mr ridley the last time i read one of his speeches on this subject it was one he made to the institute of housing conference on th june last <e> <s> it seemed that mr ridley covered his tracks and guarded his escape route rather better than the noble lord lord harris has <e> <s> mr ridley said <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord henderson of brompton i am profoundly uneasy about the bill <e> <s> in saying that i should make it quite clear that that is my opinion and not necessarily the opinion of my noble friends on these benches as indeed was made clear by the sensible intervention of my noble friend lord barrington <e> <s> this is not a party matter but it is one on which i feel very deeply <e> <s> i hope and the hope has already been expressed by others that those of us who disagree will accept that the opinions we all hold though different are held in good faith <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate because he has now said that he does seek to alter the abortion act and of course he would alter it quite significantly if his bill goes through <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl and i am sorry that i overlooked what he said <e> <s> however i recollect that he said that on a previous occasion and i dare say that others believe the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to the noble duke for that information <e> <s> i meant to say that i understand the point of view of those people who because of their sincere beliefs would like to sabotage the abortion act of <e> <s> there are people who would like to do that and i am opposed to them <e> <s> i think that possibly this bill could give them a launching pad for further attempts of the kind that we have seen during the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend that any question of imposing haste or pressure of any kind on mothers in those tragic circumstances is altogether regrettable <e> <s> i am inclined to think that as the age is brought down and one appears to apply limitations perhaps one runs the risk of increasing the pressures that may be applied to certain women <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for repeating that important statement <e> <s> he will accept that it is very complex as indeed is the document to which he referred which has been placed in the library <e> <s> he will also accept that we shall wish to study that document and the statement more carefully before we can finalise our views on this whole matter <e> <s> but in general we welcome the statement because it appears to signal two things <e> <s> first it appears that the government now accept that the principal need so far as housing is concerned is for houses to rent <e> <s> secondly it appears to signal the fact that the government recognise that it is no longer acceptable for all their efforts to be restricted to increasing the percentage of owner-occupiers which hitherto has seemed to be the governments single and only housing policy <e>", "<cs> my lords what steps are being taken to enable regional airports like manchester airport at ringway to expand their activities and to arrange flights and services for which there is a demand <e> <s> at the moment they are not permitted to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder if he will answer one question from his great experience in these matters <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to the wise advice of the bank manager to his client and i accept that i rely on that wise advice very often <e> <s> many bank managers sell life insurance <e> <s> my experience of those cases in which a bank manager has sold the wrong policy i have come across many examples is that he has done so not because of any advantageous question of commission rates but merely because he does not know anything about life insurance <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord can tell me from his experience to what extent high street bank managers are properly trained in the very complicated professional business of life insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to join with the noble lord lord ennals in thanking the noble baroness for repeating this important and welcome statement <e> <s> like all gaul the statement comes in three parts <e> <s> the first relates to screening for breast cancer the second cervical cytology and screening for cervical cancer and the third is the need for reources for research into aids <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he will be kind enough to answer me just one question <e> <s> i wonder whether he would agree that if parliament goes to the trouble to vote special help for a special group of people in special need it would be no bad thing if that help actually reached those people <e> <s> does he agree that the people in most desperate need are seldom the people who get all the benefits that are going <e> <s> the people who get all the benefits are often those who are not in the most need but those who are the best informed <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting that it may well be wise to discharge many patients from some older institutions into the community for community care will the noble baroness accept that the back-up support services for that community care are far from being provided <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up this fascinating debate on behalf of my noble friends on these benches what i personally wish to say on this subject can be said in a few sentences and i will try to limit myself to those few sentences <e>", "<cs> i know that it was attributed to st augustine but i believe that in fact it was st anthony <e> <s> however he is not actually here <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches who took an interest in this matter at committee stage i too thank the noble earl for the new clause which has come forward and which i am sure will be warmly welcomed by my noble friends <e> <s> this is report stage and as we are not going to get an opportunity to look further at the bill in detail and as the procedures are not going to enable the noble earl to speak on each further clause of the bill i hope that while he is looking into the point raised by the noble lord lord mishcon i may raise one other matter about which my noble friends and i on these benches still have some anxiety and which is perhaps related to the new clause but does not come strictly within it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene very briefly <e> <s> i have listened most carefully to the words of the noble lord lord beaverbrook <e> <s> i understood him to say that if following consultations with the local authority associations there was agreement on this provision as outlined by the noble lord lord mishcon then arrangements would be made for it to be carried out <e> <s> my only purpose in intervening was to ask whether the noble lord lord beaverbrook could say anything further about the timing of those consultations <e> <s> are they likely to be concluded before this house says goodbye to this bill or can the noble lord ensure that they will in fact be concluded in time for some further statement to be made before matters are over <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord hazard a guess as to what would have been the reaction of his noble friends on the government benches had a trawl of this kind been carried out when a labour government were in power <e> <s> bearing in mind that we are governed in this country largely by precedent should we not regard new precedents with grave suspicion <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl accept that recurrent frequent reports of obscene cruelty to animals in britain are as damaging to british prestige as is the behaviour of football hooligans on sports grounds <e> <s> does he accept that merely doubling fines is not a sufficient response <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is proper and recommended as it has been that members of these benches should vote according to their conscience on the matter of the shops bill is it not equally proper that the prosecuting authorities should be left to operate their consciences as well for a time <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord williams whether if an accountant is to be defined in the way specified in this amendment we still need the words approved by the bank in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the fact that my name does not appear on the list of speakers although i did notify the noble lord the minister and the noble and learned lord lord silkin that i would seek to say a few words at this point on behalf of my noble friends on these benches <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just finish the quotation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was in a position to know and of course noble lords accept what he has said <e> <s> i do not think it invalidates the fact that at that time the risk was put at one in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness referred understandably to scaremongering in past years <e> <s> will she make it absolutely clear that she does not for one moment regard attempts by families to obtain suitable compensation for what they believe to be brain damage in their children as a result of a vaccine as scaremongering <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at once that i greatly enjoyed and indeed agreed with the speech of the noble lord lord ennals every bit to the extent to which i have agreed with his speech on the previous three occasions on which he has made it <e> <s> i do not for a moment say that in any sense of criticism <e> <s> i say it merely in order to underline a point which is clearly apparent that debates on the state of the national health service have now become frequent and regular events in your lordships house and they have done so for the very good reason that they are necessary <e> <s> indeed it is necessary to say the things that the noble lord lord ennals has said and in fact it is necessary for them to be said over and over again <e> <s> perhaps i have reminded your lordships before of the lines from lewis carroll in i think <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the noble lord if he was endeavouring to create a new precedent by declining to answer the first three questions of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby on the grounds that he suspected that the noble lord knew the answers <e> <s> is it not a fact that we would not dream of asking questions unless we knew the answers and that we should not like a precedent of that kind to be established <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord responds may i ask the minister to elaborate further <e> <s> am i to understand that if noble lords can think of bodies which ought to be included on the merits of their own case a means will be found of amending the schedule <e> <s> surely we should not make amendments to the schedule without first deleting the sub-paragraphs referred to in the amendment of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his careful thoughtful and considered reply <e> <s> however i am bound to say to him that i do not regard it as altogether satisfactory <e> <s> he has explained that there is a procedure whereby this hurdle can be overcome <e> <s> there is a procedure only because the hurdle exists <e> <s> the noble lord explained the procedure <e> <s> an aggrieved person writes to a member of your lordships house and that member decides that it is a case where clearly there has been maladministration and that the most simple remedy for this person is to take the matter to the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> if he then sends the case himself to the parliamentary commissioner there is a procedure because the parliamentary commissioner has to write back and say that he is very sorry but he is not allowed to take complaints direct from a member of the house of lords only from a member of the house of commons <e> <s> then having informed the member of that he perhaps writes to a member of the house of commons to suggest that he puts the case <e> <s> of course there is a procedure <e> <s> the procedure has been devised by time because of the existence of this constraint <e> <s> my argument is that the constraint need not necessarily exist <e>", "<cs> i have no wish to prolong the discussion but from this bench i should like to confirm every word which the noble and learned lord has said regarding the debates and discussions in in which i too took part <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that the considerations which led another place at that time to take this decision are no longer valid <e> <s> it was taken because of the fears of what might happen rather than what has actually happened and because of feelings about the rights of mps <e> <s> the fear was that as a member one was suddenly going to be bypassed <e> <s> i believe the objections to this procedure advanced at that time are certainly not valid now and would not be advanced now were the bill to be brought in in a new situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly privileged tonight in that it falls to me to fulfil the very pleasant and welcome task of congratulating the noble lord lord trafford on his truly excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i assure him that i take pleasure in doing this <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty for noble lords like myself who have no connection with any branch of the legal profession is that the bill is drafted in such an indefinite way that we have no knowledge whatever of the manner in which the secretary of state will exercise his discretion or indeed about the procedures which will be adopted <e> <s> the noble earl in his reply to an earlier amendment made it quite clear that the secretary of state does have a discretion <e> <s> however in a very curious answer in reply to amendment no <e> <s> when the noble lord lord mishcon asked what was meant by the word theoretically the noble earl replied that it meant that the secretary of state had a discretion to do certain things in theory but in practice he would never do them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl a question before he sits down <e> <s> are there any circumstances in which the home secretary would be prepared to look at a case again or will it be that once he has made his judgment that will be his judgment for all time <e> <s> it is utterly final <e> <s> would he be prepared to look again at a case in which a person feels aggrieved <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lords lord graham and lord henderson for bringing forward this amendment for a number of reasons <e> <s> like the noble lord lord henderson i listened to the speech of my noble friend lord meston at an earlier stage of the bill and i was much moved by the matters he described to us as indeed i think were a number of your lordships in all parts of the chamber <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that my noble friends on these benches would all wish to see the adoption of an amendment like this or of one of the courses of action which have been referred to by the noble lord lord henderson because we believe that this is something which should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords there seems to be a certain irony in the fact that we are devoting these last hours of a dying parliament to debating what is perhaps the most important issue of all facing this nation and the world today <e> <s> we should all be deeply indebted to my noble friend lady stedman for enabling us so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house whether all disputes about pensions and other employment rights regarding former employees of royal ordnance factories and there were some about which the noble lord told us are now settled <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord told the house that the intended purchasers have undertaken to maintain the newspaper in its present form <e> <s> will he tell the house what powers he will have to intervene if that undertaking is not fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it is damaging to the prestige of parliament if a bill debated at great length in both houses finally receives royal assent and then nothing appears to happen to the beneficiaries under the act <e> <s> is it not unfortunate that this nearly always happens in relation to the disabled or the mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords may i respectfully ask the noble lord to reconsider his use of the word malpractice when replying to his noble and learned friend in relation to doctors <e> <s> surely malpractice is not what he meant when we are talking about faulty methodology <e> <s> will the noble lord consider that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the thanks of the noble lord lord orr-ewing to the noble lord lord chalfont for introducing this interesting and important subject <e> <s> indeed by putting his unstarred question in the manner in which he has done the noble lord lord chalfont had done us another service <e> <s> he had demonstrated beyond all possible doubt that the fact that a noble lord sits on the cross-benches should not be taken to indicate that he is impartial nor should it indicate that somehow the noble lord should be placed somewhere in the middle of the political road <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i say that from what i have heard him say on this occasion and on many others it seems to me that he belongs to the authoritarian wing of politics of which i am sure noble lords will accept there are two one at each extreme of the political spectrum <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course i entirely support <e> <s> i understand the terms of its licence and i endorse that fully <e> <s> the bbc must not have an editorial view and must not express one <e> <s> i note what the noble lord said about what the bbc is reputed to have said about apartheid <e> <s> it is right that these criticisms should be made <e> <s> that is part of the price of the freedom of our broadcasting institutions <e> <s> it is right that the bbc and the independent broadcasting authority should listen to these criticisms and consider them carefully <e> <s> i think that the bbc has considered many of these criticisms carefully and has answered them <e> <s> i would say this <e> <s> when this kind of criticism is made in one or other of the two houses of parliament the broadcasting authorities should listen but i hope they will not automatically support what is said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e> <s> would this difficulty not arise from the attempt to balance the programme within an individual programme rather than present perhaps several different unbalanced programmes <e> <s> the kind of thing that the noble lord lord chalfont objected to <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely say briefly that i am wholly in support of this order and would not wish to see it amended in any way at all <e> <s> i should like to feel that in saying that i am speaking for every one of my noble friends on these benches but the subject being as it is i am bound to say that there may be one or two of my noble friends who are still not convinced that this wholly safe and very beneficial public health measure is desirable <e> <s> there are still some who have to be persuaded <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord trafford has implied in a truly splendid speech there is nothing more important to the nation than the health of our children <e> <s> indeed it is upon our childrens health and incidentally upon their education that our social future depends <e> <s> we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord lovell-davis for giving us an opportunity to discuss the matter even though he exceeded his time by seven minutes for which the rest of us will do our best to make amends <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord intend to answer my specific question about the statement made by the noble baroness lady trumpington with regard to the new acellular pertussis vaccine developed at porton down which he told the house was ready for clinical trials <e> <s> have the clinical trials taken place and when will that vaccine be available for general use <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that these matters are constantly kept under review in the light of advice from the world health organisation about which infection is present where and when <e> <s> this means that the advice has to change very frequently <e> <s> can the noble lord say how often the leaflet he has described which is very helpful is revised and how often new editions are produced <e>", "<cs> my lords are there not two vital questions which the department must answer <e> <s> knowing that patients suffering from haemophilia were treated with blood products infected with the aids virus must we not first know whether the government were aware that the products were infected at the time and if the government were not aware should they have been aware <e> <s> if the answer to those two questions is yes do the government not have a moral as well as a legal responsibility to compensate the victims <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord can answer one short and specific question <e> <s> have all stocks of blood products which may have been contaminated with the aids virus now been destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak to your lordships today under the handicap of the tail-end of a particularly nasty cold <e> <s> i mention that fact for three reasons first as evidence of the total inability of my profession of medicine to deal effectively with certain ailments secondly to show that doctors are just as delighted to discuss their own ailments as anybody else and thirdly so that noble lords will understand if i do not achieve the degree of audibility that i should wish <e> <s> i say at once to the noble lord lord willis that i have not taken a single tablet <e> <s> i agree with him that the nation has become too dependent on remedies and particularly on a tablet as being a <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the fact that i in a professional capacity have had occasion to send several noble lords to the westminster hospital and i am delighted to see two of them here today fully restored to health and vigour <e> <s> in those circumstances does not the noble earl accept that any closure of the westminster hospital will have very serious consequences for your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i make clear that noble lords on these benches are totally united on this point if not on all other points which perhaps we are <e> <s> i should also make it clear that doctors in your lordships house the noble lord lord trafford has just spoken are united on at least one aspect of the matter that is that an intimate search of this kind is a desperately humiliating experience for the person who is subjected to it and something about which your lordships house should think very carefully indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord ezra made absolutely clear in his admirable opening speech this is a matter of the utmost importance <e> <s> however i hope that my noble friend will not misunderstand me if i say that i think that sometimes we attach too much importance to the basic question underlying this issue that is the question of nationalisation or privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble lord for repeating this important statement <e> <s> perhaps we may also say how very glad we are to see the white paper at long last <e> <s> i think we have been waiting for it longer than whoever it was waited for godot <e>", "<cs> my lords irrespective of the validity of the question asked by the noble and learned lord lord denning is it not a fact that irreversible brain damage is so high a price to pay for compensation of whatever magnitude that it is inconceivable that anyone would willingly seek enrichment via that route <e> <s> does it not follow that the most urgent matter is not a reduction of damages but to limit the number of cases occurring <e> <s> can we not make a start by expediting the introduction of the new wholly safe acellular whooping cough vaccine so as to eliminate cases of irreversible brain damage arising from that source <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord will know a case concerning such damage is currently before the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord aware that as far back as the time when the chancellor of the exchequer was mr barber this integrated system was announced as conservative party policy <e> <s> the then chancellor decided that was not the time at which he could introduce it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not high time that we looked closely at the problem of living accommodation for nurses bearing in mind the number of occasions on which nurses are attacked on the streets on their way to duty during unsocial hours <e> <s> is the minister aware that on a number of occasions when a london teaching hospital sought to appoint somebody from the provinces to a senior nursing post that person male or female has had to turn the post down because he or she cannot find affordable accommodation <e> <s> should we not make an effort to restore some of the nurses homes which i believe were sold off or used for other purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> in asking my question perhaps i may claim the indulgence of the house and apologise most humbly for having very stupidly and inexcusably overlooked the fact that my question which i ask every two years has this time been overtaken by events the nature of which the minister has very kindly undertaken to explain when he answers my question in its proper form <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that answer <e> <s> having asked the same question so many times i expected the same answer <e> <s> this time i was given a better answer and i am most grateful to the minister for what he said about the glasses <e> <s> is the minister aware that the trading standards officers are at present embarking on a nation-wide survey to discover the precise extent by which beer drinkers are defrauded through short measure <e> <s> the present estimate is that this amounts to about million a year <e> <s> if that is the case is it not really time that something was done <e>", "<cs> must we go on my lords serving beer by the so-called brimful measure whereby it either pours over the side or is sold in short measure <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are not to be moved by the pleas of beer drinkers will they listen to those of the customs and excise officers who believe that as duty is collected from customers on non-existent beer and is not subsequently paid to the revenue it is the customs and excise department that is being defrauded as well as beer drinkers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister is yet in a position to tell the house how many patients who have been discharged from hospitals such as this under the closure programme have subsequently had to be re-admitted to others <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the most worrying aspect of this statement which all of us welcome as my noble friend lord kilmarnock said that what has recently been happening in the national health service appears to have taken the government by surprise to such an extent that they are now establishing a new monitoring system i welcome that so that they will not be taken by surprise in the future <e> <s> how does the minister equate that with the fact that what has been happening in the health service recently is precisely what those working in it have been telling the government was bound to happen <e> <s> i plead most earnestly that ministers will listen more carefully to what they are told by the people who work in the health service and in particular by the nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house whether we yet have an influenza vaccine which is claimed to confer immunity against all strains of the virus <e> <s> he said that the vaccine is recommended only for at-risk groups <e> <s> does he realize <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the various steps which the noble earl has announced to the house <e> <s> can he say whether efforts will be made and urgently made to ensure that local authorities social services departments work much more closely with general practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that over the years adas officers have done invaluable work in helping to resolve conflicts between those who live and work in the countryside and those who visit the countryside for recreational purposes <e> <s> does she agree that it is imperative that that work continues and will she assure the house that it will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords over recent years your lordships house has debated this subject on many occasions <e> <s> i am sure i am right in saying that every one of those debates has shown a degree of understanding of a very difficult problem a grasp of complex figures and facts that one would not find in any other forum anywhere <e> <s> that is to be expected in your lordships house where we show a degree of understanding and an awareness of issues which is not common elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i was somewhat puzzled to hear him say that the information given to him by the right reverend prelate took him by surprise because i gave precisely the same information in correspondence to the noble lords predecessor some months ago <e> <s> would he care to look at that correspondence in the light of what has taken place <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he was seriously telling the committee that the words he quoted from the conservative party manifesto for the last general election actually meant and were intended to mean that child benefits would not be uprated <e> <s> if that was their intention then why did the party opposite not make that clear <e> <s> it would have been very simple and much more honest <e>", "<cs> my lords has the attention of the noble earl or that of his ministerial colleagues been drawn to the anomaly arising from the repayment of some of this money whereby a person receiving benefits on two books has received two amounts of that is whereas a person receiving the same benefit on one book has received only <e> <s> if the noble earl is aware of that anomaly will he kindly do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry to press the noble earl but i believe that he may have read out the wrong answer to my question <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the noble earl of what i actually asked why was it that a person receiving certain benefits on two books received whereas another person receiving precisely the same benefits on one book received only <e>", "<cs> my lords while the national health service would welcome additional funds from any source i ask the minister to ponder very carefully the advisability of appearing to give government or nhs approval to gambling which some of us believe is as potentially damaging to the citizen and indeed to society as other forms of addiction <e> <s> will he also bear in mind the possibility of the thin end of a rather large wedge <e> <s> this could lead to the installation of fruit machines in hospitals and doctors waiting rooms <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome the statement that the noble lord made in his original <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that some of us worry not so much about whether there is adequate runway space at the end of the century but whether there is enough space at the end of the runway <e> <s> could that anxiety be kept at the forefront of the minds of those who are dealing with these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the beds that have already been lost from the duchess of yorks hospital for babies in manchester does the minister accept that it would be highly undesirable for any further beds for premature babies to be lost from st marys hospital manchester <e> <s> can he give the house an assurance that there will always be beds for premature babies in the manchester area when needed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that babies who are born prematurely have already demonstrated a commendable lack of interest in waiting lists <e> <s> we need an assurance that there will always be beds available somewhere in the manchester area for premature babies who need hospital treatment <e> <s> can he give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual i enjoyed the speech of the noble lord lord beloff and as usual i disagreed with much of it <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i say that i rather regret that he did not use this occasion to develop further the very interesting ideas which he expressed to your lordships house on an earlier occasion regarding the restoration of some form of parliamentary control over essential services when those services are by their very nature a monopoly <e> <s> that would have been highly relevant today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a simple and more direct question <e> <s> since the government have made clear that they are not in favour of sanctions against south africa are the government in favour of the breach of sanctions applied by others <e>", "<cs> my lords irrespective of the merits or otherwise of this programme is the noble earl aware that many of us are of the opinion that her majestys government have made too many recommendations to the bbc regarding programmes and we have no wish at all for them to add to that number <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask all noble lords in all parts of the house not to underestimate for a moment the seriousness of the message which would go out from this house if we failed to insist on this amendment <e> <s> that message would be precisely the opposite of the message which the noble baroness lady blatch has just given <e> <s> we must insist on a very reasonable amendment <e> <s> i say reasonable because it is an enabling measure and not mandatory <e> <s> it deals with a code of practice which is advisory and not mandatory <e> <s> it merely enables local government to do things whch all of us think it ought to be doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given the date of st june which i warmly welcome but it is earlier than the date of july given previously by the minister <e> <s> does that mean that the minister is assuming that the health and medicines bill will have passed through its various stages in this house <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that the regulations depend on that bill being enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is inevitable that in a debate on this subject at this time so eloquently opened by the noble lord lord ennals we should appear to be preoccupied with funding <e> <s> the minister tempted us to remain on that road <e> <s> i accept the figures that he gave us with regard to existing funding and i was delighted to hear the hint which he appeared to give about possible additional funding in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recollect that in a recent discussion on this subject on a question asked by the noble baroness lady cox he gave some very encouraging information about the provision of affordable living accommodation for nurses <e> <s> as i am always anxious to afford ministers an opportunity to give good news can he tell us anything else about developments on that front <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that by definition premature babies are patients who cannot be put on waiting lists <e> <s> is it not clear from the figures which the minister has given to the house that there has been a net reduction in the number of beds for premature babies in the manchester area <e> <s> added to the loss of such beds <e>", "<cs> my lords without troubling the noble viscount with questions about how long our stocks of coal or oil will last may i ask him whether he accepts that our energy resources are finite which means that sooner or later they will run out <e> <s> if he accepts that does he agree that it behoves us to do two things first to husband those sources of energy that we now have with much greater care than we do and secondly to pioneer and develop alternative sources <e> <s> is this alternative source to which the noble lord lord rodney has referred one that is much neglected <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in expressing our profound regret at the loss of lady lane-fox whose courage and cheerfulness were an example to us all able-bodied and disabled alike <e> <s> her expertise was invaluable and will be sadly missed as indeed will she herself <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to underline the importance of this issue is the noble earl aware that i have been in touch with the department about two tragic cases <e> <s> one is that of a young man who committed suicide on the eve of his discharge from hospital because he was so frightened by the prospect before him <e> <s> the other case is that of a social worker who was murdered by a patient who had been discharged into the community under the scheme <e> <s> not having had the griffiths report before we started the hospital closures may i ask whether further closures can be halted until the recommendations of sir roy and others are enforced <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can tell the house how many people have forfeited housing benefit as a result of having -worth of shares <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i find myself in some difficulty in one of your lordships debates <e> <s> i was delighted when i learned that the noble lord lord hunter of newington was to introduce this debate <e> <s> it is indeed a subject of immense importance <e> <s> it is one in which i have a very deep interest and in which i have had some professional involvement throughout my professional life <e> <s> indeed there are those who may remember that over years ago i made my maiden speech in your lordships house on a related subject it was on water supplies hygiene and sanitation <e> <s> at that time i said and i repeat now that plumbers and sanitary engineers together have done more for the public health than all the doctors put together <e> <s> i adhere to that statement <e> <s> it will therefore be clear that i attach very great importance indeed to the work of those in the field of public health <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the chairman of this committee of inquiry will accept that any criticisms of his report are criticisms for which he must take some responsibility <e> <s> however the chairman of this committee of inquiry must accept some of the credit for the very wise advice that is also given in the report <e> <s> i am sure that sir donald will not quarrel with what we have said about the use of english in this report <e> <s> perhaps it is the nature of the subject which from the point of view of language tends to make it less interesting than other reports <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think he stopped asking for it to be broken up but i should be delighted to hear that he is now asking for it to be broken up because i think that would <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know which points i am wrong on <e> <s> the noble lord will be speaking later and i hope that he may say that he would regard it as an advantage for this ministry to be broken up and for the functions of social security pensions and national insurance to be taken away into a separate department as they used to be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the further considerations to which the noble lord has referred include the possibility of having a fixed date for easter a matter which my noble friend lord airedale raises every year and has raised for the past years to my knowledge <e> <s> is that still an open question or has it been closed by any one of the churches <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the leader of the house in an earlier intervention made comments with regard to the groupings <e>", "<cs> in the very long list of amendments which are grouped together is my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it merely seeks to require the bill to state that somewhere in the school timetable there shall be provision for some instruction in the essentials of first aid and accident prevention <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment he referred to the many hours which have been spent discussing this matter and for lack of progress he thought the prize should go to the civil servants who supplied the answers <e> <s> i suggest that the second prize should perhaps go to those who were responsible for the grouping of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many things that i should like to say on this subject but i shall try to discipline myself if only because i am very anxious that the attention of the minister should not be deflected from the very important points put to him by my noble friend lord banks and by the noble baroness lady turner <e> <s> i hope that he will answer all of those points <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the scheme operated by the criminal injuries compensation board to which the noble earl referred can he tell the house whether the funds available to that board are at present adequate to meet the claims being made upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the members of your lordships house who is not infrequently called upon to give medical advice to noble lords perhaps i may take the liberty of asking the noble lord the chief whip one question <e> <s> whenever there are rumours of an epidemic it is remarkable how soon certain people begin to feel that they are suffering from the condition <e> <s> it is interesting to note that last night when the debate went on a long time a number of noble lords felt unwell and believed it necessary to go home <e> <s> i emphasise that not many of those noble lords have been suffering from the condition <e> <s> it is clear from the statement that we have not yet identified the point in the food chain at which this infection has been introduced <e> <s> it can be at any stage <e> <s> it may well be outside the house and connected with the supply of some food or liquid <e> <s> i am sure that the professional people who are studying this matter will sooner or later identify the source of this infection <e> <s> when we have that knowledge it would be helpful if the noble lord would give it to the house <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lords words appeared to suggest that he regarded the present position in universities and other colleges of higher education as regards the provision of facilities for disabled students as entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i have to tell him frankly that such is not the case <e> <s> it is patchy and varies <e> <s> i have studied the provisions in various universities <e> <s> in some of them they are truly excellent in the main because those universities have realised that in future they may be short of students because of the demographic changes which are expected to come along <e> <s> they have found that many of the disabled students are extremely good students who are very successful <e> <s> in their own interests many universities have gone to great lengths to provide access in the way referred to by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm whether it is true as has been reported that if a severely disabled person employs someone living in for the sole purpose of enabling the disabled person to live independently and if that employee subsequently has to pay the community charge the fund will regard such an arrangement as a legitimate ground for a claim <e> <s> if that is true will he assure the house that adequate funds will be made available for that laudable purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord basnett is to be congratulated on bringing forward for debate a subject of such immense importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the noble lords argument all of which i support <e> <s> i am also interested in the question that he has just put to the minister <e> <s> but i hope that in elaborating his argument the noble lord will bear in mind that the difficulty is that the catchment area of some of the large institutions which are to be closed is so wide that one does not know to which community discharged patients will actually go <e> <s> they do not all go to one community or to the immediate locality of the hospital <e> <s> if they did things would be much simpler <e> <s> but what one does find is that as a hospital closes so some of the long-term patients go to far flung parts of the country in very different areas altogether <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds and decides what course to take i should like to ask the minister to explain a little more fully what he has just said <e> <s> i listened most carefully and tried to understand him <e> <s> he will know as will all members of the committee that people go into hospital for very <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to wind up this debate from these benches i should like to say at once that i am delighted that the noble lord lord plunket paid tribute to the bbcs world service <e> <s> i think we all believe that that service exemplifies all that is best in the bbc and seldom shows any of the things which are perhaps less good <e> <s> perhaps i could <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by following the example of the noble lord lord ennals with an apology <e> <s> shortly before i entered the chamber i discovered that i had left my diary in somebody elses office about two miles away <e> <s> i am paralysed if not actually speechless without my diary and i hope that noble lords will understand if i absent myself briefly during the course of the debate to retrieve it <e> <s> i hope that it will be accepted by those noble lords of whose speeches i shall be deprived the pleasure of hearing that no disrespect is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that in the past often acute hospital beds were blocked by patients ready for discharge merely because their relatives were unwilling to receive them <e> <s> is it not even worse that acute beds in hospitals like stoke mandeville should be occupied by <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell the house what part his right honourable friend mr tebbit is playing in national bike week <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord prys-davies has already said the thanks of the house are due to the noble lord lord nelson of stafford for introducing this very important debate and to the noble lord and his colleagues a bakers dozen for preparing such a thought-provoking very carefully researched report into a very vital subject <e> <s> i cannot wholly agree with the noble lord lord prys-davies in saying that the report should have anticipated some of the objections to some of its proposals <e> <s> i think that there will be many <e> <s> but that it is the job of the civil service <e> <s> every civil servant is trained to find a difficulty for every solution and i am quite sure that the civil service will find plenty of difficulties for these solutions <e> <s> i do not think that they need any help from your lordships select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in assuming that the ec has already designated this year as child safety year <e> <s> if that is so should we not do something before this year is over <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for informing me and the house that this matter is still under consideration and also that the government have not yet made up their mind <e> <s> i should not like to do anything at all to force the government to make up their mind here and now perhaps in the wrong way <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that what really matters is not so much the precise number of beds in a particular hospital on a particular day but whether a bed is always available for the receipt of an acute case whenever a general practitioner wishes to send one in <e> <s> does he recall that in the old days of the municipal hospitals resident medical officers of which i was one were not allowed to refuse a case when a doctor wished to send one in <e> <s> they had somehow to find room for that case and always managed it <e> <s> similarly in the out-patients departments before the appointments system the consultant or his registrar saw every case on the day on which that case was sent to the hospital <e> <s> that meant that some of those patients had to wait five to seven hours but some of us think that that is better than their having to wait five six or seven months as happens now <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make it clear that the group of amendments proposed by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has widespread support <e> <s> perhaps i may associate my noble friends on these benches with the amendment <e> <s> we think that the provision is essential <e> <s> those of us who work closely with people who have various different forms of handicap to all of which the noble lord lord allen <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether in continuing its overall responsibility for broadcasting the home office will continue the policies developed by the noble viscount lord whitelaw of keeping programme standards as the first priority <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble earl for repeating the important and complex statement <e> <s> he will understand that some of us need more time to study the statement with care before reaching final conclusions <e> <s> i do not propose to divide my response to the statement into four parts as did the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i should like to deal with it as a whole <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the noble lord lord ennals in his amendment despite the fact that were it to be carried as i hope it will be i should not be able to move my subsequent amendments nos <e> <s> and which are designed to introduce certain safeguards were we to go ahead with privatising the general practice finance corporation <e> <s> i concur entirely with the noble lord lord ennals as no doubt will other noble lords in all parts of the committee on the importance of general practice and its being conducted on premises which are wholly adequate and fully staffed <e> <s> the staffing complement of a general practice is in many ways closely related to the adequacy of the premises used <e>", "<cs> i cannot wholly agree with the noble lord lord trafford that the matters we are discussing refer merely to the transitional stage <e>", "<cs> as the minister has intervened may i ask him to go a little further <e> <s> earlier he told us that arrangements have already been completed for nominations to the board of the new company to be made by the general medical services committee <e> <s> is that in the future or purely in the transitional period <e>", "<cs> i listened to both the minister and the noble lord lord trafford and i absorbed what they said but i have a suspicion that whatever is introduced for an interim period tends to remain when the interim period is over <e> <s> i can give many examples where that has happened in regard to other matters and i see no special reason why normal procedures should suddenly be departed from in this respect <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the ministers earlier reply was that the situation which i should like to see under the amendment is in fact wholly covered with regard to the interim stage it already happens <e> <s> but we are anxious to ensure that it happens in the future <e> <s> indeed i am quite sure that the noble lord lord nugent of guildford is also anxious to ensure <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for those final words <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fear that the judgment of the noble lord <e> <s> lord trafford on this matter may have been clouded by the fact that he has enjoyed an entirely satisfactory contractual arrangement with the dhss for many years <e> <s> he is apparently entirely content that the department will make no improper use of these particular powers and that we need have no fears at all <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have that reassurance from the noble lord lord trafford but i would prefer to hear precisely the same words coming from the minister <e> <s> we have not had those words yet <e> <s> it may well be that our fears are groundless <e> <s> my own personal anxiety i am associated with one of these amendments and i ventilated it in a recent debate in your lordships house on priorities in medical research is that if <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the discussion on this amendment <e> <s> however i should like to say that it seems to me that paragraph g is very wide it could not possibly be wider <e> <s> it virtually empowers the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> is it the noble lords advice that we should all wear belt and braces <e>", "<cs> the noble lord appears to agree with every word that i have said <e> <s> he said that they were different bodies and appeared to suggest that they should not be subject to directions in this way <e> <s> does he agree with the amendment <e> <s> i shall be delighted to have consultations with him at any time <e>", "<cs> if the amendment is unnecessary because the clause does not cover community health councils i shall be much happier <e> <s> however i do not necessarily feel deprived of the right to have consultations about the matter with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> in the light of that further explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to say that we are most grateful to the noble lord for bringing forward the amendments <e> <s> we believe that they are helpful and we support them <e>", "<cs> i had overlooked and now note that my amendments nos <e> <s> and are grouped with this amendment which we are now considering <e> <s> i have no doubt that when the minister replies he will also reply to my amendments and therefore i should perhaps say a few brief words about them <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied <e> <s> at such time as i am not satisfied with the conditions in the national health service i would not divert resources to other activities <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> i believe that it is proper for the secretary of state to use resources for other purposes when he is so satisfied but it is not proper when he is not so satisfied <e> <s> i am not satisfied at the moment <e> <s> i should not make use of these powers at the moment were i the secretary of state <e> <s> that appears to be unlikely but perhaps i may hasten to say that i should not necessarily reject the appointment should it happen to be offered <e>", "<cs> on the same point and a related one the noble lord explained that the secretary of state must be satisfied in regard to the national health service in various ways before he authorises certain things <e> <s> my amendment provides for the situation when the secretary of state ceases to be so satisfied <e> <s> it enables him to revoke a previous authorisation <e> <s> can the minister say something about that <e> <s> i am sure he believes that to be desirable and that an authorisation should not be in perpetuity <e> <s> the secretary of state should have the power to revoke an authorisation if the situation relating to the national health service should change <e>", "<cs> does that mean continuously and that if the situation changes his decision will change <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friends on these benches or those noble friends who will he on these benches if required i should like to join with the noble lord lord ennals in supporting the noble lord <e> <s> lord wallace of coslany on this amendment <e>

merely say that whoever is the government of the particular day whether it is the government of the noble lord lord ennals or anybody else whatever is done by the state there will always be gaps <e> <s> it is my experience of medical life that some of those gaps can only be filled by voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> i share the point of the view of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i welcome what the minister has said and agree with much of it <e> <s> however he seemed to find a difficulty in every solution <e>", "<cs> i am not seeking any opportunity to differ with the noble lord lord ennals simply to demonstrate that i sit in a different part of the chamber <e> <s> however i have some differences with him as regards the amendment <e> <s> i shall comment on the points raised by the noble lord lord trafford in a moment <e>", "<cs> jolly good <e> <s> i am glad to hear that <e> <s> the noble lord lord trafford is right in saying that we have too many committees <e> <s> however he said that the matter should be left to local <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friends on these benches and i am sure that noble lords will have noticed that the number has now doubled i should like to add support to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord colwyn <e> <s> the amendment will go some way to repairing some of the damage which may be done by this bill to the dental health of our nation in other ways some way but not necessarily all the way <e> <s> however it is a very important way particularly in so far as it affects our children <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in an earlier answer he gave to the house at the end of a debate he said that the griffiths report together with certain other reports would be examined in the course of the national health service review <e> <s> does the minister accept that by then it will be too late and that certain action is essential here and now namely to ensure that provision for care in the community is in place

gardner <e> <s> speaking on their behalf i wish to say that i agree with every single word she said in a truly excellent and very clear speech in which she explained the purposes of the amendment <e>

can the minister explain the apparent conflict in the argument that he has addressed to the committee <e> <s> he said among other things that the money raised by the charge can go <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lucas would be surprised if i did other than assure him of the full support of my noble friends on these benches <e> <s> he has said that the arguments are the same as those put forward in respect of the earlier amendment <e> <s> substantially they are and i do not wish to repeat them because it is unnecessary <e> <s> they carried weight in the committee and in the division

after in the main by the community nurse as she is now called <e> <s> the nurse would dress the ulcer with whatever it needed to be dressed with and would constantly make changes <e> <s> she would always have to come to me to ask for a prescription for this that or the other <e> <s> she would tell me what she wanted the prescription for and having given her the prescription she would have it made up for the patient <e> <s> then she would apply the different items to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> he has confirmed my suspicions that there is no legal right <e> <s> i thought there might be such a right to the prescription but i knew that in practice however much they argued people could not get the prescription <e> <s> the noble lord has said that there is no legal right and i hope he agrees with me that there should be a legal right <e> <s> the person can then carry the prescription and in an emergency he can obtain the contact lenses <e> <s> the noble lord has promised to look into the matter and i hope that he will do that with a view to remedying the situation because i believe there is a deficiency in the present provisions <e>", "<cs> i am not concerned about the contents of the handbag of the noble lord lord ennals but with regard to the amendment i hope that the minister will look at it sympathetically and realise that there is a deficiency which should be remedied and perhaps will devise a remedy for that situation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may associate myself with those words <e>", "<cs> my lords does that answer mean that the noble lord cannot tell the house whether the estimated figure given by the government will meet the needs <e> <s> will the minister accept that as a result of some of their recent actions the government have done a great deal to improve morale in the nursing profession and the relationship between nurses and the noble lords department <e> <s> will he also accept that to renege on certain promises or to insist on nurses pay being paid at the expense of patient care will be a guaranteed prescription for undoing the good which has recently been done <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say a little more about the effect of the rise in mortgage interest rates on those who have to pay them and in particular on those who have been induced to buy council houses which they cannot really afford <e> <s> can he tell us whether there have been any more tragic cases of council houses being repossessed because of the inability to maintain payments <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl the leader of the house explain the relevance of the international obligations to which he refers to the matters raised by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great care to the noble lord lord trafford as indeed i always do on matters of this kind <e> <s> however it seemed to me that the noble lord disliked the words in paragraph f every bit as much as my noble friend lord russell who tabled this amendment which was so ably moved by the noble lord lord ennals on balance i come down on the side of the deletion of paragraph f rather than on the side of the compromise arrangement which is found in the later amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is the duty of members of your lordships house to go around stirring up unanimity <e> <s> at the same time i am delighted to hear that the noble lord lord colwyn finds the group of amendments acceptable because <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord ennals i have no wish to go over the ground which we covered so thoroughly and satisfactorily on an earlier occasion in committee <e> <s> i merely wish to thank the minister for doing precisely what he said he would do on that occasion <e> <s> he said that the amendment tabled in my name was defective with regard to children and vouchers and that he would amend that at a later stage <e> <s> he has now come forward with an amendment which does precisely that <e> <s> the amendment now brought forward very much resembles the amendment which i tabled originally and which his department advised me to withdraw as it did not do what i had intended <e> <s> the main difference between this amendment and my original one is that this amendment mentions four dioptres where my amendment mentioned five dioptres <e> <s> i have no idea whether that will prove to be a matter of crucial importance but i do not intend to delay the house by exploring that matter now <e> <s> i express my gratitude to the noble lord for what he has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to prolong these very amiable proceedings <e> <s> i am quite sure that all my noble friends on these benches are wholly in support of this new clause <e> <s> we very much hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord ennals replies will the minister answer a question <e> <s> quoting the minister in another place he said that the overwhelming majority of health authorities shared the view as expressed in this new clause <e> <s> my question is what about the small minority who do not <e> <s> the noble lord went on to say that there were means available to deal with backsliders <e> <s> could he give the house an example of a backslider who has been dealt with <e> <s> can he tell us the means that were used to deal with the backslider in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> it would appear that the department has recognised the problem and has done its best to meet it without the necessity for legislation <e> <s> that is achieved by relying on the goodwill and good offices of the general optical council <e>", "<cs> my lords permit me to associate myself and my noble friends on these benches with those remarks <e> <s> we too are delighted that we have proceeded with such expedition <e> <s> we too hope that the noble lord will remain with us while we continue to deal with matters of this kind <e> <s> we have proceeded very rapidly which is most satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be very damaging if a whole series of these tragic cases came before the courts for compensation <e> <s> would not the best way to avoid that happening be for the government to embark rapidly on a satisfactory compensation scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords today we are debating a matter of great complexity but one which is of the utmost importance to each and every one of us <e> <s> therefore we should all be most grateful to the noble earl for giving us the opportunity to debate such flatters <e> <s> i am especially grateful to the noble earl lord cran brook for giving so clear an exposition of the difference between the vienna convention and the montreal protocol matters which previously seemed to me to be somewhat obscure <e> <s> he has certainly clarified the issue for me <e>", "<cs> my lords were i to leap to my feet every time i saw a grammatical error in an amendment i should never be off my feet <e> <s> it occurs to me that in line <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sorry possibly to appear churlish or to be constantly looking gift horses in the mouth <e> <s> however it seems to me that this amendment is in precisely the form in which it was introduced at committee stage by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> at that time the minister in reply produced all manner of difficulties which made the amendment highly undesirable <e> <s> i am delighted that all those difficulties have evaporated but i wonder how they arose <e> <s> it seems to me that civil servants from the moment when they take office from the word go are trained to find a difficulty for every solution <e> <s> i suspect that the difficulties emerge from them <e> <s> we could have been saved much trouble if the noble lord had accepted this amendment at committee stage because it seems precisely the same to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to weary the house by listing any of my remaining minor misgivings about the bill or indeed by listing the many improvements we have made to it <e> <s> i certainly agree very much with the noble lord the minister and with the noble lord lord ennals that we have greatly improved it <e> <s> at this stage i merely express the hope that the bill stays improved and that we are not shortly required to try to improve it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer back to the further injections to which the noble lord lord hatch referred <e> <s> i am advised that such injections may well be antibiotics <e> <s> does the noble earl recollect if he is old enough that many years ago a large number of children were diagnosed as suffering from milk allergy <e> <s> later it was discovered that they were in fact suffering from an allergy to penicillin which had found its way into milk <e> <s> can we <e>", "<cs> my lords in computing the costs of reducing waiting lists we know that the government have computed them recently to provide extra money will consideration be given to the cost to public funds of paying benefits to people who are waiting to go into hospital <e> <s> for example if a manual labourer who is married with four children has to wait and not work for a year until he has his inguinal hernia repaired the cost to public funds must be very great indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of the provision of affordable living accommodation to the recruitment and retention of nurses can the minister tell us of any progress which has been made in the matters about which we were told by the noble lords predecessor concerning the re-establishment of some of the nurses homes which have been taken out of commission and other means of providing affordable living accommodation <e> <s> what progress has been made in the matters about which we were told <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be in the interests of the side of the argument that i support for me merely to repeat arguments which have already been put forward by noble lords in every single part of the house <e> <s> i feel sure that those arguments have already convinced every noble lord in your lordships house even those who voted against the suggestion <e> <s> the argument was won <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody could overemphasise the importance of this subject nor could we sufficiently underline the topicality of the <e>", "<cs> my lords were it not for the presence of the name of the noble lord lord ardwick below my name on the speakers list we would now be scraping at the very bottom of the bottomless pit of expertise in your lordships house to which the noble earl referred in his truly excellent opening speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are deeply impressed by the extremely high quality of the report by mr fennell into these matters <e> <s> will he also accept that an escalating problem facing london underground is that there are too many people in london <e> <s> i should be interested to hear whether the noble lord has any suggestions as to how we could deal with that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house what makes her think that the museums association will take note of the wise words of her noble friend lord renton about the treasures hidden away in the cellars of so many <e>", "<cs> my lords in joining with the noble baroness in pressing for a second statutory marine nature reserve i ask the noble earl by what means he hopes to keep out of the existing marine nature reserve the vast quantities of raw untreated sewage that are pumped into our seas around the british coast every day <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it is something of a paradox that on the one hand we designate an area as a statutory marine nature reserve and on the other we allow the water that flows into that nature reserve to be polluted by untreated sewage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that if the most modern hearing aid the type of hearing aid which is in the greatest demand by people with hearing difficulties were available in the national health service hearing aid clinics people would be much less dependent on the private sector <e> <s> will the noble lord have a word with his right honourable friend and tell him that it is time that we looked again at the range of hearing aids available under the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble and learned lord explain why the government have appointed a noble lord who is years of age to be vice-chairman of the broadcasting commission whereas members of the independent broadcasting authority are obliged to retire at the age of <e> <s> is that anomalous <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord inform the house of the extent to which the london boroughs of bexley and lewisham have already carried out the recommendations of mr spokess report to which reference was made in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the noble lord lord butterfield speak on many occasions before i was greatly looking forward to his maiden speech <e> <s> i was not disappointed <e> <s> our house will be enriched by his presence and i very much look forward to hearing him speak on many occasions in the future <e> <s> incidentally in addition to enjoying the noble lords maiden speech i also agreed with a great deal of it which is not quite the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i too wish to thank the noble lord for repeating this extremely cleverly worded though nonetheless disquieting statement <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will accept that along with other noble lords i do not approve of long speeches on statements <e> <s> i have no intention of making a long speech <e> <s> but i ask the noble lord to accept that many noble lords on these benches <e> <s> and i am sure in all parts of your lordships house will wish at some stage to speak at some length on many of the matters itemised by the noble lord lord ennals <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i also may congratulate the noble lord on his new appointment <e> <s> i hope that this will not be the last occasion on which he will answer health questions in your lordships house <e> <s> he has acquired an expertise in that sphere and it would be regrettable if he were snatched from us <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to say how sorry i am that owing to illness the noble baroness lady nicol has not been able to open the debate <e> <s> nevertheless i am delighted that the noble lord the leader of the opposition lord cledwyn has found it possible to open the debate himself <e> <s> he did so with great expertise and with his vast experience not only as a former secretary of state for wales in which capacity he was close to the dreadful abcrfan disaster but also as a distinguished and able minister of agriculture <e> <s> he will know that as regards pollution the minister of agriculture is at the moment in a very hot seat indeed <e> <s> it is a relevant area of experience <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recollect that when he was a boy at school the government of whatever political flavour they happened to be actively encouraged saving schemes in every school in the country <e> <s> should not the savings habit start in schools <e> <s> are we right to assume that the government seem to have lost interest in such campaigns and activities <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept that some of us would find his statement that no further legislation is contemplated a little more acceptable if the existing legislation were adequately enforced <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recollect that in the years immediately before the war there was an annual event in the calendar known as national rat week <e> <s> will the noble earl look into the history of that event and see whether it is time that it was revived <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by apologising to your lordships for addressing the house with an appalling cold for which neither the national health service nor the private sector can do anything at all <e> <s> i mention that fact to demonstrate that doctors are as delighted as anyone else to discuss their own ailments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely aware that much of the work of costing operations has been going on <e> <s> indeed i have taken part in some <e> <s> but the question i asked specifically and perhaps i could repeat it if the noble lord did not fully understand it was in costing an inguinal hernia does one include in that cost the amount of public money spent in keeping the wife and family of the person who has been waiting two years for the operation <e> <s> that was the point i made <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to underline and endorse the words of the noble lord lord kimball about our present dependence on the veterinary profession the very real anxieties about recruitment to that profession and the position of the veterinary schools <e> <s> i too hope that the noble lord will receive sympathetic and reassuring responses to those points from the noble baroness when she replies to the debate <e>", "<cs> i understand the objections put forward to this amendment by the noble earl but i should like to say to him and to the committee that if this amendment or one similar is not accepted it will be inevitable that those clubs who have these special family enclosures i know a number of them will abandon them <e> <s> how else can they maintain and operate them <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to create difficulties at this late stage <e> <s> i have always understood the word guest to imply someone who does not pay <e> <s> it is my clear knowledge that many football clubs make a great deal of money out of school parties <e> <s> if they are suddenly to be told that school parties are guests some will have second thoughts and say that they are not guests but must pay in the same way as everyone else <e>", "<cs> i welcome what the noble lord said in response to the point made by my noble friend about the possible confiscation of cards by a steward and so on <e> <s> indeed i think that what he said is most reassuring <e> <s> however the noble lord said in his earlier answer that the government had no intention of requiring or demanding the inspection of these cards other than inside the football ground or outside the football ground in other words other than in connection with a football match <e> <s> i heard the noble lord say that but where does it appear in the bill <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl in a position to tell the committee whether the penalty of imprisonment is available to the courts in respect of directors of a football club found to be in breach of the fire or safety regulations <e> <s> that is a much more serious breach yet i believe that when the noble earl looks into the matter he will find that imprisonment is not available in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> i wonder how we can possibly come to an agreement in the way the noble lord has said <e> <s> i warmly welcome what the noble lord has said <e> <s> this is a special case it must be looked at as a special case <e> <s> the fma will be asked to look at it and perhaps come forward with a scheme <e> <s> that i welcome <e> <s> but we will never see that scheme so how can we come to an agreement <e> <s> we are being asked to withdraw this amendment because clearly it cannot be applied to wembley <e> <s> the fma is to be asked to devise a scheme which it will submit to the <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us are concerned about access to forestry commission land for recreational purposes <e> <s> where further forestry commission land-holdings are privatised if that is the correct word and there has been access to that land in the past will that access continue <e> <s> that has been the governments policy in the past <e> <s> can we have an assurance that it will continue to be their policy <e>", "<cs> my lords since it is established that the damage to the ozone layer by refrigeration gases occurs only when refrigerators are broken up instead of advising people not to buy new fridges would it not be more sensible to prohibit the breaking up of old ones <e> <s> more specifically can the noble lord tell us what facilities exist in britain for the recovery and possible neutralisation of those gases <e> <s> further will he put information in the library as to where those facilities exist in different parts of britain <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return briefly to the point that my noble friend was endeavouring to make having spoken before he was halted rightly i think in his tracks because he had already spoken and this is report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make one point on the amendment which has not yet been made although it may have been referred to in the earlier discussion at the committee stage <e> <s> there is no doubt in my mind that the administration the operation and mechanics of the scheme by the football membership authority when the time comes and the scheme has finally been drafted and <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to understand the governments objection to this amendment and i heard their objection to a similar amendment in committee <e> <s> it seems to me that the purpose of this amendment is to encourage the provision of family enclosures at football grounds <e> <s> that seems to me to be a very helpful development and one which should be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the simplest and perhaps the cheapest way of providing some of the housing that is so desperately needed by the repair and restoration of some of the dilapidated houses that are at present lying empty <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that the resources required for that are merely labour which is plentiful and raw materials which are home produced <e> <s> that would prove no burden whatever on our balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> it is a particular pleasure to do so on a subject on which he feels extremely strongly <e> <s> perhaps i may say to him that he is absolutely right to feel strongly since it is a subject which warrants strong feelings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way in order that i may intervene on her side of this argument <e> <s> i referred to the sad case in which a patient suffering from schizophrenia murdered a social worker <e> <s> therefore let us not go away with the impression that we <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that this is the sixth time during the past four years on which this question or one almost identical to it has appeared on our order paper <e> <s> it is also the sixth time that in response we have received in the main prevarication and soothing words <e> <s> does the minister accept that during those four years of waiting great damage has been done to some of the sites nominated by the nature <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that it is becoming increasingly clear that what is urgently needed is more time <e> <s> if the proposals are introduced without adequate time for discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government wise to try to ride roughshod over two great professions the law and medicine at one and the same time <e> <s> does the noble lord accept that some doctors who are implacably opposed to the white paper nevertheless accept that some of the proposals could prove beneficial to doctors and patients alike provided that they are introduced with care and after proper consultation and in particular after there have been preliminary pilot studies in selected areas to find out how the proposals will work before they are finalised <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that no sensible general practitioner would accept the new contract unless he or she were satisfied as to how and by whom the community care would be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester <e> <s> as he well knows i nearly always agree with what he has to say to us <e> <s> i particularly endorse his wise words about the importance of the concentration of the ownership of the press in a very small number of hands and if i may say so sometimes in hands that are not all that clean <e>", "<cs> of course my lords but the fact the noble lords papers were in good english was unusual <e> <s> i think that highly professional sub-editors now seem to be an extinct species when i see some editions of the so-called quality press <e>", "<cs> my lords if that happened i feel that the newspapers might listen <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the figures which the noble lord has given to the house clearly suggest that section of the disabled persons act must be implemented very soon <e> <s> that would mean that the needs of long-term hospital patients would at least be assessed before they are discharged <e> <s> further as the noble lords lord campbell of croy and lord ennals have suggested as regards the provision of those needs we need to know how and by whom community care is to be provided and whether it is to be provided along the lines of the recommendations of the griffiths report or otherwise <e> <s> we must know how it is to be provided and soon <e>", "<cs> my lords if as has been announced entitlement to the orange badge is to be closely linked to qualification for the mobility allowance will that not exclude the mentally handicapped <e> <s> at present they are denied the mobility allowance because they can walk although they do not always know in which direction they are walking <e> <s> these are people who genuinely benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a wholly committed supporter of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that it was not the intention of that act that magpies should be permitted without let or hindrance to steal chicks and eggs from the nests of small birds which others of us have striven hard and long to protect and preserve <e> <s> while i am not in favour of capital punishment for theft in general should not an exception be made for the thieving and murderous magpie <e>", "<cs> as noble lords may have noticed i have in general participated in the proceedings on the bill from afar rather than in the chamber <e> <s> by that i mean that i have read the proceedings with the greatest of care <e> <s> i have read over and over again the highly predictable and totally negative replies of the government to amendment after amendment but i honestly believed that on this amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord gibson we might perhaps receive a somewhat different reply from those that we have received in respect of other amendments <e> <s> the argument is utterly compelling <e> <s> the amendment is reasonably and carefully worded <e> <s> i cannot see that it presents any possible disadvantages <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows it all as has been acknowledged is he in a position to tell the house how much charities have lost as a result of the levying of the community charge on charitable employees living in residential homes <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the important issue not so much whether surplus hospital land is sold but to whom it is sold and for what purpose <e> <s> does not the noble lord agree that much hospital land particularly the land surrounding some of the large mental hospitals which are scheduled for closure is potentially valuable amenity and recreational land often in built-up urban areas <e> <s> can he tell the house whether efforts will be made to ensure that such land is retained for those purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recollect that his predecessors at the dispatch box agreed that the provision of affordable living accommodation is crucial to the recruitment and retention of nurses in london <e> <s> does he also recollect that ministers have told us of interesting and encouraging developments whereby some of the nurses homes that have been closed sold off or put to other uses are being reopened <e> <s> is he further aware that some building societies are arranging to make accommodation available for nurses on advantageous terms <e> <s> can he say what further progress has been made as regards those two matters <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to go into the merits or otherwise of the amendment or the extent to which it is clear <e> <s> however i say to the noble lord lord mottistone that i do not believe there is any harm in leaving the amendment in the bill <e> <s> it may <e>", "<cs> i should like to know precisely what we are doing <e> <s> i was interested to hear that the noble lord lord rea is entirely in favour of an amendment to a clause which he later intends to have removed from the bill <e> <s> that seems to me a rather anomalous position <e> <s> it occurs to me that at the moment we are debating the later motion that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> are we debating that or are we to have a further debate on that later <e>", "<cs> i seldom disagree at all with the noble lord lord rea and i very frequently agree with the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i put a slight difference between the two there <e> <s> i am glad to hear that the noble lord is not going to press to a division his opposition to clause standing part of the bill <e> <s> i do not wholly accept the arguments that he has advanced and before we leave this matter i believe it will be no bad thing to put some differing arguments on the record <e> <s> what is the exercise on which we are engaged <e> <s> we are all well aware that before this bill arrives on the statute book if it ever does or before it gets very far in its proceedings in another place without a shadow of a doubt many other things will have happened <e> <s> i am much encouraged by what we have heard from the noble lord at the dispatch box about the fact that we are <e>", "<cs> i do not dispute that but i do not believe that this is the time or place at which to go into the question of diagnostic difficulties at great length <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> when moving the amendment the noble lord lord ennals was kind enough to suggest that he would value my support <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be churlish not to respond <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> i believe that his anxieties and those of the noble lord lord young are soundly based <e> <s> nevertheless i believe as he said that subsection substantially covers the point <e> <s> i believe that the ideal solution is for the noble lord lord mottistone to try to arrive at a form of words which are acceptable to the noble lord lord ennals and which remove the aspects of the subsection about which he is anxious <e> <s> that would be the right course to pursue and i hope it can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to prolong the discussion at this time of night but i genuinely believe that the noble lord lord mason of barnsley has drawn our attention not for the first time to what is a scandal <e> <s> customers are being defrauded daily on a massive scale <e> <s> i intervene because on many occasions when the subject was raised in your lordships house by the noble lord lord chelwood whom we all greatly miss i always intervened to support him <e> <s> at the same time i also managed to squeeze in a few words about a hobby-horse of mine on a related matter the extent to which beer drinkers are defrauded by the service of short measure arising from the absurd custom of dispensing beer by the so-called brimful method measure whereby it either slops over the side and is wasted or is sold in short measure to the extent that trading standards officers after a nationwide survey said that beer drinkers were being defrauded of per year <e> <s> i accept that that is another matter and i should be quite wrong to expect the noble lord lord strathclyde when he comes to reply to deal with it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word about amendment no <e> <s> c which stands in my name and that of my noble friends lord ross of newport and lord addington and is grouped with the amendment that has just been moved <e> <s> this amendment is similar in its purpose although it is perhaps more specifically and narrowly focused <e> <s> i am glad that it does not say anything at all about metering and meter charges which are a complex matter <e> <s> the arguments are bedevilled by the fact that the cost of water charges at the moment is distorted by their linkage with rates so that the only people who benefit from having meters are rich people who live in highly rated properties <e> <s> that is a separate matter <e> <s> the amendment deals purely with the way in which water rates or charges are paid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to pledge the support of my noble friends on these benches to the noble lord and his bill <e> <s> perhaps i should refer to my noble friends who would be on these benches should the need arise <e> <s> i am particularly delighted that this bill which started life as a private members bill in another place should have found so expert and efficient a pilot as the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> i believe that the bill could not be in safer or more expert hands for its later conduct and i am glad about that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister cannot respond more positively to the suggestion made by my noble friend lady robson regarding government resources perhaps i may ask him whether i am right in believing that one refrigeration firm when supplying a new refrigerator will at the same time make an allowance for the old one and undertake to dispose of it safely <e> <s> if one firm can do that would it not be helpful if all firms did it <e> <s> could the government use their influence to bring that about <e>", "<cs> my lords although the government can calculate accurately the additional administrative costs incurred by health authorities and family practitioner committees as a result of this work does the noble lord agree that it is impossible for them to compute accurately the additional administrative costs incurred by general practitioners in shopping around for the best deal for their budgets and for their patients <e> <s> is he aware that some of the general practitioners expenses qualify for direct reimbursement from the department <e> <s> will those additional administrative costs also qualify for direct reimbursement <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all be deeply grateful to my noble friend lord ross of <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble earl lord ferrers for repeating the extremely long and complex statement <e> <s> it consists of the governments response to the observations they received from approximately people and various bodies on the proposals outlined in the white paper <e> <s> it is also a response to many of the observations made by noble lords during the debate in this house some time ago <e> <s> at that time the principal anxiety expressed by noble lords in all parts of the house concerned the proposal to auction the franchises to the highest bidder <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady birk has said that remains a worry <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly say that i support what the noble lord lord ennals said <e> <s> i am bound to say that this kind of problem a very real problem expressed by many people still exists and will always exist <e> <s> i do not believe that the problem concerning civil liberties in relation to disclosure of information can ever be wholly removed but in so far as it is possible to do so the noble lord lord mottistone has devised a form of words which i at least regard as satisfactory and i hope others will too <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us are every bit as concerned about what if anything the national health service policy board will be able to do concerning who sits on it <e> <s> the noble lord told the house that the board will advise the secretary of state on the formulation of policy <e> <s> is the board entitled to advise the secretary of state on policy that has already been formulated <e> <s> for example can the board advise the secretary of state to defer the introduction of some of the proposals in the white paper until pilot studies have been held or are decisions of that kind still to be made wholly and single-handedly by the secretary of state <e> <s> if the board cannot do much it does not greatly matter who sits on it <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady jeger is absolutely right in suggesting that this amendment which i warmly welcome and which i very much hope the committee will support is in reality a stopgap measure to deal with an immediate and very urgent situation <e> <s> it is an attempt to deal with that situation while other very necessary things are being done so that we can get rid of the absurd inhuman and totally uneconomic idea of housing the homeless in bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> it is a ludicrous arrangement the economics of it defy all understanding <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said other things have to be done <e> <s> in the meantime something must be done here and now for people who are in a desperately difficult situation <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that the noble lord would not say that anyone should be proud of the health of families living in bed and breakfast accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the fascinating review of the noble lord lord hunter of newington on the evolution of our family doctor service as it now is <e> <s> the evolution of the service to the position that it has now reached leads us inevitably to the question of where we go now <e> <s> i suspect that this debate is somewhat unusual in that the noble lord who tabled the unstarred question does not know the answer and nor i suspect do the government <e> <s> however perhaps when he comes to reply the noble lord lord henley will clarify the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister noted that many of the supplementary questions addressed to him on this subject have been to do with the theft of property in rural areas <e> <s> does he accept that in many cases it is the theft of stock that concerns people <e> <s> highly organised gangs steal sheep and other stock from the fells butcher them on site and take them away <e> <s> the minister has referred to the efforts made to restore property to its rightful owners <e> <s> one cannot apply that remedy to thefts of the type that i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept that the uncertainty which arises from delay in matters of this kind can be very damaging to sites as experience has already shown <e> <s> while we do not wish the wrong decisions to be taken there comes a time when it is better to have any decision than no decision at all <e> <s> if final decisions are going to be long delayed certain interim steps such as those suggested by the noble lord lord hunt and the noble baroness lady nicol will have to be taken to protect sites <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put two brief and specific questions to the noble lord before we proceed to other business <e> <s> first since local authorities will be given the resources to provide community care rather than merely the opportunity to take the blame for community care not being provided does he think that it would be helpful if a named and known local government officer were to be made responsible for this work <e> <s> if so does that mean that there is now a case for restoring the old and much respected office of medical officer of health in local government <e> <s> the medical officer of health carried out many of the new functions which the noble lord has just described saying that local authorities will have to undertake them <e>", "<cs> my lords while carrying out this very necessary research will the government also undertake research into the known fact that there has been a cluster of leukaemia cases far in excess of the statistical average in the region of seascale for something like years <e> <s> in other words whatever nasty things sellafield may or may not be doing something else is doing something quite nasty as well and those of us who live in that area as i do would quite like to know what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what is the point of further meetings if the secretary of state continues to ignore the advice given to him in good faith by the doctors <e> <s> do we not now need to have some pilot studies to look into some of these proposals to find out who is right about the possible consequences of the schemes <e> <s> is it the doctors or the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> perhaps it might be appropriate if from where i sit in the chamber i endeavour to draw the careful line to which the noble lord referred and draw it betwixt the noble lords lord jenkin of roding and lord mcintosh of haringey on this issue <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a conflict here which cannot possibly be resolved in a form of words such as an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord ennals in thanking the noble lord lord henley for introducing this bill and explaining its provisions with such brevity and clarity <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals may indeed be right in suggesting that there was some regrettable delay before the government finally decided to take action on the deplorable and scandalous events which came to light and which were described by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene briefly <e> <s> i think that he should be aware of the real situation rather than an unreal one <e> <s> he referred to the right of the individual to determine what happens to his organs <e> <s> the individual has no such right <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down in conveying the good wishes of the noble lord lord mcintosh to his noble friend lord caithness perhaps the minister will convey also the good wishes of my noble friends on these benches <e> <s> i am quite sure that my noble friend lord ross of newport would have wished to say this had he been able to be here <e>", "<cs> i thought some of us had to be here tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am today especially fortunate since it falls to me to have the very great pleasure on behalf of the whole house of thanking and congratulating a maiden speaker in this chamber <e> <s> it is not just a pleasure but a particular privilege because we have heard today a maiden speech of the highest quality and calibre which i think bodes well for our house <e> <s> it was the kind of speech which we are entitled to expect and indeed have learned to expect from a fellow of the royal society <e> <s> we know what to expect from a fellow of the royal society because as the noble lord will presently discover our benches are festooned with them <e> <s> but we are not in fact full of immediate past presidents of the royal society of chemistry nor do we have many former professors of chemistry from my own university the university of manchester or indeed boys from barrow grammar school which i am delighted to tell the noble lord i shall be visiting tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords normally i would wish to say a great deal on this very topical and important motion so ably moved by the noble lord lord hunter of newington <e> <s> however i put down my name to speak with some reluctance for two reasons <e> <s> first as some noble lords know i have spent the last few months in and out of hospital learning a very difficult lesson how to behave like a patient <e> <s> that is not an easy lesson for a doctor to learn <e> <s> also i have developed a small speech defect and i was anxious not to burden your lordships with my words until i had fully recovered <e> <s> i therefore hope that if i am not as distinct as i might wish i shall be forgiven <e>", "<cs> my lords do the calm waters and peaceful future to which the minister just referred include the provision of community care <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has told the house that the post offices monopoly is a privilege <e> <s> does he accept that regarding certain of its duties it is a responsibility and a burden <e> <s> does he agree that there are not queues of people lined up from the private sector to take on responsibility for delivering mail in the lake district the highlands of scotland the yorkshire dales cornwall and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of upsetting my noble friend who feels we should not comment on the present dispute perhaps i may ask the noble baroness whether had her circumstances been different and she herself had become an ambulance worker i am sure she would have been a very efficient and dedicated one she herself would have been prepared to accept a pay rise of per cent <e> <s> in the present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for the fact that my name was omitted from the list of speakers in error although perhaps i should say in defence that the error was not mine <e> <s> since noble lords have not been given written notice that they would have to listen to me it behoves me to be as brief as i possibly can <e> <s> i shall be <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that he came off the fence <e> <s> it would be regrettable if the code of practice were withdrawn but i think it is helpful that some of our misgivings should be ventilated <e> <s> however it would be even more helpful if some of the things that were said in your lordships house not only on this occasion but in the debates that took place during the passage of the legislation of the noble lord lord mottistone not so long ago were heard and heeded by those who work in this field <e> <s> if that were the case things would be bound to improve <e>", "<cs> my lords to try to put things in perspective does the noble baroness accept that the really sensational reduction in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis during this century has not been greatly due to the bcg vaccine but to other factors altogether such as improved housing improved nutrition and a vast improvement in therapy <e> <s> therefore the vaccine itself is becoming gradually less important and one hopes that fairly soon it will not be needed at all <e>", "<cs> i should mention one point which is perhaps related to what the noble earl has said to us <e> <s> surely he would accept that a child born to a loving married couple as a result of aid is a wanted child <e> <s> that situation has occurred <e> <s> however does the noble earl accept that many children are born every day who are not wanted by anyone at all although they are born to properly married couples <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we are perhaps overlooking something rather important <e> <s> is it not a fact that children in germany and france and in japan for that matter are not now taught english but are taught american <e> <s> is it not also a fact that companies in britain which provide translation services translating from any language into any other language but in the main specialising in translating technical papers and journals now tell us that much of their work comprises translation from english into american <e> <s> that is not for american clients but for the europeans japanese and others who insist on having english technical publications translated into american <e> <s> if the minister can do anything to reverse that trend i for one would be very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord really believe that a potential return of per cent <e> <s> is fair and reasonable in the light of what has been happening to interest rates <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord himself is too sensible to put his own money into premium bonds but does he not realise that our wives however prudent they may be insist on buying them <e> <s> does the noble lord hold out any hope that the potential return on these investments of our wives might be a little better <e>", "<cs> i should like to make this point <e> <s> the body which has responsibility for the overall control of the conduct of registered medical practitioners is the general medical council of which the noble lord lord walton was such a distinguished president <e> <s> the gmc would continue to be responsible for the conduct of such practitioners ethical or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has told us twice today that more is being spent on those matters <e> <s> that is no doubt entirely right but does she not realise that we want to know not whether more is being spent but whether enough is being spent to meet essential requirements <e>", "<cs> in opposing the amendment moved by the noble viscount i should like to ask him to acknowledge which he did not do in his opening speech that many of those in favour of this bill and many of those in favour of the original act and i was a sponsor of that act are just as much opposed to abortion as is the noble viscount <e> <s> i hope that he will acknowledge that <e>", "<cs> my first inclination was to support the noble earl lord halsbury and this group of amendments <e> <s> it seemed to me that their inclusion in this bill would marginally improve it in that it might help avoid the confrontational situations which arise from time to time as a result of private members bills in another place or indeed in this place <e> <s> it also seemed to me to make it possible for the statute as it stands to be varied in the light of recent medical discoveries and what was happening scientifically in the medical field without the necessity for new primary legislation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may know what the royal colleges views are on the amendment at the moment <e> <s> this is an amendment to provide for a change in circumstances from time to time in the light of changes in medical knowledge and practice <e> <s> the noble lord cannot possibly know what their view will be in the light of those changes <e>", "<cs> i am well aware that secretaries of state are not always obliged to accept the advice which they are obliged to seek <e>", "<cs> i am not sufficiently naive not to know that <e> <s> i know it <e> <s> nevertheless i believe that the act as it would be if it were amended by this group of amendments requiring a secretary of state to act in the way suggested by the noble lord lord ennals would surely be <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak as one of the national health service hospital patients who has not yet died despite the harrowing conditions so graphically described by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> i say to the noble lord at once that i experienced those conditions and will return to them in a moment <e>", "<cs> and they cost a lot my lords as the noble lord said <e> <s> that is another aspect that must be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down has she anything at all to say in response to my question about the appointment of hospital social workers and the dispute about that between the department of health and the local authority associations <e> <s> has that now been resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that philately will get him everywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one point which has not been sufficiently emphasised in this debate and for that reason i rise to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as one of those to whom the noble lord referred the poor old patient <e> <s> when i had the honour to join your lordships house some years ago it did not enter my head that i had been sent to this chamber to do the work of the other place <e> <s> but that is precisely what we are called upon to do today <e>", "<cs> for once i am not in total disagreement with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i accept that the amendment could have been better worded <e> <s> for any deficiencies that it may have i apologise <e> <s> i am responsible <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his observations and reassuring remarks <e> <s> i accept what he has said as being his intentions and no doubt those of his department <e> <s> i hope that time will no show that my confidence has been misplaced <e> <s> it will be disastrous if we later find that the family health services in a certain area are being run by a committee comprised of members who have had no experience of running them and with a general manager who comes from outside and is also without experience <e> <s> that would mean that the family practitioner services were being run by the secretary of state or by his minions in the department <e> <s> that is something which has to be avoided because it is certainly not the right way to run family health services <e>", "<cs> i too await with interest the reply of the noble baroness to the group of amendments moved by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i think it is only fair to the noble lord to say to him that there was a time when i very much agreed with the ideas which he has put forward <e> <s> he will remember that some of them hark back to the days when dr david owen was minister of health <e> <s> at that time he was much concerned as were many of us about the so-called tripartite structure of the national health service <e> <s> in those days it was divided into three parts like old gaul the preventive services the hospital services and the domiciliary services <e> <s> the idea at the time was that the three never should meet and they never seemed to do so <e> <s> i felt that that was illogical and i had to do away with it <e> <s> therefore i agreed with some of the ideas which have led to this group of amendments <e>", "<cs> i trust that the noble baroness will forgive my intervention but i feel that i should point out that no one has suggested under this amendment that these appointments should not be made on a personal basis <e> <s> indeed they should be made on a personal basis <e> <s> the issue concerns the description as to what that basis should be <e>", "<cs> as briefly as i can i should like to support the amendment of the noble lords lord walton and lord hunter <e> <s> members of the committee may recollect that on previous occasions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also ask the noble baroness a question <e> <s> she said that she expected most of the authorities to have the director of public health as a member <e> <s> would she like her expectations to be fulfilled <e> <s> that is all that we are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord has said and not a word of it has taken me by surprise <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at this stage in our discussions and i emphasise those words and like <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord dainton decides what course to pursue with regard to the amendment perhaps i may say that i was absolutely delighted to hear most of the reply of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> before the minister continues perhaps she will explain one point with which i have been wrestling <e> <s> she talked about contracts and when they would come into force <e> <s> she said that they would be contracts between providers purchasers and so on <e> <s> she also said that initially these would have to be somewhat crude and then she referred to block contracts <e> <s> does that mean that the costing of certain <e>", "<cs> i was delighted to see the amendment on the marshalled list because it gives me an opportunity to fulfil a pledge which i made to the noble baroness on second reading <e> <s> she will remember that i raised the present difficulties in appointing hospital social workers <e> <s> i drew attention to the fact that as a result of the difficulties some hospitals do not have a social worker in place <e> <s> that is a disgrace <e> <s> indeed many hospitals do not have sufficient social workers <e> <s> i then told the noble baroness that until the difficulty was solved i would raise the matter again and again <e> <s> this is the first time i have done so <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he say a few words on hospital social workers <e>", "<cs> this is an important and helpful amendment and i was delighted to attach my name to it <e> <s> the noble baroness will perhaps recollect that on second reading i said that i wholly accepted that it would be quite wrong to expect every hospital to do everything <e> <s> i said that i fully understood that with certain highly specialised and expensive services it is right and proper that they should be concentrated in those hospitals <e> <s> that is what has happened <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lord perhaps he will accept this fact is speaking to us as a londoner <e> <s> would he make precisely the same remarks if he practised in cornwall in the lake district or in scotland <e> <s> is it not a totally different problem <e> <s> i accept what he said with regard to london but it does not apply to rural areas <e>", "<cs> i listened with great care to the noble baronesss reply and i note that she has looked into the matter very thoroughly <e> <s> she has thought about it <e> <s> it is clear that her fellow ministers in the department have thought about it and after taking advice she has decided that this timetable can be met <e> <s> i wish that i could believe her <e> <s> i am afraid that time will show that she is wrong and i am right <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord who appears to say that what i have asked for will be done but that there need be no statutory requirement <e> <s> i have always taken the view that patients play an important part in their illnesses <e> <s> it is important to seek patients views occasionally before we make fundamental changes to the medical arrangements in their area <e> <s> i have always believed that the ideal body to represent the patient you cannot speak to every patient is the community health council <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that those councils will be consulted on these matters <e> <s> we shall await the outcome <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is an all-party amendment and as one of the sponsors of it i thought i should make my position clear straightaway <e> <s> the noble baroness lady cox is not in her place but had she been there perhaps she could have spoken first from that side of the committee <e>", "<cs> i meant no discourtesy to the noble baroness lady carnegy but as one of the sponsors of the amendment i thought i should speak first <e> <s> it is right that the noble baroness lady hooper should know that this is an all-party amendment which has all-party support <e> <s> she should also be aware that on all sides of the committee there are members who believe that properly carried out and with proper safeguards the national health service trusts could be successful <e> <s> there are also those who believe that there are great dangers in this unless it is done properly <e> <s> that is our anxiety here <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord deals with his seccnd point will he accept that this is not a labour party amendment <e> <s> the amendment is supported by all parties <e> <s> it bears the name of his noble friend lady cox <e> <s> what the labour party happens to think or does not think has nothing to do with me <e>", "<cs> my lords normally i am extremely wary about poking my manchester nose into london affairs <e> <s> however i have always had a soft spot for the westminster hospital <e> <s> i used to attend postgraduate courses there when i felt that i was getting out of date <e> <s> i do not do so any longer i enjoy being out of date <e> <s> in addition i often had occasion to send members of your lordships house to westminster hospital and subsequently had the very great pleasure of seeing them return restored to full health <e> <s> therefore i am concerned about the fate of westminster hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that the object was to make revenue savings <e> <s> my point now is to ask what has happened to the capital cost <e> <s> the original figures quoted by the riverside health authority was that the cost would be million and million would be gained from the sale of sites which would become available <e> <s> that looked like a very good deal <e> <s> however what has happened since <e> <s> how have we arrived at these extraordinary figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that her right honourable friend announced his approval on nd december and gave the cost in his press release as million <e> <s> on the same day the north west thames regional health authoritys press release referred to a figure of million <e> <s> do the additionals explain that discrepancy <e>", "<cs> i support this essentially all-party amendment <e> <s> in doing so i support everything that was said in moving it by the noble lord lord ennals and in supporting it by the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> she was right to draw the committees attention to the fact that things have changed <e> <s> there was a time when we discussed this subject when the whole discussion focused on kidney transplants <e> <s> we discussed the deplorable fact that patients were tied to dialysis machines merely because there were no kidneys available <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord young began by reminding us that we have been told that we have a listening government <e> <s> that being the case the less i give them to listen to the better <e> <s> we have had so many explanations as to what the last group of amendments meant that by the end none of us knew what it meant at all <e> <s> frankly i doubt whether the minister did and so i do not wish to complicate this issue because i believe in it very much <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment which has been so admirably moved by the noble lord lord mancroft <e> <s> in his speech the noble lord alerted the committee to a real and serious problem <e> <s> i hope that after listening to his speech many members of the committee who were perhaps marginally aware of this problem will have become a little more acutely aware of what it involves <e> <s> when this problem arises it frequently requires urgent attention <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone has a point here <e> <s> he knows as do many of us that there is a tendency for patients who are suffering from schizophrenia to stop taking their medication once they are removed from the immediate control of the consultant who has been looking after them in hospital <e> <s> they tend almost by definition to stop taking their medication <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone is concerned that when inspections are carried out those who are conducting them should ensure that patients are receiving the proper treatment <e> <s> that is not a matter that is connected with community care <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone wants to see some kind of inspection carried out of the standard of therapy which is being provided for patients <e> <s> that is a clinical matter <e> <s> it is a matter which needs attending to but i am not entirely sure that the noble lord is right in thinking that this is the way to deal with it <e>", "<cs> to amplify the point made by my noble friend when the noble lord lord peston referred to amateurism and said that we wanted professionalism he was not talking about people being paid but about people being trained <e> <s> that is a very different thing <e> <s> the matter of paying people is a very different factor <e> <s> we want a very high standard of performance from the voluntary bodies but there is no way that they will be paid <e> <s> however they will be paid for the training that will give them that high <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am anxious to determine or elucidate his precise meaning <e> <s> does he consider that what he is now doing is as an amateur or as a professional <e>", "<cs> i intervene here to stress that my amendment makes no proposal to transfer social workers back to the health authorities <e> <s> i agree that they used to belong to the health authorities <e> <s> however in my view it is much better that they should remain part of the social services department <e> <s> nevertheless it is essential that somehow or other whoever employs them should be able to pay them <e> <s> if they cannot be paid they cannot be employed and we shall not have any <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for her reply <e> <s> it is clear from what she has said that she recognises that the problem is real and serious <e> <s> she then said that the department does not yet have all <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for expressing that hope and that intent <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady faithfull for making that suggestion <e> <s> she has recognised first that there is a problem and secondly she has offered another possible solution which may be an admirable one <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i do so as briefly as i can <e> <s> the amendment was admirably and clearly moved by the noble lord lord seebohm and i absolutely agree with what he said <e> <s> i am sure that the whole committee does so <e> <s> the noble lord lord seebohm quoted the words regarding the relevant functions of directors of social services <e> <s> the words in the bill are ambiguous to say the least <e> <s> if they do not mean what is stated in the amendment they ought to mean that <e> <s> surely that is the purpose of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i may be confused by what the noble baroness is saying as against what she said earlier <e> <s> she appeared to say earlier that the secretary of states approval is required before additional functions other than social services functions are laid on the director of social services <e> <s> are we to assume from that that the secretary of state has given approval for what is happening in the authority which has just been quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord willis who has made a major contribution to broadcasting only perhaps matched by that of his son <e> <s> the noble lords words <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment for the reasons given so clearly by the noble lord lord ennals and the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> there was nothing incompatible about the arguments advanced by those two speakers from opposite sides of the house <e> <s> this is not a party matter <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness lady cox that it would be immensely helpful and reassuring to many people if the government were to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords the previous body was the family practitioner committee and its predecessor was the executive council <e> <s> there are two alternatives council or committee in place of authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try not to muddy the water still further <e> <s> i am a fervent supporter of the polytechnics and that must be so because i have a son and a daughter who are lecturers in polytechnics <e> <s> while they do a great deal of important work in the training of various people who work in the national health service it is not my understanding of the nature of the polytechnics that any polytechnic actually has wards in which there are patients whereas there are many universities or medical schools which have wards full of patients <e> <s> they are doing national health service work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness explained what is meant by assets in this amendment but she has not explained what is meant by liabilities <e> <s> can she give an example of a liability that will be disregarded <e>", "<cs> my lords to intervene most briefly the statement that the noble lord lord mccoll read relates to a totally different situation <e> <s> the problem at the moment is that the authorities and the various bodies within the national health service are faced with new problems one of which is how to cost various procedures <e> <s> we have contracts that will come into force on st april <e> <s> i do not see how we can have a contract unless we know the prices <e> <s> there is great doubt as to whether all the different authorities will in fact be able to calculate accurately and effectively the actual cost of the things they are either selling or buying <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am sympathetic to the amendment for the clear reasons that the noble baroness lady masham of ilton has <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says that the arrangement has always been freely entered into or abandoned on either side <e> <s> it is not quite so free <e> <s> a doctor is not allowed to ask for a patient to be removed from his list at a time when the patient needs treatment <e> <s> that is the present position and i presume that it will remain so <e> <s> therefore the position is not as unequal as the noble baroness suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies perhaps i may say something <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it would be for the convenience of the house if i did not speak before the noble lord replied <e> <s> not having done so i accept that i must not speak now but must couch my words in an interrogative form <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said precisely what i said but in different words which i have no doubt is within the rules of the house <e> <s> however that is not satisfactory <e> <s> i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> let us suppose that a fund holding practice in a certain area of london happens to be burdened with a great many homeless people <e> <s> the noble lord knows as well as i do that homeless people have great difficulty getting on to a general practitioners list <e> <s> some find it impossible <e> <s> their <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment in so far as it would appear to result in the work of a fund-holding practice within those terms being continuously monitored <e> <s> i could not stand here and honestly say that i support an amendment that would necessarily impose a duty on fund-holding practices to spend a great deal of their resources and energy on preparing annual reports <e> <s> however i agree that an annual report should be prepared <e> <s> we should know precisely what is going on in these fund-holding practices <e> <s> i support the amendment as a way of ensuring that such practices are constantly and continuously monitored <e> <s> however i am not entirely sure that the practices themselves should be given the burdensome task of preparing formal annual reports <e>", "<cs> my lords when is this very welcome meeting to which the noble baroness referred to take place and will the result be available before third reading of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> some time ago i carried out an informal investigation into the personal circumstances of some elderly people in registered homes of this kind <e> <s> frankly i was disturbed and faintly alarmed by the number of cases that i discovered in which a person running a home had acquired enduring power of attorney in respect of a resident <e> <s> the enduring powers of attorney act is fairly new and could easily be used fraudulently if the wrong people were in the wrong position <e> <s> the amendment seeks to ensure that some of the wrong people are not in the wrong position <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment as i did in committee <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat the arguments which i advanced then <e> <s> i merely wish to ask a question <e> <s> my recollection of the reply which we received on that occasion was that further inquiries had to be made into precisely what was the present situation <e> <s> i have no doubt that those further inquiries have been made <e> <s> i should like to know whether having inquired into the situation it has been decided in the department that the actions of some local authorities in that regard are <e>", "<cs> my lords among the helpful measures introduced by the government does the minister include the uniform business rate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkin of roding was rather missing the point in telling us how many hours have been spent in this house and in another place discussing these reforms <e> <s> it is not hours of debate in parliament that matters those can go on for ever <e> <s> what matters is whether there has been sufficient consultation and discussion within the various professions which will in the end have to do the work <e> <s> i do not accept his argument about how long we have had to debate these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this is not an occasion for a long speech and i have no intention of making one <e> <s> it is in a way a rather sad occasion sad because it has become increasingly apparent as we have discussed the bill at great length that all noble lords in your lordships house in all parties and in none are committed to the preservation of the national health service and to its improvement <e> <s> that is the point i was trying to make when i was so misunderstood by the noble lord lord ennals when i was talking about policies <e> <s> to that extent we are united <e> <s> it has become apparent that all noble lords in your lordships house are committed to the national health service and would <e>", "<cs> my lords we are told that the reasons we were given in good faith for not carrying this amendment on th june are now invalid and that there are therefore no reasons for our not having carried the amendment on that day <e> <s> if the reasons against it have now been removed why do we not carry it <e> <s> why do we not give the other place an opportunity to carry it <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton made an extremely important point <e> <s> there is nothing on the statute book to protect the police against accusations of having falsely or illegally disclosed information <e> <s> surely the provision should be on the statute book <e> <s> there is no reason why it should not be <e> <s> the noble baroness told us that <e> <s> so why do we not send the amendment back to the other place for it to be put on the statute book <e>", "<cs> on behalf of and at the request of my noble friend lord bonham-carter who is unavoidably absent and in whose name the amendment also stands i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness explained it is purely a paving amendment for amendment no <e> <s> which is the amendment of substance concerning public service broadcasting <e>", "<cs> i wish to be absolutely clear about what the noble earl has said to us <e> <s> am i right in thinking that he has said that under the legislation as it now stands the channel station will have no public service obligations <e> <s> if that is correct does the noble earl not agree that that is in conflict with the present position in which the iba as it now is has a positive responsibility to ensure that the independent television companies do in fact fulfil certain public service obligations <e> <s> can the noble earl clarify that point <e>", "<cs> the noble earl must surely realise and understand i am sure he does that the existing programme companies anglia border and so on all had to go through such a hoop <e> <s> having done so and obtained the franchise they had an obligation placed upon them with regard to public service broadcasting <e> <s> the minister said that these companies will have to go through a hoop and we accept that fact but having gone through the hoop it would seem that that obligation has been removed <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> i am considering that carefully at the moment <e> <s> i hope the noble viscount lord whitelaw will not be too distressed if i say that i very much agree with some of the things he said about this amendment <e> <s> i also agree that the amendment is in two parts as has been pointed out <e> <s> if i may say so the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter had obviously misread one part <e> <s> he asked whether we wanted a whole set of nonentities <e> <s> the amendment says nothing like that at all <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> they could be very distinguished people and the amendment continues <e>", "<cs> i endorse the remarks of the noble lord lord ardwick in every way <e> <s> i agree with him as i suspect does the minister <e> <s> i am reassured by what the minister said as regards the provisions contained in another clause of the bill <e> <s> i have read that section and it does in many ways give effect to the sort of anxieties which i expressed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount lord ullswater for those words and i shall return to them in a moment <e> <s> he has made clear that we are at present in a very uncertain situation <e> <s> much <e>", "<cs> it will be a regulating body and not just a licensing authority my noble friend has just indicated that it will be purely a licensing authority well that is another matter that we may have to consider at a later stage <e>", "<cs> that would certainly be a pleasure but i do not know whether it would save time overall <e> <s> it would surely save my time however <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords what question is the noble lord asking the noble baroness about the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i know that my noble friend lord thomson has already supported this amendment so it is clear that it has the full support of noble lords on these benches <e> <s> however i should say with regard to the significance of the amendment that it is extremely important that the large regions should be encouraged to break themselves up into smaller regions <e> <s> that is important from the point of view of investment in regional areas <e> <s> i remember the days when granada television was awarded the franchise for the part of england in which i lived <e> <s> initially i feared that we would get a train load of peasants from the home counties coming up to manchester being disgorged from the train making programmes about the cotton trade and then going back to the home counties <e>", "<cs> naturally i support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that having set up the machinery the government should trust it to do the job <e> <s> i do not believe the requirement is necessary <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to support the amendment to which my name is also attached <e> <s> earlier the noble earl the minister talked to us about the virus of pessimism <e> <s> i am bound to say that i feel optimistic about the amendment for a whole number of reasons which i shall now explain <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble viscount for mentioning the earlier act <e> <s> i hope that he will forgive me if i remind him that that provision arose from an amendment of mine which the government graciously accepted <e> <s> i know that what counts is what is written in the bill <e> <s> but our debates at that time covered various aspects to which the noble viscount has referred including subtitling and sign language <e> <s> they were very much in our minds when the government accepted my amendment <e> <s> it was a matter of principle and not a compelling matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to be clear as to what precisely we are doing <e> <s> i understood from the noble baroness lady birk that she intended to move her amendments in this group later and that we would debate them separately <e> <s> does that have the agreement of the committee <e> <s> those amendments are in the names of the noble baroness and myself <e> <s> are we to debate them separately after we have dealt with the present amendment or does the minister propose that we deal with them together <e>", "<cs> as my name is attached to these amendments perhaps i may say a word or two but not too many <e> <s> it is my understanding of the ministers earlier remarks that broadly speaking he accepted these amendments and he was going to take them away and return with something to the same effect <e> <s> if that is the case then perhaps the less i say the better lest he should subsequently change his mind <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i was speaking and the noble baroness intervened <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness is wrong and will subsequently he delighted <e> <s> i believe that the minister will confirm what he said a few moments ago <e> <s> without amendments of this kind there is no guarantee that the kind of teletext service that a very large number of people million people at some personal cost are now receiving will continue as it is <e> <s> as a result of market forces if nothing else there is no guarantee that that service will remain substantially the same <e> <s> the minister said earlier that most of the provisions will continue <e> <s> he said that the news will continue <e> <s> i remind him that the news service is without doubt the most expensive part of a teletext service <e> <s> the news service would be in jeopardy if the provision was left purely to market forces and if there were no kind of prescription whatever <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like him to clarify one point <e> <s> i listened to him with great care but i fear that my hearing is not as acute as perhaps it should be <e> <s> i seem to recollect that at one stage in his remarks he referred to certain operators retaining the must-carry obligation <e> <s> can he explain that and tell me who those operators are <e>", "<cs> not for the first time today we find ourselves perhaps i should say i find myself in some difficulty because of the system of grouping the amendments <e> <s> the grouping of amendments is of course essential in a chamber which does not have any standing order providing for timetabling motions <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for his assistance but i am not being ungracious in saying that i did not actually need it <e> <s> i knew that was the position <e>", "<cs> it was my intention to seek the permission of the committee to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> in doing so i intended to say that i was of course aware that that would not in any sense stop other noble lords pressing their amendments to a division when we reach them <e> <s> in any case we shall come later to other amendments dealing with community radio which are not included in this group <e> <s> so we have not finished our discussions on that subject <e> <s> certainly we have not solved the very serious problems which community radio faces <e>", "<cs> in addition to supporting my noble friend lord bonham-carter and the noble baroness on the amendments at this point i should like to speak briefly about amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and that of the noble baroness lady birk and which is grouped with the others <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may use this opportunity to ask the noble earl a simple and straightforward question <e> <s> am i right in my reading of clause and subsequent clauses which relate to it that there is nothing in the clause that requires all three national stations to be based in london <e> <s> i take the view that if we are to have three national radio stations at least one of them should be somewhere in the provinces or regions and not in london <e> <s> am i right in my understanding that the clause permits that <e>", "<cs> i believe that i am right in saying that the clause deals with national commercial radio and not with local commercial radio <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in normal circumstances when blood specimens are taken for routine testing with the patients consent as is normally the case before all operations on antenatal and other occasions the precise nature of the test to be carried out is not usually specified or discussed with the patient <e> <s> nor is the patient asked to consent to a variety of different tests <e> <s> the patient consents to the blood being tested <e> <s> in those circumstances has not the time now come when it would be reasonable for all blood specimens to be tested for hiv antibodies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister under the impression that when blood is taken from an accident patient or a driver in a motoring accident and tested for alcohol the patient is first asked for his consent <e> <s> in fact he is not <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee stage i moved an amendment designed to reduce the figure six to four <e> <s> the noble earl will readily understand that i shall be reluctant to support an amendment which raises the figure six to <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting amendment no <e> <s> to which my name is attached i welcome very warmly amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble earl and to which amendment no <e> <s> is an amendment <e> <s> i acknowledge as did the noble baroness that the amendment moved by the noble earl goes a very long way towards satisfying demands or anxieties expressed by noble lords on all sides of the house when the matter was debated in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will make a sympathetic reply to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord thomson <e> <s> however my hopes are not buoyed by the realisation that at the moment the government allow a registered blind person a rebate of on a television licence otherwise costing <e> <s> that does not seem to indicate an immense amount of sympathy on the part of the government for the blind <e> <s> can the noble earl comment on that point when he replies <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house whether the situation which she has described now means that kielder reservoir which she will recollect was constructed to cope with an expected demand for water from industries in the north east that have now closed will now become useful instead of being the white elephant which it has turned out to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene very briefly in this discussion because i had an experience in this area some years ago from which important lessons can be learnt <e> <s> in the difficult situation in which we are now placed i feel i have a duty to inform your lordships of that experience <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that we are being asked to choose between a scheme that has been carefully thought out debated and discussed in great detail and another scheme which has hardly been thought out at all <e> <s> as the noble lord lord houghton reminded us we have barely had the chance to study it <e> <s> the governments alternative scheme seems to me to have grave defects <e> <s> i wish to put one question to the noble baroness perhaps she will answer it when she comes to reply <e> <s> as i understand the governments proposed alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside for the moment the doctrinal question of private patients important though that may be perhaps i may focus the ministers attention on the crucial issue of whether the resources of the unit are adequate to meet the needs of aids patients <e> <s> can the noble baroness advise the house whether the hematological resources in the unit are wholly adequate to meet the needs of aids patients as we now know them to be or will there be a shortfall whether caused by private patients or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the noble lord lord ennals is by no means the only minister of health to have opened beds which subsequently were closed <e> <s> does she recollect that every minister of health since the nhs was formed has opened beds which later were closed <e> <s> is she further aware that i attended the opening by a conservative minister of health of some new beds in oldham and that i then waited after the official opening to see the beds locked up by the caretaker because there were no nurses to staff them <e> <s> is it not a fact that there has been a shortage of resources ever since the nhs began irrespective of the party in power <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness any words of comfort for those who look after disabled people in particular those who live and work in residential institutions for the disabled <e> <s> is she aware that the charities which run such organisations such as the calvert trust and the richmond fellowship find the community charge in respect of those employees a very heavy burden <e> <s> is it not consuming charitable donations which the donors intended to help the disabled and not merely to boost public funds <e>"]
