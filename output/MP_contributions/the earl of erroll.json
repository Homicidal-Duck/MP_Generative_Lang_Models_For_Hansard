stood up before on several of the other amendments for the simple reason that i cannot understand why we pass legislation which does not say on the face of the bill what we all agree is intended to be done eventually through regulations <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i think it is very wrong in principle to hurry legislation through just because it seems to be a good thing in principle and then pray that we can sort it out later <e> <s> we do not debate the <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask why there is a different restriction in the other clause <e> <s> i do

should like to ask a question of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor as a result of what he said <e> <s> i do not see how the lord lyon and the college of arms can discharge their duties properly and the lord lyon has to determine matters which relate to succession of many things sometimes titles and sometimes other matters pertaining only to scotland without some of this information <e> <s> i fully understand the noble and learned lord saying that the full medical information should not be disclosed to the lord lyon nor should it be disseminated more widely by the lord lyon <e>
