["<cs> my lords it is some years since a lytton addressed the house and many noble lords have been kind enough to express fond memories of my father <e> <s> i have the honour of being the first in the batting order foretold by the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead <e> <s> i am aware of the great privilege of being able to address your lordships house <e> <s> however i shall try to avoid the example of my forebear the poet lord byron and to be less controversial <e> <s> nevertheless i ask the indulgence of the house <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene and i thank the noble lord the minister for giving way there is one point upon which i should like some clarification <e> <s> it relates to the fact that anyone who has a freehold interest in a property may become liable to the standard charge <e> <s> this could be a divided interest such as that between husband and wife or between a group of people <e> <s> i must straight away declare a personal interest at this point and say that i have had some very helpful responses at very short notice from the noble earl lord caithness on this matter <e> <s> but i should like to seek clarification that in the case of joint or multiple ownership each individual owner of a relevant interest will not attract the maximum charge which could in cases where the double charge applies amount to a very great inequity for second homes <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i am not sure that i understood the point that i am supposed to speak to <e> <s> will the minister repeat what he said please <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his very full reply especially at this hour of night <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the committee for any longer than is absolutely necessary <e> <s> i felt that the amendments i put forward were very much in the form of a safety net <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister has not felt it possible to take on all of them <e> <s> i shall be looking very closely at the proposals he brings forward and discussing in further detail with others the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be permitted to speak to this amendment <e> <s> to which my name also appears and to support the noble lord <e> <s> lord ross of newport <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all perhaps i may thank the minister for his very helpful replies to my two amendments <e> <s> i should also like to thank <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i know what has been said about the possibility that the term contiguous may give rise to a legal severance of the entitlement of the tenant <e> <s> i do not believe that that was intended <e> <s> if the wording is perhaps at fault the concept behind the amendment is not <e> <s> in particular in the bill we are trying to protect the dwellinghouse and to provide someone with a roof over his head <e> <s> that being the case the surplus land as it were over and above the necessary garden area should not rank for protection <e>", "<cs> before we leave clause i should like to mention just one thing which i feel cannot go unchallenged <e> <s> my criticism of clause is allied to my criticisms of the bill as a whole namely that it goes out of its way to avoid the reality of security of tenure and the importance of that principle in the context of residential landlord/tenant relationships <e> <s> at this point i have to declare an interest both as a chartered surveyor and as a landlord of private rented accommodation <e> <s> i hasten to add that this is in a very small way <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for giving way but with respect i did not advocate the total removal of all statutory controls <e> <s> i advocated the rolling back of some of them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene very briefly <e> <s> it seems to me that the situation here is in the essence of a contract between landlord and tenant <e> <s> the landlord is entitled to know to whom he is letting and the tenant is entitled to know who is letting the <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with what the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has put forward <e> <s> he referred to the commercial landlord and tenant legislation and the grounds upon which a landlord can seek possession of property because of redevelopment <e>", "<cs> there seems to be one element which the noble lord lord mcintosh has overlooked in the matter namely that if as the government claim the bill will produce an increase in supply then the consequence on the risk of being thrown out of ones accommodation is that much less <e>", "<cs> i should like to rise in support of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> it should be borne in mind that we are talking about a commercial arrangement between landlord and tenant not related to commercial property but nonetheless a commercial bargain all the same <e> <s> in most similar contractual arrangements the period after which a <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to step into the debate but there has been a great deal of discussion about market price and other matters concerned with property valuation <e> <s> i thoroughly endorse the comments made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and i should like to go one step further <e> <s> if we are talking about a property with a fairly high cost input and one which has an open market value restricted as it must be by straight-forward interpretation of the legal parameters on the one hand and the extent of the market place on the other that will produce a conflict and an unnecessary complication <e> <s> it is outside the present processes of valuation for such a purpose as i understand it <e> <s> i see great difficulties arising <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an issue which must be dealt with by the local planning authority <e> <s> if in its wisdom it gives consent for property for a specific purpose it is up to the authority to enforce that <e> <s> we have a well-established procedure in planning law for dealing with that <e> <s> it is not for me to say that all properties which are adapted or constructed for disabled persons should be subject to that restriction any more than i am saying that every property built in the open countryside should be subject to an agricultural restriction <e> <s> i made no further comment but i point out that the mechanism exists <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> however that causes speculation as to the time-scale over which the first purchaser will remain in beneficial occupation <e> <s> that may be a matter of or years or it may be a relatively short time <e> <s> we are dealing with a small market place a point already touched on by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> we have a net deficit of suitable properties available for disabled people <e> <s> the noble lord lord swinfen touched on that issue <e> <s> i support him in his assertion that we need more such properties and that that is the real solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> that presupposes that the disabled person if he is able to sell at a valuation determined by the district valuer at the time when that date comes has purchased the house at a similarly discounted value in the first place <e> <s> i was trying to make the point that that leaves us with expensively adapted properties which are being sold at a depressed value subject to that restriction <e> <s> can the noble lord answer that point <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the chairman of committees for rising slightly late <e> <s> there are a number of points that i wish to make about the amendment <e> <s> i should like to preface my comments by saying that these and other amendments that follow under various subdivisions of amendment no <e> <s> are in many respects extremely technical <e> <s> i am particularly sorry that they should have been tabled as i understand it last thursday which has given precious little time for the matter to be properly considered by those of the professions who are most keenly involved <e>", "<cs> with apologies for rising yet again i should like to thank the noble lord lord ross for his customary courtesy of bestowing on me a greater command of this subject matter than is the case <e> <s> i fear that i am just as bemused as everybody else <e> <s> i took on board the point made by the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> in view of the lateness of the hour it is no time to be discussing in detail the many points that i should have liked to raise with the minister <e> <s> having said that i do not think it would be right if i did not somehow mark the card at this stage with a number of points on which i would hope to have some clarification in due course although i do not wish to ask the minister to answer in detail or indeed at all at this juncture <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for that explanation and apologise for the incompleteness of the amendments that i have moved <e> <s> my power of parliamentary drafting is not as good as perhaps it should be <e> <s> however i should like to consider the explanation that the noble and learned lord has given <e> <s> it seems entirely plausible and proper <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> his knowledge of the matter is incomparably greater than mine in regard to the correct way in which these things should be dealt with <e> <s> he answered my question in the sense that he accepts that a member of a professional body will not necessarily be excluded from being considered a fit and proper person <e> <s> that was the point behind the amendment <e> <s> i thank the noble and learned lord for his reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak briefly in favour of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it has a direct bearing on my own amendment amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady elles speaks with much greater knowledge on this matter than i do <e> <s> i could not begin to tell her what the situation was regarding even my own profession save to say that i could be expected to have legal action taken against me were i to breach a confidence <e> <s> i am not competent to say whether it would make any difference if that were backed by <e>", "<cs> obviously i hoped that the noble and learned lord would go further than he has done <e> <s> he has picked his way extremely adroitly through what is a not inconsiderable minefield of differing views here <e> <s> but in the light of what he has said there is obviously a procedural and structural deficiency to my amendment and therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for trying to include something that should not properly be there <e> <s> that must be put down to my lack of knowledge of the correct wording that applies in such cases <e> <s> in the circumstances i believe that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has given me as good an answer as i could possibly expect at this time of night <e> <s> perhaps i may leave the matter in his hands for the time being <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am greatly heartened by what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> in the circumstances while thanking him for that with the permission of the committee i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> i am not sure to which amendment he refers <e>", "<cs> thank you <e> <s> i am not speaking to that amendment <e> <s> i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> j k kb kc and l i ask the committees pardon <e>", "<cs> i am heartened by what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my voice to those who have heaped praise on the noble lord lord middleton for his excellent and learned committees report on this matter <e> <s> it has an enormous breadth of common sense and statistical information and i warmly welcome it <e> <s> i wish to associate myself with the views of the noble lord lord shuttleworth who gave <e>", "<cs> my lords in this bill which i warmly welcome we have a great number of aspects to deal with and i want to concentrate on just a few of them <e>"]
