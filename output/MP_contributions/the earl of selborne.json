["<cs> my lords i should like the opportunity to support the noble lord lord stanley of alderley and the other members of your lordships house who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i should declare that i am chairman of the hops marketing board <e> <s> therefore i take some considerable degree of interest in the matter and look with alarm at the bill as at present drafted <e>", "<cs> i should first like to congratulate the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and his committee for this excellent report <e> <s> it has drawn attention to an area of the common agricultural policy which is well overdue to receive further illumination <e> <s> this report is fully of extremely valuable information be it statistical or otherwise and full of information which is in some senses sometimes even surprising <e> <s> i was grateful to the committee for giving me the opportunity as an apple-grower to give evidence as a witness <e> <s> i was most grateful for the courteous way in which my evidence was heard <e> <s> having read this report with as your lordships might imagine great care there are two points which i found to be spelt out with great clarity and which must be quite self-evident <e> <s> first the eecs present support system for fruit and vegetables is strangely complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was trying to make was that this should be funded from eec funds and not necessarily from national funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not claim to know more than the minister that would be a most unwise assumption to make on this matter <e> <s> it occurs to me that many noble lords in the chamber today will take only a passing interest in this bill and will not consider it totally central to legislation of this session <e> <s> i look at it rather differently as of great importance but then as my noble friend has explained i am a hop grower and indeed i am chairman of the hops marketing board <e> <s> i recollect as the noble lord lord bishopston has already reminded us that from time to time over the years we in your lordships house have taken a passing interest in the hops marketing board and have tended to say that the hops marketing board is a force for good in the marketing of hops in europe and there is no earthly reason to change it <e> <s> quite frankly that has remained the attitude of myself as a hop grower and indeed of the board to this very day <e>", "<cs> my lords like others who have spoken i should like to say how grateful i am to the committee for this very timely report which draws attention to the concerns and suspicion which is very widely held throughout the community but <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady white has explained i am the chairman of the agricultural and food research council <e> <s> i can therefore assure my noble friend that at least one member of the council will listen to and not only listen to but read carefully the observations made in this debate <e> <s> your lordships are tolerant in these matters but i must nevertheless be careful not to speak on behalf of the agricultural and food research council <e> <s> i hope that i may be allowed to speak as someone who has more than a passing knowledge as a farmer <e> <s> i can perhaps assure the noble baroness that i grow more than just hops and apples <e> <s> i involve myself in many crops dairy farming and the like which will be familiar to welsh farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that my noble friend has put me right on that <e> <s> when assessments are to be made as they have been made governments do so presumably by taking a hard look at the strategic considerations which are implied by withdrawing support in one direction and increasing support in another <e> <s> i do not quarrel quite so strenuously as some will with the concept that the food industry does need further support <e> <s> the reasons can be well justified as has been done in another report to which sir kenneth blaxter who has already been mentioned was a participant <e> <s> he made the point that we are losing in the balance of payments on our food industry <e> <s> the food engineering industry has badly lost its share of the market <e> <s> unlike agriculture be it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first explain to your lordships that i am the chairman of the agricultural and food research council and therefore have a particular interest in the debate initiated today by the noble lord lord sherfield <e> <s> from all the speeches made in the house today it is clearly the case that there is recognition of the need to be selective be it basic research programmes strategic research programmes or applied research programmes <e> <s> the question which concerns many of us is do we have the machinery to be selective <e> <s> shall we be able to sharpen up our priorities <e> <s> can we avoid fluffing the hard decisions <e> <s> as the noble lord lord sherfield asked earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an unnaturally late hour for farmers and i suspect for environmentalists so i shall he brief <e> <s> like other speakers i shall contain my remarks to just one of the two most important reports <e> <s> i shall contain my remarks to the blue report on agricultural and environmental research <e> <s> i do so because i have to declare an interest in that i am not just a farmer i am also chairman of the agricultural food research council a body which will derive much benefit i am certain by this report <e> <s> i do however speak for myself and not for the council <e>", "<cs> my lords i start as did my noble friend lord jellicoe by declaring that i have a close involvement in todays subject as chairman of one of the research councils in my case as chairman of the agricultural and food research council <e> <s> also like my noble friend i must declare my indebtedness to the noble lord lord sherfield who once again has drawn our attention in a masterly way to the erosion of the science research base in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first declare an interest as chairman of the agricultural and food research council as well as being a farmer <e> <s> as such i must resist the temptation much as i should like to do so to dwell on the problems that research councils are facing in these times of severe cuts <e> <s> i am sure that the remarks of the noble baroness lady nicol and the noble lord lord stanley will be appreciated by those who are affected so directly by these cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i read the report with a great sense of relief and i have listened to the debate with an equal sense of relief <e> <s> when in the fullness of time the government give their response and we quite understand that we shall not have a full response tonight it may not necessarily be all that we seek <e> <s> however at least there will be a feeling abroad particularly among the scientific population that the problems are now well understood <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the million injection <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the million injection of funds to the science vote will be of enormous relief and help to the research councils <e> <s> they are in the great difficulty of having to turn down extremely well presented and important research projects <e> <s> i am sure that the research councils will be greatly relieved that this injection of funds will give them the opportunity to award research funds to those projects which are so greatly needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should explain at the outset that my interest is as chairman of the agricultural and food research council <e> <s> i wish to talk not so much about that council but about the whole breadth of agricultural research in the country in terms of the question tabled by the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> i must say how grateful i am to the noble lord for introducing the subject <e> <s> by the force of his speech and indeed by the force of the speech of my noble friend lord ferrers it was made clear that in the last few years there has been a quite dramatic change in agricultural research in this country <e> <s> its extent was tellingly spelt out by my noble friend in terms of the rothamsted institute although that could be repeated throughout the research services be it within the ministry of agriculture in scotland within the afrc or following the speech of the noble lord lord blease to an extent in northern ireland <e> <s> i have been impressed when visiting hillsborough in northern ireland by the high quality of research undertaken there <e> <s> it is very much part of the complex and wide though sometimes rather difficult to follow structure of agricultural research <e> <s> one can add to that the research associations university research work <e>", "<cs> i should like to commend this amendment to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i speak as chairman of an advisory committee for an arboretum in hampshire administered by hampshire county council <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that there would be grave risk to an extremely important collection of over trees different species if it were to go out to competitive tendering <e>", "<cs> my lords i must immediately declare an interest because i am chairman of the agricultural and food research council <e> <s> i hope the previous speaker will not mind if i do not follow him in speaking on the role of nutrition and nutritional research as clearly i have only a short time to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout this debate we have quite rightly been reminded time and time again of mans great ability to pollute his environment and to pollute his world <e> <s> again we are correctly told that much of the global pollution is irreversible <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that a very real contribution can be made to pegging the increasing levels of c in our atmosphere by forestry and that therefore the present lack of planting particularly in the private sector is a matter of long-term concern in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the findings of the southwood committee and also of the deliberations of the tyrrell committee is it not good advice for the consumer not to be unduly worried by the scare stories presented in the media and perhaps to take advantage of the low price of beef at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the select committee report and many of the speeches this afternoon have referred to the changing face of agriculture <e> <s> one of the problems is that we do not really know to what extent agriculture is changing <e> <s> we know that it is changing but the implications are not clear <e> <s> the select committee report points to conflicting evidence about the acreage that will go out of production in this country <e>"]
