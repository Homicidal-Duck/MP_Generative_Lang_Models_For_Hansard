["<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs for taking this early opportunity of acquainting <e>", "<cs> the first democratic election <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise simply to say that of course we welcome the bill and appreciate the manner in which the noble lord has moved the second reading <e> <s> as he has said papua new guinea was brought to independence by australia in whose trust and within whose administration it remained until september <e> <s> it then became an independent state but because it was brought to independence by another state the normal procedure of independence acts by this country did not need to be followed <e> <s> nevertheless certain consequential amendments in our own law are necessary <e> <s> the noble lord has described them and they are of course principally adjustments dealing with the status of citizens of png papua new guinea western samoa and nauru <e> <s> the bill does that by adding those three countries to the list of commonwealth countries in the british nationality acts as we have heard making the citizens of those countries commonwealth citizens under united kingdom law <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he of course realises does he not that i was in no way suggesting that the movement of welsh lamb to france is covered by this package order <e> <s> but it is surely right to remind our friends and allies across the channel that when a package like this in this case in relation to third countries rests so much on implementation generally by the community so that practice should be borne in mind on their own hearth and with their own nearest and dearest <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord for explaining the contents of this bill so fully <e> <s> as he said what makes this territory and the bill unique is that for many years the new hebrides have been a condominium administered by france and ourselves and on the whole very happily <e> <s> the population of about divided as it is linguistically and religiously as to about per cent <e> <s> anglo-protestant and about per cent <e> <s> french-speaking roman catholic has on the whole proved amenable to compromise and co-operation <e> <s> but as the noble lord said the progress through the various stages of self-government and on to independence has not been easy <e> <s> i was myself concerned with this for some years as minister of state dealing with m dijoud and his predecessor m olivier <e> <s> it is therefore the more interesting that this territory as a whole will on independence achieve that status within the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the foreign secretary said in reply to my question that there were members of the security council who would not recognise a free and fair election when they saw one <e> <s> does that include the americans and the french <e> <s> that is what is giving concern not that it is proved that the governor is at fault <e> <s> he has in all conscience a tremendous job and the way in which he has tackled it commands the admiration of everybody and i think the support of everybody including people on this side of the house <e> <s> but the foreign secretary should address himself to the important fact which is most disconcerting that both the americans and the french have joined those countries who would not recognise a free and fair election when they saw one in condemning the way we are conducting the affairs of rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a question to the minister before he finally sits down <e> <s> he referred a few moments ago in his speech a very fair speech to the likelihood that the government would look again at the situation in south wales and i believe that by association he included deeside and shotton particularly in regard to assisted area status if i heard him aright <e> <s> i beg him in any such reappraisal of the possibilities of helping certain parts of wales very badly hit by the recession in any case and particularly by recent developments to include the area of north west wales particularly the area including and surrounding caernarvon about which we heard so eloquently from my noble friend lord maelor <e> <s> and would be in looking at the position in that area where i believe the incidence of unemployment is already the highest in wales i believe that is true of the unemployment count districts look at the possibilities of helping that area and particularly look at the circumstances the almost inexplicable circum <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an extremely important matter and i think that the whole house would wish me to be as helpful as i can to the government in this present situation <e> <s> the united states having run down its chemical warfare capacity may feel that it has to resume it thus adding a particularly horrifying extra dimension to an already very threatening arms race <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support what the right reverend prelate said and indeed welcome the tone and content of what the foreign secretary said <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that this problem cannot be solved by unilateral action whether it be political or otherwise but can respond only to reconciliation concession and co-operation by all those concerned <e>"]
