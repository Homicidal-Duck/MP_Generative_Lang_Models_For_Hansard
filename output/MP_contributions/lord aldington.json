["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for his reply may i ask whether he can please reassure us that the government are aware and will communicate their awareness to public authorities of the damage to public confidence if statements such as this are made during an inquiry <e> <s> the inquiry has necessarily cost the local residents quite a lot of money and they have already seen signs for example roads have been altered and road and bridge plans have been altered suggesting that that particular statement was right and that the government have approved the location at sellindge <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish all of us could show the capacity for exporting fervour to others as the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has shown us today and on other days <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> we have a job to do in the country as a whole to make people understand this problem and i join with others in thanking the noble earl lord listowel for initiating this debate even though he knows that i found it difficult to get through the report in time for this debate bearing in mind that it was published so recently <e> <s> i also join noble lords in congratulating my old friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i do <e> <s> if i mentioned every point on which i agreed with the report because that is in the report i should be here not for minutes which is much too long but for about <e> <s> so the answer is yes my lords and i should now like to bring my speech which i hope has lacked nothing in fervour following the noble lord who preceded me to a conclusion <e> <s> i hope very much that her majestys government are going to give a lead to other countries including the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be in order for me while declaring an interest to congratulate the government on this decision <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether he would not agree in answer to the question about the number of sales that the vast majority of the expected sales will be in the civil and utility field rather than in the naval field which also will be very important <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to bring this good debate for good i believe it has been to an end <e> <s> before doing so i should like to thank very much all those who have taken part and to thank noble lords on all sides of the house for the many undeservedly nice things they have said about me <e> <s> they were quite unexpected <e> <s> i am glad to note that my colleagues clearly still remain my friends <e> <s> that is rather remarkable after all that we went through together <e> <s> i thank them too for their speeches today which have greatly enriched the houses understanding of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend remind noble lords sitting opposite that it was they who some years ago prevented those of us who advocated the adoption of pwr and the building of pwr stations in this country from going ahead and it hardly lies in their mouths to accuse my noble friends of having delayed the adoption of nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to begin by expressing my thanks to the noble lord lord bruce for introducing this motion today <e> <s> we are enabled to spend what i might call a contemplative afternoon on a few of the many important factors affecting the future of british manufacturing industry which are now being widely debated in the country as a whole following the publication of your lordships select committee report last october <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e> <s> i see as i think the committee does an enormous difference between a national plan and a broad strategy and industrial policy <e> <s> this government have an industrial policy <e> <s> they have mentioned it <e> <s> an industrial strategy is one thing a plan another <e> <s> i am not in favour of the plan for the reasons that the noble lord has eloquently and precisely expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question of my noble friend after declaring an interest as a former helicopter manufacturer and as holding an honorary position in that now well-known company <e> <s> i support the points that have been made about noise but is it not a fact that if air traffic control allowed the helicopters to fly higher the noise problem would not exist <e> <s> secondly i draw my noble friends attention to this point <e> <s> is it not rather curious that a government who invest many millions of pounds in developing two helicopters of suitable commuter size should make it impossible for helicopters to provide commuter services in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just listened to a most thoughtful and interesting speech on a subject to which i propose to return later in my remarks <e> <s> however i am most grateful to my noble friend for stimulating all our thoughts on this very difficult question <e> <s> i too should like to pay my tribute to the maiden speech of my noble friend lord derwent <e> <s> i also remember his father <e> <s> i was greatly impressed by what he said to us and the firm manner in which he said it <e> <s> since it accords with my theme i hope he will think that he has a friend at least here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> does she think that it was right for the labour government in to join with others to spell out that parents were at liberty to choose schools for their children even schools which were not run by public authorities <e> <s> does the minister think that it was also right for the labour government in to ratify that matter <e> <s> is it not extraordinary that the leaders of the labour party now propose in flagrant breach of that view to eliminate this liberty of parents to choose schools for their children <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the last two supplementary questions is it not important that the house understands that the assistance given by her majestys government is no greater than the assistance given by governments of other countries <e> <s> it is not as if the aerospace industry is receiving a special subsidy or subvention from her majestys government to advantage it over competitors <e> <s> the industry is being put into the same position as its rivals <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a long time since i have spoken immediately after the noble baroness <e> <s> however i am glad to be able to assure her one point <e> <s> although the comments of the committee on her majestys treasury were made with restraint i do not think that my comments will be quite so restrained <e> <s> perhaps therefore the noble baroness will wait to hear them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as a layman among legal luminaries ask my noble friend to elucidate one point which has been worrying me as i have listened to the debate <e> <s> as i understood it from listening to the noble and learned lord lord denning his object was to limit the retrospective validation of the secretary of state <e> <s> that was his purpose <e> <s> it is a purpose which i have wholly applauded right from my younger days when i learned my law and when i followed very carefully my noble and learned grandfather lord atkin who spent most of his lfe trying to do precisely that <e> <s> as i listened to the noble and learned lord and to the noble and learned lord lord simon my former noble friend i was minded to think that they must be right <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble viscount lord hanworth for giving us the benefit of his valuable experience <e> <s> it is a privilege to follow a number of noble lords who have experience of this subject and who have thought about this important debate <e> <s> i join with others in thanking the noble lord lord cledwyn for putting down the motion and opening the debate with such a carefully thought out and powerful speech <e> <s> it was somewhat like the curates egg i agreed with a large part of it but not all <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend give way <e>", "<cs> phony remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene briefly and declare a small interest <e> <s> i am chairman of the independent schools joint council <e> <s> i welcome the regulations as did the opposition spokesman as procedural or housekeeping <e> <s> i had hoped that we should not get involved in the greater and more philosophical argument about the value of the assisted places scheme to the education system of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is at least one charitable foundation and probably many more which is ready and willing to borrow pictures in the reserve collections but finds when it approaches museums and galleries that there is no willingness at all to lend them <e> <s> will he make inquiries to see that the excellent intentions of the government which he has just announced are being followed through <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend remind british railways that the tracks running through railway stations are part of britain and they could be kept tidier and cleaner than they are at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much pleasure in congratulating the noble earl on his maiden speech and in telling him how much we enjoyed listening to him even though we might not have agreed with some of what he said <e> <s> perhaps i may also say how much we look forward to hearing him again <e> <s> there is one point on which i at least among the members of your lordships house agree and that is that life does not stop at <e> <s> having read his <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am glad the noble baroness has mentioned that <e> <s> i regard the position <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene for a moment <e> <s> as i disclosed to the house at second reading i am chairman of the independent schools joint council <e> <s> i regret the ideological bitterness in the speech of the noble lord who moved the amendment <e> <s> i shall not follow him in that <e> <s> he seems to me to have been properly chastised from a number of quarters already <e>", "<cs> my lords i always enjoy listening to the noble lord lord harris of high cross even when speaking after me he is as unkind to me as he has just been to the noble lords lord ezra and lord williams of elvel <e> <s> however i have learnt much from him and i take some of his words with a pinch of salt even today <e>", "<cs> i must declare my interest again <e> <s> i believe that i have done so twice already in the discussions on the bill <e> <s> i happen to be chairman of the independent schools joint council <e>", "<cs> i do not know the latest position because as the noble earl is aware i am no longer warden of the school <e> <s> i believe that at one time the school still kept the right to administer corporal <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems of such a debate is that one comes to the house wanting to talk about economics and finds that the fine and distinguished speaker from the opposition benches who has just spoken talks about something different <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will forgive me and not consider it an act of discourtesy on my part if i do not debate with her on this occasion although i should have liked to have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the s and s when many of us were engaged in industry british industry was highly successful in many parts of the world <e> <s> its share of world trade was considerably greater than it is now <e> <s> the balance of trade on manufactures was very positive <e> <s> while i am not arguing with my noble friend about the great improvements in quality and efficiency in the past few years is it really helpful to denigrate what was done in the past <e> <s> that was greatly helped as i and many others know by the leadership given within the design council by the noble lord who asked the question and by the display of the results of that leadership which was a symbol in fact more than a symbol in the pursuit of better design throughout manufacturing industry in britain and in the world which was much enjoyed by many people all over the world <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the question posed by my noble friend behind me which the noble earl answered is it not a fact that a large body of opinion in kent joined with kent county council in approving the creation of a new high-speed rail link <e> <s> is he aware that what concerns them is that too little regard appears to be being paid to the environmental impact on the people of kent of a rail link the main purpose of which is not to serve the people of kent but to serve other people <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right in saying that the increase in productivity has been the highest but is he aware that the actual productivity is not the highest <e> <s> is he further aware that when my noble friend who asked the question was secretary of state for scotland the increase in productivity in one of those years was per cent <e> <s> and not the figure that has just been mentioned <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend enlighten me <e> <s> i understand what he says about the importance of regulations but i do not understand how any noble friend of mine can believe in a system which gives to ministers by regulation a power to alter primary legislation <e> <s> i simply do not understand that <e> <s> i had thought this the great point of principle something which we stood for <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the real problem which causes this deficit to the balance of trade on manufactured goods is that we simply do not have a large enough manufacturing industry in this country <e> <s> as long as we do not produce as many manufactured goods as the british people wish to consume we are bound to have a deficit <e> <s> can i ask my noble friend what he is doing to encourage increased output and increased manufacturing capacity to cure this terrible deficit because it is terrible <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> so far as i am allowed to do so i say yes to the question which he has put to me <e> <s> may i ask him whether he realises that i should not have put this question down had i not become completely exasperated over the delays during the past months <e> <s> they have become worse and not better despite the sympathetic treatment from the clerk of printed papers who could not have interested himself more sympathetic noises from the printed paper office and sympathetic noises from the area delivery manager of the post office in my district <e> <s> after all that matters became worse so i have had to appeal to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have a past in this matter is my noble friend aware that perhaps rather surprisingly i am wholly in agreement with the line that he has announced of action to be taken by the government <e> <s> as one who had the privilege of trying to make the old scheme work at a time when the old scheme was necessary and had the support of the then leader of the transport and general workers union i can testify to the difficulties and disadvantages and to the effects from time to time on the port of london and many other ports <e> <s> as soon as conditions had become right i was sure the time would come for the abandonment of this awkward and difficult scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords we all wish to thank the noble lord lord ezra for introducing this motion in a characteristically well argued lucid and very persuasive way <e> <s> my noble friends on the front bench would be very wise to listen to the noble lord lord ezra who has great experience in industry in running one of our great national enterprises <e> <s> in running that enterprise he learnt about british manufacturers who in those days supplied practically everything he needed in the way of plant <e> <s> eveything he says is worth listening to <e> <s> his experience is unrivalled and we on the select committee found his charming way of putting it very telling indeed <e> <s> i thank him and i hope that my noble friend will consider very carefully what he said <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will also listen a little to what i have to say which is very much along the same lines <e> <s> i have a point of view to put and i know my noble friend will forgive me if he does not agree with all of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i said per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that one of the problems of the commuter lines particularly from the south-east of kent to london which are quite appalling is the massive overdemand in the morning and the underdemand in the middle of the day <e> <s> is he aware that it is very difficult to run a commercially profitable service like that <e> <s> i took part in an inquiry years ago and that was the main reason then and it is the main reason now for british rails difficult commercial problems and for the commuter traffic problems in the south-east of england <e> <s> is my noble friend really not aware that despite all the investment in british rail absolutely none of it in the past five to years has come through to the south-eastern region and the routes from london to ashford to folkestone <e> <s> i travel to london every day and i can assure him that the conditions of equipment and arrival times are shameful <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to intervene in this important and interesting debate for the reason that your lordships may have gathered from the speech of the noble lord the leader of the opposition and the noble lord lord bridges <e> <s> i have been appointed chairman of a committee formed by the european communities select committee to consider these matters <e> <s> i shall say a few words on the debate and then quite shortly i should like to tell your lordships about that sub-committee <e>", "<cs> we shall hear it again <e> <s> the noble lord made a new point about the fear of the new eastern european countries that they would shrink away from the european community because of the proposals that he put into the mouth of the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> it seems to me much more likely that as the eastern europeans look at the community they will see a most successful community of nations <e> <s> they will see a community whose economic growth trade and happiness have improved a community which stands free with sovereign member states uniting together in their common purposes <e> <s> i wish the community to develop that aspect further so that it can be of value to the eastern european countries as it has been of value to the efta countries whose main trading partner it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i also thank the noble lords who will be speaking in this debate many of them no doubt at some inconvenience because it is a friday and because we were not given much notice <e> <s> i observe that the working hours of your lordships house appear to be moving up towards each week when other people are claiming that they should work for only hours a week <e> <s> i am particularly glad that my noble friend the minister is able to be here to speak after me despite the fact as i know that he has a full list of commitments today <e> <s> i know also that he has one very important engagement which will take him from the chamber after he has spoken and i am sure that your lordships will share with me a full understanding of his need to leave us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house would like to thank my noble friend for his very competent and comprehensive reply and for the terms in which he and my noble friend lord trefgarne addressed the subject <e> <s> we are most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords that really is rubbish if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief in closing the debate because i took up rather too much of your lordships time earlier <e> <s> i thank all noble lords who took part in the debate <e> <s> i am grateful for all the kind observations made about the report and the committee and also for the flattering but quite unjustified remarks made about me personally <e>"]
