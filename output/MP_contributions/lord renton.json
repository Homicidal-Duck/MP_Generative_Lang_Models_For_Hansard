["<cs> my lords in addressing your lordships house for the first time i should first like to thank my noble and learned friend the lord advocate and if i may so call him as he referred to me my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones for their kind welcome in anticipation of my maiden speech <e> <s> after the three exceedingly well-informed and full speeches which we have heard members of your lordships house may wonder what there remains to be said but i must remind your lordships that lawyers do not readily concede the last word to any other lawyers <e> <s> a committee in which i was involved dealing with legislation recommended that there should always be a scottish law officer serving in your lordships house <e> <s> for that reason i am so glad to be taking <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i think really the point here is that we are using a criminal sanction not after an act has been done but in order to ensure that it gets done by putting people <e>", "<cs> i too had no intention of intervening in this debate but having heard the noble lord lord wigoder i feel bound to remind him of a case in which i had the pleasure and advantage <e>", "<cs> yes and i explained how by chance and by the police establishing themselves at the exits because they happened to have been called there soon enough they got a number of the other young people who were present to give evidence <e> <s> but one can imagine many similar circumstances in which they might have had no witnesses at all <e>", "<cs> i think there is a practical difficulty about the suggestion made by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey that there should be a charge made by the police before fingerprints are taken <e> <s> the practical difficulty as i see it is this the police may in investigating the crime have found some fingerprints and they may well have a reasonable suspicion that the person whom they have in custody is the person whose fingers might fit the fingerprints <e> <s> but they may be wrong <e> <s> however in order to find out whether they are right or wrong it surely should not be insisted that they should first make a charge <e> <s> the making of a charge is a serious step <e> <s> i should have thought that it is much better to let the police establish whether or not the fingerprints can be related to the person in custody before that person is charged <e>", "<cs> i was surprised to hear from the noble lord lord foot that the thomson committee said there should be no alternative to tape recording and his amendment is based upon that assumption <e> <s> however i suggest that there are six good reasons why there should be an alternative to tape recording <e> <s> some of them have been mentioned already <e> <s> they are these first there is the possibility of tampering with the tapes <e> <s> that can be done not only by so to speak rubbing out parts of the record but also it can be done by a policeman who perhaps was not too particular or perhaps even over-zealous by arranging that a part of the record he did not like especially if it was in his own voice should be rubbed out and then he could insert what he wanted to put there <e> <s> that is the first reason the possibility of tampering with tapes <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> with respect i think he has missed the point i was making <e> <s> i was making the point that the tape recorder should have no monopoly <e> <s> by all means we must have tape recorders used <e> <s> there is a place for them <e> <s> they are now established practice <e> <s> but to say that no other method should be used even when the person in detention may prefer it seems to me to be quite unjust <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton but with respect i wonder whether he has gone quite far enough <e> <s> he has pointed out that in scotland in practice the judge never would visit the jury neither would he do so in england of course <e> <s> such a thing is unheard of <e> <s> but when it becomes necessary to find out how the jury is getting on with its deliberations after a very long absence or if the jury sends a message to the judge requiring his further direction in england at any rate the jury would always be brought back into court so that any further direction by the judge would be given in the presence of the accused and indeed of the public <e> <s> therefore if all that corresponds with practice in scotland it would seem to me that the word or could be omitted from the amendment and we would not need the words the judge <e> <s> so the provision would read <e>", "<cs> without daring to deny what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has described as holy writ in scotland i feel bound to point out that it seems to be rather absurd and a complete <e>", "<cs> having heard the two noble and learned lords i am somewhat puzzled by these words in brackets which are sought to be left out by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside <e> <s> when it says <e>", "<cs> i wish to deal with only one point and that is the question of whether on this important matter the law of england and of scotland should necessarily be exactly the same <e> <s> we know that whatever happens the same sort of practice statutorily defined is likely to emerge <e> <s> as an english lawyer i was honoured flattered and pleased when the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton said that we should await the report of the english criminal law revision committee before reaching a decision on this matter <e> <s> but we have before us the criminal justice scotland bill and i should have thought that it was right for us to deal with it on the basis of whether the bill has got it right for scotland <e> <s> if it has got it right for scotland then whatever is said by an english criminal law revision committee should not matter <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he would allow me to say this <e> <s> surely the whole point about the law of scotland especially the criminal law is that it is in so many different respects different from the laws of england and the act of union requires that the customary law of scotland should be maintained and indeed built upon <e> <s> every time we have before us in parliament a criminal justice scotland bill we are building on what has gone before and that is what we are doing tonight <e>", "<cs> i feel very convinced by the argument used by my noble friend lord teviot in his first amendment because as many of us know the expression permit when used as a verb is an ambiguous one and indeed in many circumstances is vague and i think in the context in which it is used here it could be so described <e> <s> without presuming to repeat or elaborate what the noble lord has said i feel the argument he has put forward deserves attention from the government <e>", "<cs> it is with hesitation that i ask that my noble friend should consider this matter further because it does not seem to me to be a good enough answer to say as he has said that permits and authorises have the same effect in this context <e> <s> they plainly do not do so <e> <s> permits can mean either <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether this is the right moment for me to do so but i should like to make a comment upon drafting and perhaps this is as good a moment as any <e> <s> we find in this schedule as elsewhere in the bill that there is a great deal of amendment of previous legislation and especially of the act <e> <s> i think it is highly commendable that nearly all the amendment has been done by the textual method and for that we can be thankful <e> <s> but it does mean a tremendous amount of cross-reference <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and the following amendments which he has tabled really raise two separate issues <e> <s> the first is what interests are to be protected <e> <s> and the second is who is to be the judge of those interests <e> <s> on the first issue i think we can probably take the view that used to be taken in the united states by general motors when they said what is in the interests of general motors is in the interests of the united states <e> <s> i would very much hope that any british government trying to protect the interests of british business people in any kind of business would take the view that if the interests of any business were affected that would be against the interests of the united kingdom <e> <s> i think it is upon that assumption that clause has been drafted but having said that i think it is largely a question of drafting for i agree in substance with what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> there is one small point that requires further consideration by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> your lordships will see that under clause a person in the united kingdom is required <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me amendment no <e> <s> proposes that the words in subsection of clause should be omitted <e> <s> therefore in fact i have covered that point <e>", "<cs> i do indeed ask leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> and i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> in his further consideration of this matter perhaps he would bear in mind that the first three clauses were of course borrowed from the act <e>", "<cs> i shall not endeavour to answer that question <e> <s> it is better left to a greater expert than i it is not merely on the principle that one good turn deserves another that i desire to support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran on his amendment <e> <s> although clause has been fairly widely drawn it looks as though this question of the summoning of a person to give oral or written evidence has simply been assumed in the drafting <e> <s> rather than leaving it to chance it might very well be spelt out in the way that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has suggested <e>", "<cs> although it would be a rare occurrence we could find a situation in which somebody had a lien on documents belonging to somebody else <e> <s> if that were so it would seem to be wrong that that possibility should be overlooked <e> <s> that is the only point i would wish to add in support of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if my noble and learned friend would allow me to say so leaving out the words which i propose should be deleted in fact means that you could not bring any proceedings at all against a person who failed to comply with clause <e> <s> so the question of a defence would not arise <e> <s> there would not be proceedings brought against him <e>", "<cs> i heartily concur with what the noble lord has said about my noble and learned friend and i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> in doing so however may i say that i do it in a spirit of complete surrender and conviction <e> <s> i think that the answers i have been given show convincingly that the criminal sanction is required <e> <s> i only express the hope that it will never have to be used when this bill becomes an act just as it has never been required under the act <e> <s> if it does have to be used i think we shall have to be very careful indeed and it will be the responsibility of my noble and learned friend so far as scotland is concerned and of the secretary of state and the attorney general elsewhere to see that this criminal sanction is not used in any way wantonly <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was dollars and million dollars <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend has said in effect that the two parts of my amendment are unnecessary to fulfil the purpose which i described <e> <s> he has referred to clause <e> <s> i assume in the background he has in mind also clause which extends the act <e> <s> if that is so well and good i would then have to apologise for having troubled the committee <e> <s> however we were told at second reading that clause is largely declaratory <e> <s> it seems to me to be almost declaratory of the existing law <e> <s> if we are declaring the existing law at all i think that it behoves us to do so with some thoroughness <e> <s> however on the assurance that my noble and learned friend has given and i hope to goodness that he is right about this i wish to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very much <e> <s> obliged for that clarification <e> <s> i must confess that with ones knowledge of the act and the practice which has grown up under it i had assumed that my noble and learned friend was asking the committee to accept that a british court would not normally award punitive damages <e> <s> if it be the fact that for example the kind of case that i mentioned from the united states and the product liability cases where the punitive damages can be so enormous are going to be enforced by judgments in our courts then i regard that as an intolerable situation <e> <s> it is one which parliament should not accept especially when we are trying to legislate in this way <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble and learned friend will give further thought to this matter because it will he a serious gap in the bill if we leave it that punitive damages can be so enforced in spite of what we are trying to do in clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say how grateful i am to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i think there is still a strong case for reminding parliamentary counsel who do such a magnificent job for us that even they are capable of still further improvement perhaps on the lines recommended by the committee on the preparation of legislation to which the noble and learned lord referred <e> <s> he has given us another example of what is sometimes called an arcane art which leaves us with long sentences of great complexity whereas shorter sentences and more subsections would make things more easy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as the parent of a handicapped child and as chairman of the national society for the mentally handicapped thank my noble friend for the statement she has made <e> <s> in doing so i should like to say that in the national society the fact that the government have accepted our views on the warnock report is greatly welcomed <e> <s> one can understand that the present education bill would not be a suitable vehicle for wide implementation of the warnock report but i hope that my noble friend will heed the suggestions made for a limited implementation of it in particular with regard to parents rights <e> <s> parents of mentally handicapped children <e>", "<cs> my lords although to my mind there is a good answer to the case put forward by the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble lord lord mishcon i think it would be better if the answer to it came authoritatively from the front bench instead of less authoritatively from me <e> <s> therefore i wish to confine myself to the point made by my noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> on the assumption that the driver is going to remain liable under this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i concede as my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has said that this is a very narrow point indeedi can envisage and perhaps other noble lords would do so as well the rare case in which it was said that the accused although he had taken such steps as were reasonable in the circumstances had not done all that he might have done <e> <s> the imagination of the tribunal might be used even at the suggestion of the prosecution to think up something else he might have done and did not do <e> <s> the use of the word all would give rise to just that situation in an admittedly rare case <e> <s> that being so i do think that the plea which has been made to my noble and learned friend to take this away and consider it again would be better than having a division upon it <e> <s> i do therefore appeal to my noble and learned friend not to close his mind at this point and force the house to a division but to say he will think about it further <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some reluctance that i intervene at this stage because it is said that we are dealing with minor and consequential amendments <e> <s> nevertheless the rehabilitation of offenders is a matter which can be of very great importance to individuals <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords again one is grateful to my noble fiend lord mansfield for his explanation <e> <s> here i am able to praise the draftsman because in these very complicated amendments he has used the textual method of amending rather than the non-textual <e> <s> but on the drafting of it i wonder if i may just seek information on one point it arises at the last line of page of the marshalled list where we see the words shall cease to have effect and at the second line of page where those same words appear and they appear again three times towards the end of page <e> <s> i have always understood that the words cease to have effect do not have the result of actually deleting those words from the statute which we are seeking to amend <e> <s> in other words we are saying those words shall remain in the statute but shall cease to have effect <e> <s> that is not repealing <e> <s> but the intention here seems to he to repeal <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be convenient if i make a few brief comments following what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has said <e> <s> he suggested earlier that the government might very well provide notes on clauses or at any rate enable us to see them in the library <e> <s> there are good precedents for that <e> <s> i think that when the noble and learned lord lord gardiner was lord chancellor he broke with precedent and made notes on clauses available whether in that way or in some other way i am not sure <e> <s> but it is certainly very helpful especially during the committee stage of a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will agree with me when i say that my noble friend lady pike has done a great service by telling us in great detail of the work of the wrvs work which we greatly admire under her distinguished chairmanship <e> <s> think she came very close indeed to saying and i hope that she will not mind my pointing this out that in addition to the work which traditionally has fallen upon the wrvs they should also take on the work which used to be done by the civil defence organisation <e> <s> she seemed to me to come very close indeed to that <e> <s> i shall be coming back to the part to be played by volunteers but before i go any further i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lord murton of lindisfarne upon his maiden speech <e> <s> i am delighted that he made it on this occasion bearing in mind his very distinguished service as an officer in the territorial army <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that clarification and i am sure the true position is as my noble friend has stated it <e> <s> the noble lord lord shinwell said that we want a vast army of volunteers <e> <s> i think that is a slight contradiction in terms expressed in that way <e> <s> we assume that the opportunities given the needs of the moment the building on existing societies will produce a lot of volunteers but each of the volunteers must have a specific job or jobs to do and only the local authorities can ensure that that happens <e> <s> therefore we get back to this proposition that whatever the degree of independence of each of the voluntary bodies may be there has still to be some kind of direction and that direction has got to come from the <e>", "<cs> my lords a further reason for supporting this amendment is that if we turn to clause we find that the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster when referred to in this bill is to be considered to be the chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house to speak again i think that the noble lord lord reigate <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take that advice but i think my noble friend will have to reconsider what he said about the effect of the use of the words chancellor of the duchy of lancaster <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the further progress of the bill in this house as well as in another <e>", "<cs> i beg to differ from my noble friend lord eccles <e> <s> in doing so i speak as chairman of the national society for the mentally handicapped in which so many members on both sides of this committee have taken an active and helpful part <e> <s> i do <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all your lordships have been impressed as i have by the sincerity of my noble friend lady young and her desire to help <e> <s> one particularly welcomes her undertaking to give further thought to clause relating to information <e> <s> however to the extent that the crux of my noble friends argument is that the effect of accepting this amendment would be to place contradictory duties on local education authorities i wish to take up the point made by lord stewart <e> <s> it seems to me that there will be no simultaneous contradiction if the job is properly carried out <e> <s> in other words in this bill we are assuming that the provisions with regard to special education and handicapped people in the act are to remain until the warnock legislation comes on to the statute book <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i have been through this report pages of it but i have not read every word <e> <s> however i have been through as one does the summary of recommendations and i cannot find anything in that summary which deals with parental choice as a specific recommendation or parental right of appeal <e> <s> i cannot find the equivalent in other words of clauses and of the bill <e> <s> it is implied in the discussion in various parts of the warnock report that parents should be consulted and properly informed <e> <s> to that extent the provisions of clause are anticipated by warnock <e>", "<cs> i should like to remind my noble friends on the front bench that the royal commission on legal services in its report last year recommended that there should be mandatory grants for those who wish to study for the vocational training for the bar or the solicitors branch of our profession <e> <s> i am sure that the desirability of having a broad social spread of entry to both branches of the profession is one which would commend itself to your lordships in the public interest <e> <s> i am glad to say that for many years we have had a fairly broad social spread and some of our very distinguished judges in the higher judiciary have come from fairly humble social backgrounds <e> <s> nevertheless recent times have shown that it is not easy for all those who might do well in the profession and ultimately make fine judges to find the wherewithal to go through with the professional training which necessarily lasts some years <e>", "<cs> i wish to ascertain the governments intentions with regard to the provisions of milk in special schools <e> <s> at present under the education milk act all children at special schools get free milk whether they are in maintained or non-maintained schools and so do children under years of age <e> <s> i think there is some confused and sometimes rather political thinking about the supply of free milk in schools <e> <s> a few children including some handicapped children have an obesity problem and may be better without milk <e> <s> then there are some other children who are allergic to milkthey simply do not like it and will not take it <e> <s> but most children including handicapped children do need milk and benefit from it <e> <s> i am concerned to see that all those children who are at special schools get it if they need it <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend be so good as to answer the point i made about special schools <e>", "<cs> it was not on the drafting point it was on the question of what is to be the future of supplied milk to special schoolsthat was what i was asking <e>", "<cs> my lords i mustcome cleanto your lordships <e> <s> after my noble friend lord reigate had carried his amendments giving the responsibility for the appointment of the trustees to the crown on the advice of the prime minister i rose and mentioned that i thought that a consequential amendment might be needed on the lines now proposed but i agree with my noble friend lord reigate that this amendment does not seem to be necessary atfer all <e> <s> it brings us to the strange position which so far as i know is unprecedented that we shall have in this fairly short bill two identical definitions of the expressionthe ministers as my noble friend lord reigate has pointed out <e> <s> it is unnecessary and it is tauto <e>", "<cs> this is the only really complicated clause in the bill <e> <s> therefore i feel justified even at this late hour in asking a government spokesman whether he would be so good as to resolve any doubts that one might have partly about its effect but also because i should be interested to know about the timing of the various stages which arise under this clause and under the appointed day provision in clause <e> <s> we find in clause that certain provisions of the act of <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships would not find it insupportable to hear the opinion of a fourth lawyer in succession may i say that i am sure that the members of our profession would not wish to claim any kind of monopoly of representation before these appeals committees <e> <s> but at the same time as has been pointed out by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and by other noble lords there may well be occasions when it would be to the advantage of all concerned for a lawyer to be there <e> <s> therefore i hope that we may regard the words to be represented in the broadest sense and without any restriction <e>", "<cs> my lords one has some sympathy with this amendment subject to what my noble friend the minister of state may say <e> <s> i must confess that a fear which i have is that if these appeals are not heard in private they will become the subject of wrangle in the local press which i think would be regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be in order during this discussion for i feel it might save time to refer to amendment no <e> <s> to clause which covers the same point <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness lady david will forgive me i shall not speak to her amendment because it deals with a point that is separate from the points raised in the amendments of my noble friend in relation to special schools and children in need of special educational treatment handicapped children <e> <s> in this respect i mention in particular amendment no <e> <s> because as my noble friend rightly pointed out it is the one amendment that mentions the special schools and the handicapped though of course the operative amendments are really amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i do so with deep regret but with respect for my noble friends integrity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigoder has made this case in if i may say so a very restrained manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether he can confirm that it appears to be the deliberate policy of the soviet government to round up and imprison all those people who might try to get support from visitors to the olympic games <e> <s> secondly what is the latest information that he may have about anatoli shcharansky a jewish dissident who has been treated with exceptional severity <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that i speak following such an experienced economist as the noble lord lord balogh for i am but a simple lawyer and i have always found that economics is a strangely inexact science on which economists frequently disagree as indeed the noble lord himself pointed out <e> <s> they seem to disagree even more than lawyers do on some legal matters <e> <s> the noble lord started by referring to mrs thatcher and said he was grateful to her for her monetary policy <e> <s> but lest monetarism should become a sort of football in the political-economic game i would remind your lordships that mr denis healey when opening his budget statement in another place in april said <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the use of the word monitor in relation to the senior judge will my noble friend make it clear whether this is to be a once-and-for-all inquiry to be followed by a report or is it to be what could otherwise be called an ongoing exercise <e>", "<cs> it is with some hesitation that i rise to speak on this subject because i never made the deep study which many of your lordships have in spite of many years in another place of the national insurance scheme and the various modifications of it which have been made over the years <e> <s> i find that having been a member of your lordships house for a relatively short time i am always learning and being surprised <e> <s> one of the surprises i have come across this evening is that apparently after a matter has been discussed thoroughly in another place we are free in your lordships house to propose amendments which would lead to an increase of no less than million in the taxpayers commitment and for that reason alone i should have thought we would be very chary indeed about accepting amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may venture to comment on the point made by the noble lord lord wells-pestell when he complained that in considering this part of this bill we were embarrassed by the fact that there is a social security no <e> <s> bill passing through another place <e> <s> whether or not that bill might one day amend the contents of this bill i suggest that there is nothing we can do about it <e> <s> there does not appear to me as i hope to explain to your lordships to have been any <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether your lordships would bear with me as what i said has been challenged <e> <s> first as regards what was said by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones whose parliamentary experience is exactly the same length as my own though his is much more distinguished i would again resort if i may to <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord lord wells-pestell will not think that i am quibbling with him when i say that i have a great deal of sympathy with his use of the word inadequate but no sympathy at all with his use of the word feckless in this context <e> <s> i hope my noble friend on the front bench will give very careful attention to what the noble lord lord wells-pestell has said but how far we should legislate in order to protect people who are so feckless to use the word used by the noble lord that they are not prepared to co-operate with public authority when attempts are being made to help them i find very difficult to swallow <e>", "<cs> i really do think that the noble lord lord wells-pestell is under a misapprehension <e> <s> some of us have experience of these things <e> <s> i myself was responsible under the home secretary for the prison service for several years and have taken part in another place in legislation dealing with these very matters <e> <s> if i may say so i think that in the remarks the noble lord has just made in his second intervention on this amendment of his he was doing an injustice to the aftercare officers because it is among the prime <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all your lordships have great sympathy with the case that has been put forward by the noble lord lord wells-pestell and supported by the noble lord lord underhill at any rate to the extent of the motives behind it <e> <s> it is very difficult for us to legislate in clear terms which will have certainty of legal effect yet which will at the same time be understood by the people who will be affected by that legislation when it comes to working out in detail the arrangements as they affect individuals <e>", "<cs> i think that one of the important things that we should be sure about is that the information is as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has mentioned kept up to date <e> <s> in effect that is going to mean annual changes in the information given because it has become the habit of governments at the behest of parliament to make changes annually not only in the amounts involved that would be an easy matter but also as the law and the practice evolves in the substance of the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede i would have said that one is bound to agree with my noble friend lord trefgarne that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> it attempts to do two things first to insist that the successor company should formulate proposals <e> <s> but it is unthinkable that the successor company could carry on without formulating proposals for research and development quite unthinkable in the very nature of its obligations under this bill <e> <s> therefore to that extent the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i too am grateful to my learned friend lord long for his explanation <e> <s> frankly as has been said by the noble lord lord bruce of donington we have a very confused situation before us as a result of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> like him i have no objection to the substance of the amendment but i feel that it is leading us into an unsatisfactory structure so far as this legislation is concerned <e> <s> if noble lords will be so good as to turn to clause as it now stands without the amendment we see that it says that the provisions of schedule to this bill shall have effect <e> <s> if we turn to schedule we see that it is headed limits on financial assistance under industry act section <e> <s> it so happens that subsections and of this amendment no <e> <s> also in effect however it has been done in relation to the previous legislation limit the financial powers that may be used <e>", "<cs> i am deeply obliged to my noble friend lord trenchard <e> <s> when he says that these will be embodied into the act he presumably means a consolidation act in due course and if so when is that consolidation act likely to be put before us <e> <s> my other point is this <e> <s> with the deepest respect to him may i remind my noble friend that the drafting of statutes is the responsibility not of parliamentary counsel but of ministers <e>", "<cs> on clause i have a very small point on which i think it would be <e>", "<cs> this is a short point but it might be of interest to your lordships and perhaps of importance <e> <s> in subsection of clause we find that <e>", "<cs> my lords surely what old-age pensioners want and may i say that i speak as one is to ensure that their standard of living keeps pace with the increases in prices <e> <s> old-age pensioners are not envious people <e> <s> they do not wish to make a claim for an improved standard of living for themselves because of the accident it may be a mere accident and it may not necessarily be an accident to the national advantage that in a particular year earnings happen to increase by an abnormal amount in that particular year <e> <s> what they are interested in is their own standard of living and the yardstick for deciding what they should have in order to achieve that aim is surely information about prices and earnings should be regarded therefore as irrelevant <e>", "<cs> i am glad that my noble friend lord bellwin has decided to look at this amendment again because undoubtedly my noble friend lord selsdon put forward a very convincing argument <e> <s> at this stage i should like to make an appeal to the noble lord lord mishcon because the amendment which he moved no <e> <s> a has basically the same intention the same purpose as that of my noble friend lord selsdon <e> <s> but of course my noble friends amendment has the advantage that it will be unnecessary to make what i would call risky actuarial assumptions <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that i hope my noble friends amendment will not be accepted <e> <s> for a third of a century i represented a huge rural constituency and throughout that time the bus services declined <e> <s> they declined for various reasons with which at this

made it clear <e> <s> what i tried to point out was that the noble and learned lords amendment purports to make statutory a procedure in which in first instance the unions are judges in their own cause and finally under that procedure they go to an independent review committee whose members however impartial however learned however distinguished are people who are associated with particular attitudes which are being strongly contested on both sides of this committee <e> <s> in the circumstances i should have thought that we should have to consider whether we were letting justice be done and appear to be done by accepting the noble and learned lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to set at rest the mind of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the whole of your lordships committee have listened with admiration to the candid statement made by my noble friend lord gowrie <e> <s> i took particular note because before he spoke i was hoping briefly to address your lordships on the matter of what he said about the effect of the opinion so far expressed by the european commission on human rights <e> <s> but there was one very important point which was brought out

which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express my thanks to my noble and learned friend for what he has said in the second part of his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that it is perhaps understandable that parliamentary draftsmen are primarily and properly concerned with the need to obtain precise legal effect and that in doing so they may very well overlook the needs of the ultimate user but that ministers seeing the drafts of the bills in a more detached way might well apply their minds to the best ways of achieving that <e>", "<cs> my

with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly relieved by that explanation but the noble lord lord winstanley asked whether the bill went far enough and proceeded to give reasons for its going further <e> <s> meanwhile perhaps i can assure him as to some of those reasons <e> <s> for example he said that inquests were expensive <e> <s> as was pointed out by the noble lord lord boston of faversham there will be less expense incurred if sometimes the inquest can be transferred from one coroner to another so the bill may be said to save money <e> <s> lord winstanley then said that inquests were time-consuming if the coroner does not have to view the body some time will be saved there too <e>", "<cs> my lords how much is this costing the british taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble and learned friend for that most encouraging reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether in order to maintain and perhaps even improve upon the present momentum in this vital work he is quite satisfied that enough parliamentary counsel are being devoted to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is no company in this country which has done more to keep this country in the forefront of technological progress in the sciences of peace and war than the ferranti company but that in order to achieve their successes they have in the past mostly done best when they were independent <e> <s> therefore one welcomes the difficult decision which the government have had to make which underlines the need for independence <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with all that my noble and learned friend has said but i wonder whether before he sits down he would be so good as to make two points clear <e> <s> the first is bearing in mind the doubts that have been expressed during the debate in your lordships house about the meaning of deeply-held personal conviction can we be sure that the tribunals which have to resolve this question in individual cases will be entirely free from doubt and what steps may be taken to ensure that they are free from doubt <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i am sure that the fault was mine <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has resolved our doubts as to whether the expression deeply-held personal conviction can include political convictions <e> <s> he has made it abundantly plain that it can <e> <s> however doubts were expressed about that point during the debate and naturally one wonders whether the tribunals which have to decide these matters will be entirely free from doubt in their own minds <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my second point was that if the european court when it finally decides this matter having considered the bill or if it has gone on to the statute book the act of parliament feels that further clarification is needed in our law in order to carry out their decision will the government then take action by asking parliament to amend the law accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will allow me to intervene since he has just mentioned the part that he played a notable and distinguished part if i may say so as chairman of the conservative party <e> <s> in view of what he has just said i wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is a desire to finish this very important debate and reach a decision before dinner

respect not validly made in this debate by noble friends for whom i have enormous regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the opportunity to do what my noble friend lord gisborough has just suggested has passed <e> <s> we are now making lords amendments to the bill which will go back to the commons and in the commons they can only suggest amendments which are consequential to those which we have made or which would negative them <e>", "<cs> my lords my remaining amendments will not be moved <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a good deal with which i disagreed in the speech of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby but i am sure he will be better answered by my noble friend lord gowrie than by me <e> <s> i wish to be brief so i move to other matters <e> <s> having taken part in the proceedings in another place on the and acts it has been a great privilege as well as interesting for me to have taken part in the proceedings in your lordships house in these calm informative and constructive debates which in my opinion have lost <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that the great advantage of having separate and parallel bills for scotland is that when there are united kingdom and great britain bills dealing with the law of both countries the scottish draftsmen may concentrate their efforts upon basing their bills on scottish law <e> <s> is he also aware that the demand for this committees report throughout the commonwealth including scotland has been so great that it is now out of print <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord say when printing will be resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that the making of this statement today will be greatly welcomed by all concerned with the administration of the criminal law and that

my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble and learned friend for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that the bill proposed by the noble and learned lord lord scarman was not in accordance with all the recommendations of the committee on <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and my noble and learned friend lord hailsham to keep open minds on this rather more narrow but very important point which i have raised about judicial interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble and learned friend for that very encouraging and satisfactory reply <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that the more the detail that has to be written into a bill the more desirable it is to define the purpose underlying that detail so that it may be better understood <e>", "<cs> having spent four and a half years an unconscionably long time as a junior minister in the home office i find myself in some difficulty over amendment no <e> <s> which is the crux of the matter <e> <s> before we surrender the home secretarys power to appoint chief constables of all the forces in england and wales i think we should bear in mind that although they are separate forces there is really only one career structure <e> <s> it is in the national interest that there should be some kind of co-ordinating responsibility which only the home secretary can exercise to ensure that the best men reach the top or the tops as it may be of that career structure <e> <s> therefore i would hope that the government would not accept that part of amendment no <e> <s> which applies to the appointment of chief constables and indeed the determination of the force establishment because there we have a very large amount of central funds involved <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be well known to your lordships especially to noble and learned lords that the law commission always have more on their plate than they can readily digest <e> <s> therefore one hopes that when this matter is referred to the law commission as i hope it has already been they will not find there are so many other matters of pressing urgency that this must go to the end of the queue <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is able to give us any idea of the degree of priority which this matter will have but certainly it should not be long postponed <e>", "<cs> it may help noble lords opposite if i were briefly to make two points <e> <s> first the negative resolution is not just a slip through method <e> <s> experience in both houses has shown that in deciding whether there should be a prayer against a negative resolution members on both sides of both houses have to apply their minds to the matter much more than they do in the case where there is merely an affirmative resolution tabled by the government <e> <s> thus the negative resolution is a democratic process just as much in some ways as is an affirmative resolution <e> <s> but there is an even greater difficulty about having too many requirements for affirmative resolutions written into the statute book <e>", "<cs> first as to amendment no <e> <s> it does seem to me that the words if he thinks fit are quite unnecessary and from a purely drafting point of view should come out <e> <s> this subsection gives power to the secretary of state to direct a local authority or a development body to submit to him a special report <e> <s> well he is not going to use that power unless he thinks fit <e> <s> therefore to write into the statute if he thinks fit is quite absurd <e>", "<cs> i hope i shall not be thought stuffy if i refer briefly to amendments nos <e> <s> and both of which are amendments to subsection which merely gives the secretary of state power to direct a local authority to make a special report on the matters specified in sub-paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i accept what my noble friend says but it does not seem to me that the words in lines to really meet his point and as he says he is going to have a look at these two subsections again i trust that he will look at those phrases <e> <s> they do cancel each other out <e> <s> on that understanding i would be glad to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i would simply add that it is rather strange when the bill itself does not carry out what is said in the explanatory memorandum <e>", "<cs> the matter is not quite as simple as has appeared even from the last two speeches <e> <s> if we turn to clause we find there set out the parts which apply to scotland and those which do not <e>", "<cs> on the other hand if we turn to paragraph of the explanatory memorandum we find that certain parts are said to apply in their entirety to scotland <e> <s> one of the parts there mentioned is part iv in which clause which we are now discussing falls and yet in fact because of subsection of clause part iv does not in its entirety apply to scotland <e> <s> of course one must not hold it against the government that in the course of changes in the bill the explanatory memorandum may not hold good for the rest of time but at the same time having tried myself to find out the territorial extent of the bill to scotland i must confess to a slight puzzlement over part iv <e> <s> also although i hope it is not out of order to mention it in passing part vii gives rise to some difficulty as well <e> <s> i think that the matter could well be clarified in due course by an amplification of clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord colville of culross for his reference to the need for consolidation and to his reference to the desirability of keeling schedules on some occasions <e> <s> i do not think however that he would suggest that this particular clause would be suitable for a keeling schedule because it merely adds to the existing law rather than making amendments to it <e> <s> i was quite satisfied with the very candid explanation given by my noble and learned friend the lord advocate about the rather strange arrangement of the subsections and the new clauses here and his free confession that it is on page that the mistake is made of there not having been sufficient in-setting into the margin <e>", "<cs> it is with very great hesitation that i dare to challenge a government drafting amendment but this one does not seem to be very felicitous <e> <s> indeed this paragraph will read in the year an amount in the pound shall be specified in each rate support grant report <e> <s> i think this needs further elucidation i do not think we can just leave it as starting off in the year it is too vague too imprecise <e> <s> i think i must ask my noble friend whether he would be so kind as to consider it further <e>", "<cs> yes i am sorry i was one line out <e>", "<cs> may i carry this one stage further <e> <s> it is quite right that justice should be done between education authorities in england on the one hand and wales on the other <e> <s> but england is <e>", "<cs> i desire to support this amendment <e> <s> during my nearly years as member for huntingdonshire the population more than trebled and that did give rise to the most acute problems especially with regard to education <e> <s> one has to remember that the causes of these population increases are threefold <e> <s> in huntingdonshire and indeed the greater part of cambridgeshire of which huntingdonshire is now part the three kinds of increase with which we had to contend were those due to town development schemes of which we had four or five the new town extension of peterborough and the natural increase <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend on that point <e> <s> it will be within the recollection of noble lords that under the present system the rate support grant order does not come for confirmation to parliament generally until late november or early december and already the local authorities especially the county councils are well advanced in their preparations for their budgets for the following year at any rate certainly in full preparation of their estimates <e> <s> if it were possible under this new system to introduce the order a month or two earlier say at the earliest opportunity in october it would make a great deal of difference <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that mentally-handicapped people charged with offences which are not serious are sometimes remanded in custody with most unfortunate effects and in circumstances in which such action is not really justifiable <e> <s> has he any information as to the extent to which the figures he has given apply to mentally-handicapped people and can he enlighten the house about the policy which has grown up with regard to their treatment in this respect <e>", "<cs> may i intervene before my noble and learned friend rises <e> <s> i find this is a very obscure clause in any event quite apart from what has been said by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> we have no explanation of it in the explanatory memorandum and paragraph is the relevant paragraph of that memorandum <e> <s> i think that if on an important matter of this kind affecting the help given by the local authorities to disabled people we are enacting anything at all then it should be set out in a way which can be understood in parliament and outside it without cross-reference difficulties being involved <e> <s> if it cannot be set out in the clause itself i feel that the explanatory memorandum should give some kind of help whereas none is given in this connection <e>", "<cs> i am sure we are indebted to my noble friend for his lucid explanation <e> <s> as he has indicated a good deal of time would have been saved if the explanatory memorandum had helped us at all <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> this is a very important point that has been raised by these three amendments especially the first two and i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> or alternatively no <e> <s> or a striking of a balance between the two <e> <s> in the county of cambridgeshire which owing to its enormous and rapid increase in population has a large capital development programme they have in fact a financial control system of their own based on a -year medium term plan and it really is essential to plan capital expenditure for more than a year

not have a -year plan one may incur costs of development and design and planning which become wasted and for that reason an adjustment such as this is necessary <e> <s> these amendments recognise the need for central government to make adjustments in the second or third years if the state of the national economy requires it and i should have thought that per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> was about the right kind of adjustment that it would have been reasonable to have made <e>", "<cs> i find a conflict between what my noble friend has said so generously about the intentions of the government which would indicate a degree of flexibility and the total inflexibility of subsection <e> <s> i cannot believe that he finds it satisfactory that this bill should get on the statute book with that conflict between the inflexibility in the bill and the flexibility of what he intends <e> <s> i do feel that the noble lord should say to the committee that he will consider this matter further between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall not divide at this stage <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend has given an undertaking to consider the matter further which ought to satisfy us for the time being <e> <s> i would be very much afraid that a division might close the matter <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may inquire out of my ignorance what is the difference in these circumstances between remission and refunding <e> <s> there no doubt is a difference otherwise presumably the draftsman would not have used both expressions <e> <s> but what is the difference <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would heed the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and bear also in mind that the government are surely going to have to make up <e>", "<cs> there is another strange misprint here <e> <s> the reference to schedule should be a reference to <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i am asking the noble and learned lord to clarify something in relation to what he has already said so that we may understand the rest of his speech the better <e> <s> he has very properly pointed out that the hybridity rule applies where private interests are adversely affected <e> <s> he seems to be suggesting that the interests mentioned in this new subsection are private interests <e> <s> in fact they are metropolitan districts or an inner london borough or an area of land which is partly in one and partly in the other <e> <s> it seems to me that it is only at

noble and learned friend for that largely satisfactory reply <e> <s> is he aware that until the completion of <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has pointed out that this proposal will mean no increase of staff in the home office i am sure that is so but will mean a reduction of staff <e> <s> i would make the point that it might even lead to a reduction of staff on the part of the police authorities <e> <s> a good deal of time is spent by the police authorities in doing the ground work in the form of estimates and so on which is necessary for this kind of expenditure <e> <s> also they have to occupy a good deal of their administrative time and attention in to-ing and fro-ing with the central government over these estimates and approvals <e> <s> to that extent it may even lead to a reduction of staff and expenditure on the part of the police and local authorities <e> <s> therefore i would support the amendment of my noble friend lord inglewood

involved in the prison administration in the past and have admired the prison service will greatly regret the nature of this dispute and the fact that such a narrow dispute should have such wide implications <e> <s> is he also aware that the government will have as they have had in this house today the full support of people throughout this country when they find themselves forced because

noble baroness lady stedman and my noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> this amendment is really inspired i am sure the noble baroness will agree by the experience that we had in cambridgeshire in recent years of rapid increase in population due to five or more town development schemes the enormous new town development peterborough and a very high natural birth rate <e> <s> experience has shown so far that although a rapid increase in population gives rise to increased financial burdens especially in education the rate support grants have either not taken account of that or done so two or

masham of ilton deserves our praise and thanks indeed for having initiated this debate <e> <s> not only that she does so for all that she does for the disabled including the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i know this because i happen to be chairman of the national society for the mentally handicapped mencap for short <e> <s> may i say that i am delighted that on the opposition front bench the debate is to be wound up by the noble earl lord longford who was the first chairman that mencap ever had and that my predecessor the noble lord lord segal will be speaking a little later in this debate <e> <s> incidentally i was delighted that one of our patrons the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury made such a helpful speech from our point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but is my noble friend not aware that it is quite absurd to have all the palaver of finding out how much private means mentally handicapped people in adult training centres possess because very few of them ever have any private means <e> <s> is it not time that we changed from a system which so much discourages them in their attempts to get trained for work and enabled to earn a very modest amount which is then taken away from them by some authorities but not by others <e> <s> should we not change the system altogether now <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the question asked by the noble and learned lord and also in view of my noble friends earlier suggestion that we should consult the local authorities may i point out that i have a little list <e> <s> we have consulted all the local authorities and the question which i tabled was based upon the answers <e> <s> therefore while thanking my noble friend for the interest he has taken in this matter may i persuade him to carry it a stage further with a view to ending this ridiculous system <e>", "<cs> i have not tabled any amendments to clause but i suggest to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor that it requires a little more thought <e> <s> i think it could be improved in the direction of some liberality which i will explain <e> <s> of course the clause as it stands is based on the phillimore recommendations in paragraphs and of their report <e> <s> but it is now more than six years since phillimore reported and since then there has been a great advance in the use of tape recorders and indeed in the construction of tape recorders <e> <s> i believe that there are now some quite effective ones which would fit into something the size of a pocket watch and which by way of receiving microphone have something just stuck into the lapel of ones coat like a trade union badge or british legion badge or something like that <e> <s> so we have to think in terms of the general availability and increased use of these and indeed the difficulty of detection sometimes when they are used <e> <s> we want the law to be enforceable and we do not want to create a situation in which there has to be a lot of searching of people in court to ensure that the law is being obeyed <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i should like to say that i listened very carefully to what he said and it would seem to me that the logic of his remarks would be that we should not have anything like subsection <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be discourteous if i did not acknowledge the careful thought which my noble and learned friend has given to this matter <e> <s> however i would simply point out that under my alter <e>", "<cs> i invite attention to subsection which is a flagrant example of non-textual amendment when it should be done by textual amendment <e> <s> the provision reads <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord morris in what he says especially on his second point <e> <s> it is strange in an interpretation clause to have this point of substance made about the time at which proceedings become active when all other such points are dealt with in schedule <e> <s> i support lord morris in suggesting that this point also should he stated in schedule <e> <s> to the reader of the statute this could be regarded as a bit of a trap one does not expect to find in the interpretation clause matters which are plainly dealt with elsewhere in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to appear obstinate <e> <s> i try not to be especially when my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is dealing with a matter <e> <s> i fully accept what he says in relation to the first part of subsection and i take his point that when dealing with the act and the tribunals under it it is an advantage to have the references to it all in one place <e>", "<cs> but may i remind my noble and learned friend that it is not draftsmen who are responsible for the contents of bills but rather the ministers who are in charge of those bills <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged for that implied support and i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that he will have this matter considered <e> <s> in these circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that he will consider the matter further <e> <s> perhaps i might correct what appears to be a wrong impression which no doubt unintentionally he gave <e> <s> he said my proposal would mean abolishing the penalty of arising under the protection of birds act <e> <s> it would not <e> <s> it would mean merely that we did away with the small general penalty of which is insufficient in many cases and we should thereby be ensuring that those cases under the bill which would be covered by the penalty would in future be covered by at least the penalty <e> <s> we should be clear about that <e>", "<cs> would not the simple solution be to use both words so that the provision read in or on <e>", "<cs> again i am obliged to my noble friend for offering to consider this matter further <e> <s> i shall in turn read with care what he has said <e> <s> however he has not so far convinced me <e> <s> nevertheless in view of his undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel bound to point out that this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> illustrate the kind of difficulty and trouble that we get into when we have offences created by ministerial order <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat what i said when dealing with clause but the fact that my noble friend has had to move amendments nos <e> <s> and underlines that it is better to have the offences created by the statute and not by statutory instruments <e>", "<cs> i think that i am in favour of this paragraph but i find it a little difficult to follow especially when we find in the last line the words <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws his amendment and in view of what the noble earl lord avon has said about the european position i wonder whether i may remind your lordships that in a hard winter in this country one will sometimes find a flock of several hundred pigeons go to a field of brussels sprouts and strip it in hours <e> <s> i should have thought there was full justification for using automatic weapons partly to scare the birds away but also to reduce their numbers <e>", "<cs> i too desire to support the amendment and i think we should be quite clear in our minds that these are necessary words of limitation <e> <s> i have a confession to make to the committee <e> <s> the other night when we were last discussing the present clause i was supporting the amendment of my noble friend lord swansea who wanted repeater guns used in certain circumstances and i suggested that when enormous flocks of pigeons were stripping a field of brussels sprouts for example it would be legitimate to use a repeater gun in order to reduce the numbers of pigeons <e> <s> however if the secretary of state is to make an order making it legitimate for repeater guns to be used the order should be confined to a particular purpose <e> <s> the question of whether the elimination of excessive numbers of pigeons can be said to be necessary for conservation is very arguable indeed but i submit that it would be utterly wrong for repeater guns to be used for any purpose except that of destroying pigeons or other pests <e> <s> therefore when the secretary of state is required to consider making an order under clause it would be as well for him to have regard in particular to conservation and indeed the order should be limited to that but there might be very rare exceptions when within the terms of the bill he should have regard to some other purpose such as the destruction of pests <e> <s> at the moment the bill has not made that clear either way <e> <s> i think it right that my noble friends amendment should be embodied in the bill but that further consideration should be given to the question of the use of weapons for the destruction of pests <e>", "<cs> surely the answer to my noble friend lord onslow is that the position is very much affected by the invention of the deep-freeze which enables game to be kept for a very large number of months indeed for a year or two if necessary <e> <s> it is perfectly edible and almost as good as when eaten when killed fresh and hung for a few days <e> <s> unscrupulous people have a large vested interest in keeping large numbers of birds in deep-freezers especially commercial freezers <e> <s> therefore i have some sympathy on this occasion with what has been said by my noble friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> i will try not to widen the discussion too much but i have always had an aversion to seeing birds of any kind kept in small cages <e> <s> i remember annoying one of my constituency agents very much by refusing to present the prizes at an annual show of a cage birds society <e> <s> is there anything in this bill which will ensure that if birds are bred and kept in captivity they will be kept in reasonable sized cages <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain your lordships for long but here we are embarking on what i understand to be a new departure namely we are going to have registered taxidermists yet another occupation which will not be legitimately carried out without the permission of a rubber stamp <e> <s> perhaps that is inevitable but it is bound to give rise to some difficulties and i detect a difficulty that will arise as a result of the way in which subsection is drafted <e>", "<cs> i gladly do so <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his understanding <e>", "<cs> it is with some temerity that rise to express disagreement with what has been said by my noble friends <e> <s> i should declare that i have an interest in a part of scotland where we try to protect the young mallard and teal and other duck which breed locally although not very many of them and also pheasants breeding on the marsh which pheasants love of course <e> <s> we find that the blackheaded gulls are great enemies of these birds during the nesting season <e> <s> it would be quite a serious thing if they were given the complete protection which by implication seems to be sought and i hope that my noble friend lord avon when he is considering this matter further will bear in mind that the blackheaded gull is sometimes a predatory bird <e>", "<cs> before that amendment is withdrawn may i say this <e> <s> such a very strong case has been correctly made out against the great black-backed gull that if it is allowed any measure whatever of protection it is merely an invitation to the breaking of the law <e> <s> people will not put up with the depredations of a bird like this <e> <s> so i suggest to my noble friend that this is rather a case for the government to make up their minds whatever advice they receive <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> we have the classic and terrible case of the so-called siberian wallflower which i believe was brought to a london suburban garden just over years ago and has spread throughout great britain <e> <s> it is now the most appalling pest and weed which spreads so easily <e> <s> the person who brought it in would not i think have been liable under this clause as it now stands and it should be strengthened <e>", "<cs> the operative word is permits <e> <s> if that could be introduced into the clause it would strengthen it <e>", "<cs> i too support my noble friend the duke of atholl because this schedule causes great difficulty <e> <s> i think it is over-zealous and schizophrenic <e> <s> on the one hand it attempts to deal with known pests like the mink coypu and so on and on the other it assumes that birds and animals which are not frequently found at the moment might become so <e> <s> if the thinking underlining the schedule had been in operation some hundreds of years ago we would not have had the common pheasant introduced into this country and probably not the red-legged partridge either <e> <s> i implore the government to think again about the schedule which i think would be unenforceable for the most part <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill and i am sure all your lordships agreed with him said that this was perhaps the most important clause in the bill <e> <s> it is indeed so because arrangements which have existed since the act and which attempted to protect the habitat have completely broken down <e> <s> we have had a lot of evidence about that <e> <s> i do not wish to add any examples except two rather telling ones from my former constituency of huntingdonshire because i know it so well <e> <s> there in huntingdonshire per cent <e> <s> of all hedgerows have been destroyed in the past years

flourished <e> <s> but an over-zealous river authority decided to lower the level of the water table and that destroyed the vegetation on which the swallowtail butterfly depended and we have never had it since <e> <s> something must be done <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> what he has in mind may well produce a fruitful result and i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to your lordships how grateful i am to my noble and learned friend and i wonder whether i may just congratulate him and the draftsmen upon the neat way in which they have overcome the problem of dovetailing clause as it now stands in the bill with the contents of the recently consolidated magistrates courts act <e> <s> i did attempt to overcome the difficulty in a different way by tabling a re-draft in a textual manner amending the act but without altering its meaning and scope <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have said that this is an even better bill both in substance and in drafting than it was when it first came to us <e> <s> it clarifies and modernises the law relating to contempt <e> <s> it extends it where

hesitation and one or two doubts i think that the government now have it about right or as near right as is possible <e>", "<cs> it follows from what the noble baroness lady white has said that if we are to refer to the rights of people visiting the countryside we should also refer to their duties <e> <s> this amendment does not do so but in further thoughts about it i hope that it will <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind that my noble friend lord cullen of ashbourne has pointed out that this procedure is needed in urgent cases i wonder whether i may ask him what is to happen if the occupier is

that one or other of them should be notified in these urgent cases <e> <s> on the bill as drafted and in the light of what the noble lord has said it may well be that the whole thing be frustrated by the occupier not being available <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that mainly encouraging reply <e> <s> nevertheless may i again take the liberty of reminding him that there are occasions when parliamentary counsel are not infallible and that it would be far better if it

the noble lord lord avebury has proposed <e> <s> i am not committed to the detail or the drafting of his proposed new clause but i feel that he has made out a case for dealing with this problem of the further reduction of hedgerows <e> <s> when we were discussing clause and the question of the protection of habitat of wildlife i referred to the fact that in huntingdonshire which i used to represent per cent <e> <s> of the hedgerows have been destroyed in the last years <e> <s> it so happens that a great many of the few surviving miles of hedgerow are along the roadsides and i think we should be sympathetic to an effort to preserve them more especially bearing in mind that the reason why so many hedgerows have been destroyed is to make the fields larger <e> <s> this proposal would not have a bad effect upon farming <e> <s> it would merely mean that fields which cannot be further enlarged by cutting down hedgerows would <e>", "<cs> i too find great difficulty about my noble friends

councillors <e> <s> therefore i very much hope that it will not find sympathy though i regret to have to say so to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i can only say that is an exceedingly happy note on which to end <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that your lordships will wish to join me in congratulating the noble viscount lord bledisloe on his most

for that unwelcome reply may i ask this is he aware that the royal commission on taxation and the committee on the preparation of legislation did suggest what is proposed in this question in fact in the recommendation which the question refers to and that parts of this years finance bill do most fortunately follow the recommendation <e> <s> will my noble and learned friend therefore please encourage those whose duty it is to draft our fiscal legislation to do what is proposed namely to state the scope of the charges and relief wherever it is feasible to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the definition of a trade dispute includes disputes between one trade union and another and that in those circumstances immunity arises <e> <s> will he ask the secretary of state for employment to consider whether there is any longer justification for immunity in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend about access to government departments especially those to which the disabled require to have access <e>", "<cs> my lords while acknowledging in particular the last supplementary answer which my noble friend has given may i ask him whether he is aware that parliamentary counsel above all have a great deal to gain from the use of <e>", "<cs> my lords thanks to the wise and important speech made by my noble friend lord home of the hirsel i shall be able i trust to shorten my own a good deal <e> <s> but i shall refer in passing to one or two points made by the noble lord lord gifford <e> <s> the citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies introduced for the first time in by the then labour government has been overtaken by circumstances <e> <s> it has in effect become obsolete and it is overdue i suggest for replacement <e> <s> indeed it is arguable that when the labour government legislated in in a way with which we are all familiar that would have been a suitable moment for making the change <e> <s> however that was some years ago and it was not done <e>", "<cs> my lords he may not be the ultimate authority but he is a man of principle who resigned from his position i think as minister of state at the home office because he disagreed with the labour government of the day on their policy for race relations <e> <s> he is a man of deep sincerity as well as of great ability and in another place a very great deal of note was taken of what mr alexander lyon said on third reading <e> <s> i think that one is entitled to quote him at any rate to the extent that he denied the racial character of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider myself privileged to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester because for five years i was recorder of that city where i learned to respect him and the robust views which he expressed and of which we have had another example this afternoon <e> <s> in particular i was glad that he referred to the problems of the parents of mentally handicapped children because i have a daughter who is severely handicapped both mentally and physically <e> <s> if i dwell mainly upon the problems of the mentally handicapped as they are affected by the bill i trust that your lordships will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that our civil defence arrangements in the united kingdom are far behind those of most european countries especially russia <e> <s> is he also aware that our own arrangements will not be adequate until all local authorities play their part <e> <s> what steps will her majestys government take in order to ensure that all local authorities play their essential part in this vital matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply and may i ask him whether her majestys government will continue to make it clear to the soviet government that their maltreatment of mr shcharansky and others who have been striving to establish human rights in russia can only damage the reputation of the soviet government in the eyes of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace of coslany was good enough to refer to the question which i am asking tomorrow and i think i should mention that although my question is related to the new clause moved by the noble lord it is in fact wider than that <e> <s> there is a little overlapping but my question is a good deal wider because i am concerned not merely with those people who fail to claim i am concerned with the very much larger number of people who try to claim or on whose behalf a claim is made but who are defeated by the utter complexity of the law <e> <s> the law runs to something over pages of statutes and regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that extremely helpful reply and welcome the information which she has given <e> <s> is she aware that the present statutes and regulations occupy over pages and even experienced people find it very difficult to advise those who are handicapped on exactly what benefits and allowances they are entitled to claim <e> <s> when the government are thinking further <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly also to support this motion <e> <s> since time immemorial jurors have had the duty of reaching their verdict without fear or favour <e> <s> back in we had reason to believe that pressure was being put upon jurors and that was why majority verdicts were introduced with the support of all parties and even with the somewhat doubtful consent of the criminal bar association <e> <s> but unless the amendment of the noble lord lord hutchinson is accepted it seems to me that pressure upon jurors could as has been pointed out be extended and extended in a variety of ways some of them most insidious <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble and learned friend is perfectly right about the presentation to the court of appeal of any particular matter which might have arisen in the jury room and that i am not disputing <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that over-zealous solicitors perhaps in order to try to find out any kind of reason for appealing would start making their own inquiries among jurors to get a bit of inspiration even though they were not entitled to lay those matters before the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i have doubts about this <e> <s> we have enough trouble caused to the profession by having a great many different appointed day orders under various statues <e> <s> if we are going to have this added complication and i am not aware of a precedent for it and if we are going to have different days for different courts then i can see that what is often now confusion will be confusion worse confounded <e> <s> if the circumstances were slightly different from what they are at this moment and if this were an even more important matter i would be urging that we do not agree with the commons in this amendment but as things as are i suppose we must accept what we are asked to agree to <e>", "<cs> my lords owing to the important part which volunteers could play and are keen to play in our civil defence arrangements and owing to the undertaking given about this matter by my noble friends predecessor in looking after civil defence mr leon brittan as long ago as last autumn could my noble friend say when we are likely to get the statement affecting volunteers <e> <s> will the matter then be the subject of a statement in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> since the time factor has been mentioned i should just like to say that i am one of those who feel very strongly that normally we should take plenty of time on legislation because legislation is so difficult <e> <s> so frequently it has been shown that your lordships house by exercising its powers of revision with great thoroughness and great care has managed to improve legislation a great deal <e> <s> but there are other occasions when the public do not expect us to tarry they expect us to correct something which is plainly wrong <e> <s> i would suggest that this bill is one of those occasions <e> <s> perhaps that is irrelevant to the amendment moved with his usual clarity by the noble lord lord mishcon and i should like therefore to turn to that matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is perfectly right and it is obvious that i have not made myself clear to him nor perhaps to other noble lords <e> <s> i am saying that once one has been convicted and even though an appeal is pending one is deprived of ones ordinary civil rights which go with liberty <e> <s> that is what i am saying <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the casualties might be from a direct nuclear hit is it not the fact that civil defence in this and other countries is designed to protect people against fall-out in respect of which protection is possible and also that civil defence precautions should be made in case there should ever be a conventional attack which is just as likely as a nuclear attack <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness lady jeger has done us a service by moving this amendment <e> <s> as she so rightly said the provision of the necessary number of teachers with the necessary specialised qualifications is at the heart of the implementation of this bill <e> <s> but i too doubt whether the amendment is necessary <e> <s> also i doubt whether it is technically adequate if i may say so and i shall explain what i mean in a moment <e> <s> the amendment places a duty and rightly so upon the local education authorities but i do not think that the local education authorities can provide all the kinds of specialised training that would be required <e>", "<cs> i find myself supporting the noble lord lord banks in what he has said <e> <s> so far as i can tell at this moment and subject to what my noble friend may say from the front bench i should have thought that his amendment probably does achieve the purpose which he has designed for it <e> <s> as i said on second reading we at mencap are very unenthusiastic about integration <e> <s> we realise that integration has many advantages for many of the physically disabled and for many others but not so far as the mentally handicapped are concerned <e> <s> i have discussed this with a great many people with parents of the mentally handicapped recently with two headmasters of special schools with two advisers to local education authorities on special education and indeed with a director of education as well and i cannot find any one of the people with whom i have discussed it who says that there ought to be integration into ordinary schools of those who are suffering from mental handicap <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord banks replies if indeed he is going to do so i should just like to say a few brief words <e> <s> having heard what my noble friend the minister has to say on the matter i now have a better understanding of subsection and of the implications <e> <s> speaking for myself rather than <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth has pointed out her amendment no <e> <s> is really an alternative to amendment no <e> <s> and my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> she suggested that it might be a good thing if we discussed the amendments together because we all have the same motive and it is just a question of how our purpose is best achieved <e> <s> may i say that having heard the noble baroness i have a very open mind <e> <s> it may well be that she is right in saying that if parents are to be given this information they should be given it at the earlier stage while the assessment is being made instead of having to wait which they would have to do if my amendment were accepted until after the statement has been made and therefore the further information would merely form the basis of a right of appeal <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend tell us whether her proposed amendment would be an amendment to clause or an amendment to clause <e> <s> it is i think rather important for us to have some idea of that <e> <s> i must say that i started off as i said earlier with the assumption that really we could not expect all the information to be provided or as much information as i hoped to get until the statement had been made and then along with the good advice i had from the man at mencap who has been advising me i drafted amendment no <e> <s> as an amendment to clause <e>", "<cs> apart from the point of substance which my noble friend lord drumalbyn has raised about citizenship by descent with which i have great sympathy his amendment should appeal to the committee as a matter of improving the drafting and presentation of the bill <e> <s> it has been said i have said this myself that this is a bill which has been unnecessarily misunderstood and of course one cannot have bills drafted in such a way that they are always certain of legal effect and at the same time be abundantly plain to lay people <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord mishcon on the opposition front bench smiling at that i think he is smiling in agreement having full knowledge of that <e> <s> there are however times when without impairing the legal effect and perhaps indeed giving greater clarity to it we can make an amendment to a bill which also makes it more easily understood by people at large <e> <s> the amendment of my noble friend lord drumalbyn does just that <e> <s> it is placed at this strategic point in the bill the very first subsection upon which a great deal else in the bill depends and i think that if we were to spell out in the way he has suggested the ways in which one can be a british citizen that could only be an advantage <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has raised an objection that if these words proposed by my noble friend lord drumalbyn were inserted here at this point where he suggests they would have to be inserted forever after wherever the phrase british citizen appears in the bill <e> <s> i do not accept that <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate really feels that that is a difficulty it is one which is easily overcome by adding after the words which my noble friend lord drumalbyn proposes shall be inserted something to this effect <e>", "<cs> there is yet another way of achieving the purpose though it is nothing like so good as that already referred to <e> <s> that would be to include something in the definition clause clause <e> <s> but that would mean that it would be necessary as i shall later propose in relation to the word settled to have a reference to clause <e> <s> i hope that my noble and learned friend will not at this stage turn down this drafting proposal finally and out of hand <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord mishcon has said i feel that despite what the noble lord lord avebury has said there is here a matter worth considering <e> <s> even if i have achieved nothing else i have got the noble <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord drumalbyn and i are each trying in our similar ways to make a further attempt to improve the clarity of clause <e> <s> it so happens that in spite of the discussion that we have just had i feel bound to point out that when we come to clause the definition of settled requires nearly a whole page of description <e> <s> it is in subsection subsection and subsection of that clause and it occupies nearly a whole page <e> <s> as my noble friend lord drumalbyn pointed out we shall have to discuss that when we come to clause <e> <s> but whatever the contents of that clause will be when we have done so it would surely be a good thing to give a guiding light forward at this stage <e> <s> i naturally prefer my own amendment to that of my noble friend because my own amendment is a bit shorter but they are of exactly the same effect <e> <s> therefore i do not know whether it is right to say that i support him but i think he is on the right lines <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation <e> <s> he has raised a point very similar to that which was raised by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate on the previous amendment <e> <s> the more that one thinks about this drafting problem speaking for myself anyway the more one feels like suggesting that the draftsman should be asked to insert a new subsection to follow subsection to cover the point that was made in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> so far as amendments nos <e> <s> and are concerned the point could be covered by wording such as this <e>", "<cs> i moved this amendment because i felt that your lordships and indeed many thousands of other people were entitled to a full explanation from the government as to the implication of limiting the right of citizenship by descent to one generation <e> <s> we have had that full explanation and a very clear one from my noble and learned friend the lord advocate <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate has made a point which i was going to make on clause and i hope i shall not be out of order if briefly i follow him <e> <s> i do not think that at the moment the bill gives him any comfort either in clause or anywhere else <e> <s> if we turn to clause to see what is meant by relevant employment at the bottom of page we find that it is employment <e>", "<cs> this gives me an opportunity of saying something which i hope may be considered relevant to this amendment but which i think should be said at some stage in view of some remarks made by a noble friend of mine in an earlier debate today about the way in which the home office handles the various applications made for registration <e> <s> i say this with due consciousness and being very glad that there is a former minister of state for the home office sitting on the opposition front bench at the moment and a former under-secretary of state sitting behind him and that there are i think three or four of us on our side not all here tonight who have had the responsibility of among other things seeing what happens in the so-called aliens and nationality division of the home office as it used to be called although i am not sure what it is called now <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friends on the front bench could possibly accept the amendment of the noble lord lord spens or any of those that go with it more especially in view of the fact that the government have already undertaken to consider certain matters which are covered by those amendments <e> <s> but what i should like to say is that i think the noble lord lord spens has done a good service by drawing attention yet again to the fact that this clause contains so many detailed provisions <e> <s> whenever we try too hard on legislation we get into the kind of troubles that we have had today <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that my noble friend lord drumalbyn has noticed that in clause we find that the word firm is used and used there so far as i can see for the first time <e> <s> the strange aspect is that subsection refers back to subsection in such a way that one would assume that the word firm had been used in subsection whereas it <e>", "<cs> i had in fact noticed and i am sure that noble lords have noticed the many amendments which are consequential upon the one which my noble friend is now moving <e> <s> all the same i think that we are entitled to some explanation if there is a rational one which there may not be of course as to why it is that in subsecton which my noble friend wishes to leave out the word firm is used but in subsection it is not used <e> <s> i can hardly believe that the parliamentary counsel really intends that the word firm shall be used in its wider and non-technical sense <e>", "<cs> in my opinion naturalisation is something which should be guarded as a privilege and not too lightly granted but there are necessarily exceptions and that is what is envisaged in this subsection in the middle of page <e> <s> but it worries me somewhat that age and physical condition are the only matters singled out for the granting of the exception <e> <s> one thinks instinctively of say an elderly married couple who themselves clearly fufil the conditions but who have a mentally handicapped son or daughter <e> <s> they would not wish their son or daughter to be left out and perhaps they may think that because the son or daughter did not become british they would be deprived of the rights which the parents hope to acquire by naturalisation <e> <s> although from a purely drafting point of view i am not totally sympathetic to the amendment i do think that the special conditions required to make the exception are too tightly drawn <e> <s> i do not say that merely to add the words mental or would necessarily be right but i do think this needs looking at <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness in this amendment and in the series of amendments she has moved <e> <s> she has touched upon a very important point indeed <e> <s> may i say thanks to the initiative of some oxfordshire parents who belong to the national society for the mentally handicapped who threatened to sue the oxford education authority for failing to provide education for young people between and that the right to their having such education was brought to the forefront <e> <s> i would say in tribute to the secretary of state that he supported those parents at once as soon as the point was brought to his notice and i should like to express our gratitude to him for that <e> <s> but it is not quite enough in the context of this bill for that right to be acknowledged under the education act and then to leave the rest to chance <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness because i had not realised i think quite frankly she was speaking a little bit faster than my brain could accommodate the matter that that amendment was part of her scheme but now that she has drawn it to my attention i think it would be an alternative way of doing what is necessary and therefore it may be that the way i suggested becomes unnecessary <e> <s> this is a drafting matter on which we would welcome the views of my noble friend lady young <e> <s> but leaving aside the drafting for the moment i think that in principle the noble baroness lady david has made an important proposal which deserves the support of your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is right that the bill does what we want it to do then one would perhaps be willing to be patient and not amend it in the way suggested by the noble baroness and might be willing to wait until the government have made up their minds about this document on the legal basis for further education and have made such further legislative provisions as are needed <e> <s> but that is a fairly big if <e> <s> speaking for myself i shall want to consider very carefully between now and report stage what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i hope that she is right because it would seem that we would have to wait some time before action were taken upon this document <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i wonder whether the noble baroness is on good ground <e> <s> as i understand it the government have already made it clear that local education authorities have the power to make teachers available to adult training centres <e> <s> the burning question is whether there are enough teachers in general who are trained in giving instruction to the handicapped of various kinds so as to fill the various places that will be needed <e> <s> but certainly the power is there <e>", "<cs> speaking for myself i am convinced by what my noble friend has said so far as my own amendment is concerned <e> <s> she has persuaded me <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend care to comment on the point made in amendment no <e> <s> and i think mentioned by the noble lord lord banks about the desirability of a second notification <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support which has been given to the general principle underlying my amendment and the others <e> <s> i am sure that untold parents in years to come would be grateful for that support if they knew because they will need support themselves and as this is the th anniversary of my wedding i would say as a parent that i too am grateful for that reason as well <e>", "<cs> i do not understand how that has happened <e> <s> we could not pass on until i had withdrawn amendment no <e> <s> and i was only just asking leave to do so <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the last remarks of the noble baroness are very important <e> <s> we should keep this matter open <e> <s> speaking for myself i never saw amendment no <e> <s> a until this morning and so i hope that my noble friend does not think that we are in any way being churlish or ungrateful <e> <s> she is right in asking us to add the amendment to the bill now but i say that entirely without prejudice to our returning to it on report and proposing amendments to it <e> <s> i say yet again that she might well wish to consider whether her amendment is as perfect as it should be <e>", "<cs> i regret to have to say to your lordships in the presence of the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill that i am strongly opposed to this amendment <e> <s> he has based the case on the need for monitoring and co-ordination but those are responsibilities which in any event fall or should fall upon government departments and to have to write into the bill a new quango of this kind would be an admission of the failure of government <e> <s> but i have other reasons for opposing it <e> <s> first is that the money which a quango would cost could be much better spent in various other ways <e> <s> apart from that we at mencap do not want a body of this kind <e> <s> at present we have direct access to ministers and officials in the des and in the dhss and we have excellent cooperation from them <e> <s> we feel that if we have a national advisory committee it could become an iron curtain between us and the ministers of those departments and we do not want it <e>", "<cs> if i may say so with respect to the noble baroness it seems to me that her amendment is self-defeating because subsection creates a concession and one which i should have thought ought to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support my noble friend on this point <e> <s> when people are given the right to do something in the circumstances envisaged here which of course are transitional arrangements they should be encouraged to get on with it and exercise the right <e> <s> if there were no limitation period at all people could very well be dilatory in asserting their own cause <e> <s> therefore surely it must be right to encourage them to get on with it <e> <s> after all they have <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble and learned lord i should like to point out that i was earlier attending a meeting of sub-committee e on european legislation <e> <s> it was a rather important meeting which lasted an hour and a half and that was the only reason why i could not be in your lordships committee and <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend the lord advocate could explain one matter <e> <s> it seems that the high commissioners offices in commonwealth <e>", "<cs> i hope we are not going to make heavy weather of this but it is quite important <e> <s> it seems to come to this that for the first five years after the bill comes into force our consulates in foreign countries will grant registration in their own right so to speak and on their own responsibility and that after five years they will act as a post office and forward <e>", "<cs> very apologetically because the night is still fairly young may i ask my noble friend whether he will look at the words in lines and <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has <e>", "<cs> i had not finished <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend was asking me to give way on a matter and indeed i would gladly do so <e> <s> but to spare your lordships further discussion on this matter so far as i am concerned may i simply say that it must be some reassurance to the people of gibraltar that they are going to have a citizenship which is parallel with british citizenship but which is made different for the geographical historical and realistic reasons that we have been given that they are going to continue to have the right of immigration to this country under our law the right to work and settle under european law and the right to apply under clause of the bill regarding which the conditions in their case will not be onerous for full british citizenship <e> <s> incidentally as i understand it that would mean they would then have to relinquish their proposed citizenship for <e>", "<cs> i have some reason to doubt whether this clause is necessary at all <e> <s> i think that we are entitled to some kind of explanation from the government as to why we should have it <e> <s> of course the numbers involved might be relevant and even if there are small numbers it might perhaps be worth having this opportunity for resumption of british citizenship <e> <s> but bearing in mind the numerous opportunities that are given in the bill to obtain british citizenship i should have thought that it was possibly inviting people to blow hot and cold to fail to make up their minds if we also have a clause which enables them having renounced citizenship to resume it again <e>", "<cs> i a m grateful to my noble friend lord belstead for his explanation such as it was <e> <s> i feel at least equal gratitude towards my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter because i share his doubts about the explanation which has been given <e> <s> perhaps he was not in a position to do so but my noble friend lord belstead has not given any indication of the numbers involved in for example each of the last years for which figures are available of the people who under the present law have renounced citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies and then claimed to resume it <e> <s> if we could have some information of that kind it would help us in reaching a decision if not now then at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may follow up what my noble friend lord drumalbyn has said because i have found some difficulty in understanding this subsection quite apart from what has been said <e>", "<cs> that is a possibility <e> <s> other possibilities arise as well and i should like to know which ones the government have in mind or perhaps all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that section of the act would have been much better understood if the textual method of amendment of previous legislation had been used on that occasion <e>", "<cs> i feel bound to agree with my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson <e> <s> this is indeed a most remarkable clause <e> <s> it seems to be based on the assumption that every british citizen is an adult that none of them is a minor that none of them is a member of your lordships house that none of them is already a convicted criminal in prison and that none of them is awaiting trial and thereby having to have his passport removed in case he should leave the country in the exercise of this right which the noble and learned lord has said that every british citizen should have in all circumstances <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord mishcon for giving way but the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and i were serving in another place when the most fundamental change in our nationality laws was made <e> <s> that was in the british nationality act and no such statement of rights accompanied that act nor so far as my recollection goes did the vigilant opposition of which i was then a member nor did the vigilant labour party bank-benchers who were so numerous ever suggest that such rights should be written into the british nationality bill <e> <s> if one once started to do so the rights of our people are so very considerable that it would have to be an enormous bill on its own <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord must know that the basic rights of the people of our country have been established long ago starting with magna carta <e> <s> they are already in the law <e> <s> there is no need for us to make a sort of botched up new clause on a bill of this particular kind in order to re-write or re-establish those rights <e> <s> if we are to start adding to rights i would insist for example on the rights of the mentally handicapped which have not yet been defined at some time being put in a statute <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is being a little unfair to my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson and myself who have merely stated a perfectly straightforward proposition that these rights should not be stated in the way put forward in this new clause <e>", "<cs> i am merely muttering to the noble lord next to me that that particular right is established and does not need to be re-written <e>", "<cs> while supporting my noble and learned friend may i presume to add just one further point in support of what he has said that the secretary of state is answerable to parliament <e> <s> he has been answerable so far under the present law which is being repeated in clauses and <e> <s> if he is answerable to parliament in those exceptional cases to which my noble and learned friend has referred he must take the responsibility instead of simply being allowed to say by statute that the responsibility shall pass to this committee of inquiry which he has appointed <e>", "<cs> may i just say to my noble and learned friend the lord advocate as one lawyer to another <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend would allow me it is quite true that there was a division on a somewhat similar amendment but not on this amendment which indeed was not possible at that stage <e> <s> indeed i voted with the government at that stage because of the undertaking which my noble friend had given <e> <s> now that i have seen the result of her undertaking as i said i am far from satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank those who have supported my amendment to the amendment of my noble friend lady young and i acknowledge the doubts expressed by two noble baronesses <e>

matter was decided in committee because the government won on an amendment which had been moved to clause by the noble baroness lady darcy <e> <s> i voted with the government on that occasion not because i thought the matter was being concluded as a matter of principle but because my noble friend lady young had given an undertaking to consider the matter further <e> <s> that being so i did not think it was right for an amendment to be pressed against her at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend baroness darcy de knayth has done a valuable service for the house in tabling this amendment and moving it <e> <s> it does not go so far as the amendment which i moved earlier which was narrowly defeated by your lordships and this is the kind of situation where there is so little

next stage <e> <s> there is no party issue or government issue in this matter <e> <s> it is something we want to try to get right in the interests of the parents of all concerned <e> <s> i would have

of his intention to move as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> it would be churlish not to acknowledge the considerable trouble and careful thought which my noble friend lady young has undertaken in preparing and tabling the amendment <e> <s> we should not hold against her the fact that although this is a very important amendment to the bill she gave only a short explanation of it this morning since in fact she gave a very full explanation of it yesterday when speaking to an earlier amendment to clause <e> <s> i have no wish to undo the good work that she has done in saving time <e> <s> i would say merely that her amendment is indeed welcome <e> <s> i still feel that with regard to clause we need to give the matter further thought and i trust that in a few moments i shall have the opportunity of moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i support my noble friend in her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those noble lords who have supported this amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend lady young for her obviously careful and thoughtful explanation of the governments point of view with regard to it <e> <s> this is a matter on which i fear we must agree to differ but i would not wish to press your lordships to go through the division lobby this morning on the last friday in july <e> <s> so far as i am concerned honour would be satisfied if we allowed this amendment to be negatived <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness lady david on this series of amendments which she has explained so succinctly <e> <s> although they cover a great deal of detail i support them in principle <e> <s> i think it is right to stress that this was one of the three priorities of warnock and is really the only one which has not been fully dealt with in the bill unless it be said that the training of teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is agreed among us all that our country probably has as good a record as any country in the world with regard to overcoming the condition of statelessness <e> <s> one should bear in mind however that it is not always the desire of stateless people although we may wish to help them and they may wish us to help them to get rid of their statelessness to become at present citizens of the united kingdom and colonies <e> <s> there are for example refugees from russia i am thinking in particular of the ukrainians who prefer to reserve their position in the hope perhaps a forlorn hope that one day they might be able to regain a russian nationality which they could accept and on terms of freedom <e> <s> but this amendment with regard to people born after commencement of the act when it becomes an act would grant automatically absolute british citizenship not merely as a right but even when that citizenship had not been sought <e>", "<cs> at commencement indeed and i shall deploy the argument for that fairly fully when we come to that amendment <e> <s> meanwhile i would draw the attention of noble lords to clause where we deal with people who are stateless at commencement <e> <s> we do not give them an automatic right to become the new type of british citizen we have imposed certain conditions and it does not seem to me to be consistent with that that we should now accept the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how grateful i am to my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> i hope that it would not sound churlish if i were to say that as a matter of presentation this amendment would be even more effective if it were to follow subsection of clause rather than coming at the end of the clause <e> <s> may i therefore put into his mind that possibility for a government amendment for third reading to bring the amendment forward in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express my deepest thanks to my noble friend for the obvious concern which he has shown with regard to this matter <e> <s> it is a real problem and indeed there are such people we know them i have a daughter who is such a case who cannot speak at all <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be only right that the child should be able to follow the parents nationality <e> <s> i am deeply grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i refrain from comment on that last remark from my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter but may i say how grateful i am to those noble lords who have shown an interest in this amendment <e> <s> if i may say so i am also grateful for the spirit in which it has been discussed <e> <s> of course i would not wish to divide the house on such an amendment as this and i accept the advice which has been given to me that i should withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i shall be only too glad to co-operate with my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble and learned friend the lord advocate was quite right in saying that if this amendment were carried one would need to have a similar amendment for clause to bring that forward <e> <s> indeed last night i tabled an amendment which today appears as a manuscript amendment in order to achieve that result <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what proportion of the nuclear warheads referred to are held by russia <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment gives rise to two conflicting matters <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the views expressed by the noble lord but i am afraid that i would not resolve the conflict in the simple way that he proposes <e> <s> on one side of the argument we want to avoid statelessness we want to avoid people resuming statelessness if they had it before through being deprived of citizenship which has been granted to them <e> <s> on that i think we can all agree <e> <s> as has been said before this country has a very honourable record in preventing statenessless and in removing statelessness where it has arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i find myself somewhat perplexed <e> <s> at committee stage along with other noble lords on both sides of your lordships committee i expressed some doubts about clause the ouster clause because it seemed to me that subsection of it was giving a strange sort of paradoxical right <e> <s> although it was a discretion to be exercised it was to be exercised without regard to race colour or religion <e> <s> but in the nature of things and because of subsection of the ouster clause there was no certainty that the right to have the discretion exercised without regard to those three things was a right which could be enforced and so i said <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the department of employment reconsider the present policy with regard to the grant of employment permits to foreign people <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend lord ferrers if he will explain one matter in relation to scotland and as we have the benefit of the presence of my noble and learned friend the lord advocate i would hope for a doubly wise answer <e> <s> i am surprised and a little worried that at the bottom of page we find the words in relation to subsection of this new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly exercise my right of reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> may i with the leave of the house reply to the short debate which has taken place <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady masham and to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for their support <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend lady young for her fairly full explanation although i regret to say i cannot accept it <e> <s> in the first place in her concluding remarks she said that this would be bad law <e> <s> if this would be bad law what are we to say about what the government have so wisely done on the british nationality bill from which they have deleted nearly every reference to the original proposition that the secretary of state was satisfied thereby removing the objective test and enabling the matter to be challenged in the courts or parliament in a way that could not so easily have been taken had those words remained in <e> <s> i really cannot accept that this would be bad law <e> <s> it might be slightly embarrassing to some of the local authorities if they could not always have the last word <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at once and ease your lordships minds that i am persuaded by the gracious way in which both noble baronesses have argued against my amendment <e> <s> but may i just correct the noble baroness lady jeger because clause does not refer to local authorities it refers to area and district health authorities <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that what the noble baroness said would in her mind apply with equal force to them as she argued in relation to local authorities <e> <s> it was clause that applied to local authorities local education authorities in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i believe her whole speech may have been based on the assumption that the word includes means in this definition means <e> <s> in fact it merely reads <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the two noble baronesses <e> <s> i had indeed missed the point of this definition of child until i heard both their speeches <e> <s> i accept that my amendment was potentially more than a drafting amendment <e> <s> however having heard them both and having learned a great deal from what they said i now am a wiser man i trust and i certainly do not intend to press this to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am sure that all of your lordships on both sides of the house are united in agreeing with the noble baronesses on the labour benches that we do not wish to see the implementation of the bill delayed i must confess that i should be very disappointed if we were to make the target date <e> <s> there are some local authorities that i would expect to be ready to implement the bill on st september <e>", "<cs> my lords there if i may respectfully say so i see the danger <e> <s> if we say that the date should not be later than st september that will cause many local authorities to sit back and say we have plenty of time to deal with this <e> <s> we have lots of problems as it is <e> <s> we can let this one wait a bit <e> <s> no if there is to be a target date i should much rather see an earlier date <e> <s> i think that many local authorities could implement the bill by st september and it would be very sad indeed if they were not all made to go ahead and get on with it so that it was implemented by st september at the latest <e>", "<cs> my lords the government deserve to be heartily congratulated on this bill and on the open-minded way in which ministers including my noble friend lady young have considered the arguments put forward in all parts of both houses of parliament <e> <s> of course the minister initially responsible was my right honourable and learned friend mr mark carlisle who is no longer in the cabinet <e> <s> whatever may have been the reason for his departure he deserves credit for having in this parliament introduced three education bills and for getting two of them onto the statute book with this one to come <e> <s> he deserves credit especially for acting on the warnock report <e> <s> so many valuable reports of independent committees royal commissions and so on especially on education are well received all round and highly regarded but they never reach the statute book <e> <s> but mrs mary warnock and her committee have in their lifetime achieved the apotheosis that they deserve <e>", "<cs> my lords although one necessarily tends to agree with the noble lord that we should not create offences of absolute liability that is to say offences which make it unnecessary for the prosecution to prove a guilty intent <e> <s> nevertheless the defence which he purports to set up in the words in amendment no <e> <s> g makes it much too easy a defence <e> <s> even when one accepts that the onus will be on the accused to prove this all that he or she has to say in effect is when i took my dog there i did not think that it was in a field or enclosure in which there were sheep <e> <s> that seems to me to be much too easy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with apology that i rise very briefly at this point <e> <s> i should have taken the point at an earlier stage of the bill or even when my noble friend was moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i make the point now only for the sake of the record and so that those authorities who are responsible for enforcement of the bill may watch out for the point in the years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very full and satisfactory reply <e> <s> in the development of this matter would he bear in mind that it is now the policy of the government to get thousands of people including mentally handicapped children out of long-stay hospitals and living in the community in smaller homes and hospitals and that it will be essential when they do so to achieve the highest standards <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a further suggestion in a constructive hope that when this interchangeability is introduced into the bill by amendment it should be done so as soon as possible in the bill so that those who read it will understand it for the rest of their reading of the bill <e> <s> if it gets tucked into a definition clause at the end it will not have as good effect <e> <s> i would have thought that perhaps the right place to put it is in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that welcome reply may i ask whether her majestys government will make it clear to the government of vietnam that their oppressive rgime which has caused so many people to take to the boats and to go on the high seas is made even worse by their tolerance of these pirates who act in such a brutal way to the distress of civilised countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that even if there were complete nuclear disarmament there is such a preponderance of conventional soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord foot has made the most useful and constructive speech and i am sure it has commanded a lot of attention from your lordships <e> <s> may i say that i believe the government are fully justified in asking for this act of not to be repealed for two main reasons first because as has been said the prison officers dispute has not yet been resolved and it is better to be safe than sorry <e> <s> but the second reason is one on which i should like to dwell for a few moments <e> <s> it is that the difficulties of prison administration have been increasing steadily year after year for nearly years <e> <s> even if the prison officers dispute had not taken place provisions of the kind included in the act which is not to be repealed would in my opinion sooner or later have had to be introduced <e> <s> the granting of an extra year for considering those matters and for making some of the provisions permanent as the noble lord lord foot has said seems to me to be quite essential <e> <s> there is an almost permanent dilemma with regard to the prison administration so long as crime continues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to know that the noble lord lord kilmarnock joins the growing number of your lordships who do not want the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill to be lumped together <e> <s> my noble friend lord elton in his open-minded opening speech said that this bill was a non-party measure <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace of coslany endorsed that <e> <s> i think that this is a splendid way for us to approach this from both sides of the house <e> <s> i am so grateful to both noble lords for the favourable advance notice that they gave of what i might now say <e> <s> i must try not to disappoint your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for inviting me to amplify and clarify the position <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i say how much we welcome his statement that the government will consider how far they can go in having the mentally handicapped dealt with separately <e> <s> in the event of the government deciding how far they can go can he say whether they will then table the necessary amendments <e> <s> because they will have all the expertise at their command and it would make for better progress if that were done <e> <s> then if we want to carry the government a stage further we can see what we have to build on <e>", "<cs> my lords if and when multilateral nuclear disarmament is achieved russian superiority in conventional weapons is as great as my noble friend the duke of norfolk told us then europe would be at the mercy of russia <e> <s> mr brezhnev has said recently that russia will never surrender her superority of arms strength and presumably he meant her superiority in both nuclear and conventional weapons <e> <s> therefore if and when we get negotiations covering multilateral nuclear disarmament we shall have to embark upon negotiations for conventional disarmament after that <e> <s> i think that the obvious conclusion from those simple facts is surely that the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly comment on what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i did not make any accusation that the russians were supporting the cnd <e> <s> what i said was that the cnd should aim its propaganda against the russians rather than letting the russians exploit the existence of the cnd <e> <s> at least that is what i intended to say and to convey <e> <s> i was glad to hear the noble lord lord noel-baker say that he favours multilateral nuclear disarmament because the campaign for nuclear disarmament seems to favour unilateral nuclear disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and bearing in mind that he asked me to clarify something in my speech i wonder whether he would be so good as to clarify a matter <e> <s> he referred to what the russians need for maintaining order internally <e> <s> did he ask them why they had to imprison and put in so-called psychiatric hospitals and otherwise victimise people who were standing up for human rights in accordance with the helsinki agreement to which the russians are a party <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this excellent scheme for the voluntary training of young people is about the best thing that has happened since the compulsory apprenticeship scheme in the reign of the first queen elizabeth <e> <s> to what extent will the physically and mentally handicapped be able to take part in it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that so long as the world population goes on growing faster than the world food supply we shall be living with this problem for the rest of time <e> <s> might it not be well to point out especially to the russian government that if they could only increase their food production it would help the overall position throughout the world <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has performed a helpful service in moving his amendment <e> <s> it is agreed among all who think about this matter that section of the act is not satisfactory as it stands and that it needs <e>", "<cs> in supporting this series of amendments i wish to thank my noble friend lord elton for the vast amount of trouble and care he has taken since second reading even to the extent of interrupting his short holiday during our winter recess <e> <s> he has taken trouble to meet the strong case which i put forward on second reading on behalf of the mentally handicapped and which was supported by noble lords in all parts of the house and i wish to thank them too for what they said <e> <s> i hope i am not speaking indiscriminately when i say i wish especially to acknowledge my gratitude to the noble lord lord wells-pestell whose experience and advocacy were very helpful indeed in supporting the case i put forward a case which mencap have been advocating for at least five years namely that the confusion between mental illness and mental handicap which arises from section and other parts of the act should somehow be overcome <e>", "<cs> there seems to be an omission from each of the amendments nos <e> <s> and namely what is to happen when the patient is incapable of understanding <e> <s> this may be because of his permanent mental state it may be mental handicap although we do not reckon that mentally handicapped people should become patients within the definition of the act because they are not treatable <e> <s> however supposing the person concerned is not capable of understanding however hard an attempt is made under amendment no <e> <s> to ensure that the patient understands his rights <e> <s> it is very difficult to ensure that the patient understands <e> <s> of course it may be that the answer to this problem which i have mentioned is to bring in a relative not necessarily the nearest relative <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend bearing in mind he has referred apparently with approval to section of the principal act whether he has seen on the marshalled list amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that would repeal section of the principal act and replace it by a provision of a much more familiar and more suitable kind to the effect that <e>", "<cs> there is a small but important point on this bill <e> <s> i have not tabled an amendment because i spotted it only today <e> <s> but i suggest that in line on page after the word occupation the word education should be inserted because there will be cases when a patient may be required to receive not only training but also education <e> <s> the two things have a different meaning in our statute law and i suggest that education should be covered <e> <s> perhaps my noble friends would look at that between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> i am sure that your lordships committee is grateful to my noble friend lord belstead for the clear explanation that he has given of what is really quite a complicated matter <e> <s> i say without hesitation that the government are to be congratulated upon promptly attempting to carry out the wishes as embodied in their decision of the european court of human rights <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee would be right to accept the request of my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thoroughly accept what my noble and learned friend has said with regard to his own position in this matter namely that he cannot take any further action i should like to ask him to inform the house whether it is possible in scotland as it is in england for the prosecution when offering no evidence nevertheless to ask the court that the charges may remain on the record so that if evidence is forthcoming or a witness is able to attend at a later date the case may then be proceeded with <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend can remove from my mind at any rate a little uncertainty and i hope i am asking this in the right place i did not ask it on amendment no <e> <s> where the same point arose because i felt it better to wait until we had both amendments before us <e> <s> i am rather puzzled as to the occasions when respectively the responsible medical officer <e>", "<cs> are we to take it then that the governments view as expressed in the statute is that they do not mind which of these various people or bodies performs this task or when <e>", "<cs> i do not think there was any need for my noble friend lord belstead to apologise to your lordships committee for the length of his statement because these amendments are important lengthy complicated and far-reaching <e> <s> speaking for myself although i listened very carefully to what he said i think i shall feel more confident that i understood the matter when i have read it all in tomorrows <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany the noble lord lord elystan-morgan and all other noble lords will refrain from putting this idea before the house on any future occasion <e> <s> i remember so well and i expect many noble lords do that about years ago it was considered by all parties to be an enlightened move to abolish the so-called criminal lunatic asylums and to have those unfortunate people whether or not they had been before the courts who were difficult in one way or another taken out of the hands of the home office a department in which i served with interest for a great many years and which i admire greatly <e> <s> but health matters are not their scene <e> <s> it would be a terribly retrograde step if we were to try to put back the clock and go through all that again <e>", "<cs> may i suggest to my noble friends on the front bench that in principle mental patients have a much stronger case for legal aid than do many others who already get it whether in criminal or civil cases <e> <s> i say that for two simple reasons <e> <s> the first is because in nearly all of the cases which would come before mental health review tribunals the patients liberty is at stake and the other reason is that their mental condition makes it difficult for many of them although not all of them to understand their rights to understand the issues which arise to sift the evidence being given for and against them and still more difficult for them to argue their cases convincingly before the tribunal <e>", "<cs> i am so grateful to my noble friend for making that clear <e> <s> it comes to this there is no reason why the government should not accept both her amendment and an amendment granting legal aid <e> <s> so there is no difference whatever between us <e> <s> it seems to me that this is an exceptional case <e>", "<cs> i think that it would help us to judge the governments intentions and our own responsibilities if my noble friend lord elton could give us some idea of when the review of the likely cost will be completed <e> <s> if it is to be completed while the bill is still before your lordships house we could quite safely leave the matter today and i very much hope that it will be completed within that time <e> <s> certainly it would be most unfortunate if it is not completed before the bill receives royal assent which will be several months hence <e> <s> if we could be told about that it would at any rate help us to judge the matter more efficiently <e>", "<cs> be that as it may and i accept what my noble friend says about the drafting technicalities so far as this bill is concerned i have a great deal of sympathy with the desire of the noble lord lord wallace to have section of the act repealed <e> <s> it is a monstrosity an anachronism and i do not know of any other case in which in order to start civil or criminal proceedings it is necessary first to obtain the leave of the high court <e> <s> this is a strange proposition because if a judge or master of the high court gives leave for the start of proceedings it by-passes some of the procedures of the high court which enable the court itself to stop proceedings which are for example frivolous or vexatious it stultifies applications for security for costs which in proceedings such as this might very well sometimes be asked for and it is not the kind of provision which should remain on the statute book <e> <s> whether it should simply be repealed and nothing put in its place is another matter <e> <s> this particular amendment says simply that it shall be repealed <e>", "<cs> may i say a word about the two applications which have been made to the european commission of human rights <e> <s> in those cases it is alleged that section of the act is in violation of the european convention on human rights <e> <s> in one of those cases the commission has already decided that this is a claim which is admissible for hearing and the hearing has been fixed for th february <e> <s> it looks as though both of those cases will be as successful as other recent cases brought in the european court of human rights about other aspects of our law relating to mental health <e>", "<cs> they are strengthening it <e>", "<cs> although i feel very great sympathy with the principle underlying the amendment perhaps i have not been a member of your lordships house long enough to know whether this is the appropriate legislative chamber in which it should be dealt with <e> <s> it has been mentioned that this was considered by a speakers conference in a previous parliament <e> <s> i would have thought that if this change in the law is to be made those who are elected democratically to another place should be the people to make the change rather than on this occasion the members of your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> that i did not know <e>", "<cs> i feel obliged to agree with my noble friend on the front bench on this occasion <e> <s> there is a real danger in this amendment which perhaps the noble baroness lady masham may not have foreseen namely that if we specify that some clinical procedures are to be carried out and there are other clinical procedures which might have been carried out in a particular case the fact that the other procedures were not carried out would perhaps be a good defence to the doctors concerned although it should not be a good defence <e> <s> it is far better that we should leave matters of this kind completely open so that as my noble friend has said doctors will do what is necessary in the circumstances of each case <e> <s> when we start legislating in detail there could be dangers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hooson has performed a most valuable service by studying this matter in great depth and presenting it so fully and clearly as he has done to the committee <e> <s> the points he made about patients rights are so clearly well made that i do not think the government could leave the bill in its present state with regard to that part of the case made by the noble lord <e> <s> may i say in passing that of course what is in clause and in the amendments refers essentially to those people who are mentally ill but does not refer to those mentally impaired people who are not also mentally ill and not being mentally ill they are untreatable <e> <s> i think it is right to make that point clear so that we understand each other <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to your lordships for being unable to be here at the beginning of this short discussion <e> <s> i had to attend a memorial service out of london <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat what i said when we were discussing an amendment on the same point moved by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany but i should like to make two brief comments <e>", "<cs> when we come to the debate on clause stand part i shall make a fundamental criticism of subsection of this clause <e> <s> but if the secretary of state is to be allowed to pass the buck to this new quango to the extent that subsection envisages then i think it is extraordinary that the quango should be allowed to get away without ever having to report to parliament <e>", "<cs> i wish to approach this matter from a slightly different angle from that which was deployed by the noble baroness lady robson <e> <s> as i indicated earlier i find great difficulty about parts of subsection of the clause <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i have not quite understood my noble friend <e> <s> is he asking me to repeat which part of subsection of clause i am referring to <e>", "<cs> my last point on clause is that subsection is a piece of legislation by reference so it-is a drafting point <e> <s> sometimes it is helpful and shortens a bill to have some legislation by reference but when that happens and if there is a point of substance involved it helps the legislators very much if an explanation is given in the explanatory memorandum to the bill but there is no such explanation here <e> <s> i hope i am not making heavy weather of this but for those who have to work it it might be helpful especially when the bill becomes an act if clause could either be enacted without legislation by reference or if a little more of an explanation were given <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will allow me to make the comment that functions include powers in our statute law <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to detain your lordships for just a few seconds longer but i think i must try to clear up one point arising from what my noble <e>", "<cs> although i am sure that all of your lordships will agree with my noble friend on what should be the role of the approved social worker the question is what should be the role of legislation <e> <s> i think that we have to be rather careful not gratuitously to go into too much detail because let me remind your lordships i hope that i do not appear to pontificate that the main function of legislation is to create rights and to create remedies <e> <s> if we are merely going to use it as a descriptive vehicle for the various roles of various occupations even those in the public service then legislation may be exceeding its proper function <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a very short point <e> <s> i should like to refer to the fact that under subsection i it says <e>", "<cs> i was one of those who greatly welcomed this new schedule when my noble friend lord belstead moved it earlier in the proceedings <e> <s> the government are to be congratulated on the important new development contained in this new schedule <e> <s> i have just one point on it which puzzles me very much <e> <s> it arises on page of the marshalled list for today and it concerns paragraph of the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is a much larger proportion of people in misery for one reason or another on the other side of the iron curtain than in capitalist europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord elton for this amendment as i am for various other amendments which he has tabled to deal with points raised in committee and if i may say so they demonstrate the great care and the splendid judgment which he has shown on so many of the difficult matters in the bill <e> <s> this amendment acknowledges that those suffering from mental illness or impairment are generally capable of some kind or degree of educa <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord kilmarnock raises a difficult as well as an important point with regard to our obligations under the european convention on human rights <e> <s> it is quite clear especially in view of the experience to which the noble lord lord wade has referred of our being brought before the european court that we should observe the convention and not incur ignominy by appearing not to have proper arrangements for performing our duties under the convention <e> <s> that is so and nobody can gainsay it <e> <s> but on the other hand we have to bear in mind that there are a vast number of matters which are covered by the convention <e> <s> i mention only one the case of the three railwaymen who raised the question of their dismissal under a closed shop agreement when they were employed by british railways <e> <s> there are many other circumstances that can arise <e> <s> it seems to me that if we were to have a special board for dealing with just one of those many circumstances we would be creating a precedent in our legislation for a very wide and differing range of matters <e> <s> it would seem to me that we would have many different types of board <e> <s> i do not really see that there should be a need for that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i am most interested in the argument the noble lord is advancing but if i remember rightly the bill to which he referred and which did in fact pass your lordships house in a previous session while bringing into our own law the european convention on human rights did not purport to establish a series of boards in order to implement that convention in this country <e> <s> as i understand it the underlying implication of the bill was that the existing courts of this country would implement the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lord belstead will give serious consideration to this amendment <e> <s> it raises a practical point of substance which should command attention <e> <s> here we are not dealing with remand for the purpose of further inquiries as to the circumstances of the offence or as to whether the accused person committed it <e> <s> this is a remand for the more limited purpose of ascertaining the accuseds mental condition <e> <s> surely eight weeks altogether should be long enough and justice should not be delayed by prolonging the matter for as long as weeks altogether <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock has made an important point which deserves sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i spent four and a half years at the home office working in the next room to my noble friend lord butler and there were occasions when we agreed to differ <e>", "<cs> i think it may be that the noble lords who moved each of the amendments have overlooked the fact that the bill is not to come into force until th september <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that their amendments do not help us very much because one would hope that in view of what my noble friend lord elton has said the government will use their existing powers under the legal aid act to ensure that we have legal aid before mental health tribunals long before th september <e> <s> if we have to accept either of the amendments which have been moved then we shall certainly have to wait and wait all that long time <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that on any view of the matter the government are right <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether she could enlighten me at any rate and perhaps other noble lords as well about one particular point <e> <s> i had always thought of after-care as being the responsibility of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am properly corrected and i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords the need for after-care is of course clear to everybody <e> <s> the question is under what powers it shall be done and who shall do it <e> <s> we have a probation and after-care service for dealing with offenders of various kinds and the section hospital orders to which reference is made in the amendment of the noble baroness lady masham are in respect of those who have been convicted <e> <s> as i understand it in the normal way the probation and <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord elton when moving his amendment and those that go with it i thought understated the advantages of what he has done <e> <s> he put it forward to your lordships as a mere drafting improvement but i think that it goes further <e> <s> i welcome particularly the omission of subsection of clause which started the process off on the wrong foot and said that consent shall not be required for treatment as the foundation of what was to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a most difficult matter one of the most difficult to arise on this bill <e> <s> as i said earlier and as others have said we should be grateful to my noble friend lord elton for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord and i do not dispute that he may be right that ones understanding of the technical position that arises is not as clear as it should be <e> <s> i would have thought it unfortunate for us to reach a decision at this moment i really do feel that <e> <s> we could all profit if the government were given the opportunity of further consultation in the light of what has been said in this debate <e> <s> whether these amendments would fall or not my instinct would be to let the governments amendments be made but let us invite my noble friend lord elton to consider the matter further in the light of what has been said by noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord hooson has said on this amendment <e> <s> i do not think as has been said that we need repeat the arguments which were deployed fully at committee stage and which have been further clarified by the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to add one or two points about section as it stands and before doing that i must come clean and tell your lordships that i was largely responsible in for section <e> <s> it fell within the home office part of the bill for which i was responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that on this occasion i do not find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> one appreciates the trouble that he has taken to get this amendment drafted and to put the case before your lordships <e> <s> before i go any further perhaps i should mention that our youngest daughter is within the jurisdiction of the court of protection and we have been very well satisfied with the way in which they handle her affairs <e> <s> it is done smoothly efficiently and without any fuss <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend not only for that answer but for the action which he and the foreign office have been and are taking with regard to shcharanskys plight <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether or not the soviet governments failure as shown by the treatment of shcharansky and others to honour their helsinki undertakings diminishes their credibility in relation to all other matters in which they say they are seeking agreement and on which they would like to be believed <e>", "<cs> my lords although as the noble lord lord wallace knows i am unhappy about section of the act and have twice asked the government to get something better on to the statute book i regret to have to tell him that his amendment would perpetuate too much that is wrong in section <e> <s> in fact it would make scarcely any change in it at all <e> <s> i hope that i shall not be considered discourteous if i even go so far as to say that i wonder why the noble lord drafted it and placed it on the order paper because it would make so little change <e> <s> indeed he might even have worded the first subsection of his amendment section is repealed and re-enacted as follows because that is very nearly what it comes to <e> <s> i must therefore continue to press the minister to do something and to do something pretty drastic about section and to persuade my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to give the subject urgent consideration remembering that my noble friend said last week that he would be referring the matter to the lord chancellor with a view to obtaining his advice <e> <s> in any event i hope your lordships will not think that this amendment is a satisfactory substitute <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join with the right reverend prelate in hoping that your lordships will reject this amendment <e> <s> i say that for two main reasons <e> <s> the first is that the amendment would increase the burden of proof on those unfortunate mental patients who feel that civil or criminal proceedings should be brought against those people whom they allege have maltreated them in hospital <e> <s> i feel that it would be wrong to increase the burden of proof in that way so that would be my first ground of opposition to the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like very briefly to add my thanks to those which have already been expressed <e> <s> although i have tabled so few amendments and none since the first part of the committee stage i really feel that my noble friend lord elton deserves immense praise because he has had so many other responsibilities to bear while this bill was proceeding but his skill and helpfulness have never failed <e> <s> as chairman of the royal society for the mentally handicapped may i say that i wish the <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not put my name down to speak in this debate and i am grateful to the noble lord lord elystan-morgan for saying that i may precede him <e> <s> i rise mainly in order to make it clear that admiration for this bill is not the monopoly of the opposition front bench <e> <s> indeed i think that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is to be warmly congratulated on presenting to us a bill which is so wide-ranging and in all its terms so acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i remind him of the paramount importance of getting the public utilities involved in this emergency planning process <e> <s> will he give an undertaking to your lordships that the government will monitor that progress in order to see that proper arrangements are being made <e>", "<cs> my lords although we should not vote against this bill and i accept that we cannot amend it in my opinion we owe it to the people of canada to consider carefully what we are being asked to do <e> <s> like the noble lord lord gifford i too have studied the effect of the bill on the indian peoples of canada the aboriginal peoples who have expressed to me as to him and to other noble lords genuine fears about its effects <e> <s> i have considered whether their fears were well founded or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very reluctant to interrupt <e> <s> i think that this is the first time that a speech in this debate has been interrupted <e> <s> but i must assure my noble friend lord morris that section is really a safeguard because it enjoins upon the courts that when construing other sections of that schedule they may not to use the words of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have leave to reply i should first like to thank my noble friend lord trefgarne for his very interesting explanation <e> <s> it seems to me to be a very fine and subtle point <e> <s> having listened carefully to my noble friend i believe it is only the presence in line of the words continue to detain that really justifies the retention in line of the words without lawful excuse <e> <s> i think so <e> <s> i take that point and therefore thank my noble friend and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all of your lordships who have taken part in the debate and whose speeches have made it such a valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a suggestion which is as flattering to me as it is well deserving to my noble friend <e> <s> but i do not have such power <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords i find my noble friends speech even more inexplicable <e> <s> but apart from that speech i think it could be said of this debate that the things that unite us are greater than those that divide us <e> <s> we are divided on the question of statistics but without the statistics we have no other way of knowing what is happening and what the trends are <e> <s> there was division between us on the advantage of publishing separate statistics of the offenders guilty of mugging in london <e> <s> i must confess that although i appreciate the feelings of those who have expressed doubt about that the truth is always advantageous <e> <s> unless we can find out who is committing offences what ages they are roughly where they are and where they belong we shall not he able to tackle these problems in the way that the public expect us to <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords while not doubting my noble friends and the governments desire to eliminate lead in petrol when it is found to be a cause of damage to the human brain would he bear in mind that there are far too many people in this country suffering from mental handicap for which the causes cannot be established and when there is a cause that seems likely to be established will the government please take it very seriously indeed <e>", "<cs> there is a further anomaly which may or may not have occurred to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor namely that although clause of this bill does not apply to scotland people who have been married in scotland by cohabitation and repute and who therefore under scottish law are married may come to england live in england and find themselves in some doubt under this clause <e> <s> to that extent i think that there may well be another anomaly which deserves the further consideration of my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble and learned friends will go very carefully on this matter because it seems to me that the noble lord lord mishcon has suggested that there should be an irrebuttable presumption of negligence in the circumstances described in subsection <e> <s> if we look at those circumstances we find that they are really drawn rather widely <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord lord napier at the moment that he was interrupted was quoting something said publicly by the chairman of lloyds at a meeting of lloyds members and something which had received a great deal of publicity <e> <s> that is as i heard it <e>", "<cs> i have a very short point <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend can help <e> <s> clause deals with the interest which is payable on sums which the court orders should be paid into court <e> <s> they would be lump sums <e> <s> i believe it has always been the practice so far that only simple interest should be paid but in these days when interest rates are fairly high and when the sums are quite considerable and there may be a delay in the payment into court i am wondering whether there is not a case for payment of compound interest <e>", "<cs> i should like to give a brief word of support to my noble friends <e> <s> there is no need for me to repeat the arguments which they have put forward <e> <s> however i should just like to add that there has been very careful consideration of this matter by the law commission presided over by one of her majestys judges <e> <s> i think that we are entitled to know why it is that in producing this bill my noble and learned friend has been somewhat selective and has not accepted the whole of the package which the law commission put forward <e> <s> there may well be a good reason for that but unless there is i would have hoped that this is a matter that perhaps my noble and learned friend would wish to consider further <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we sympathise with my noble and learned friend and are grateful to him for his explanation of his own problems <e> <s> but speaking for myself my sympathy would be very greatly increased if he could tell us in broad terms what were the grounds of objection on the part of the cbi and others whom he named who did object <e> <s> i would just add the relevance of our knowing that it is because although the matter was considered rather controversial outside parliament i tend to agree with the noble lord lord mishcon who indicated that in your lordships committee that it would not be controversial to accept these amendments and i find it very hard to believe that it would be controversial in another place <e> <s> if my noble friend has to accept clauses which occupy another page or two and it is found that they are not controversial i should have thought that he would be doing his bill no harm nor spoiling its chances of getting onto the statute book <e>", "<cs> at this stage i apologise for uttering a word at all but even though i cannot expect a reply i should like to draw attention to the really rather unsatisfactory method of bringing so many different provisions of the bill into operation in so many different ways <e> <s> this clause seems to me to be an unnecessarily complex one and i hope that on future occasions at any rate parliamentary counsel will endeavour to advise ministers to bring their bills into operation in a less complex manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for his first reply as a home office minister may i express to him our best wishes in his new responsibilities <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that of necessity district councils are closer to the people than are county councils and in the event of an emergency will have more direct contact with the people <e> <s> will he therefore keep a very close watch on the implementation of those circulars so as to ensure that the district councils are fully involved <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give your lordships an assurance that the desire for peace will not be regarded as a reason for appeasement <e> <s> secondly may i ask my noble friend whether there is any further news of the small number of british civilians on south georgia including two women scientists <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend any confirmation of the reports that argentinian troops or some of them are hungry and are having to turn to the british people in the falkland islands to relieve their hunger <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply and remind him that what he has said is of great importance <e> <s> does he bear in mind that recent events point to the necessity for prior preparation rather than brilliant improvisation at the last minute and can he assure us that these plans to which he has referred are in fact being carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the doubt thrown by a member of the opposition front bench upon the validity of my question may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that it would be a bad day for democracy if members of either house of parliament were not free to ask reasonable questions about the defence of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the people on the falkland islands our own british people must be longing to be rescued <e> <s> will he give an undertaking that no desire for peace and no process of negotiation will delay the happy day when eventually they are relieved from argentine rule <e>", "<cs> my lords those who took part in the committee stage should be grateful to my noble and learned friend though it would seem that under the bill as it will stand if the amendment is made we could have two claims <e> <s> one would be what i would call the genuine widow the lawful wife who has been living apart from the husband prehaps for some years perhaps under a deed of separation and receiving maintenance from him under that deed and the other the woman with whom since that separation he went to live but there has been no divorce <e> <s> it would seem that each of those ladies would have a right of action under the bill as it will stand when amended <e> <s> if so it will presumably be a matter for the discretion of the courts as to how it shall be sorted out between the two of them but any word of clarification which my noble and learned friend can give might be of great help <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may presume to help and when two noble and learned lords are in doubt it seems presumptious that i should say a word it seems to me from the reference to section <e>", "<cs> my lords while joining in the hope that there will one day be a permanent cease-fire on honourable terms may i ask my noble friend viscount trenchard whether there is not a danger that a temporary cease-fire will enable the argentinians to repair runways and redeploy their forces to their advantage and that therefore a temporary cease-fire would be to the temporary advantage of the argentinians and to our disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether when he tabled his motion my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth expected that we would have such fascinating discussions on inland waterways and container ships <e> <s> before i go any further i should like to join in the chorus of welcome for the maiden speech of my noble friend lord cayzer <e> <s> his mention of container ships has started something terribly important because it prompts us to realise that our future economic prosperity is so much linked with europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble and learned friend inform your lordships whether under the law of the united kingdom and bearing in mind the realities of this sad situation there is not now a state of war with the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a brief comment that these two amendments add to the argument in <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> my lords before i beg leave to withdraw the amendment i wonder whether i may be allowed first to thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for the explanation of the reasons for the clause as it stands and thank him even more for the undertaking which he has given to consider the matter further <e> <s> i would also like to thank the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones my noble friend lord colville of culross and the noble lord lord hacking for their support <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that answer may i ask him why there was that regrettable decline during those earlier years and whether there is any hope of the improvement in being sustained <e> <s> may i also ask my noble friend whether he is aware that there are many men and perhaps women willing to serve as specials <e> <s> therefore may i ask my noble friend what the government will do to persuade chief officers of police to recruit more of them <e>", "<cs> i find myself in the sad situation of being able to thank my noble and learned friend only <e>", "<cs> my lords in seeking leave to withdraw the amendment i wonder whether i may make it clear that i should be the last person to enter into a tug of war between myself on the one hand and the lord chancellor and his predecessor on the other <e> <s> i am not quite so daring or so foolish as to do that <e> <s> but may i have the leave of the house to make three brief comments <e> <s> first i concede as i did before that the lord chancellor is going to have his problems of administration and rule-making and obviously one should not ignore them <e> <s> secondly having conceded that point i think it is rather unfortunate that we could not have perhaps in a little schedule a list of those clauses which <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply as far as it goes <e> <s> is he not aware that as a rule international crises occur unexpectedly and suddenly and therefore is it not desirable that as envisaged in section of the civil defence act the government should make arrangements for all members of police fire and ambulance services <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible that some irresponsible and bomb-happy dictator in order to teach somebody else a lesson could drop just one nuclear bomb from which many other countries might suffer <e> <s> is not that a possibility which should not be ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend says that the local authority can be required to provide accommodation for the widow does he mean only the local authority in the area where the widow was being housed by the services or does he mean the local authority in an area where the widow wishes to go and live with her children <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i cannot begin without paying tribute to my honourable friend mr eldon griffiths who promoted this bill as a private members bill in another place <e> <s> it is a measure of his experience and parliamentary skill and the respect in which he is held that the bill passed so easily through another place and arrived in this house unamended <e> <s> it also reflects the all-party support which the bill received and which i venture to hope it may receive also in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> if i may have the leave of the house to speak again very briefly i should like to thank him and other noble lords who have supported the bill <e> <s> i am grateful for the government support <e> <s> i should like to comment briefly on some points which i found <e>", "<cs> my lords may i endorse the noble and learned lords statement that it makes me very happy <e> <s> may i ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor whether this excellent momentum can be sustained indefinitely or possibly increased <e>", "<cs> my lords although i disagreed with nearly everything that he said it is an honour for me to follow the noble lord lord taylor of mansfield <e> <s> i shall always be grateful to him for his kindness to me many years ago when i was appointed a junior minister and found myself responsible for health and safety in coal mines and many other matters <e> <s> he and the noble lord lord blyton were so very helpful and kind in teaching me a lot that i needed to know i have always remembered that with gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the united kingdom has achieved one of the greatest triumphs on behalf of freedom and justice in the history of the world and that these relatively minor aftermath matters are of little significance in comparison with that great victory <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend acknowledge the magnificent way in which the nursing profession has so far declined to strike and will that be borne in mind in their favour in any thoughts that the government may be giving to their pay and conditions of service <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend lord mottistone is right

hunt and those who may agree with him have considered the principle that is summed up in the old latin tag <e>", "<cs> i think i mentioned that the committee on the age of majority some years ago decided that the criminal provisions such as provisions relating to sentencing the age of various criminal liabilities and so on should not be touched by their recommendations <e> <s> i think that

buildings which are part of our heritage which get destroyed rather easily under the present planning law <e> <s> would he therefore ask his right honourable friend to consider whether that law needs strengthening in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> i was merely going to say that the government have got this about right <e> <s> having listened to what has been said by the noble lords lord elystan-morgan and lord hunt i would not have thought that this amendment needed any variation <e>", "<cs> my lords it would seem that the statement that my noble friend has repeated applies only to england and wales <e> <s> are we to assume that the somewhat similar and sometimes better arrange-ments for scotland and northern ireland are to remain unchanged <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is right to be vigilant about this matter <e> <s> there is a great deal of nonsense in our subordinate legislation and i think that he was fully entitled to draw attention to one or two cases which are at present subject to affirmative resolution and to point out that really those cases are not justified <e> <s> however i am afraid that if we accept his amendment we shall be adding to the nonsense to which he has drawn attention <e> <s> of course the important matter of whether there shall be an affirmative or a negative resolution and it is an important matter and i do not take the view that the noble lord was suggesting that it matters very little in some cases is a matter of judgment of our judgment as parliamentarians and not only judgment in this house but judgment in the other house <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind how much the islanders have suffered from this aggression can my noble friend assure your lordships that if it is decided to ask for payment of compensation it will be paid in sterling or another sound currency and not in argentine paper money <e>", "<cs> as i had to attend a long meeting of sub-committee e of the european select committee of your lordships house i was unable to hear the first part of this debate but i know quite well what must have been said <e> <s> indeed it has been admirably reflected in the speech of my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> my attitude to the matter is to a very great extent governed by the unfortunate experience of the three railwaymen and the terrible delays that have taken place in their three cases <e> <s> their cases were started i believe nearly five years ago and even now they have not been resolved <e> <s> that was not entirely in fact scarcely the fault of the european court <e> <s> i am sorry to say that it was very largely the fault of various branches of her majestys government <e>

statute eventually will be dealt with it would enable my noble friends to judge what they should do as a result of the reply which my noble friend lord ferrers has given <e>", "<cs> as i have understood the noble lord lord wedderburn he is not complaining of the holding of ballots but of the holding of them every five years <e> <s> this is a matter of judgment to be exercised in the light of experience <e> <s> i do not claim industrial experience but i do remember this that in the best of industries the annual turnover of the workforce is at least per cent <e> <s> and if we take per cent <e> <s> turning over each of five years it brings us very nearly to a complete turnover of the workforce in five years <e> <s> in those circumstances surely we must acknowledge that a very considerable change of attitude may have taken place <e> <s> therefore in the judgment which we have to exercise in deciding how often ballots should be held five years does not seem to be unreasonable <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord trenchard replying for the government will indeed be able to assure us that that is about right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill

water does not always conveniently fall into administrative boundaries <e> <s> with his smaller authorities will it not be necessary to have some way of enabling adjoining authorities at any rate to borrow each others water if necessary <e> <s> will there be any kind of liaison written into the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to my noble friends answer to my noble friend lord duncansandys that this would not benefit the united kingdom if i understood him rightly would he bear in mind that there is great scope for international action in these tasks of preserving the worlds heritage and that the international action is not likely to be effective without the full support of our country <e>", "<cs> i venture to suggest that both the noble baroness and the noble lord lord wedderburn have overlooked one very important fundamental matter which is that the ordinary case of unfair dismissal is that of a dispute merely between the employer and the employee <e> <s> but here

statute had been introduced as a result of the initiative of one type of government and another by another type <e> <s> they must accept it in the broad or not at all <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord davies he does not have this right because what happened with regard to london transport was that the law had not meanwhile been amended and the law lords were merely declaring the law as it was <e> <s> they had a duty to do so <e>", "<cs> may i say with respect to the noble lord lord mccarthy that he is ignoring the british genius which is to accept the verdict of democracy as expressed in a general election and in parliament <e> <s> as a result of doing so people who are placed in a responsible position whether as high court judges chairmen of tribunals or as the noble lord lord mccarthy describes them side members of tribunals should be prepared objectively to apply the law as decided by parliament and not to start being selective <e> <s> if we cast aside our objectivity we lose one of the great advantages of our democracy <e> <s> i hope that on further consideration the noble lord will not persist in that view <e>", "<cs> is there not the further danger that if the amendment were accepted the trade union view <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that reply and to acknowledge the efforts made by the air marshal and by mr armstrong and the response which a good many local authorities have given to their approaches <e> <s> but is it not about time that all local authorities prepared to deal with any emergencies that may arise in peace and war and to make full use of the many volunteers who are willing to help them in their humanitarian task <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the people who would rejoice most if we completely abandoned civil defence as has been suggested would be the men in the kremlin <e>", "<cs> my lords as the criminal justice bill seems unlikely to come before your lordships for third reading until nearly a fortnight has passed would it not be possible for this gap to be filled by a simple amendment to be tabled by the government rather than having to wait for legislation in the next session of parliament <e> <s> would my noble friend agree that if that gap could be filled as soon as that many people would sleep more quietly in their homes meanwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is well worth making a pilgrimage to bethnal green accompanied by ones children or as the case may be ones grandchildren to visit this fascinating museum and it would be a great pity if children especially were made to pay any charge to enter it <e>", "<cs> my lords a great deal of what the noble lord lord avebury has said with great sincerity roes far beyond the scope of this amendment <e> <s> one must bear in mind that the people of this country expect our government and parliament to maintain an effective control over illegal entry <e> <s> this amendment which is of a somewhat technical kind although i agree it has practical implications for those concerned is a way of enabling the people who attempt to enter illegally to be dealt with on the basis of the continuing offence <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord it applies equally to those people who have entered illegally and find some reason for remaining here <e> <s> then it is pointed out to them that they have no right to be here and then they overstay <e> <s> if i have misconceived the matter then of course i apologise <e> <s> but it seems to me that a great deal of what the noble lord said was beyond the scope of this amendment and that the comment which i made was a perfectly valid one <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> he is so persuasive that he tempts one to agree with him sometimes against ones experience and better judgment <e> <s> in the now fairly distant past i had quite a lot of minor judicial experience as a recorder relief judge at the old bailey which as the noble and learned lord lord gardiner will remember was a rather doubtful proposition and had to be brought to an end <e> <s> in those days i took many chances by making probation orders rather than giving custodial sentences and for the most part the experiments worked extremely well <e> <s> there was always the opportunity of a custodial sentence if the probation order did not work <e> <s> however one was deeply conscious that if the probation order was to work there should be complete personal confidence between the probation officer and the person in his care and that swords of damocles were to be avoided if possible <e> <s> also one realised as my noble friend lord elton said that one had to permit the greatest flexibility <e> <s> although one had power to attach various conditions to

resources for this very necessary service which we wish to see expand <e> <s> but i am astonished that the noble and learned lord should move this amendment in order to try to achieve his object <e>

even i have i would say to him that this is not the way to legislate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid on this occasion the noble lord lord mishcon has not persuade nor even tempted me <e> <s> i disagree with him i am afraid fundamentally this time <e> <s> when fixing the maximum period of probation one should not confuse ones mind with what has become the usual period the maximum period of probation by analogy with the maximum period of sentence which i agree is quite a different thing should be to cover the unusual cases the most difficult and sometimes the worst cases <e> <s> i do agree that it is very rare for a probation order to be made for as long as three years but there are rare cases in which it becomes desirable <e> <s> i give just one example <e> <s> the court of appeal many years ago said that with recidivists provided the crimes they corn-mined were not too serious and when custodial sentences had been tried time and again it was worth giving them a chance with probation <e> <s> when that happens it needs to be a fairly long probation order <e> <s> so that is just one example of why we need to have sometimes more than two years <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wanted to say that it did not seem to he entirely accurate to use the word <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house to speak again i should like to endorse what has just been said about the excellent way in which my noble friend lord elton has conducted these proceedings for us <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recollect that during the last war the island of malta was awarded for its valour with the george cross and would not some similar recognition either by grant of special citizenship or in some other way be well deserving in the case of the people of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind my noble friend that in his previous appointment last winter he was so good as to tell us what the government proposed to do about the further education of those mentally-handicapped young people who are capable of it <e> <s> will he bear in mind this in further developments in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend

a considerable amount of agreement with what the noble lord lord mccarthy has said <e> <s> in considering this matter one cannot ignore the point made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock that in section

circumstances of a trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords every speech which has been made in this very important debate has indicated that the present situation is undesirable and that something must be done <e> <s> we have just had a speech from my noble and learned friend the lord advocate running through all the possibilities including the one outlined in this amendment and i noted what he said <e> <s> he has said in effect that nothing can be done under any head <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords on both sides of the house will be surprised and disappointed by that and so will the people at large outside parliament <e> <s> i find most surprising the statement of my noble and learned friend that the amendment would not give rise to any new remedy because that clearly seems to me to be strange the point being that under the present law immunity is given in a trade dispute against actions of tort and the very essence of the amendment is that it would remove that immunity <e> <s> to that extent it does give rise if not to a new action to an action which is not available at the moment <e> <s> if that is wrong my noble friend lord campbell of alloway who has a much <e>", "<cs> my

immunity and there is surely a right of action for negligence <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join my noble friend in welcoming this amendment and those which go with it <e> <s> my only point in rising is to ask my noble friend lord elton whether he will be so good when he replies to the debate as to confirm that although the amendments use the expression mental condition he has used the expression mentally unfit he intends in law that the term mental condition shall include those suffering from mental handicap or mental impairment he will remember the significance of that phrase as well as those suffering from temporary mental illness <e>", "<cs> my lords i would add one short point <e> <s> it seems to me an indirect way of providing a new statutory sanction for the enforcement of a variety of provisions which are set out in this new subsection and this seems to me to be a misuse of the bill for that purpose <e> <s> presumably each of those statutory provisions has its own method of enforcement and for us to try to enforce it in this rather extraordinary indirect way is not in keeping with the purpose of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i happen to agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in what he has just said <e> <s> indeed i would go one stage further and say that even with a perfectly free trade union and without the pressures placed upon the members of the acting profession <e> <s> equity would still have been a great trade union of benefit to the members of that profession but without the coercion which the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that the speech of the noble lord lord molloy filled me with nostalgia not unpleasant nostalgia either because i always enjoyed his fluent oratory in another place and i have never doubted his sincerity <e> <s> but may i remind him that this bill is not about wages <e> <s> it is about freedom and justice for working people and the protection of the interests of the community against for example such things as happened in the winter of discontent which he so properly condemned <e> <s> i was rather surprised that he did not share the view of his former chief whip the noble lord lord aylestone now the leader of the sdp who said he wondered what all the fuss was about in the opposition to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming my noble friends statement may i ask him whether it is intended to impress upon the soviet government that success in this matter depends upon multilateral disarmament and <e>", "<cs> my lords we should he grateful to my noble friend

amendments place a fresh duty on the responsible medical officer to consult other professionals concerned with the patients treatment <e> <s> this is a welcome extension of wider consultations which mencap and others have advocated all along <e> <s> i believe that the government have got this right and we are grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elton must have breathed a sigh of relief over the important amendments that he persuaded your lordships to accept when the bill was before your lordships previously amendments for which he had shown initiative and in regard to which great wisdom <e> <s> but now that he is responsible for other parts of the bill the home office part <e> <s> i hope i am not taking an unfair advantage with him to ask him for an assurance that the commons amendments which he is now suggesting we should agree with do not affect the principle that when the courts have made a hospital order and the person in respect of whom it is made has been sent to prison or perhaps even discharged meanwhile it is the court and not the hospital authority which retains ultimate responsibility in respect of the case <e> <s> this is important not only in order that all concerned may know where the responsibility lies but also because upon that may depend the ultimate question of who exercises aftercare <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was one of those who pressed rather hard for legal aid in these cases i too would like to acknowledge what the lord chancellor has done <e> <s> i think the question put by the noble lord lord wallace is one in respect of which we are entitled to an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords we have come to the most important group of amendments among all the many amendments that the other place has made to the bill <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i hope that it will not be considered inappropriate to make one or two comments before my noble friend lord mottistone moves his amendment as i assume he will be doing <e> <s> it was clear from our proceedings in committee and on report that this was a very difficult matter indeed <e> <s> as one who takes some interest in legislation i did not envy the government having to replace the one clause that they had and try to find something which would as near as possible meet all the many opinions that we had including those of eminent professional men in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may say a brief word about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is an important amendment whereby the mental health act commission may be directed by the secretary of state to keep under review the care and treatment of voluntary patients <e> <s> that is a considerable advance on the original concept whereby only detained patients came under the control of the commission and we welcome it <e> <s> but had we been in a different stage of the session i would have moved to leave out purely as a matter of drafting some words in line of the new subsection a which appear to me to be otiose and unnecessary <e> <s> they are the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it was important that my <e>", "<cs> my lords for generations all people of voting age except felons bankrupts and members of your lordships house were entitled to vote at parliamentary elections <e> <s> there may be people who misreading this new clause might think that something ridiculous was being enacted by us in that people who could not read or write and who had no understanding of anything were being given the opportunity of having their hands forced to put crosses on election papers and perhaps voting by post <e> <s> but as i understand it especially if one considers what is contained in amendment no <e> <s> which is the new schedule and especially paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble and learned friend about one matter <e> <s> on the face of it this would seem to be a general enhancement of the status of recorders and the opportunities that they may be given <e> <s> but are we to understand that it will be the practice that recorders should only be given the kind of high court work to which my noble and learned friend referred just now as having been done by those solicitors who were recorders or is it intended that greater use should be made of the power now given <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just add to that point <e> <s> it seems to me that if in fact it was found from time to time that it was unnecessary for there to be a deputy master appointed the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor could simply decide not to appoint one <e> <s> but it would be regrettable would it not to deprive him forever or at any rate until further legislation of the power to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords having had the responsibility of piloting the coroners act during its stages in your lordships house may i say that i heartily welcome this new development <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i shall bore my noble and learned friend with a short point which i intend to make <e> <s> we find that this shall not come into force and shall not affect a will made before the commencement of section above <e> <s> in order to find out when that will be we have a mind-bending exercise of trying to understand clause all over again <e> <s> i hope that in future legislation we shall be able to deal with the matter more simply <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble and learned friend moved the bill in your lordships house he wondered whether it would get through in this session <e> <s> i hope it is in order to rejoice with him that in a few moments it will be ready for royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords while fully accepting what my noble friend has said about the governments position in this matter may i ask him whether he is aware that in fact the campaign for nuclear disarmament gets far more publicity on television than those who agree with the use of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords if this debate were limited to a conflict between doctors parents and mentally handicapped children with lawyers intervening i would if i may say so with due humility be the personal embodiment of that conflict because i am a lawyer the son of a doctor and a parent of a severely mentally handicapped daughter <e> <s> but of course the issue in the debate is not simply about that conflict because as the pearson commission argued in chapter of their report to which my noble friend lord campbell of alloway referred it is where the government and local authorities have for reasons of public policy either attempted to make vaccination of one kind or another virtually compulsory or encouraged it so much that their responsibility is engaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i might take a very brief moment to suggest that the government deserve praise for this important and massive piece of consolidation not because it occupies pages but because it brings into one statute so many provisions now spread about the statute book and these provisions govern the necessary working of our parliamentary democracy <e> <s> voters who really care should be grateful for this including those who speak welsh <e>", "<cs> i too would like to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i assume that we may refer also to amendment no <e> <s> which is closely allied to amendment no <e> <s>

done it would save the cumbersome business of renewing registrations <e> <s> if we are to have only rare inspections then we must have registrations renewed fairly frequently <e> <s> the more frequent the inspections <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain your lordships for long but this is a very important schedule and i welcome it as a serious attempt to curb the activities of a small number of people who have been exploiting the field of residential care <e> <s> some rather bad cases have come to light and one therefore feels in sympathy with the schedule <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords why did not the government submit to judgment after the european commission had given its opinion especially bearing in mind that the court has never yet overruled the commission <e>

given <e> <s> there are six pages of detailed legislation by reference and a great many references to previous legislation <e> <s> without the help of the notes on clauses one could not possibly have

subsections and the kind of things included in the second schedule <e> <s> however my noble and learned friend has spoken with the authority of his office <e> <s> as i say i am grateful for the explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in listening to this discussion it seemed to me that perhaps my noble friend lord mottistone had it in mind that in the

circumstances would no doubt do so <e>", "<cs> my lords very strangely some words have crept into this amendment which should not be there <e> <s> they are the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i

houses in order <e> <s> my noble friend lord gowrie was at pains to point out the disappointment that there has been on that score <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has given way i must point out to him that if he reads carefully the definition of residential premises he will find that they are essentially premises in which people do reside and that in what my noble

that your lordships will be gratified and enthused to hear the warm support given to the bill of my noble friend lord onslow by the noble lady lady saltoun and the noble baroness lady phillips who

i am only paraphrasing and am not trying to be an amateur dratfsman exercises the functions which my noble friend has described shall be a recognised body for the purpose of this clause <e> <s> that would be one way round it and i should have thought it was worth thinking about <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that until we have signed the european extradition convention and

to understand from the replies which my noble friend has already given that when in the further consultations which are to take place with representatives of trade unions conflict arises between the

this short debate i should like to thank the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble friend lady faithfull for the critical support which they have each given to the bill <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord elton for his enthusiastically positive support and for the way in which he has clarified some issues which have arisen <e> <s> i should like to say to lord mishcon that i welcomed very much the expression he used when he said that the select committee would be wise to consider the side issues which arise on both bills including the administrative implications <e> <s> i

had good reason to change their minds when they saw that there was no longer a danger to this country from the election of a marxist or near-marxist party which had the support of only about per cent of the people <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with my noble friend that the commission should not be abolished can he answer the question of my noble friend lord belhaven and stenton about the cost of the commission <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to support my noble friend lord stanley of alderley on this matter <e> <s> it may well be that amendment no <e> <s> has the same effect as and overlaps with the amendment of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but for the sake of clarity and removal of doubt in subsection of clause i think it might be an advantage to have my noble friends amendment as well <e> <s> i do not think that any harm could be done <e> <s> it is rather interesting that subsection comes as near as the parliamentary draftsman ever gets to a purpose clause because in that subsection he explains the intentions of the remaining subsections of clause <e> <s> in doing so it might be an advantage to have it made clear that with regard to the danger the liability arises only when the occupier knows or ought to know of it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would help still further to improve the amity which is prevailing in this discussion if i say that i now also agree with my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> may i express a different view <e> <s> mankind is endlessly torn about differences of opinion as to belief but knowledge is something that can be ascertained <e> <s> also where there is plainly a duty of care the simple word ought used by the greatly loved father of my noble and learned friend in <e>", "<cs> i wish strongly to support my noble friend lord stanley of alderley on this matter <e> <s> it seems to me that unless this amendment or something to the same effect is introduced into clause we shall have great uncertainty we shall have confusion and we could have serious injustice <e> <s> those people who occupy land and want to be reasonable occupiers in allowing reasonable access to people i am thinking especially of those who might be tempted to close existing rights of way or perhaps open-mindedly be willing to create new rights of way will be very much afraid of adopting what i call a liberal attitude in this matter <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble and learned lord surely if by statute a landlord or occupier is forbidden to set a trap as for example the mantraps which were forbidden by legislation years ago there is nothing in the amendment which would legalise the use of such traps deprive anybody who was injured by them of a cause of action or prevent him from being prosecuted <e>", "<cs> i hope i may be allowed to come back on this <e> <s> i was born in a house alongside which a river flowed and separated the house from the garden <e> <s> we had a bridge from the house into the garden over the river <e> <s> the only time we ever had a burglar and strangely enough it was a woman burglar was one who tried to approach the house not knowing that the river was there <e> <s> she came at night and the first that we knew of her intent to burgle the house were cries of help me help me <e> <s> from the river <e> <s> there was a sudden drop to the river on the side furthest from the house and it would have been quite extraordinary if my father had been exposed to an action in tort by that lady who might have complained that there should have been some way of protecting her from falling into the river <e> <s> so when we are talking of traps we have to think of the reality of the ordinary situation such as the one i have described <e>", "<cs> the real case that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has made against this amendment is that the circumstances which could arise under it and which are envisaged by those of us who have moved it can be satisfactorily dealt with always by clause <e> <s> i say to my noble and learned friend with great respect that if that is so there will be a number of cases fought in the courts and perhaps going right up to the house of lords in order to decide whether the person who was trespassing and had a criminal purpose as for example in the simple case of the stealing of apples or the burglar climbing up the ladder was covered by subsection with all clarity or not <e> <s> the courts may disagree in the great multiplicity of circumstances that might arise and i would have thought that while we were legislating on this matter we should try to put it beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> with respect i did not say that <e>", "<cs> may i just state the position that arises with naturalists trusts of which there are a number all over the country who arrange nature trails sometimes on their own properties when they have open days and sometimes on other peoples property <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made it clear that his was a probing amendment and i have regarded my noble friends two amendments to which i let my name be added as probing amendments also <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon has pointed out this is a rather difficult matter <e> <s> so many different circumstances can arise and we have to be very careful indeed that we do not discourage for example the riparian owners of water where there is fishing and angling from allowing angling clubs to go on the land <e> <s> sometimes it is necessary to incur modest expense to enable people to have access to the land for the purpose of angling <e> <s> you may have to put up a fence when there are cattle about to prevent the anglers being disturbed by the cattle <e> <s> yet nobody would say that the letting of the angling right to the members of the angling clubs was a business <e> <s> it is not intended to be profit-making <e> <s> therefore we do need to make sure that in circumstances like that and other circumstances mentioned by the noble lord there is not a discouragement to the use of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords is not membership of the order of the british empire a compliment which her majesty pays to some people who have no real connection with this country but who have performed services which the people of this country have admired <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not ease the situation however slightly if we each limited ourselves to one question or double-barrelled question per day <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor on the introduction and the passage of this bill and to thank him for the way in which he handled our amendments <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon said this bill will be of great help and a great improvement <e> <s> it should in general lead to better relations between the public and occupiers in the publics obtaining access to the countryside <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord middleton for giving a trailer for my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i go along with him in feeling that we should not have a division upon this or upon any of the amendments to clause today <e> <s> i think we want what my noble friend lord belstead having been in the foreign office will understand we want a valuable exchange of views <e> <s> the foreign office uses that expression generally when nothing has been decided <e> <s> i do not think that we ought to be precipitate about deciding these difficult matters today <e>", "<cs> has my noble friend seen the letter in <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> i think he will find that the point will arise on a later amendment <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord belstead for the open-mindedness which he has shown and for his willingness to consider this matter further <e> <s> i am also grateful to the other noble lords eight of them who have spoken in this short debate <e> <s> i am especially grateful to the noble lord lord northfield and to my noble friend lord mountgarret for the support they have given to the terms of the amendment <e> <s> i must confess that when i moved the amendment it never occurred to me that i should find myself caught up in the scottish situation although i have a family interest in land on the other side of the border <e> <s> i had not declared this interest because the bill will not prevail so far as i know on the other side of the border <e> <s> in considering this amendment further i very much hope that my noble friend will consider it as a separate matter from the very interesting scottish issue <e>", "<cs> the amendment is not intended to refer to previous tenancies held by predecessors in succession but only to the current tenant <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord walston has raised a very narrow and subtle point <e> <s> i only hope that my understanding of it is right <e> <s> the position with regard to a current tenancy that is to say a tenancy which is the subject of a fresh rent review but without changing the tenancy is already dealt with <e> <s> what the amendment is intended to do is to refer to a previous tenancy albeit on the part of the same tenant <e>", "<cs> again i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> before seeking to withdraw the amendment i should just mention that i was advised by real experts in this branch of the law that the amendment was necessary to remove the injustice which i have mentioned <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say whether the soviet government have publicly or behind the scenes given any reason for their withdrawal from these talks <e> <s> does he agree as many noble lords on these benches together with many other people in the conservative party and throughout the country agree that the russians withdrawal from the talks makes it imperative that we should calmly and deliberately proceed with our deployment programme of these missiles <e> <s> thirdly will my noble friend comment on the danger of the proposal made by the noble lord lord bishopston that we should deploy no more missiles until the russians are prepared to come to the negotiating table again <e> <s> does he not consider that if we were to take that step it would mean that in future negotiations we would be negotiating from weakness <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that <e>", "<cs> could we be told exactly which amendments are therefore to be discussed together <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that i support what my noble friend lord stodart of leaston said <e> <s> when the act was going through the house of commons i had already represented for over years a very large farming constituency and kept in constant touch with the local branch of the nfu which was a very strong one <e> <s> i had the clear impression that the government were almost taken by surprise at the pressure exerted by the headquarters of the nfu at the time of the negotiations on the act <e> <s> it has become perfectly plain that the system of land tenure in england and wales is as i am afraid previously happened to some extent in scotland becoming fossilised <e> <s> i was hoping that out of these negotiations and into this bill we should get a system which broke much further than the bill does into the rights of succession <e> <s> that is in the general interest of farming and those who want to enter farming <e> <s> as my noble friend lord middleton said the proposals in clause are about as modest i would almost say as ineffective as one could possibly have expected to see <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend and the government will not succumb to any pressure from the opposition to make them even less effective <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield on one hand and my noble friend lord kinnoull and myself on the other tabled the amendments nos <e> <s> a a b and a to which i wish to speak without knowing that each other had done so <e> <s> i am glad that the name of the noble lord lord northfield appears first on the marshalled list because these amendments are an attempt to carry into drafting form the recommendations of the committee of which he was chairman <e> <s> i do not need to say very much to add to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the noble lord no doubt due to his usual modesty and moderation did not mention that these amendments follow from the report of his committee <e> <s> i think i should invite the attention of the committee to the fact that the final sentence in paragraph of the report states <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord lord walston has said about members of our profession i think it only fair to point out that it was members of the agricultural law association who used their initiative to draft the amendments to fulfil the recommendation of the report of the noble lord lord northfield <e>", "<cs> may i ask two questions which are relevant to this and on a matter on which i must confess i am an honest wobbler <e> <s> it seems to me that there may be little difference between the appointment of these people by the minister and appointment by the rics <e> <s> the same people are likely to be appointed in any event and therefore there would not be very

can give us some idea of the effect of the legislation to which he has referred in reducing the number of injuries incurred especially by young people <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say to what extent it will be possible for regional development grants to be used for the restoration of derelict land urban or rural <e> <s> this is something which can sometimes be done when other purposes of development grants are being fulfilled and can therefore be taken in their stride <e>", "<cs> i would only wish to add that it is a fundamental principle that prevails throughout the whole of our legal system except at any rate on this one occasion to which the noble lord lord howard has referred that there should be an appeal <e> <s> indeed throughout the civilised world this is regarded as a principle of natural justice <e> <s> i am therefore another who would wish to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend to the noble lord lord prys-davies and to my noble friend viscount dilhorne <e> <s> i shall make one quick point <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies properly referred to the power under section of the act on the part of the minister to do two very limited things this is the power of the minister not of the lord chancellor it must be for expediting arbitrations or for reducing their costs <e> <s> that does not deal with the fundamental problems which i mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the governments policy of getting mentally handicapped children out of hospitals and into the community is warmly applauded <e> <s> is he aware that there are a number of mental hospitals which are well known to be unsatisfactory <e> <s> and can he say whether any mental hospitals of that kind are included among the figures he has given of hospitals closed down <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the speeches in your lordships house in this most interesting and moving debate have referred to the physically disabled <e> <s> it will not surprise your lordships if i confine myself to the ways in which these bills will affect the mentally handicapped who are the largest single group of disabled people and whose problems are quite different from those of the physically disabled <e>", "<cs> earlier this year my lords there were flagrant attempts to discriminate against mentally handicapped people at a devonshire holiday resort where a splendid hotel proprietor encouraged disabled people to stay in his hotel to such an extent that at the time of the demonstration per cent <e> <s> of the guests in that hotel were mentally handicapped <e> <s> but some members of the local chamber of commerce objected to seeing them about the town and on the beaches they said that it discouraged other visitors and was had for trade a

goods made in northern ireland so also does his answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the conditions of melting snow which have been prevailing in the north recently which no doubt will continue from time to time every time a lorry approaches ones car on other than a dual carriageway or every time one is overtaken by a lorry enormous amounts of slush are thrown up on to

lords cannot the russian attitudes be explained only by ambition or fear <e> <s> if they maintain that it is not ambition could they be asked why they have this prolonged military occupation of

than one lasting two and a half hours it will have a wider scope and the subject itself will be a bigger subject <e> <s> therefore during any such debate there will be some back-bench speeches which should not be limited by the mathematical accident of dividing the number of minutes available by the number of back-bench speakers <e> <s> there should be scope for those peers with special knowledge to make a contribution to the debate which may exceed the average length of time <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the sun the wind and the tides are waiting to be used for the benefit of us all <e> <s> will he tell us what research and development is taking place in order to achieve that end <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend has considered and whether the noble lord on the woolsack has considered the desirability of discussing all the amendments between nos <e> <s> and inclusive together <e> <s> one general discussion on the various alternatives which arise on those amendments would undoubtedly save time <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a very grave misfortune <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that the noble lord is a much greater authority

wonderfully patient and open-minded but i suggest to your lordships that he has been much too indulgent <e> <s> the outcome as expressed in amendment no <e> <s> is not satisfactory <e> <s> i am also very sorry for the draftsman i should think he has had an awful time behind the scenes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord has overlooked the fact that the word willing is in previous rent formulas and is now well established and understood <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it would be in order for me with the leave of the house just to tell the noble lord lord hooson that the expression willing has been interpreted by the courts in more than one case <e> <s> it was held to exclude any element either of reluctance or of over-anxiety on the part of the assumed landlord or

<e> <s> this is a satisfactory answer <e> <s> as i said at an earlier stage i have great sympathy with parliamentary counsel over this aspect <e> <s> trying to dovetail what the various parties want

outside had been helping one with the drafting of them until one saw the government amendments on the marshalled list <e> <s> it is almost a vicious circle <e> <s> but i understand i sympathise and i am grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted everybody should be to my noble friend for the clarification he has given as to the effect of the bill in the circumstances i have described <e> <s> it may be that that clarification is enough to alert all concerned because it goes to show how in this branch of the law which has become one of the most complicated branches of the law nobody should ever act without the assistance of a professional adviser who can find his way through this labyrinth which already exists and which is becoming even more of a maze <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is quoting me he should do so accurately <e> <s> i said that the existing law was a labyrinth and that this bill makes it more of a maze <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my two noble friends in what they have said <e> <s> i too support the government on this <e> <s> i would only add that i am very surprised indeed that the noble lord lord bishopston whom i have known for many years and for whom i have a high regard should have fallen into the error of saying that because some of us thought that clause was defective for numerous reasons on which he and i agree therefore clause should be jettisoned <e> <s> i simple do not understand the reason for that <e> <s> there is no reason and no logic <e> <s> it is what lawyers pompously call a <e>",

right <e> <s> i must apologise that i referred to a new subsection <e> <s> it should have been subsection as my noble friend has said <e> <s> with that explanation and in the hope that those who inspired me to move the amendment are satisfied also i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that explanation <e> <s> i think those advising me and the agriculture law association on this amendment will wish to consider very carefully what my noble friend has said <e> <s> speaking for myself i am grateful and i do not wish to carry it further at this moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in addition to what he has said about the need for training teachers of children with special needs there is a great need for more teachers specially and fully trained for teaching the mentally handicapped <e> <s> will he bear in mind that at the stockport college of technology there is an excellent two-year course i think the only one of its kind now going on and will he having made those inquiries do what he can to see that there are more of such courses introduced elsewhere <e>",

cases and in some instances as the bill later envisages would be perfectly justified <e> <s> therefore it should be made clear at the very outset of the bill in clause that it is unreasonable discrimination that the noble earl and those who support him on the bill are trying to prevent <e> <s> although it might have been better if there had been an amendment to cover this it is relevant to our consideration of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like to support what the noble baroness lady masham said <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> i

line leave out mental otherwise the point which is covered by amendment no <e> <s> might go by default <e>", "<cs> may i say that for reasons that will be apparent i support amendment no <e> <s> which has been moved by the noble lord lord ennals but without prejudice to ones attitude on his later amendments <e> <s> i made it clear at second reading that although i am president of mencap i was speaking for myself in saying that the bill was not suitable for the protection of the interests of the mentally ill and handicapped <e> <s> indeed i felt and still feel and this is again a personal opinion that it could cause great disappointment and distress to the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i will not trouble your lordships with the arguments which i used at second reading but i would stress that by the time the mentally handicapped have gone through the legal procedures which would be involved in asserting their rights even with the best will in the world on the part of all concerned a great deal of delay will have taken place <e>", "<cs> if i may briefly deal with that point conciliation is in itself a somewhat vague concept and would be in these circumstances <e> <s> the bill gives specific rights to people to litigate as a parallel remedy to conciliation by the commission <e> <s> perhaps i may say that the management committee of mencap which met last week when i could not be there was very doubtful about the work of the commission and it is upon the existence of the commission that conciliation would depend <e> <s> conciliation is all right if we understand it for the most glaring and flagrant cases but there is a great twilight area in which conciliation as we know from the other examples which the noble lord has given the race relations commission and the equal opportunities commission is not the answer <e> <s> therefore i do think we should consider the principal right which the bill gives to people that is the right to litigate <e>", "<cs> may i first say that i have some sympathy with the method of drafting which brings definitions to the front of the bill <e> <s> we do that with statutory instruments but for some reason the draftsmen have always resisted doing it in bills and ministers who are responsible for drafting have gone along with it quite wrongly <e> <s> but here we have a definition of disability coming on early and to that extent i think that the noble lord has performed a service in inviting your lordships to consider the possibility of having it in <e>", "<cs> with deep respect to the noble earl i do not think that he is right in saving that the elimination of clause would mean that there was nothing left in the bill <e> <s> there would still he the right of people to sue in the county court or the high court on the grounds of discrimination <e> <s> there would still be the whole of part ii which places heavy burdens upon local authorities which have been expressed as costing million <e>", "<cs> mr rix has written a letter in i think rather guarded terms to the noble earl to which he and i have already referred <e> <s> as i said earlier the management committee although the most important body in a way in mencap is not the top body <e> <s> the top body is the national council which has not yet had a chance to formulate policy on this point <e> <s> mr rix does marvellous work for us and for the mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> may i say that i have the enormous pleasure of for once agreeing with the noble earl <e> <s> it is quite absurd that we should within any statute refer to other parts of the statute <e> <s> it is mere surplusage to do so and from the purely drafting point of view whatever other motive the noble earl may have had <e> <s> i think he has done right to move this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble earl lord attlee on this amendment but before i speak to it i wonder whether i may say what a real pleasure it is to have him speaking here again in this house <e> <s> we all enjoyed his maiden speech on second reading and we are thankful that that was not a finality <e> <s> we hope that we shall have him speak again especially on these matters <e> <s> when i entered another place as long ago as i was approached by the prime minister of the day the noble earls distinguished father who came up to me in the smoking room one day and said i gather you were at univ <e> <s> referring to the same college at oxford that we were at <e> <s> i thought how typical of that great man to refer to a young and humble back-bencher just arrived when he was prime minister and make contact with him in that way <e> <s> i have never forgotten and i was always grateful <e>", "<cs> i had given notice of my intention to oppose this question and my intention remains the same in spite of the amendment just made which is undoubtedly an improvement <e> <s> the basic trouble with clause is one which we come across very frequently in that it is an attempt to spell out all the hypothetical circumstances which might arise instead of leaving it to the court to decide in general terms whether or not there has been unreasonable discrimination <e> <s> one could make a rather long technical speech about this but i will spare your lordships <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has lifted the curtain upon the most remarkable possibilities <e> <s> in the first place i did not understand that this bill referred to linguistic disadvantages <e> <s> if we are going to blind ourselves to linguistic disadvantages and say that every time somebody possesses one they must nevertheless be turned down for a job in which linguistic capacity or an ability to speak our own language is an essential then my goodness there will be disappointments on the part of potential litigants <e>", "<cs> if i may with the deepest respect presume to say so to the noble earl if he wants to find examples to illustrate the application of the bill he should find an example which comes within the terms of it and clearly the one which he has chosen does not do so <e> <s> i say that with deep respect <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his opening remarks <e> <s> i did not do quite as well as he was kind enough to say because i should have said in relation to clause that it is not merely exemptions that can he made under clause as they can under subsection of clause but it is such modifications as are necessary that can be made <e> <s> that leaves us somewhat in the dark <e> <s> what modifications <e> <s> who will decide whether they are requisite <e> <s> so the combination of these two clauses is very confusion at the moment <e>", "<cs> to ease your lordships minds i do not intend to divide the committee on this clause stand part motion but i should like to ask the noble earl whether he will explain clause it would help <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth has mentioned circumstances with which i am familiar because in a large block of flats in westminster we had a flat on which there was a lease in which it was written that no person of unsound mind shall be admitted but we regularly took our mentally handicapped daughter there <e> <s> nothing ever happened and i knew it would not happen because she had no behaviour problem <e> <s> if the landlords had <e>", "<cs> no i think the noble lord dishonours the people of our country when he says so <e> <s> i have never heard of a clause like that being enforced although it is right that there should be such a clause because there are people both mentally ill and mentally handicapped people who can create a frightful disturbance in a block of flats <e> <s> it is right that the landlords should have that up their sleeve <e> <s> but it was obviously too widely drawn in that case <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to detain your lordships further but i said earlier that it is not good enough for the regulations under this bill which are of vast importance and many of them can be made to be merely subject to annulment by the negative procedure <e> <s> after all let us consider the various places in the bill where the secretary of state can make regulations <e> <s> indeed he can make regulations which will enable the law to be altered and altered substantially <e> <s> to have that merely the subject of a negative resolution is not good enough and i hope that between now and report the noble earl will consider amending the bill so that regulations are subject to an affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord was coming to his conclusion <e> <s> i was going to ask him before he sits down whether he will make it clear that he is suggesting that for example buckingham palace and other important places should be given the same kind of protection as is given to foreign embassies under the criminal law act but that the homes of ordinary people should not be given that protection <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first set at rest the mind of the noble lord lord airedale by reminding <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite different from what i heard the noble lord say <e> <s> i am glad that he has clarified the position <e> <s> he is of course right in saying that there was a lack of security and that that was the main cause <e> <s> but fagan did drew attention forcibly and clearly to a serious gap in the criminal law that has worried many people in their homes ever since <e> <s> my noble friend is now trying to fill that gap and i am sure he is right to do so <e>", "<cs> one must concede my lords that there was an onus on the prosecution in the first bill to prove fear distress and so on and that onus is not repeated in the present bill <e> <s> but the government having taken advice have come to the conclusion and have no doubt borne in mind the provisions of the criminal law act that it is not necessary to place that particular burden on the prosecution <e> <s> they are instead of making it a defence placing on the prosecution a burden which is a negative one not always easy to prove that the trespass was done without reasonable excuse <e> <s> speaking for myself i think there is a justification for that attitude although i must concede that this bill does not specifically call upon the prosecution to prove the things that were in the previous bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is not only a question of incoming calls but that for family reasons patients very often need to make outgoing calls as well and it is frequently made difficult for them to do so and sometimes the expense of doing so is considerable <e> <s> in further consideration of this matter will he kindly bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recollect what my noble friend lord home of the hirsel said in our debate on th february about the importance of verification of agreements on disarmament and so on and the russian reluctance ever to agree to any verification of any kind so far <e> <s> can my noble friend the minister do his utmost to ensure that this point is brought home to the russians as a test of their sincerity <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord may have misheard or not taken on board what i was saying namely that under the present law the doctrine of trespass <e>", "<cs> i said so <e>", "<cs> i think i owe it to your lordships and to my noble friend to explain on the point that my noble friend has made about the difference between civil trespass and criminal trespass that the words as a trespasser would have to be interpreted by the courts in the light of the existing law whether it is criminal law or the law of tort <e> <s> there is such a thing already as criminal trespass for example trespass in pursuit of gain <e> <s> the courts would be entitled to look to the deciding cases under that branch of the criminal law <e> <s> but they will also be entitled to look to the definitions of trespass in the law of tort <e> <s> therefore with deep respect to my noble friend i think that it would be taking too narrow a view to say that we should not look to the existing civil law in relation to the definition of a trespasser <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord airedale for his support on the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to all those noble lords who have commented upon it and spoken about it <e> <s> i assure my noble friend lord onslow that when i come to withdraw the amendment his attempted flattery will not have influenced me one bit <e>", "<cs> after the support which the noble lord lord airedale gave me on amendment no <e> <s> i feel a bit churlish in having to oppose him on this amendment <e> <s> but i wonder whether he would not on consideration realise that he is introducing a rather extraordinary proposition into the criminal law <e> <s> what this amendment says in effect is that unless a criminal is arrested in the exact spot or on the premises where he committed the crime he should not be arrested and convicted however serious the crime might be in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> may i say that the noble lord lord mishcon has done the committee a service by raising this point again <e> <s> when in answer to a question in effect by him on second reading i gave by the light of nature and to the best of my recollection of the law the answer to which he referred i may or may not have been right but the government since then have had the opportunity of taking advice and will no doubt give us the true answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the need to reach a satisfactory revision of the arrangements under the cap is so fundamental that my right honourable friend the prime minister will have the full support of most people in this country in refusing to agree to a temporary and unsatisfactory package which would have been unfair to this country <e> <s> secondly may i ask my noble friend whether he is in a position to give us the reasons which i do not think have so far been stated as to why it is that france and italy have decided to block the repayment of the monies which are lawfully owing to us at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords should not inspectors have power to award costs against any party whose troublesome behaviour causes the inquiry to be unnecessarily prolonged or the police to be called in <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is an agreed matter i do not want to take up further time with it <e> <s> i should simply like to endorse what my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale said and say that i rejoice even more about the omission of the words proposed to be left out than at the insertion of the words to be included <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i think that the noble earl has been wise to table this amendment and i hope that your lordships will accept it <e> <s> my own experience in a long life has been that discrimination in favour of people is a much more frequent occurrence than discrimination against them <e> <s> so this matter did most certainly require clarification and the noble earls amendment provides it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say as i did before that if a definition is to come it should come early in the bill and that is right <e> <s> i find that this definition omits mental handicap and mental illness <e> <s> coupled with amendment no <e> <s> this appears to be the deliberate intention of the noble earl and the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> in view of what i said at second reading and committee i can but welcome that omission if that is a thing that can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i am afraid that the noble earl has done something that he did not intend because in this definition there is no mention of mental handicap mental impairment or mental illness <e> <s> the nearest we get to it is psychological function whatever that may be <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl or the noble lord lord ennals if he has leave of the house to reply to this short debate could explain what psychological function means <e> <s> one has to bear in mind that the first part of the paragraph down to the word normal after which the comma appears is qualified by the second part of the paragraph <e> <s> if i may i will read it <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think the noble earl has got this right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this is right but i have to confess that the business moves so much faster than does my mind that i did not understand why it was that amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth was not agreed to <e> <s> perhaps it is too late for me to complain about this but i think that it was a very good amendment and should have been agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask him to clarify one point <e> <s> at the committee stage my noble friend lord skelmersdale said that a new cumulative supplement setting out the whole of this act with the previous legislation could be produced within four months of receiving the queens printers copy <e> <s> if i understood and heard correctly my noble friend lord bellwin he said that having consulted the editor it would be possible to do that within two months <e> <s> can my noble friend say within two months of when <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale in moving this amendment was kind enough to warn your lordships that he had asked me to reply to the debate and that is what i now propose to do very briefly <e> <s> i am sure that we are all deeply indebted to the noble and learned lord lord simon for drawing attention to the need for early consolidation and i speak generally when i

there any further scope on the part of the immigration service to try to prevent the coming to this country of people who may be terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend suggest to our right honourable friend the secretary of state that he might well combine his diplomatic skill and great experience in our law tactfully to point out to the chinese that our systems of justice are quite different and that we in particular attach great importance to the independence of the judiciary <e>", "<cs> my lords having opposed the bill introduced by the noble earl lord longford i would not wish it to be thought that any silence on my part with regard to this bill meant that i was in disagreement with it <e> <s> i think that this bill can serve a very useful purpose <e> <s> it would

guildford will see when he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the if i may say so moderate constructive and limited contribution of the noble lord lord beswick has been in refreshing contrast with other speeches we have heard from noble lords on the other side of the house which appear to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for clarifying that <e> <s> i obviously misheard the part of his speech in which he seemed to be saying that he did not think that a total ballot of all the members was necessary for all elections <e> <s> but i apologise <e> <s> i am glad he has clarified that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very satisfactory thought for us to bear in mind <e> <s> i am grateful once more to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords quite frankly that is a very big question <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill about it <e> <s> whatever the answer to that question that would not invalidate what is in the billthat is my answer to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be a great contribution to world peace if the russians were to abandon this insistence on always having superiority over everybody else combined <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any evidence that the report of the bma which was made by a specially appointed committee of the association has been supported by the thousands of its members <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that it is right in civil defence to prepare for not only a vast holocaust which was the underlying assumption of the bma report but also any eventuality perhaps of a lesser kind which might occur and from which there would be millions of survivors <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that england taken as a separate entity and leaving aside the small island and city states is one of the six most densely populated countries in the world <e> <s> however thanks to an initiative in your lordships house in we have successful family planning arrangements which are enabling us to reduce the birth rate and stabilise the population <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that therefore the active participation of her majestys government in this conference will be welcomed by many other countries as an example <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment would have the result that a person subject to a community service order would be required to serve on a jury if summoned to do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon with his usual kindness ability and i dare even say charm has tried to persuade your lordships that this amendment should be accepted <e> <s> i fear that i must put forward a contrary view to the committee <e>", "<cs> most certainly <e> <s> i am grateful for that apology <e> <s> we assume that this young man in that position suddenly gets summoned to serve on a jury in a different town from that where he lives and a different place from that where he is doing the community service order <e> <s> the mind boggles at the chaotic position in which he would find himself <e> <s> it is no answer to say that he could apply to the court to be exempt from jury service <e> <s> i say that he should not be placed in that difficult position <e>", "<cs> first let me say that it has been extremely helpful to have had this amendment moved <e> <s> the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and combined is that a person placed on probation could be summoned for jury service as soon as the probation order had been served or discharged as sometimes happens <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> superficially i think that the noble lord has put his finger on quite an interesting point <e> <s> it is true that the bill does not deal with those who have been fined although it might well have done so but the logic of what the noble lord is saying is that at the report stage i should consider moving an amendment to include those who have been fined <e> <s> i am sure that that is the last thing the noble lord would wish me to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly did not intend it to have that effect <e> <s> i was bowing as i always do to the superior wisdom of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the code of practice proposed under the police and criminal evidence bill will deal with only one of the very unsatisfactory features of this case <e> <s> would he not agree that when there has been a case of such notoriety which has caused such public anxiety rather more attention needs to be given to the matter than merely revising the code of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i expect many of your lordships were as surprised as i was by the view of the noble lord lord sefton of garston that having won a large majority in the house of commons at the last general election the government nevertheless have no mandate for their legislation <e> <s> that is a proposition which must have appeared very strange to his front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must leave the facts to speak for themselves with regard to that <e> <s> if i may say so i think that the noble lord lord harris of high cross really hit the nail on the head when he said that there is no ideal solution to this matter <e> <s> in the background of the decisions that we have to take is the timetable with which the government were faced and with which another place was faced <e> <s> the timetable in the briefest terms is this that the conservative party won the last general election and again formed the government in june that unless something be done the metropolitan councils and the greater london council will have to face elections in may and it is proposed that the changes envisaged as a result of this manifesto commitment shall take place with effect from april <e> <s> that is a very tight timetable <e> <s> we are faced with a situation which has never previously arisen <e> <s> a tier of local government is to be abolished and such functions as it has are to be performed by existing councils which are not to be abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fair enough point to make except that we have to bear in mind that the circumstances with which we are faced today have never arisen before and may never arise again <e> <s> if they do arise again the sensible decision which the government have taken might conceivably also be taken by another government in similar circumstances which i would have thought are extremely unlikely <e> <s> but clearly of course we are always abandoning our own precedents whenever we amend legislation and if as the noble lord lord hooson suggests it is a dangerous precedent on which governments could rely in future rather than parliament then it comes to the same thing because all governments are answerable to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very anxious the noble lord spoke for quite a long time i think half an hour <e>", "<cs> yes my lords over half an hour <e> <s> there are more speeches to follow mine and i am anxious not to take up more time having arguments with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> bribing the people with their own money my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is merely a matter of words shall i say pleasing the people by using the money that is raised for them by the rates of the greater london council in order to please them <e> <s> the noble and learned lord with his long experience can put whatever parliamentary interpretation he pleases on that process <e>", "<cs> it might help if i say at this stage briefly that some years ago i appeared for the prosecution in a case in which an unqualified person was convicted of obtaining money by false pretences which consisted in his claiming to be able to test eyes and prescribe lenses for correcting vision <e> <s> he had an elaborate box of filed lenses and he had books on the subject but he had no training and no clue how to do it properly <e>", "<cs> on reflection i hope that the noble lord lord rugby will not persist in the line which he has just taken <e> <s> all my working life until recent years i have belonged to a very highly competitive profession indeed <e> <s> but it is also a highly qualified profession <e> <s> we hope that these regulations will have something to say about the requirement that people in the competitive world which the government quite rightly envisaged have adequate qualifications or are subject to adequate safeguards <e> <s> that should be so whatever the interests of opticians as they now are may be <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord rugby will not expect the government to accept his argument as part of this case <e>", "<cs> my lords in his excellent maiden speech my noble friend lord blakenham said that the act was a major step forward <e> <s> indeed i think that the debate we have had tonight is of itself some evidence of that <e> <s> it was a major step forward at the time in spite of misgivings expressed on both sides of your lordships house <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord onslow said there is a new climate of opinion and several examples of it have been given <e> <s> i should like to add the further example of the establishment of the farming and wildlife trust and i hope that it will receive very wide support from farmers and landowners <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in justice my noble friend should mention that my noble friend lord onslow farms a great deal of his own land as well as being a keen conservationist and therefore perhaps he was an ideal person to introduce this debate <e>", "<cs> i am not unsympathetic to the broad motive lying behind this amendment <e> <s> may i take a rather detailed point first <e> <s> although the two speeches we have heard referred to those detained under the mental health act <e>", "<cs> i feel that the noble lord lord ennals has done a valuable service in putting forward this probing amendment <e> <s> we are in a slight difficulty it is not a great one but it is a familiar one in that power is given to a minister to make <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilmarnock has referred to an important point on which we really should try to get an assurance from the government <e> <s> to my mind it is unthinkable that a person treated within the hospital eye service and who needs as the amendment says complex or high-powered lenses and who at present receives a modest subsidy of should not continue to receive it <e> <s> one must hear in mind that even with that subsidy those people treated even within the hospital eye service may have to pay a very large sum indeed <e> <s> i have heard of sums being paid of over and above the <e> <s> therefore this is of great importance <e>", "<cs> speaking for myself i am to a great extent reassured by what my noble friend lord caithness has said <e> <s> but i hope that he will not take it amiss if i also say that we shall want to study very carefully what he has said because this is not a straightforward matter <e> <s> therefore while thanking him very much in order to make quite sure i think that we should leave the matter open until the report stage <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to take up time but i feel that we should ask the government to consider the drafting of just one small phrase which arises on paragraph in the newly-written paragraph a of the schedule on page <e> <s> under the head <e>", "<cs> i think that the government have clause about right although i have misgivings about clause as it stands <e> <s> i am very surprised at clause which reads <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that explanation <e> <s> i shall want to study it because i feel that subsection as drafted does not bear out what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support my noble friend lord cullen <e> <s> he has deployed rather fully a matter to which i was proposing to refer on the question <e> <s> whether the clause shall stand part <e> <s> all i shall say now in supporting him is that what he has said will enable me to make my remarks that much briefer <e>", "<cs> what i have to say is on a fairly short point on clause stand part <e> <s> as i said when we were discussing the last amendment i can shorten it because so much of the background to the short plea that i wish to make has already been described <e> <s> however i would just mention that this is a long and complicated clause the effect of which will depend upon regulations <e> <s> the regulations will in turn in their content and in the way in which determinations are made in accordance with them depend not only upon the provisions of this bill but also upon the present law <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that we should not let this clause be added to the bill now <e> <s> i think that we should hut if we do not have the benefit of knowing the result of this appeal between now and report stage our difficulty in handling it at report stage will be very great <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i should make it clear that i agree with him that this is not a matter for government decision as to whether the appeal should be expedited <e> <s> all i am asking is that the government should agree to an application made by the appellant to expedite the appeal <e> <s> that is the only extent to which the government need to take action <e> <s> the decision must be that of the court <e> <s> but i think that when the court hears the application and hears the advantage that it would be for parliament to have the appeal expedited the court may take a favourable view of the matter <e>", "<cs> yes but under the procedure of the high court there is a discretion on the part of the court to hear the further applications <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should be grateful as the noble lord lord mishcon said on the last amendment to the usual channels because they have enabled us to have this most interesting debate <e> <s> may i say how much one appreciates the interest and the value of the contributions made by all those noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i wonder whether i may first of all deal with the point just made by the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies <e> <s> before doing so may i say that it is such a great advantage to the house when a lord of appeal in ordinary retires because he then gains the freedom which he was not fully able to exercise previously in taking part in our debates <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i misheard the noble lord between and now <e> <s> there is indeed a difference alas <e> <s> there has been a difference in each year since and continuing through and in that there is more crime in this country <e> <s> the administration of criminal justice has been under greater strain and there has been more jury nobbling <e> <s> jury nobbling is made much easier when jurors themselves have a past criminal record <e>", "<cs> of course my lords it is not unknown for different statisticians within the government service to give different answers to the same problem <e> <s> all that i can say is this <e> <s> i have got my figures from those collated from probation officers all over the country and handed to me by the home office <e> <s> i shall repeat them <e> <s> in per cent <e> <s> of those placed on probation had been convicted of burglary per cent <e> <s> of violence of one kind and another and no fewer than per cent <e> <s> for theft or handling stolen goods <e> <s> it is very pertinent and rather interesting to refer to a study made by the home office in and i would have thought that the experience gained then is possibly an indication of what still happens and may happen in the future <e> <s> the study in of those convicted in showed that per cent <e> <s> of them of all ages were reconvicted within six years <e> <s> sixty-three per cent <e> <s> that is surely a figure that is most material to the arguments used in support of the amendment including the argument used by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the purpose of this amendment and i hope that the government will say that they accept its purpose <e>", "<cs> speaking for myself i quite understand why my noble friend lord gowrie could <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me before he sits down he has overlooked two technical factors <e> <s> if we now try to strike clause out of the bill we shall in effect be negativing the amendment which we added to the bill last week <e> <s> the other point which i recognise is mere mechanics but which will nevertheless be an awful nuisance for the staff is that if clause goes out all subsequent clauses will have to be renumbered in the copy of the bill that we get at report stage <e> <s> that will throw us into a thorough state of confusion <e>", "<cs> i also oppose this amendment <e> <s> may i say briefly even though it presumes to supplement what the noble and learned lord lord denning has already said that the courts have adequate powers for dealing with frivolous or vexatious litigants which is what the noble lord lord howie was concerned with <e> <s> the courts can strike out actions which are brought by them and award costs against them <e> <s> that in itself is really quite a sufficient safeguard <e>", "<cs> under the provision of the third line of subsection of clause the court is to make a declaration <e> <s> if the court finds in the words of amendment no <e> <s> that the failure has simply consisted of a procedural irregularity presumably the declaration would say so <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord lord denning that no injustice would be done by leaving it like that <e> <s> the court whatever it finds is free to find what the amendment proposes <e> <s> one naturally has some sympathy with the spirit of the amendment but technically it does not seem to be necessary <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the committee for not having been here at the start of this discussion but i am very familiar with the issues which arise <e> <s> i wish to pick up one point made just now by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> of course anything which simplifies drafting in the presentation of a bill is to be welcomed <e> <s> i would have thought that the expression the course of justice is virtually synonymous with the administration of justice <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones also wishes to leave out as i understand it from his amendment <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend is being asked to reconsider this schedule may i make the suggestion that there does not seem to be any underlying principle which separates the items in the schedule from some of the items in the clause <e> <s> i should have thought that for the sake of public understanding of what will become quite an important piece of the law it would be better to have the whole thing either in the schedule with a reference from the clause or else all set out in the clause <e> <s> as it is i think that it is very muddled and unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the powerful plea made by my noble friend lord broxbourne with if i may say so his usual lucidity and persuasion <e> <s> i think there is only one important fact that i need add to what he has said and that is this if your lordships will turn to amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list you will see that we are asking for only one more member to be added to the constituent council <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness ignoring entirely the vast numbers of people who go from the london boroughs to work in the city every day <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether she will bear in mind that this is an exceptional case in that although there are only voters resident in the city nevertheless the people who go to work there earn the rates which enable no less than million to be paid to londoners in general <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the british contribution towards this project eventually have to be expressed in the estimates or in some form of public accounts in terms of pounds sterling <e> <s> would it not be better <e> <s> therefore if we were kept informed in that way <e>", "<cs> although i have a great deal of sympathy with what has been said in favour of codes of practice dealing with these matters i am somewhat surprised that we are dealing with this at this stage <e> <s> therefore i assume that amendment no <e> <s> is really a probing amendment <e> <s> your lordships have agreed that amendment no <e> <s> which is a specific amendment to the relevant clause clause no <e> <s> dealing with codes of practice can be referred to now <e> <s> but i would very much hope and expect that my noble friend on the front bench will say that these matters should be dealt with in a code under clause and not separately and at this early part of the bill <e> <s> as i am referring to clause may i humbly give notice that when we come to that clause i shall be suggesting that there should be a code covering the interrogation arrest and treatment in the hands of the police of those suffering from mental handicap and mental illness <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend agree that his argument would apply especially in those cases where the exit was marked no exit <e>", "<cs> would it not be enough to say <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon not only for drawing our attention to this rather strange subsection but also for intercepting my departure from the chamber in order to attend a public function which alas i have to do tonight <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will take careful note of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it is a very strange provision and indeed subsection <e>", "<cs> i venture to suggest that despite that painstaking explanation which my noble friend has been so good as to give to your lordships it really comes to this <e> <s> it would be much simpler to repeal the various measures which the government suggest do not need to remain on the statute book <e> <s> we have already got a very lengthy repealing schedule as is usual in cases like this and to add another page or even two pages to its length would not matter greatly <e> <s> but if she can tell us that the various measures are already contained in the repealing statute let us make that clear in this subsection <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether the statement that he has just made is a reflection of existing indeed of well-established practice because if that is so it does not seem necessary that we should legislate to cover the point <e>", "<cs> the assimilation with scottish law to which the noble lord lord foot has referred could be to a very great extent achieved by deleting the words in the last line on page namely for a term of five years and by deleting subsection on page <e> <s> it does not seem as though it would be very difficult <e>", "<cs> although this is a drafting amendment and we are told that that is so it does once more point to the need for the kind of simplification in the law to which reference was made on the previous amendment <e> <s> i think that we should bear that in mind when considering this purely drafting amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to oppose this amendment and as i have not previously spoken on subsection and in particular on paragragh <e>", "<cs> so that i may understand this amendment i wonder whether the noble lord lord mishcon would envisage these circumstances <e> <s> supposing i were the relevant person and i decided to nominate him as a person to accept service of a summons on my behalf without ever having been in touch with the noble lord and without knowing whether or not he would accept service <e> <s> would that be in his opinion a valid compliance with his amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend will be so kind as to explain <e> <s> is it for the constable to decide <e>", "<cs> if that interpretation is correct one wonders why the amendment is necessary <e> <s> however i will not pursue the point <e>", "<cs> this is another rather strange provision <e> <s> it is a case of in effect a repealing method <e> <s> it is an indirect and rather obscure repealing method <e> <s> it is a non-textual repealing amendment of a great many previous provisions <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord really has considered whether it is necessary and desirable for us to go into quite so much detail in our legislation especially when a minister has pointed out that the matter will be covered in other ways in circumstances where detail is expected <e> <s> in view of the explanation that we have had from my noble friend the under-secretary of state at the home office i consider that this is not the kind of detail that we should insist upon <e>", "<cs> several distinctions could be made <e> <s> one is the enforceability of the provision and the consequences of not obeying it <e> <s> i do not think that in this case we are likely to find that anything will he very consequential when no record is made as a result of the statutory provision rather than a record being made in pursuit of the code of practice <e> <s> in any event it would i assume he a matter for police discipline <e> <s> this is a mainly administrative question concerned with the operation of the police forces <e> <s> i should have thought that this is not the type of penal provision to put into a bill of this kind <e>", "<cs> it would be no different at all <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that if this amendment were accepted and a person had been arrested on a charge of burglary or theft and a police officer were making a search for that purpose the police officer would he precluded from following up a suspicion which could easily arise that the person concerned might have some drugs on him <e> <s> it would be very restrictive and quite unreasonable if in those circumstances the police officer was not also allowed to search for the drugs <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me have we not to be careful that we do not create a conflict between two statutes which we could be doing if we accepted the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord plant who has fully explained the reasons for this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the clause as it stands misses a necessary opportunity and i do hope that what the noble lord has said will be heeded <e> <s> while i am on my feet i should like also to say that i think the amendment in the name of the noble baroness lady masham has a great deal to commend it <e>", "<cs> for the sake of clarity may i point out that both of these amendments could be made <e> <s> it is not a question of amendment no <e> <s> a being broader and therefore of including amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> both amendments could be made <e>", "<cs> i supported the noble lord lord plant earlier with great sincerity <e> <s> but having heard what has been said especially by the noble earl i wonder whether i may make a plea to the noble lord lord plant that we should all be given an opportunity to consider this matter further and to come back to it again at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to that last point is there any hope that the employers and the transport and general workers union in considering how to settle this dispute will bear in mind that thousands of jobs in the steel industry are at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend on the front bench was good enough to mention that i had raised a doubt about the adequacy of the drafting at committee stage <e> <s> having looked again today at the clause as it now stands and having considered the amendments that my noble friend wishes to have made i find myself in a dilemma <e> <s> i do not think that one is any better than the other <e> <s> i am sorry to have to say that because i realise that much honest endeavour has gone into the attempt to improve the clause <e> <s> i am attracted by the suggestion of the noble lord lord ennals that we might try to persuade the draftsman under persuasion perhaps from my noble friend to get something that really is a little more clear and that will fulfil the intentions which i think exist on both sides of the house <e> <s> i am attracted by the suggestion from the noble lord on the cross-benches that somehow the word unregistered should be brought in <e> <s> that puts the matter beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> i agree that it would be right to discuss my amendment with that which has just been moved by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> frankly i must say that i am not in a position to challenge anything that the noble lord lord ennals has said although my understanding of some of the things he has said hearsay understanding does vary slightly from what he has told your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be right for me to intervene again rather than leaving it to the noble lord lord ennals who will have to make the final decision on his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful and i shall not move my amendment when the time comes <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord bear in mind that clause is mainly an enabling clause <e>", "<cs> my lords for reasons which may be familiar to some of your lordships i naturally support anything that is a prop to the mentally handicapped <e> <s> however it may be that i have completely misread this clause <e> <s> to substitute the age of for the age of would seem to be a disadvantage to those concerned <e> <s> therefore the purpose of the amendment seems to me to be somewhat unusual <e> <s> if i have understood the position correctly and perhaps i have not and the age was the severe disablement allowance could not be paid until three years later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i feared when i intervened just now i was wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not <e> <s> it is an advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the suggestion made by the noble lord lord henderson and point out that under subsection there are to be regulations anyway <e> <s> that being so it seems absurd that when making those regulations the power for which the noble lord has asked should not be included <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i may speak if i get the leave of the house <e> <s> have i the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my gratitude to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and to the <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether he would join with me in acknowledging the generous offer by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to treat the position of the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill as a separate issue and refer that matter to the home secretary <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i have come to a different conclusion <e> <s> the noble and learned lords amendment in common with the two previous amendments attempts to codify i think that in this case that is the right word and alter a part of the law which deals with the discretion of the judges in criminal cases <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord scarman knows i am rather predisposed in favour of codification in certain circumstances <e> <s> there are arguments for and against it <e> <s> if the case law is in a state of confusion or has reached conclusions which are no longer acceptable to parliament there is a clear case for altering and codifying the case law even though it dealt with discretions <e>", "<cs> when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway pointed out that if something needed to be done amendment no <e> <s> b would be a preferable way of dealing with it <e> <s> at that time i expressed doubts as to whether it was desirable that we should legislate in this way in this statute because we have the law which has been evolved by the courts <e> <s> i expressed the view that it might be better for it to continue to be evolved instead of being so to speak crystallised by statute <e> <s> this amendment has great superficial attraction because of its simplicity <e> <s> if however it is intended to be a statement of the present law or a simplification of the present law i would simply say that it is an oversimplification of the present law as can be seen if one reads the <e>", "<cs> although for various reasons i am strongly in favour of the attitudes of the police federation and have been glad to support the noble lord lord plant in several of the amendments that he has put forward i find it rather difficult to accept these two amendments mainly because i do not think that they are really necessary to achieve the laudable objects that he has in mind <e> <s> i say that mainly for the reason given by my noble friend lord elton <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to support the amendment of the noble lord lord plant <e> <s> one must bear in mind that a police officer who finds himself in this position may long before disciplinary proceedings take place have found himself suspended and he may of course be deprived of promotion <e> <s> although it may not happen at that stage his expectation of promotion may have faded somewhat into the background <e>", "<cs> i find this very surprising indeed <e> <s> in effect my noble friend is saying that the police federation should pay these costs <e> <s> the police officer concerned may not have any kind of service contract with the police federation requiring the federation to pay <e> <s> frankly i am not sure of the position and perhaps the noble lord lord plant can help on what is the contractual position between a police officer and the police federation <e>", "<cs> i can and very quickly <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones with his long experience will be able to support me in this <e> <s> we both were in the army <e> <s> i think my noble friend lord elton was too <e> <s> when there was a court martial the officer or soldier concerned was always represented free of expense to himself by lawyers within the armys legal service and very distinguished lawyers they sometimes

disciplinary cases in which the line between a disciplinary charge and a criminal charge is very blurred <e>", "<cs> i do apologise for coming in yet again but i think the crux of this matter was hit upon by the noble lord lord elystan-morgan when he referred to the police force as being vulnerable <e> <s> the police force are unique in that they are the only general law enforcement body in this country <e> <s> we all rely upon them <e> <s> we pass laws week after week in parliament but it is the police who are going to have to enforce them and very frequently that requires great courage strength of character and ability <e> <s> of course they are bound to fall foul of members of the public who are unwilling to co-operate with parliament in the carrying out of the law or the enforcement of the law by the police <e>", "<cs> with deep respect i have not said that at all <e> <s> what i have said is that the police are responsible for law enforcement <e> <s> in carrying out their responsibilities they may find that members of the public are unwilling to co-operate and not only that are prepared to make complaints against them which may or may not be justified <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend from experience just as he knows from home office experience my experience is much older than his but just as fresh in my mind and the noble lord lord elystan-morgan can bear me out that it came to our knowledge that complaints against the police are exceedingly numerous <e> <s> a very large number of them are frivolous <e> <s> others appear on the face of it to have some substance and have to be investigated <e> <s> still others will lead to disciplinary proceedings which may or may not result in the police officer having been found guilty of whatever we care to call it misconduct <e>", "<cs> i was very much hoping that we might receive a clear indication of the governments view of this first amendment <e> <s> i really feel that that does stand <e>", "<cs> if the matter is voted upon now in effect it will be closed and very possibly closed against this amendment whereas if we take the advice of my noble friend lord elton that he and we should study what has been said and come back to it at report stage the matter will remain open and there may be some advantage in that <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord plant will not press this matter to a division now though i am on his side in this <e>", "<cs> may i thank my noble friend lord elton for his immediate proposition which i accept gladly and congratulate him on it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there may be a desire on both sides of your lordships house to reach a decision before oclock <e> <s> i shall therefore be brief <e> <s> i too should like to congratulate the government on these well-conceived and workable proposals and particularly to express to my noble friend lord gowrie my apprecication of the part that he played in reaching them <e> <s> i believe sincerely that these proposals will be a big step towards real democracy in our trade unions <e> <s> whatever may be felt by some of their leaders and by the front bench opposite about them their members i am confident will welcome these proposals when they see the opportunities that they give <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this order <e> <s> i am sure that all those who would like to see an improvement in the statute book must welcome the method which has been used again on this occasion <e> <s> the importance of progress in consolidation cannot be under-estimated and i am sure that most of us would like to see even more of it although there has been improved progress in recent years <e> <s> but the very strict statutory requirements affecting consolidation have undoubtedly been a hindrance to progress <e> <s> they have caused delay sometimes because of the sheer complexity of trying to consolidate a mass of previous legislation which may be conflicting and to do so while still adhering to the statutory requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord gowrie and indeed to the secretary of state for the long letter which he wrote to me which my noble friend mentioned <e> <s> i think the explanation which has been given or at any rate part of it intensifies the need for this amendment <e> <s> i feel bound to say that because the explanation given depends on the supposition that subsection has something to do with the way in which the principal executive committee is elected whereas it has nothing whatever to do with that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some years ago when the labour party asked parliament to nationalise the coal mines they insisted that the national coal board should be constitutionally independent <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was once attracted to the idea of pr for the united kingdom may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that if we had that system it is unlikely that any party would have an overall majority in another place and we would probably therefore have a series of coalition governments <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a humble suggestion that it would sometimes be better if ministers would chew the ammunition before firing it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is also the question of micro dots which are used by spies <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all let me thank those three noble lords who are experienced lawyers and the three laymen using their common sense who have supported me in this amendment <e> <s> i really am very surprised at the reply which we have had from my noble friend <e> <s> what he is saying is that although none of us can understand it he has been persuaded by the ammunition which he has been given and which he claims to have chewed and he can understand it <e> <s> and he says in effect that if there is any difficulty it will be overcome by police training <e> <s> that i find an over-sanguine expression <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in the middle of my speech in reply to this short debate <e> <s> may i thank my noble friend for the second bite that he has given to this rather tough cherry <e> <s> i welcome his undertaking to consider not only subsection of clause and the first schedule to the bill but as has been mentioned this whole collection of complicated but very important provisions which are contained in clauses to <e> <s> that is a very great advance and i am very grateful for the support of those noble lords whose persuasion has led the government to that view and while thanking my noble friend and them i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the noble lord lord wigoder had got this right <e> <s> it seems to me that the word appears must mean and must be interpreted as meaning as appears reasonable on any objective criteria <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the same as saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very warmly to support the in my opinion very strong case which has been put forward by the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> we owe him a debt for having raised this matter on clause stand part at committee stage and for all the trouble he has taken again today <e> <s> may i say in passing that the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord denning wished to <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the important point he has made would apply as much to the bill as it stands as it would if the amendment were made <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he mention how

attribute to him the initiative and wisdom which i attributed to the government <e> <s> i hope that my apology will be accepted by him <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept from the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that what he has put forward in this amendment is commendable practice <e> <s> but the question arises whether it should be the subject of legislation <e> <s> earlier on and not long ago my noble friend lord elton said that we should not make laws that are not enforceable and one wonders how this law would be enforced if we were to make it <e> <s> what would be the consequences for the accused person or for the police officer who failed to make the record if the law <e>", "<cs> my lords unaccustomed though i think your lordships believe i am to throwing into my friends faces the words which they have uttered recently i hope that i may be forgiven if i start off by pointing out that on the previous amendment my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said i hope i took his words down correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be convenient if i were to say a brief word now as it might be of help to the opposition front bench <e> <s> in view of what my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said about the grouping of these amendments may i respectfully point out that it would appear that the amendments to be grouped together were and are amendments nos <e> <s> and but no others with them unless of course there is some remarkable mystery about amendments nos <e> <s> a and b which does not appear on the surface <e>", "<cs> my lords my views on this matter coincide exactly with those of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack <e> <s> i implore the house to agree that these three amendments nos and will be more conveniently taken together and not cluttered up with other notable amendments in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that it would be a great deprivation if we were not able to consider amendment no <e> <s> and if convinced with regard to it to add it to the bill <e> <s> if i understand the noble lord lord mishcon correctly he is falling into the error of assuming that because there is a certain amount of overlapping in the scope of the two amendments they are therefore inconsistent <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> as was pointed out in the earlier discussion the amendment in the name of my noble and learned friend is wider in scope than amendment no <e> <s> but that does not prevent us from considering it and adding it to the bill as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make just this further point <e> <s> i think that sometimes we are entitled to assume that an amendment in broad scope may be highly desirable for us to discuss and add to a bill and that if we fail to do that especially at this relatively late stage of proceedings in both houses the bill may reach the statute book in an inadequate state <e> <s> that seems to me to be very much the position in which we find ourselves perhaps unfortunately and most unusually <e> <s> having passed the earlier amendment of more limited scope though admittedly of greater detail should not deprive us of the opportunity to consider what may be a necessary addition to the bill <e> <s> if i may express a purely personal opinion i hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will move his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in favour of the spirit of this amendment and i do not see how anyone can be against the spirit of it <e> <s> but i think that in practice it is likely to lead to a little bit more trouble than may have been envisaged <e> <s> there are so many different degrees of discrimination <e> <s> there can be the very slightest discrimination consisting merely of cutting somebody whom one knows <e> <s> on the other hand there can be very wilful discrimination coupled perhaps with harsh words and rudeness <e> <s> but as i understand it this amendment is intended to cover the very slightest discrimination as well as the more serious kinds <e> <s> with that lack of definition i feel bound to say that although i agree with the spirit of the amendment it could give rise to difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> the man may <e> <s> on the face if it have been rightly charged but when the matter has been gone into it is found that he is clearly not guilty and is therefore acquitted <e> <s> i felt that the noble and learned lord would not mind my making that correction <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not quite sure how i stand with regard to this matter <e> <s> i wanted to ask my noble friend a question <e>", "<cs> my lords lest it be thought that silence on these back benches be regarded as a lack of appreciation may i make the comment that it has been said that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains <e> <s> by that standard my noble friend is a genius <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is in the public interest that the number of people who are horn mentally handicapped should be reduced that there are very many causes of mental handicap and that it is only by continuing research into it that those causes can be isolated and prevented <e> <s> will my noble friend give an undertaking that there will be no diminution of research effort into the causes of mental handicap <e>", "<cs> my lords is this matter not now best left to the judgment of history <e> <s> which will be that the whole of the falklands effort on our part was a remarkable success <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too congratulate my noble friend most warmly in his promotion to the cabinet and ask whether in further consideration of this matter he will bear in mind that the largest single group of disabled people are the mentally handicapped <e> <s> as a result of voluntary effort many of them are already in employment <e> <s> they make good and steady workers within their limitation and many more could be employed <e> <s> will he consider that perhaps the best way of securing that will be not by further legislation but by pursuing the good will of employers <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has given the noble lord lord elton more than the usual amount of trouble both while he has been in the home office and while he was in the department of education may i endorse what the noble and learned lord has said and also congratulate my noble friend <e> <s> while i am on my feet may i say that i know what a vast amount of trouble he has taken over the amendments for this third reading <e> <s> he has not been able to meet every point but i know that he and the home secretary have given deep consideration to all the matters raised at third reading and speaking for myself i feel that honour is satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i too briefly wish to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i do so mainly on two points <e> <s> the first is that all that has to be decided is whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the five points mentioned here are met <e> <s> i do not think that that would be beyond the competence of any person who is worthy to be a justice of the peace <e> <s> my other point is <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i think that he would have wished to point out to us

violence and intimidation and the damage that was done were matters which called for action on the part of the police <e> <s> the noble lord said that he wanted a strong police force i want strong police forces and that is a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the duty of the court to award compensation where appropriate is scarcely dependent at all upon the factors mentioned by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many coal-faces have been damaged some of them perhaps permanently all of them temporarily by flooding by underground fires and by a falling in of underground roadways and that all of these damaged coal-faces will cost a great deal of money to put into order again <e> <s> is this a factor which so far as he is aware is being borne in mind in the further negotiations with regard to this strike <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper

matter <e> <s> will he therefore ensure that publication of the report is given the highest priority and the widest possible circulation when it is published <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question if i may say so the shrewd question raised by the noble lord lord shinwell is my noble friend aware that there have been nuclear tests in various parts of the world and that a great deal of scientific evidence has been accumulated as a result of those tests which would give us some indication of what could be done to help people who were not damaged by a direct hit by a nuclear bomb but were on the wide perimeters of such an attack <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the steps both of the moving stairways and of the static staircases are often steep and that that causes problems not only to those with disabilities as my noble friend lord campbell has said but also to very old people small children and pregnant women <e> <s> will he bear in mind therefore that this is a real problem which should be given the highest possible priority for solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has raised a matter of very considerable principle <e> <s> is it not one of our fundamental rights and freedoms that there should be the right of prosecution as a safeguard against concealment or abuse by authority with the exceptions provided by statute whereby the attorney general or the director of public prosecutions must give his consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that satisfactory reply and ask him whether he will convey our best wishes to the new principal of easingwold for the important work that he has carried out <e>", "<cs> my

a conventional war or even a continental war in which nuclear fall-out may have drifted over this country <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend lord radnor i feel that my noble friend lord belstead is right to resist the temptation to do what has been done in recent statutes namely to go into too much administrative detail <e> <s> i am sure he is right to resist that <e>", "<cs> i

it the sea-fishery that has to be british or the officer or both <e>", "<cs> it would seem on the face of it that part ii of the bill and especially clause refers to the deposit of nuclear waste in the sea <e> <s> but one knows that there is a good deal of other legislation affecting nuclear activities <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend can confirm that in fact and in law the deposit of nuclear waste will be covered by part ii of the bill including clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am not certain whether or not this amendment is needed <e> <s> i should

friend will bear in mind when considering the follow-up as he has undertaken to do <e> <s> regulations will be challenged for their <e>", "<cs> i listened as carefully as i could to what my noble friend said but i was still perplexed at the end of it to know which minister or secretary of state would be responsible for laying the regulations before parliament <e> <s> in your lordships house we do not have to worry very much about which minister we question because all questions are prefaced with the words to ask her majestys government <e> <s> but in another place it is very important that

all necessary may i say that i do believe my noble friend lord belstead is right in that i would have thought cases out of or perhaps even more often than that this is a true enabling power and the minister is given a discretion as to whether to make regulations and when <e> <s> that is the legal position <e> <s> in practice however one does find that when that power is given it is almost invariably used <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i think it is only right to invite your lordships attention to the somewhat vague phraseology of subsection <e> <s> we find <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend there may be circumstances not covered by any international obligation a rare case perhaps in which the government might feel that they were wrong to export <e> <s> it would be an isolated case involving a power <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i really do agree with my noble friend <e> <s> there is only one point i should like to make however arising out of what he has said

anything encouraging the acceptance of this amendment or anything like it <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement that my noble friend made about civil defence expenditure which will mean that local authorities will no longer have a financial excuse for not carrying out their statutory and humanitarian duties with regard to civil defence <e> <s> but to clarify the matter will he confirm that the exemption applies to all civil defence expenditure on both capital and current account <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the motive of the noble baroness in moving this amendment but i am puzzled

whether the consolidated directions and guidance being given to local authorities will contain references to this matter of co-operating with the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might

lord explain <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mancroft has made a revelation to your lordships which saves me from making a confession namely that i had the responsibility of piloting the charities act through its committee and report stages in another place <e> <s> it was one of the most harassing experiences that i have ever had in a long and varied life <e> <s> strangely enough that act was regarded at the time as being controversial not because people thought that it did not go far enough but because its critics said it went too far by giving too much power to the charity commission over trustees even though as has been pointed out in several speeches this evening it contains practically no powers of compulsion over them <e> <s> indeed the charity commission has lacked the resources which would have enabled it to take the fullest opportunity of such power as is given to it by that act <e> <s> at the time that act was considered progressive almost adventurous <e> <s>

repealed starting with i think the act to which the noble lord lord mishcon referred came to or more pages <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that sabotage of any defence installation is one of the most serious offences in our criminal calendar and that the invasion of such installations can cause very serious disruption to their working <e> <s> will he therefore bear in mind that

in a moment <e> <s> the noble lord said that nuclear disarmament is not enough and that we must apply our minds also to the reduction of conventional armed forces <e> <s> i was pleased and if i may

last wednesdays very useful debate initiated by the noble lord lord molloy several of your lordships mentioned that conventional disarmament is just as necessary and important as nuclear disarmament

one wonders why we pass laws <e> <s> what are laws <e> <s> laws should be enforceable and there should be a sanction if they are not obeyed <e> <s> i wonder what would happen if the instructions in this amendment were not carried out <e>", "<cs> i concede at once that of course in the past many so-called laws have been passed which have been merely administrative instructions by parliament to ministers instructions which could perfectly well be made public and be firmly obeyed within the government <e> <s> however sometimes we need to pause and think about the extent to which we legislate on purely administrative matters <e> <s> it is for that reason only that i have a doubt as to whether we are going a little too far in that respect on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord could answer a question arising out of what he has said <e> <s> does he concede that the advice given by the director to the police on criminal matters may include advice as to how to prepare the prosecution in cases of shall we say <e> <s> terrorism espionage drug offences and all kinds of other matters on which it really is essential that there should be confidentiality <e> <s> it seems to me that his amendment would require the advice given in such matters if it be of a general nature to be publicly revealed <e> <s> that in itself would be wrong <e>", "<cs> i would add briefly to the welcome intervention of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale by saying only this <e> <s> i wonder whether it has occurred to the noble lord lord irving of dartford for whom i have such a

"<cs> this amendment is free from objections which were raised in regard to the first of the three amendments which the noble lord lord irving of dartford has moved <e> <s> indeed in principle i have great sympathy with the method he proposes because it is quite clear that if previous service of the kind mentioned in the amendment is to be taken into account it should be stated in the statute <e> <s> subject to the technicalities of the matter on which of course we must rely upon my noble friend to advise us i should be glad to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope i shall not sound churlish if i say that i feel the draftsman has really made quite an unnecessarily large meal of this clause <e> <s> it covers over two and a half pages and goes into great detail when i think that

very slightly amplified it could have covered the whole of the quite long subsection <e> <s> we heard earlier the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale talk about cluttering up the statute book with unnecessary matters and i really do think that a greater effort to be succinct in this clause would have been very acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very full reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is satisfied that mere non-refusal to carry out their statutory obligations by those local authorities who have nonsensically declared their areas to be nuclear-free zones is likely to lead to effective civil defence in the event of conventional attack or nuclear fall-out <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are electronic devices which will reveal the presence of bombs and other electronic devices hidden behind walls <e> <s> if such detective devices had been used it is possible that this bomb concealed as it was might have been located without tearing the hotel to pieces <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether the police are equipped or will be equipped with these electronic devices of a detective character <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord onslow has raised the interesting question of double legislation <e> <s> generally speaking i think that it ought to be avoided for obvious reasons <e> <s> we do not want repetitive legislation in the statute book <e> <s> but there are occasions when it is justified <e> <s> i suggest that the principal occasion when it is justified is in order that legislation on a particular subject may be complete within itself so that we do not have to make a cross-reference to legislation on some entirely different matter <e> <s> having said that and not having done my homework on this particular amendment i am not sure whether one should support it or not <e> <s> however all that i would say is that if the amendment that is proposed would help us to have this particular piece of legislation more complete then this amendment or something like it might be worth accepting <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships to reply to my noble friend who invited me to do so may i respectfully say that i am sure he is right <e> <s> we should be grateful to him for reminding us of the rule of interpretation of the courts <e> <s> this is that if one thing is expressed it may be assumed that other things are excluded <e> <s> the dog latin that we use in the courts is <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend moves on subsection of the clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords there seems to be no need to repeat at any length an argument which we have had to the effect that if we pick out one example of something that we wish to prevent we may be frustrating ourselves by excluding others <e> <s> i am beginning to think that the road to legislative hell which is unnecessary complexity is paved with good intentions <e> <s> so often we have well-intentioned amendments which have or might have exactly the opposite effect to that desired <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me rightly or wrongly and perhaps we shall be told by my noble friend lord belstead whether it is right or wrong that where ministers are given a discretion of the very wide kind contained in for example clause which is to become subsection <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not intend to press this amendment <e> <s> i take note of what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord denning and by my noble friend lord colville of culross <e> <s> but i must make the following comment before i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i think that both of their speeches and i say this with deep respect reveal a woeful lack of confidence in the home secretary and his advisers including the commissioners <e> <s> it is a sad situation if parliament is to go into quasi-administrative details in legislation because that shows such a lack of confidence in those who have the responsibility of keeping an eye on this branch of the law or on any other branch of the law <e> <s> however having said that and saying it i trust without rancour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too hope that my noble friend lord colville will think again about this <e> <s> he acknowledges that parish councillors should have the right to receive the accounts if they wish <e> <s> but he suggests that this admirable objective should be achieved by taking so to speak two bites at the cherry <e> <s> the first bite is to leave them to ask the district council for a copy and if that does not work in general then the secretary of state will be asked to make regulations which will then have to be laid before parliament <e> <s> i suggest that that is a much more cumbersome way of establishing the right than for us to accept this simple amendment <e>", "<cs> had i known that my noble friend lady trumpington was about to intervene i should not have made my second intervention <e> <s> having heard my noble friend may i say again that i am surprised because it is acknowledged that if they want them these parish councillors should have copies <e> <s> that is acknowledged by my noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> but that is not unnecessary duplication <e> <s> indeed this amendment suggests that trouble would be avoided by simply requiring the charity trustees to do as they are obliged to do at present and to send a copy of the accounts to the parish council <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be very much to ask <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his constructive suggestion <e> <s> i too should like to consider with care what has been said in this debate <e> <s> perhaps we can have a discussion about it between now and report stage <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with great respect what we need to have put now is that the amendment is proposed <e> <s> it is not a question of putting the question just yet <e> <s> i have moved the amendment it is now for the deputy chairman to say amendment proposed <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend and in view of what he says i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend lord colville will not submit to the learned blandishments of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> we must be well disciplined if i may say so with deep respect in everything that we do when legislating <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that he has made a wise and constructive suggestion which i greatly welcome <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel bound to point out that this question of exempt charities and the matters with which clause deals is even more complicated than one might have judged from listening to my noble friend lord colville of culross <e> <s> the definition of an exempt charity is in subsection of section of the act <e> <s> that says that an <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what my noble friend means and i appreciate what he is saying but i really think that his purpose might be better achieved by having an amendment to clause which would then enable the application of exempt charities to the various provisions of this bill in its various clauses to be clearly stated in one place rather than picking out their application to individual clauses one by one as it seems he is intending to do <e>", "<cs> if i may add one postscript to that as i understand it traditionally the powers of the court with regard to objects which have failed for example relate to their having failed and they have failed because it is impossible to achieve them not because it is impractical to achieve them <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that subsection was an attempt to express the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord colville has already kindly said that he will reconsider the way in which he is asking your lordships committee to deal with these exempt charities <e> <s> seeing this new subsection i must confess that i am rather confirmed in the view that i put forward previously that instead of having them dealt with in these piecemeal ways an elegant amendment to clause would be a far better way of dealing with them <e>", "<cs> in supporting my noble friend lord maude of stratford-upon-avon i merely wish to say that i am astounded at our moderation <e>", "<cs> i am sure that your lordships committee is grateful to my noble friend lady trumpington for what she has just said <e> <s> it seems to me that what she has put before your lordships committee is the kind of wisdom which we have learned to accept from home office ministers through the ages <e> <s> but i should just like to make the comment that those who are opposed to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord maude of stratford-upon-avon have produced arguments which are really arguments against having clause at all <e> <s> if we are to have clause i suggest that it should be realistic <e> <s> to have the figure of as the gross income included in it is quite absurd <e> <s> the sum of for one hours work is now the rate for many semi-skilled workers and we are referring here to an annual income <e> <s> it is quite ludicrous <e> <s> i appreciate what my noble friend has said about going too high and what was said by the noble and learned lords on the cross benches about the administrative burden that might be placed on the charity commission if we went too high <e> <s> but using what my noble friend lady trumpington has called our judgment i should have thought that our best judgment is to accept the two amendments moved by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are far more genuine reasons in favour of a policy of dispersal and evacuation than those implied in the question of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the answer which my noble friend has just given is she aware that the european countries provide something like per cent <e> <s> of european conventional defence but that even so they are heavily outnumbered by the russian forces <e> <s> therefore will my noble friend confirm that the original answer that she gave applies as much to conventional disarmament as to nuclear disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest and sympathy to what was said by noble lords in support of these amendments but having heard my noble friend i feel bound to agree with what he said <e> <s> i feel that the supporters of amendment no <e> <s> in particular may well have overlooked the great advantage that they have in clause <e> <s> i wish that there were more subsections like that <e> <s> it is what we call in effect a statement of purpose <e> <s> it governs the whole of the provisions in part iii of the bill dealing with pesticides <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much doubt whether the noble lords interpretation of the governments views is correct but we shall no doubt hear from my <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the subject of expenditure i had hoped that i would make it clear and i hope to be forgiven for not doing so that expenditure on civil defence is exempt from rate capping and exempt from cash penalties <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that there are now volunteers <e> <s> that is in addition to those who are more fully involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not been here <e>", "<cs> my lords as the mover of this debate a long time ago may i say rather boldly perhaps that i think that it has achieved its purposes <e> <s> the first purpose was to enable as many noble lords and noble baronesses as possible in all parts of the house to give us the benefit of their experience their judgment and their expertise and i am so grateful to all of them who have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords with deep respect that is an entirely separate issue <e> <s> i must leave that as it is <e> <s> i shall not take up further time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would be able to help us to reach a judgment on the merits of the prosecution if he could tell us whether mr ponting had the courage to tell any minister or his civil service superior what he intended to do with those documents or did he merely let suspicion fall on other civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very narrow point and i shall therefore not detain your lordships for long <e> <s> may i say that i entirely agree with what the noble lord lord hooson has said about reactions in another place <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord colville that we should keep the figure low but goodness me the figures proposed in these two amendments are as low as i would have thought judgment and conscience would allow <e> <s> i feel that a gross annual income of for a charity is so small as to be absurd <e> <s> it is the sort of sum for which now no solicitor would write the simplest letter <e> <s> it is the sum for which most skilled workers would be just about willing to agree for one hours work <e> <s> for us to say that if we agree with the principle of this clause we will have it operative at a level of endowment of a year only which does not apply to an endowment in land and a gross income of a year does not seem to be within the realms of reality <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of my disagreement with my noble friend i should like to thank him for the letter which he sent to the noble and learned lord lord simon and for his generally open-minded approach to this matter <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble and learned lord lord denning for raising a question of principle which i did not raise when moving the amendment <e> <s> my old friend lord boyd-carpenter he used that term so rightly i will not say how old is a former chief secretary to the treasury and therefore it was not surprising to hear him singing an old treasury song <e> <s> i was disappointed that my noble friend lord elton was so eager to join in the chorus of it <e> <s> i think that their speeches entirely ignore the tremendous power that another place has over ministers who are answerable to it as are some ministers before your lordships and who have control over regulations and public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on this occasion strongly support my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> the suggestion that we should accept an amendment which everyone agrees could be improved upon because it is not yet quite right seems to be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord withdraws the amendment i wonder whether i might say that i would not like it to be thought that the support for the view that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has expressed has no sympathy on this side of the house <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for all my noble friends when i say that we greatly welcome the decision that my noble and learned friend on the woolsack has taken <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord attempts to answer that question i have another query <e> <s> i very nearly moved an amendment to this amendment namely to leave out the words <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord graham whose motives i greatly respect in this as in other matters i really do not see how the government could accept these amendments <e> <s> granted that local authorities will no longer be carrying out prosecutions on behalf of the police but it nevertheless seems to me that there will be a number of occasions when a local authority cannot carry out all the many statutory duties laid upon it by parliament or cannot protect its own interests or its ratepayers interests if these amendments are accepted <e> <s> so much for the substance of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords this new clause taken by itself appears to be acceptable <e> <s> but when we compare it with clause which it follows we find ourselves in the strange position of double definition of the same phrase <e> <s> the two definitions are not identical and they are both negative definitions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not omitted those words from my mind <e> <s> i can assure the noble and learned lord <e> <s> but i find it very strange that we have a definition of preliminary stage in clause and then another definition in clause <e> <s> they overlap with each other and seem to have only very slightly different purposes <e> <s> i should have thought there was a strong case for looking at both of these clauses again and for trying to dovetail and collate the two <e> <s> it would be better drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i could hardly believe my ears when i heard the noble lord lord mishcon refer to the faithfull lord renton <e> <s> i may have misheard him but although i have always regarded myself in that light this is the first time that it has ever been put on record in either house and i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that correction <e> <s> i think that one should pay tribute not only to my noble friend lord maude of stratford-upon-avon but also to my noble friend lady faithfull because without their joint efforts i do not think we should be having this third reading tonight <e> <s> i pay tribute as i did earlier to the noble and learned lord lord brightman and in lincolns inn we are indeed proud of his achievement on this occasion <e> <s> i also pay tribute to my noble friend lord colville of culross <e>", "<cs> my lords will the passports still be issued by her majestys secretary of state for foreign affairs and bear the royal coat of arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i have no welsh blood in me so far as i know and i am not a member of the welsh circuit <e> <s> but as a member of the english bar i used frequently in the s to

days <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord lord mishcon has just said and although i did not entirely agree with it i concede it was a very persuasive speech and we should consider whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not previously spoken <e> <s> am i too late to come in then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness has underlined the fact that the bill preserves the right of private prosecution <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale who at this moment is attending a very important family christening elsewhere has asked me to draw attention

the son of a scotsman and i have a foot across the border in that we have a family property in scotland <e> <s> i am interested in this amendment but a little puzzled by it because it would seem to assume that even when a museum of scotland has been established the royal museum of scotland and the national museum of antiquities of scotland will both continue to exist although each will have been shorn of some of its contents <e> <s> possibly i suppose the best of their contents could have been creamed away <e> <s> i should have thought that if there is to be a museum of special importance in scotland the name of that museum would be significant and naturally the name of the royal scottish museum already in existence seems to me to represent what the noble earl lord perth has in mind and would indeed seem to be most-appropriate for a museum specially related to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he say what will happen to the royal scottish museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not dispute that in substance these amendments should be made <e> <s> however the current drafting practice and the better drafting practice is that amendments of this kind should be contained in a schedule to the bill rather than in a clause <e> <s> we do not want clauses in bills cluttered up with too much detail especially when they concern relatively minor amendments of previous legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble and learned lord lord denning on this amendment <e> <s> i cannot think why the words that he proposes to leave out were ever included in the bill <e> <s> they give rise to certain questions <e> <s> incidentally i am not sure whether the proceedings referred to and which shall not be brought are proceedings against only the solicitor himself or are against any other person in respect of whom the solicitor may have been acting and against whom the solicitor on behalf of the client complaining has failed to obtain a remedy <e> <s> that is one doubt which arises in my mind on these words <e>", "<cs> my lords have not even the peacetime disasters shown that the most terrible damage can be done on a wide scale by chemical attacks explosions and so on <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether the nato defence committee of which we are members is taking any steps in this matter by way of research and advice and protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> may i ask him

putney is but a diversion of a somewhat mischievous kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that answer <e> <s> will my noble friend say whether dealing with peacetime emergencies will be given prominence in this circular and will it give guidance on the level of emergency planning staffs required and on recommended salary scales <e>", "<cs> my lords for how long must we go on pointing out that these questions about civil defence are not confined to preparation for nuclear attack but are designed to cover all hazards <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure us that the film will embrace the all-hazards approach including the possible use of chemical weapons and the need to provide protection against them <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the national health service is now costing billion a year gross not very much of which comes back in charges on patients and so on and that that gross sum amounts to about a year for every man woman and child in this country <e> <s> is it not therefore a question of deciding how best these very large sums can be spent <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give any indication to your lordships of the kind of response that he received when he drew attention to failures to implement the helsinki final act

ever-increasing numbers of didicois people who merely go on to the roads with caravans and live and move from place to place sometimes to escape trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware

policy is co-ordinated with the governments crisis relocation plans <e>", "<cs> my lords as the soviet union may not follow our fine example on disarmament with regard to chemical weapons is there not a great risk of their possibly being used a greater risk than the use of nuclear weapons and should not we in the nato countries therefore prepare to protect our people against possible chemical attack <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies to that point i wonder whether i might be allowed to make a point which arises which is that regulations are normally made by ministers and if necessary presented to and defended in parliament by ministers and although it is not without precedent for an order in council to say that a department shall have power we really mean the secretary of state in this case <e> <s> i would suggest that on future occasions we should be quite clear about this and engage the secretary of states responsibility or that of whichever minister

motive whatever to frustrate him <e> <s> so long as he feels that the amendments which are being accepted meet the main purpose that he had in mind which is similar to my purpose i hope that he may be content <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first endorse what the noble lord lord henderson of brompton said <e> <s> a national council for the disabled about which we all know he is so

do apologise but perhaps he does not realise that the london boroughs association was given specific duties under section of the greater london council general powers act that until two years ago it

expenditure is approved and subsection <e> <s> that subsection says <e>", "<cs> i have been very surprised if i may say so by the speech of the noble lord lord ennals and also that of the noble

mentioned me <e> <s> if she is kind enough to give way may i say that she has misunderstood me or that i have not made myself plain <e> <s> certainly each metropolitan borough each scheme-making body

arrangement is more appropriate than a compulsory one <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first heard the noble lord lord irving of dartford put forward his case it seemed to me that consititutionally he had

clarification <e> <s> i hope that i am not taking up time unnecessarily <e> <s> what does the noble lord really mean by support staff <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that i do not go along with the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey in the arguments that he has put forward in support of the amendments so far as i am capable of understanding them <e> <s> i think that i understand his main motive which seems to be to get onto the governing bodies somebody representing the non-teaching staff in other words various non-teaching staff the ladies who provide the meals the man who looks after the boiler or perhaps the person who cleans the windows and so on <e> <s> however i do not think that it is as important to have those people represented on the governing body as it is to maintain the representation which the government have in mind which is expressed in the bill and which i support <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord so kindly warned me of the danger of politics rearing its ugly head i point out to him that he is surely inviting that danger by asking for members of the support staff to come along who may very well be active trade unionists and possibly members for example of nupe <e> <s> as he is worried about the possibility of politics entering into the life of schools i invite his attention to the amendments which have been tabled by some noble lords including myself to clause <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lords who have spoken i and i think many people would feel that this amendment is contrary to the interests of the pupils who have to serve as governors and to the interests of the schools <e> <s> let us take the position of the pupils <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ritchie has just indicated they would probably be fairly senior pupils coming up for very important examinations <e> <s> surely it is best that they concentrate upon their studies in this highly competitive world of academic qualifications <e> <s> if they become governors far from concentrating enough on their studies they will be submerged in the paperwork with which school governors will probably inevitably be confronted <e> <s> that is unavoidable these days <e> <s> i think that it would be against the pupils interest <e>", "<cs> for reasons which the noble lord has been kind enough to mention i naturally took great care to study his amendment and to compare it with the words in the bill which he proposes should be left out <e> <s> may i deal with the bill as it stands for the moment <e> <s> i should not like those words to be left out <e> <s> if i needed to give a reason it is to be found in the notes on clauses where in relation to clause they state that the subsection provides <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> however i am a little worried about the large number of by-elections to which it will give rise <e> <s> i think that it is going rather far to put it in the terms of the amendment <e> <s> at the same time i must confess that i am not happy about the governments provision in subsection of clause that the <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will forgive me if i say that i do not understand her argument and cannot follow it in relation to the bill <e> <s> she says that this matter which is governed at the moment by subsection is to be governed in future by the regulations to be made and they will be made <e>", "<cs> yes but that deals with another matter <e> <s> it does not deal with the tenure of office which is what i thought we were discussing on the amendment <e> <s> i think my noble friend will have to ask those advising her to look again at the matter in the light of this discussion <e> <s> it is a very confused situation in my opinion <e> <s> i should certainly wish to read what my noble friend has said before being at all satisfied because i must confess that i am perplexed <e>", "<cs> i have given notice of my intention to oppose the question but let me enable your lordships to relax by saying that i do not propose to divide the committee <e> <s> i use this legitimate device as a peg on which to hang a plea to the government <e> <s> i am partly <e>", "<cs> i am deeply distressed as i seem to have lost an ally <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord started off by commending the suggestion that we did not want the primary legislation to contain too much detail in the clauses but that it should go into the schedules <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to trouble the committee further at this late hour but a very serious point arises out of the prospect of leaving it to the local authorities <e> <s> may i explain the experience of my former constituency of huntingdonshire where there were several thousand men serving in the raf on two large stations <e> <s> some of their children were educated locally therefore no problem but most of the airmen were on temporary posting to these places and their children were in different local authorities all over the country <e> <s> therefore if we leave it to the local authorities some airmen may find that they have a postal vote and others would find that they have not <e> <s> that would not seem to be appropriate <e>", "<cs> i had given notice of my intention to oppose the question that the clause shall stand part of the bill but when i spoke to clause i said that i would not make another speech <e> <s> i was so disappointed by the reply that i received on clause that i do not wish my disappointment to be doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to the noble lord lord stallard for initiating this valuable debate and if i may say so for the temperate and constructive way in which he has done so <e> <s> also we can be thankful that we have from three noble baronesses heard most interesting and knowledgeable speeches and very moving ones as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spoken longer than i expected but i conclude by saying this <e> <s> recreation has been mentioned <e> <s> one must always give credit where it is due <e> <s> i have criticised the almost defunct greater london council for wasting peoples money on some of its films <e> <s> but quite recently it produced one interesting and valuable film called a sporting chance which had nothing to do with betting on horse races <e> <s> the film showed what can be done for people with multiple handicaps by way of gymnastics physical training even badminton wheelchair polo riding for the disabled and so on <e> <s> to the extent that the manpower services commission has been helpful in developing riding for the mentally handicapped for example and in various other ways it is only fair while we are adopting a somewhat critical attitude towards the government that we should acknowledge the fine work which the msc is doing <e>", "<cs> i am in broad agreement with my noble friend lord beloff and the noble lord lord henderson of brompton when they suggest to the committee that there is a part for the secretary of state for education and science to play in making the arrangements for what is to be taught in schools in future at any rate in broad principles <e> <s> i rise really in order to issue with deep respect to my noble friend lord beloff a caution about one thing that he said <e> <s> if i noted it correctly he said that if everything were put into the curriculum or curricula which ought to be there there would be little time left for indoctrination <e> <s> i am surprised that my noble friend should be so optimistic <e> <s> what he has suggested would be the triumph of hope over left-wing ingenuity <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we have all listened with interest and gratitude to my noble friend and we are grateful for the explanation which she has given of the rather complicated machinery in clause <e> <s> i think however that we come to a point when we have to find out if we can who is going to have the last word after all these consultations have taken place <e> <s> i come therefore to the point made earlier by my noble friend lord mottistone who referred to clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a helpful suggestion to my noble friend <e> <s> this is a difficult matter and it is not just a lawyers point or a question of drafting <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh does not claim perfection even for his amendment <e> <s> i should have thought that after the valuable discussion we have had in which there has been a degree of agreement across the floor of the committee as well as some points about which we all disagree it would be much better instead of trying to reach a decision tonight on this complex matter for my noble friend the minister to say that she will take this point away think about it carefully and consult the secretary of state in the light of our debate <e> <s> i am sure that in the long run that would be of much greater benefit to all concerned <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would allow me to say this <e> <s> i am sure that he is trying to help the committee but this is creating some confusion <e> <s> at the moment only amendments nos <e> <s> and have been discussed and there are quite separate issues to be raised on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i hope that he will not feel that by trying to deal with all four of them now he is closing the governments mind <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend be so kind as to help us by reading what he has to say at about half the speed at which he is going <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend also bear in mind that the debate to which he has replied has dealt with primary schools and there has been a feeling expressed in all quarters of the committee that primary schools are a somewhat different issue from other schools from secondary schools <e> <s> although we bear in mind the constructive views put forward for example just now by my noble friend lord home of the hirsel we feel that these are separate issues <e> <s> the primary school is the one to consider first then perhaps after dinner we can consider the others <e>", "<cs> in case any members of the committee should think that there is no evidence of any attempt to undermine democracy or the rule of law in any of our schools perhaps i may point out that there has already been sent to the secretary of state a copy of well-authenticated plans by militant tendency which were not intended to be published but which have appeared in both <e>", "<cs> it is rarely in ones long parliamentary life that someone who does not belong to ones own party comes so totally to ones rescue <e> <s> however even if the noble lord lord harris had not done so and i am deeply grateful to him i would have had to point out to the noble lord lord mcintosh that i am not talking of a document issued four years ago and then claimed to be a hoax <e> <s> i am talking of a document which has been clandestinely circulated this year <e> <s> thanks to the vigilance of certain journalists as recently as nd april a full report appeared in the <e>", "<cs> yes it could be indeed although there have been others since then <e> <s> what i suggest to your lordships is this <e> <s> the case made by my noble friend on the threat to democracy and the rule of law in our schools is one which has to be taken seriously <e> <s> of course if my noble friend says that we have no evidence of this i have a two-fold answer <e> <s> the first is that all this information has been sent to him already <e> <s> the second answer is that even if he had not heard a word of it and even if the department of education had remained deaf and blind as it sometimes appears to me to be we should still alert the department because it is better to shut the stable door before the horse has bolted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just follow the noble lord for a moment <e> <s> he has just touched on what some people regard as a dilemma but perhaps he will think back to the greatest law giver of all time to moses and to the ten commandments <e> <s> will he remember that the ten commandments could not have been drafted without five of them at least being expressed in negative form <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord is saying can he answer two questions <e> <s> is he going to say that the document which has been quoted and has been published is out of character with militant tendency or within their character <e> <s> secondly can he say whether following publication in the <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lady cox replies to that let me say that parliament is always asking the courts to decide difficult and controversial questions <e> <s> there is nothing new about that <e> <s> the whole of our trades disputes legislation from to has involved the courts in deciding questions they would rather not decide difficult questions controversial questions party political controversial questions <e> <s> but the courts are there to fulfil the will of parliament <e> <s> what are the courts for <e> <s> if parliament considers that there is a mischief to be suppressed or a positive aim to be achieved it is for the courts to do what parliament requires <e> <s> i must say to my noble friend with all the friendliness and candour that i can command if he thinks i can still command any that that is not an argument which should be put forward on this occasion nor indeed on many others <e>", "<cs> the amendment does not propose the banning of political discussion in schools <e>", "<cs> i think it rather confuses the issue <e> <s> we have some well thought out separate amendments the noble lord has proposed a positive method and i have proposed a negative method of dealing with the more limited aspects of the matter <e> <s> if i may say so i think we would achieve greater clarity of thought and it would lead to better results in the end if we kept the discussions slightly separate <e>", "<cs> let there be no confusion <e> <s> i hope i am not drawing unjustifiably on my experience from time to time in the chair when i say that the so-called grouping of amendments is done by one of our splendid officers of the house using his own initiative but with necessarily a limited political knowledge of what lies behind the amendments but we are not bound by that so-called grouping <e>", "<cs> the effective word is promotion <e>", "<cs> i propose to withdraw my amendment but quite frankly not for the reasons given by my noble friend lord swinton <e> <s> he has again spoken of imprecise terms and perhaps it is my fault that my amendment was not better understood <e> <s> to me it is perfectly plain <e> <s> we are not talking merely about the teaching of partisan political views we are talking about the promotion of partisan political views <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has tried to persuade the committee that it is all right for the parents simply to wait until the governors annual report or the parents annual meeting or for the reports by the governing body and the head teachers all of which are well <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the remarkable success of the governments policy in reducing the rate of inflation augur well for the outcome of these matters which have been mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say i hope that the government will be sensible and accept the substance of what the noble lord lord irving of dartford has said <e>", "<cs> i rise only to say that in spite of the efforts of my noble friend i am unable to accept this argument <e> <s> i shall in due course move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that undertaking i happily ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that whether international precautions are successful or not and whatever the world health organisation may do or fail to do the nuclear disaster that is no exaggeration in russia points to the need for local authorities in this country greatly to improve their peacetime arrangements for the protection of their people against fall-out <e>", "<cs> my lords this new clause is introduced as a result of an undertaking given by the government at report stage and after a discussion and not the first discussion in this house on this subject <e> <s> i should have thought therefore that it was perfectly well within the rules of order for the tabling of amendments at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the motives of the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee but i have some doubt about it because it seems to me that it gives to the local education authority and the governing body or to each of them a veto as to whether or not the provisions of subsection of clause which are good provisions shall be carried out and i am very doubtful whether each of those two bodies or either or both of them should have such a veto <e>", "<cs> my lords i take a slightly different view of this and i am so sorry to have to record any kind of disagreement with my noble friend lord beloff with whose views i nearly always agree although perhaps he does not always agree with mine <e> <s> although i do not accept all of the arguments of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey i think that from the purely drafting point of view he has made a point which we should even at this late stage consider <e> <s> the word modified can be read as amended or changed <e> <s> if it is the governments view that the governing body shall be allowed to change or amend the policy of the local education authority so be it but i did not think that that was the governments view <e> <s> if the policy of the education authority could be changed by the governors of every school we should get immense variation between one school and another within that authoritys responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may have your lordships leave to make one brief comment <e> <s> i am impressed by the argument which my noble friend has put forward but i am nevertheless left with the feeling that modifications could be very wide <e> <s> i am wondering therefore whether it might not be a good thing to say perhaps by amendment in another place modified in necessary detail or some such wording while retaining the general principles of the local education authoritys guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lady young and her colleagues for moving this amendment <e> <s> it is undoubtedly an improvement to the bill <e> <s> it would be churlish of me to say that i should have preferred our original simple method but the government want flexibility and are doing this by regulation <e> <s> therefore if it is to be done by regulation this is a better way to do it <e> <s> one must follow the drafting very carefully indeed to ensure that the whole of the clause is now governed by the word shall in the first line but we accept that it is so and are therefore grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank those noble lords who have spoken in this short debate <e> <s> i am sure all those who have heard it will agree with me that although it was short it was important and very encouraging <e> <s> i find it encouraging for two main reasons <e> <s> first because of the firm agreement on both sides of your lordships house and among different parties on the need for improving the protection of our people in peacetime <e> <s> secondly because of the acknowledgement that much still needs to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that full and helpful reply <e> <s> may i ask him in relation to the kind of mischief referred to in the question whether the public order bill would not give us the soonest and best opportunity of introducing provisions relating to criminal trespass on land as well as dealing with other matters of public order which have arisen out of the extraordinary behaviour of this convoy <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering further legislation will my noble friend bear in mind that many more premises or parts of premises would be let if it were not so difficult to get rid of tenants who turn out to be unsatisfactory or are unable to live happily with other occupants in the same building <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in this country in the past year or so wage increases have considerably exceeded the rate of inflation <e> <s> do not the trade unions have a constructive part to play in helping to restrain wage increases and therefore limit our costs of production <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment moved by my noble friend but for slightly different reasons <e> <s> the word particularly in an act of parliament is unusual <e> <s> what does it mean here <e> <s> either it merely means very in which case it is unnecessary and indeed absurd or it is a subterfuge intended to enable the government to designate as few areas as possible so that if they were challenged in the courts they could say oh but this is something that does not have to be done because we do not think it is particularly desirable <e> <s> surely it is either desirable or not desirable <e> <s> had we not better leave it like that and support my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> it would seem from what my noble friend has said that the words particularly desirable do not truly reflect what the government have in mind which seems to be financially acceptable <e>", "<cs> as i think we are supposed to be referring to amendment no <e> <s> as well i wonder whether my noble friend lord belstead would be so good to explain what he understands the word sensitive to mean <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e>", "<cs> i think the governments intentions are probably good but we have to make sure that the words they are using will fulfil those intentions <e> <s> i would therefore ask my noble friend lord belstead if he would explain what he means by sensitive in this context <e> <s> it could i suppose mean vulnerable <e> <s> does it mean sensitive to particular farming or forestry practices which might impair the natural beauty of the environment or impair the wildlife <e> <s> does it mean simply that it is suitable to be designated <e> <s> also we have to consider the other side of the coin <e> <s> if an area is not designated does it mean that it is not sensitive <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord belstead on an earlier amendment revealed the financial reality of this matter <e> <s> he mentioned that there would be million available for five or six areas <e> <s> surely the reality of the matter is that estimates will be laid in the usual way and the minister of agriculture will have to keep within those estimates <e> <s> therefore the treasury will have given their consent a <e>", "<cs> my noble friend may be interested to know that there are about examples in the statute book of this particular nonsense <e>", "<cs> will not my noble friend face up to this <e> <s> in the light of what he says the treasury will always consent because if it does not consent it will be exercising a veto <e> <s> if the treasury is always going to consent what is the point of writing into the bill that it requires the consent of the treasury <e>", "<cs> that would be a veto <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend lord belstead can say whether the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission for scotland are to be called in to manage <e> <s> i feel that if they are the amendment of my noble friend lord buxton should be accepted <e> <s> this should be made clear in the bill <e> <s> if they are not to be called in who is going to manage the areas <e> <s> is the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who sometimes has to drive a very severely disabled person in my car and bearing in mind that that person can walk only a few yards from the destination at which the car arrives to the place where that person has to go for example a doctors surgery will he bear in mind the need to issue at least temporary permits for driving severely disabled people as passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords how can there be a middle course between what appears to be the difference between right and wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his very kind comments and for <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i think that it is very necessary and as the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has pointed out it cannot apply to large numbers of people <e> <s> i am a little concerned as to the application of it <e> <s> i want to make sure and perhaps the noble lord lord henderson of brompton can help me that it would apply to people who are living in a very small established home of say half a dozen severely disabled people some of them or all of them perhaps mentally handicapped <e> <s> as parents die the ordinary family home breaks up but the severely disabled people remain in that condition for the rest of their lives and will therefore have to live somewhere perhaps different from their original homes <e> <s> or their home maybe used as we in the royal society for the mentally handicapped are hoping to use them with suitable financial provision made to enable others to come in <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord care to add to his important list the greater london association for the disabled <e>", "<cs> may i ask one more question arising from what my noble friend said on my query <e> <s> she said that a small group home or a person in a small group home would not be eligible if the home was receiving help from a local authority <e> <s> if it were a small group home run under the aegis of a charity but without help from the local authority would the provisions my noble friend has in mind enable anyone in that small group home to be eligible or would they still be ruled out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should acknowl-edge that my noble friend lord belstead has done something which must have resulted from a tremendous struggle behind the scenes a struggle which the treasury is known always to win and never deserves to win least of all on this occasion <e> <s> but he has done his best though he has been candid enough to acknowledge as he was kind enough to say in a letter which he sent to those of us who were concerned that the substance of the matter is not really changed at all by his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down is he saying that he is accepting the logic of the amendment of the noble baroness but also saying that he cannot accept the amendment merely because there is no precedent for it <e>", "<cs> my lords we all respect the zeal of my noble friend lord craigton for conservation <e> <s> it is a zeal which i share <e> <s> i am a former president of the conservation society <e> <s> but i am very much afraid of his amendment <e> <s> what i fear is that by inserting the word farming it will limit the effect of the clause so that it is only farming areas which could be designated in the way that the provision intends <e> <s> areas for example which are given over to forestry or are merely open spaces with neither forestry nor farming on them <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not appear to me to be so on the wording <e> <s> i may be wrong <e> <s> at this late hour one can get things wrong <e> <s> i am afraid that to insert the one word farming would limit the operation of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that years ago this country under a conservative government set a splendid example to the rest of the world with our original clear air act <e> <s> will he ensure that the advantages obtained for this country and the experience gained as a result of the administration of that act are given world-wide publicity so that other nations may benefit from our example <e> <s> will he also say to what extent it is considered that deforestation especially of the rain forests of central africa and south america has a bearing on this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is it accepted by ministers that special constables have an important part to play in helping the police on certain special occasions <e> <s> can my noble friend say to what extent the number of special constables will be increased within the metropolitan district <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are several hundred different languages which are spoken in the indian subcontinent and that this problem is dealt with to a very considerable extent by our very careful procedures to enable people to obtain entry permits in their own country before they ever leave it <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that the immigration officers unfortunately have to contend with a number of people who try to evade our procedures but they nevertheless show great patience in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord gifford i too believe that this bill is important because it will strengthen democratic freedom <e> <s> but i hold that view for reasons which may differ from those of the noble lord <e> <s> i take the view that you cannot have freedom without order <e> <s> there is too much disorder in our society and it is our duty to strengthen the law in the hope that we have more order and less disorder <e> <s> it is in the light of that that i think we have to consider this first clause and the noble lords amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i turn therefore to subsection of clause <e> <s> we find that it is in exactly the same terms as subsection of clause and my comments would hold in the same way <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friends on the front bench can reasonably accept this group of amendments <e>", "<cs> the view put forward by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones having previously been put forward by the law commission naturally commands respect <e> <s> but we have had very serious riots in this country from time to time <e> <s> if a riot causes death great destruction of property injury and disturbance of the lives of many people we should think in terms of a very stiff penalty for it <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord care to confirm that the law commissions statistics on sentences awarded were all of them statistics for riot under the common law <e> <s> may not the position have changed somewhat when the bill comes into force because instead of merely three people being enough to constitute riot under the common law under the bill no fewer than people will have to be proved to have taken part which surely alters the situation somewhat <e>", "<cs> your lordships will no doubt accept the advice given by my noble friend lord glenarthur <e> <s> perhaps i may say that in the light of his comments i too accept his advice but i express the hope that there will not be serious riots in which death and injury take place and the offenders cannot be found <e> <s> in the riots the deaths and injuries that occur will no doubt have been caused by those who started the riots <e>", "<cs> i hope that it will not distress noble lords opposite if i say that i am in some measure of agreement with them <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that although the intent behind clause is sound and good it is going to cause trouble especially in the magistrates courts <e> <s> those conducting the prosecution on behalf of the police will find themselves in a position that is not entirely unusual of having to prove either the intention of the alleged offender or the likely effect upon the mind of the intended victim <e> <s> it is not entirely unusual for either of those things to have to be proved in court under various provisions of existing law <e> <s> but when one tries to unravel the formula contained in lines to of clause one can see that lay people especially and indeed sometimes lawyers will have a good deal about which to argue <e>", "<cs> may i ask which column <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble and learned lord lord denning has said but as a postscript to that perhaps i may make a suggestion <e> <s> it is quite clear from the speeches of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington that what they are worried about is the proof of intent in relation to these words <e> <s> if i may invite the committees attention to for example line on page if the word intended had been inserted before the word conduct the matter would have been much more clear and that would have expressed better what the government if i may use the word in another context intended <e> <s> the same applies in line <e> <s> again if the word intended had been inserted before the word conduct some of the fears expressed by noble lords opposite would not perhaps have arisen <e> <s> it is interesting to read on and find in relation to subsections and that the awareness is covered by the use of the word intends <e> <s> we see that word used at the beginning of line and that clearly is carried forward to the last line of subsection which the noble lord seeks to leave out <e> <s> we see the word intends at the beginning of line and we find it again in line <e> <s> in both those cases it is appropriately used and explains the awareness <e> <s> with the suggestion that we need the word intended in subsections and i too hope that the government will leave the clause as it is <e>", "<cs> in deference to the noble lord lord plant i should have thought that his two amendments raise a somewhat separate point from that of awareness <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that my noble friend lord glenarthur will consider this amendment sympathetically <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite absurd that the provisions which i think arise principally on clause in relation to a dwelling should be restricted to the actual activity inside the structure and that for someone standing just outside his front doorstep or in his front or back garden an entirely different situation should arise <e>", "<cs> i am awfully sorry that i do not have the reference but there is a statutory provision somewhere in our landlord and tenant law if i remember rightly which indicates that a dwelling includes more than the mere structure <e> <s> if we could import that definition we may well succeed in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house which of the various international bodies of which we are a member has taken upon itself if any has done so the responsibility for implementing this world conservation strategy <e> <s> can he say whether the countries which contain the tropical rain forests are members of that international body <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put a point to the noble lord lord ennals before he sits down <e> <s> he says he wishes we could have more <e> <s> however under the governments amendment as suggested and accepted by another place many more people will benefit and more and more money will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the noble lord lord henderson of brompton at the committee stage on his amendment and i am glad that i did so <e> <s> now we are faced with the question of what is going to be best for the disabled people concerned <e> <s> we are told that they number at least <e> <s> it is suggested that there should be flexibility but surely certainty is something that we should be thinking of on behalf of the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that justice

the draftsman as to how to improve his drafts <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend replies i wonder whether he would be so good as to help by clarifying a matter on this rewritten section of

amended if that legislation were passed <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate has drawn attention to a number of risks biological social and legal which he fears as a result of what he calls

leave it out <e> <s> speaking for myself it is with the greatest reluctance that i accept this nonsense but i expect it will go on until long after i am dead <e>", "<cs> while i was grateful for the retrospective support of the noble lord lord grimond on a previous amendment i am happy to assure him that on this occasion i am in full agreement with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> as well as adding to the congestion of parliamentary business this amendment or one on these lines if accepted would cause what to local authorities in scotland would be unwelcome delay in finality being reached as to the liabilities in this matter <e> <s> therefore i very much hope and expect that my noble friend the minister will advise the committee not to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the welcome liberalisation of fares on regular airlines have some effect on the fares of chartered flights which carry thousands of people to and from this country on package tours for holidays <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a substantial point on which my noble friend can perhaps enlighten your lordships <e> <s> is there any machinery to enable us to tell what has happened in another place so that as soon as the prime minister has started to make her statement we should be free to permit if i am not using the wrong word my noble friend the leader of the house to repeat the statement in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow the point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> there are vocational courses which are part of a professional training <e> <s> a person may already have a degree <e> <s> it may be the degree so-called of barrister-at-law but before he can earn his living certainly in england and i think in scotland too he has to be a pupil for at least six months <e> <s> that is the sort of problem which arises <e> <s> my noble friend has had an excessively difficult time <e> <s> the difficulty has been partly caused by the grouping of the amendments if i may say so <e> <s> it has given us far too wide a discussion covering far too many disparate details <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord morton of shuna has turned up the precedents for the use of that word <e> <s> i must confess that i have not done so on this occasion <e> <s> however i think it will be found if i may say so with deep respect that for once he has made rather heavy weather of this point <e> <s> the expression certainly occurs elsewhere <e> <s> i seem to recollect that in fiscal law it is important because if a person goes abroad the question arises as to whether he resides in this country to a greater or less extent <e> <s> in matters of election law the same point arises <e> <s> of course when members of the committee sign their allowances if they ever do they are asked to state their principal residence <e> <s> there has never been any problem about it <e>", "<cs> i think that the electoral law applies in scotland in the same way as it does in england <e> <s> democracy prevails on both sides of the border <e>", "<cs> for those of us who perhaps do not have the subtlety of mind of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and i think that there are some of us in that unhappy state it might have been better if the various definitions that we have to apply as we go through the bill had all been stated in the second or third clause <e> <s> then those definitions being mastered i think that the rest of the bill would have become more simple <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies on that further point i wonder whether i may point out that a limitation period of three months for the establishment of a civil action is a very short period indeed <e> <s> when my noble friend is looking further at this matter will he bear in mind that much longer periods of limitation for the claiming of money are acknowledged by the law generally <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that the normal limitation period of three years would be appropriate in these circumstances <e> <s> what i am saying is that a period of three months appears to be disproportionately short in the particular circumstances which arise here <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that forewarned is forearmed and that our early warning system is a crucial part of the air defence of the kingdom including the most beautiful parts of it <e> <s> will he therefore ensure that fylingdales is given the highest priority of equipment of manning and indeed of location <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers that can he say whether the term housing body has been used previously in scottish legislation <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend on that point and perhaps take the matter a little further <e> <s> there are so many definitions dotted about the bill some of which are quite new <e> <s> there is the interpretation of part i in clause where there are about a dozen definitions <e> <s> there is the interpretation clause towards the end of the bill with a lot more definitions <e> <s> now my noble friend lord selkirk has pointed out that there is a definition right along in the second schedule which is not related solely to that schedule <e> <s> it is a definition which we needed in order to understand clause <e> <s> therefore the case for having the definitions all together and only in the bill is very strong indeed <e> <s> it would save time and simplify the task of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i pray in aid the recommendations of the committee of which i had the honour to be chairman which said what my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has just said namely that principles should be stated in clauses and that when a great deal of detail is needed to be set out to apply those principles to particular circumstances it should be contained in a schedule or if temporary for example in statutory instruments or orders in council <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that unexpectedly encouraging reply <e> <s> is he aware that some local authorities ignoring chernobyl persist in declaring themselves nuclear-free zones are irresponsibly breaking the law and are failing to prepare the civil defence plans which they are required to prepare <e> <s> what do the government propose to do about such authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that much more realistic reply <e> <s> does he agree that those plans cannot be implemented without the help of a large number of volunteers that some counties have hundreds of them and that other local authorities have none

for the possibility i put it no higher of a conventional conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not expect my noble friend to accept this amendment <e> <s> it would introduce a large element of uncertainty to a matter in respect of which we should be giving the clearest indication of the intentions of parliament <e> <s> in order to prepare for the end of the present system and the introduction of a new one people will have a good deal to do <e> <s> they should know precisely the moment when their arrangements must reach a climax in other words when the bill is to come into force and the changes made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all share with the noble lord a desire to ensure that the mentally handicapped are given the more favourable treatment included in the bill on report as a result of the government amendment <e> <s> however looking at the amendment moved by the noble lord lord carmichael i wonder whether he has appreciated that it would narrow the group of people who could be helped under the terms of the bill <e> <s> the group of people is stated in general terms as those with <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my congratulations on my noble friends vigilance <e> <s> it is the kind of small point that few of us detect <e>", "<cs> my lords it surprises me that we could seriously be discussing the omission of this clause at third reading <e> <s> as i understand the rules of the house on third reading they are that we may consider amendments which arise out of government undertakings given at an earlier stage and we may consider drafting amendments <e> <s> but if this clause which has been in the bill since the beginning or something like it has were now simply to be left out a great part of the purpose of the bill would go to the other place unfulfilled <e> <s> i do not know what the other place would say about that <e> <s> it would be a most extraordinary position <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether it has occurred to him that if the clause is left out a number of consequential amendments to the bill which are not before us would be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the tribute which the noble lady lady saltoun has paid to my noble friend lord glenarthur and i would add that he has shown great stamina and skill because this is a very difficult bill both in form and in substance <e> <s> if ever an illustration were needed of the difficulty of legislation in itself in matters which appear to cover just the ordinary things of life this bill is a good example <e> <s> as to the form of it all i would say is that it is perhaps regrettable that we had to put into it so much which is largely of administrative direction <e> <s> if we could leave those matters to ministers to deal with instead of involving parliament in the primary legislation the legislation would be clearer and easier to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether when the statistics are published they will include information about hooliganism by british subjects abroad <e> <s> can he also say whether they will give an indication of the number of lives lost as a result of this hooliganism <e>", "<cs> this is a short but important point and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has given very strong reasons in favour of it <e> <s> i wish to support him <e>", "<cs> no with great respect that cannot be so because there is a difference between evidence given orally and statements made orally but not on oath <e> <s> those advising my noble friend have obviously overlooked that difference <e>", "<cs> if i may say so there is a great deal of difference <e> <s> one is made on oath and the other is not <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said for years it has been the practice of the courts to allow oral statements to be made either by the accused or by an advocate on his behalf whether a barrister or a solicitor <e> <s> are we really by a backdoor method going to change that long-established procedure <e> <s> it would be sheer nonsense to try to do so and the noble lords amendment makes sure that we are not doing so <e>", "<cs> i am terribly apologetic about taking up any time at this late stage of this parliament but i understand that judges have always had power to adjourn cases at any time and it surprises me that this amendment is at all necessary <e>", "<cs> before any other noble lord gets up to thank my noble friend i wish to assure members of the committee that even under the amendment as we accept it the matter will not arise

unusual course but a sensible one in the circumstances <e> <s> i have to confess that i find this subsection a bit of a muddle even if it is not amended <e> <s> however the muddle that i find is not one which is dealt with by any of the amendments put down <e>", "<cs> may i now with great humility try to explain the difficulty that i have about this subsection whether or not the amendments are accepted <e> <s> if my noble friend could address his mind to that as well as giving us the long-awaited reply to the noble lord lord hutchinson i should be grateful <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his correction <e> <s> the reasonable is more reasonable in the place mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give some indication of the extent to which

display of so much violence sex obscene language and occasional <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the powerful case move by the noble lord lord cornwallis with such strength and lucidity <e> <s> clearly there will be injustices here <e> <s> owner-occupying farmers as well as other landowners will be dispossessed in circumstances in which there will not be a transaction between willing buyer and willing seller because there will be no willing sellers if the land is to be parted with merely at existing use values <e> <s> the developers who will be the buyers and whose position is reinforced by an act of parliament will be in a strong position to make killings out of a resale if that is the right expression <e> <s> however the developers will undoubtedly be able to resell the land at development values to people <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be a safeguard as well as adding to the interest and pleasure of drinking wine by the glass if the publican or the restaurateur got into the habit of saying what the drink was or having a placard indicating what customers were drinking <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the mentally handicapped form the largest single group of disabled people <e> <s> will he confirm that mencap will be kept informed of the consultations as they proceed and given further opportunities to make representations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right in saying that an order under clause will be a better answer than a by-law of the kind proposed by the amendment <e> <s> however i hope that it will be borne in mind that smoking should be prohibited in the tunnel <e> <s> i personally do not suffer from claustrophobia <e> <s> however people in my family have done so and they find it is bad when there

there are even stronger and more general reasons as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord cornwallis <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat the arguments put forward at the committee stage <e> <s> however we have heard some further arguments today which reinforce the case for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the work of parliamentary counsel the legislators and indeed the users of statutes is greatly increased by ministers and their departments requiring too much detail to be written into statutes much of which is purely administrative and some of which is unenforceable <e> <s> will he therefore also bear in mind that we have fewer parliamentary counsel now than we had years ago when the problem was not quite so acute <e> <s> is he able to assure us that the increase in the number of parliamentary counsel will not lead to a further increase in the contents of each statute <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give an undertaking that what is obviously necessary on this occasion will not easily be regarded as a precedent for future occasions <e> <s> it is bad when even non-controversial legislation has to be rushed <e> <s> we should not let this occasion pass without getting an undertaking from the government with regard to the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to

speech but i think that we ought to understand the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will allow me to intervene <e> <s> it is splendid news that he has just given us but perhaps i may make the comment that i find it very strange that it is not mentioned in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure for me to follow my noble friend lady blatch not only because she was a constituent of mine and i have witnessed her rise in local government culminating in her becoming leader of cambridgeshire county council and a very effective one but also because of the way in which she got going with her maiden speech and has followed it up so soon on a subject in which she is well versed <e> <s> i was not able to congratulate her at the time as i was not speaking in the debate <e> <s> in her work on cambridgeshire-county council she played a leading and effective part in helping the county council to do what it is required to do splendidly in terms of civil defence and civil protection <e> <s> i have reason to know as i have the honour to be president of cambridgeshire emergency volunteers <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that part of his speech which he says is not his main contribution it will be interesting to hear the rest i wonder whether he will bear in mind that we are now at nd july <e> <s> we are about to enter august and then september and the st october follows immediately <e> <s> it is abundantly plain from the evidence already given by my noble friends and from evidence which i have at my disposal here that the nuclear-free zone authorities and we know their attitudes have embarked upon a long-term stalling exercise which appears to have the deliberate intention of not being ready by st october <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that that is so <e> <s> i can provide him with the evidence <e> <s> i do not want to take time in the middle of his speech repeating it all <e> <s> but does he support them in that attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend but my point is terribly important <e> <s> he has used the phrase county level civil defence authorities <e> <s> does that phrase include the joint fire and civil defence authorities <e>", "<cs> the word evidence is broader than the word facts because evidence may include not only facts but expressions of opinion as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships welcome my noble friends statement that further thought will be given to finding a better solution for the constitutional problem in fiji <e> <s> in giving attention to this matter will her majestys government bear in mind that there is in fiji an indigenous people with a tradition and culture of their own and that it would be quite wrong merely in the name of democracy to find this indigenous community losing its identity and its place in its own country <e>", "<cs> i have one difficulty over this which is no doubt due to my ignorance <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that if the provisions of the clause are to become effective whether it is to be by live video link or by closed circuit television a record in other words a tape has to be made <e> <s> if that is so it seems to me not to be very material as to whether it is done by closed circuit television of which a record is made or by video link <e> <s> perhaps in my ignorance i could be enlightened <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think that my noble friend has missed the point made by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham and indeed by me too <e> <s> we have said that there must be a record and the question is what sort of a record <e> <s> also what arrangements would be made for the proceedings being taken and for their being proved because that may be desirable too <e> <s> merely to have a transcript taken as the result of a shorthand note would not be right in a matter of this kind <e> <s> we need to have a tape which shows what was actually seen on the closed circuit television <e> <s> can my noble friend give us an assurance that that is what will happen <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has just pointed out it is no use saying that it will be done in the usual way because there is not yet a usual way for doing this <e>", "<cs> the difficulty i feel about the amendment is this <e> <s> we are told in subsection that this is a case of giving evidence on a trial on indictment or an appeal to the criminal division of the court of appeal <e> <s> we now through a government amendment find that it would also apply to those cases which are referred to the court of appeal <e> <s> but a trial on indictment is always preceded by a preliminary hearing before the magistrates <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the stage at which it would be right to be taking this evidence <e>", "<cs> in that case my comment would be that clause would do much better coming before clause <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl permit me <e> <s> i was not referring to cases of summary jurisdiction <e> <s> i was referring to the fact that committal proceedings take <e>", "<cs> i bow to better recollection <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether the replies so far received reveal that all local authorities with statutory responsibility for protecting their people would be able and willing to do so in the event of there being another serious nuclear accident causing fall-out <e> <s> do they appear to be relying merely upon calling their areas nuclear-free zones and doing nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that your lordships have already waited several years for a full report on the performance of local authorities on these responsibilities can my noble friend tell the house roughly when we may expect the full statement to which he referred in his answer to my question <e>", "<cs> i feel that the clause is right for dealing with these cases when they are first offences but if a person gets into the habit of taking motor cars without the consent of the owners and is convicted more than once i think there should be the possibility of trial by indictment <e> <s> i must confess i have not checked this through to see what would happen for subsequent offences and if my noble friend lord caithness can enlighten me on that point i shall be very grateful <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend lord elton on the broad theme that he has put before the committee <e> <s> however i should like to make two points <e> <s> first we are depriving a large number of people of what was regarded as an ancient and fundamental right of trial by jury on such a serious matter as the allegation of theft <e> <s> within our society even petty pilfering has been regarded as so antisocial as to incur general displeasure <e> <s> in the past rather than having a wanton conviction by a bench of magistrates who might be inexperienced amateurs it was right to accord the right to trial by jury but those days have gone <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend lord denning has pointed out the magistrates of today are trained people <e> <s> a tremendous amount of care is taken and they are well advised <e> <s> they are expected to achieve and indeed do achieve a high standard of justice which in the case of relatively small thefts enables us to withdraw the right to trial by jury <e> <s> on that point i do not think that we need have any fears <e>", "<cs> after that fascinating description of the history and principles underlying this amendment the committee will not expect to hear much from me at least i hope that it will not <e> <s> perhaps i may say that i also support the principle of this new clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry not yet i meant my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> i am blaming the system <e> <s> if this matter had been in the bill as presented to us at second reading no doubt there would have been an explanation of the effect of this new clause in the explanatory memorandum <e> <s> however we do not have that advantage <e> <s> we could have been shown the matter exactly as it affects the criminal appeal act or at any rate sections and of that act if what is called a keeling schedule had been used <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one more point which is that this removes what is an anomaly in the law <e> <s> seeing the noble and learned lord lord ackner there i can best illustrate this by the fact that a case which i threw out at the conclusion of the prosecution case at quarter sessions was taken to the divisional court over which at the time the noble and learned lord was presiding and the divisional court criticised me for throwing it out and ordered that the justices should carry out a new trial <e> <s> so this can already be done at the lower level and it is absurd that it should not be done at the proper level <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has done a valuable service in bringing the matter before us <e> <s> i should like to indulge in a modest amount of personal reminiscence to put the matter into perspective <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has asked me a question may i be allowed to reply <e> <s> i agree that we should lay down minimum standards <e> <s> but the new clause purports to do much more than that <e> <s> it purports to make it a minimum legal requirement that these things should be done presumably at once <e> <s> if they cannot be done at once it is misleading to enact them in that way <e>", "<cs> i was fully in favour of the removal of crown immunity for the hospital services of this country <e> <s> i still have an open mind on the question of whether it should be removed from penal establishments and i shall be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say about that <e>", "<cs> i do not understand the argument put forward by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it seems to me that if a man might kill to avoid a sentence of life imprisonment it is quite possible that he would want to kill in order to avoid a sentence of years imprisonment <e> <s> therefore there does not seem to be great validity in that argument <e> <s> i support the government on this matter <e>", "<cs> arising from what the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has just said we should bear in mind that we are not suggesting in clause a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment but a maximum sentence to cover only the very worst cases <e> <s> it could not possibly be very frequently that life imprisonment is awarded but to cover the worst cases i think it should be on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that partly encouraging reply but is he aware that when i went along this waterway in july i could hardly see the surface of the water because of floating rubbish and water weeds that there were reeds encroaching from the banks and that it was silting up at various places <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that this could and should become an attractive waterway for thousands of people <e> <s> will he pass on to the thames water authority our strong feelings about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not surprise the noble lord lord henderson to know that i am in broad agreement with him in that i favour the idea of a select committee <e> <s> early in this debate my noble friend lord ferrers referred to the fact that there is now a better understanding of mentally handicapped people in this country <e> <s> he was good enough to say that mencap as a voluntary organisation had

week in that post <e> <s> he as much as any other individual has done such a lot to help towards that better understanding mentioned by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i too doubt the need for this

punishment <e> <s> confiscation is intended to prevent the crime from being committed again by the same people <e> <s> that does not invalidate my noble friends argument <e> <s> i trust that i am not presuming too much when i say that i hope my remark clarifies the case he has put forward and perhaps strengthens it <e>", "<cs> i ask my noble and learned friend the lord advocate to give very careful attention to what the noble lord lord morton of shuna has said <e> <s> i wish to draw upon a strange experience that i once had in order to support the case <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> however i wish to ask him to consider the matter further <e> <s> the fact that the provision was in the non-statutory scheme and that the government are proposing to relax it somewhat to give the board a wider discretion does not get over the difficulty that people who try to help the police to make arrests should not be penalised by having the

such an extent that they cannot support their populations and that they are certain to become even more over-populated which will threaten the environment <e> <s> will the governments representatives refer to the problem of that over-population at the conference <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble and learned friend lord denning i too support the bill on the broad ground that any good scheme is capable of improvement and should be looked at from time to time by parliament which established the scheme in the first place <e> <s> however i must confess that when i first read the bill there was much more that i needed to know about it <e> <s> having heard the full and helpful speech of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor many of the doubts that i had have been removed <e> <s> some of the doubts held by members of the bar will be removed when they read his speech <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to interrupt <e> <s> i fully agree with him <e> <s> however i wonder if he will go a step further and say that the words fair remuneration might well come into the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that quite full reply <e> <s> is he aware that in recent years much valuable parliamentary time has had to be spent in curing drafting and other obvious defects in bills presented to parliament and that those defects could have been spotted before publication <e> <s> although further prior scrutiny might take up a short while is my noble friend not aware that bills would receive the royal assent sooner if less time had to be taken up in curing those defects <e> <s> have the government therefore not considered this solution which would be to their advantage and that of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that unfortunately rather short reply <e> <s> is he aware that his statute law committee which has been operating since and is responsible as i understand it for advising him on legislation is composed of very eminent people who normally meet only once a year <e> <s> with the help of one of its sub-committees would it not be of tremendous value if the statute law committee were to consider statutory trends in the drafting and structure of legislation and what further improvements might be made <e> <s> it should bear in mind that there is widespread anxiety about the quality of our legislation <e> <s> would it not he a good idea if its reports were laid before parliament from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly welcome the provisionally expressed russian intention to withdraw their troops from afghanistan <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that if those troops are merely diverted to strengthening the russian forces on the european front it will not add to the peace of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the reduction of taxes on tobacco and alcohol and the imposition of vat on food childrens clothing and school books would be a high price to pay in order to achieve further european integration <e>", "<cs> this seems to me to be such an important matter that i hope the committee will bear with me for a few moments <e> <s> as is well known to some noble and learned lords who have spoken as chairman of the committee which suggested that they should be used when appropriate i am on record as being in favour of purpose clauses in order that we may do what parliament so rarely does which is to express its intention <e> <s> although we legislate to a vast amount we so rarely indicate in general terms what we are doing <e> <s> therefore when i first saw this amendment i looked upon it with some favour <e>", "<cs> although i am very much in favour of the next three amendments which are very specific in relation to the composition of the board with due respect to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i have doubts about the practicability and need for his amendment <e> <s> i shall take the points of the amendment in turn <e> <s> paragraph a mentions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly reply to the noble baroness <e> <s> of course there are many statutory consumer councils but here we are dealing with a quite different point <e> <s> here the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is obliged to find out the people representative of certain groups <e> <s> i believe that the biggest group of people who get help under the legal aid scheme are the people involved in divorce cases <e> <s> should the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor really be obliged to ferret out a suitable representative of such people <e>", "<cs> i am rather disappointed with the speech of the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> as i said at second reading if we are to have two solicitors on this board and that is already stated in the bill i should have thought that there should be at least two barristers <e> <s> under the present scheme the law societys administering committee has always had two distinguished experienced members of the bar serving on it and they have found time to do so <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> there are the press reporters who report legal cases <e> <s> there are the police <e> <s> the examples are innumerable <e> <s> however this relatively small independent legal aid body which must be highly respected must have people who understand and have had professional experience of the working of the courts <e> <s> that is why i say it is better that we should accept amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> can my noble and learned friend say whether he considers the fact that the bill provides that the board shall include at least two solicitors would prevent the lord chancellor from also appointing two barristers <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble and learned friend will forgive my interruption <e> <s> i should like to place on record the fact that the advice that he has received from the bar has changed from the advice that i was given at the time of the second reading <e> <s> i accept what he has said <e>", "<cs> one is entitled to move the amendment in another members name <e> <s> during an earlier discussion i said that i was proposing to move this amendment if it was not moved <e> <s> however in view of what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said which indicates that he is now in discussion with the bar council and that its attitude has changed since second reading i do not propose to take the matter any further <e>", "<cs> part of the answer to the last point raised by the noble and learned lord is that one could have different areas which deal with divorce and other civil matters <e> <s> the only point i wish to put to my noble and learned friend is that there are already existing areas and sub-areas for legal aid <e> <s> presumably free scope is given to the board to change those areas and to have an entirely different arrangement <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord would say what he has in mind <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord agree that what he is proposing here in mandatory terms is very similar to the power given in permissive terms under subsection when read with subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> subsection and subsection of clause would enable to be done that which he is making mandatory in his amendment <e>", "<cs> if the bar and the solicitors were to be represented on the board presumably it would not be necessary to have consultation of the kind which is envisaged in the amendment by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> nor would it be necessary to have it if the effect on solicitors or barristers respectively were to be favourable to them <e> <s> therefore when the amendment refers to a significant effect on them one wonders whether those are the right words <e>", "<cs> strictly speaking it does not need to he written into the bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would be so good as to explain why he has raised this matter at this stage admittedly under the heading duties of the board when it might have been more appropriate to have raised it under clause which deals with availability of representation <e>", "<cs> my lords i cordially welcome the appointment of my noble friend as minister of state at the home office <e> <s> is he aware that the home office now has a policy and has had for several years of coping with all emergencies in peace and war shortly called the all-hazards approach and that the home office has used the expression civil protection rather than civil defence to describe all those risks <e> <s> would it not be better therefore to bring the statute law into line <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i wonder whether he can clarify one point <e> <s> he indicated that this provision should apply regardless of means <e> <s> we know that some children have considerable means <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that my noble and learned friend if i may so describe him as i do by chance on occasion should be at such pains to wish to protect the children of the very rich in this way as undoubtedly his amendment would do <e> <s> let me just take one example <e> <s> a millionaire may die leaving several dependants including a child <e> <s> the will is contested <e> <s> it may be contested of course on behalf of the child it may be contested on behalf of one or other of the dependants <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the case put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon is sound in its merits <e> <s> however the question arises is it a fit subject for legislation <e> <s> the discretion that will be exercised by the board is plainly stated in clause to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i should have thought that the only extra factor that arises on discretion is the time factor to which the noble lord very properly and fairly referred <e> <s> but is that matter not better dealt with by the rules of court <e> <s> i should have thought that for us to go into this detail on legislation was unnecessary especially when rules of court would be available to achieve the purpose <e>", "<cs> i was going on to say that in framing rules of court what the noble lord has said is sensible and should be borne in mind <e> <s> if any further amendments to existing rules are needed let that be done at the same time <e>", "<cs> i referred to rules of court but of course regulations would be a perfectly sensible and in the circumstances perhaps a more suitable way of doing it <e>", "<cs> i desire to support the noble and learned lord <e> <s> when the noble and learned lord lord griffiths spoke at second reading i took the liberty of interrupting him and suggested that the words fair remuneration might well come into the clause <e> <s> having heard the noble and learned lord lord ackner i not only remain of that opinion but am further convinced that that should be done <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down i wonder whether he will allow me to point out that i think most of us discussing this amendment were speaking only to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i myself do not agree with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think it would have followed from what i said about the public purse <e> <s> surely whether line should be left out is a separate issue and it would be better if we concentrated at this moment on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> having spoken in favour of amendment no <e> <s> i too hope that the noble and learned lord lord ackner will not try to bring this to a conclusion tonight <e> <s> from his point of view it might be a self-defeating exercise <e> <s> if the matter is allowed to rest for the time being we might achieve something from this amendment eventually <e>", "<cs> there have been several times in the living memory of those of us who are now fairly old when the government have been faced with a very severe economic crisis and by common consent government expenditure on all sides has had to be restricted <e> <s> to say that the government shall not have the freedom to do that with regard to the legal aid fund in those unfortunate circumstances seems to me to be quite unrealistic <e> <s> i hope that such a situation will never arise but to say that parliament is to act on the basis that it would never arise seems to be impracticable and wrong <e>", "<cs> i too agree but i wonder whether i may briefly mention in passing that one of the offences to which this level of penalties will relate is described in paragraph a of subsection as <e>", "<cs> on various previous occasions i have supported the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and he has sometimes supported me when attempts have been made to exorcise those words from other statutes dealing with different matters <e> <s> however we have never had a stronger case than this for getting rid of words which clutter up the statute book as has been said <e> <s> we all know something about system of government and the careful and thorough consultations which take place within it and i find it strange that the lord chancellor one of the great officers of state should have specifically written into the statute that he cannot act without the treasurys approval when he would never dream of doing so even if it were necessary for him to do so <e>", "<cs> i am not regarded as learned in this place <e>", "<cs> i have a further query on which i should be grateful for elucidation in addition to that raised by the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> perhaps i may say that the noble and learned lord was at one time financial secretary to the treasury <e> <s> therefore he speaks with a great deal of knowledge of those matters <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble and learned friend whether he is able to give any indication as to his intentions with regard to bringing into force various parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> i feel strongly that there should not be the right of legal aid for proceedings in the immigration appeal tribunal <e> <s> if that were granted the pressure on the legal aid board would become tremendous because there is a great demand for people from various overseas countries to enter our overcrowded country <e> <s> although in many of the cases the board would not consider it right to issue a certificate nevertheless the pressures would be enormous <e> <s> i therefore feel that we should certainly not grant legal aid in such circumstances <e> <s> i have an open mind on the other two matters and i should be <e>", "<cs> it is a good principle of legislation that bottomless pits should be avoided <e>", "<cs> at first sight i was tempted to think that a body of such importance as the nature conservancy council should have two members rather than one if only for the reason that if one member is ill they will not be represented in the discussion at all <e> <s> that could be a misfortune <e> <s> on the other hand the nature conservancy council has many demands upon its membership <e> <s> if it is to be an established principle that they are to have two representatives on every important conservation body then their resources so far as concerns the members of the council would be somewhat strained <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to trouble my noble friend but he has continually talked about a fair balance and he has told the committee that there will be members of the authority altogether <e> <s> he has also told the committee that there will be three representatives of conservation interest namely two from the countryside commission and one from the nature conservancy council <e> <s> that is three out of <e> <s> if he looks at clause a he will find there that the first named and i should have thought the principal general duty of the authority is conservation conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the broads <e>", "<cs> they certainly are <e>", "<cs> very briefly as the noble lord has challenged what i have said i wonder whether i may point out two matters <e> <s> first my noble friend lady blatch i have never disagreed with her before and i have known her many years is quite right i am sure in thinking that the present members of norfolk county council are conservation minded <e> <s> i am not disputing that <e> <s> however the composition of county councils changes <e>", "<cs> we are going to get this one <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness will not to take too much time on this amendment <e> <s> i was glad to support her on her previous amendments but i believe that she has a tremendous difficulty here in addition to the hybridity point which could delay the passage of the bill very much <e> <s> her difficulty is that if you have a relatively minor point of conservation but a major point involving a major decision on shall we say <e> <s> navigation it would perhaps be an exercise of bad judgment for the broads authority to say oh no we must have priority for conservation therefore the major navigation point must give way <e> <s> that is why i think the amendment is quite unacceptable <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i hope he will not let it be thought that this is a fit subject for legislation for a department to be asked to give guidelines <e>", "<cs> in a very long experience of legislation i first entered parliament -odd years ago i have never seen a precedent for this type of provision <e> <s> i have never known a provision to be enacted by parliament which stipulated that if a minister could not appoint the proper number of members on a public authority as laid down by parliament in a bill the department could get cracking with fewer members <e> <s> in this case we are speaking of a fairly large proportion <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to my noble friend but he has not told us whether this provision is breaking new ground or whether there is a precedent for it <e> <s> if this is a precedent i hope that it will not be used at random by a less well-intentioned government at some time in the future <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is much too generous <e> <s> i am not learned in your lordships chamber <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i hope that he will allow me to remind him that in reaching our unanimous decision to which he has referred our minds were prompted by the fact that we were taking away from the lord chamberlain a jurisdiction of being censor while placing upon the courts a responsibility which it could be said they already had of allowing the law relating to obscenity to operate <e> <s> in order to give a complete picture of the conclusion that we reached i think that that should be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> that would make the amendment unnecessary <e>", "<cs> this well-intentioned amendment is extremely widely drawn and i wonder whether those who have moved it have really contemplated that it would have a most damaging effect <e> <s> the only criterion as to whether this information counselling and advice could be given is to be found in the words at the end <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has overlooked the fact that if the five year old child when he becomes a teenager asks about this relationship and is told in the case of your mother and her friend it is a relationship that they have decided upon and i do not think you need worry that is not promoting homosexuality in the child <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord gifford i do not agree that clause as it stands in any way offends the european convention on human rights <e> <s> i do not consider that an amendment along the lines of amendment no <e> <s> b is necessary <e> <s> however if it were to be considered necessary with great respect to noble lords who have spoken the amendment does not cover the points made by the noble lord when he quoted from the judgments <e> <s> i believe that the first judgment he quoted referred to non-interference with a persons private life <e> <s> the second judgment referred to freedom of publication <e> <s> the amendment does not deal with either of those matters <e> <s> even if the assumption which the noble lord invites us to make is correct i do not think that the amendment meets his purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords would not some of the problems that have been mentioned be solved without difficulty by calling upon the clergy and the religious leaders of non-christian bodies to help the headmasters of schools by inviting these religious leaders to conduct the acts of worship instead of the headmaster <e>", "<cs> my lords knowing how reluctant the managers of government business are in both houses to agree to there being affirmative procedure rather than negative i am sure that my noble friends on these benches agree with me when i say that we should not only be grateful to my noble and learned friend but we should congratulate him on the persuasion that he must have used <e> <s> if i may say so i think his choice of the various items for affirmative resolution is significant and important <e> <s> the scope of legal aid and advice for example will be subject to affirmative resolution as will the extent of representation under clause which is going to be a vital part of the scheme <e> <s> i join in the welcome that has been given to this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords with deep humility <e>", "<cs> my lords i leave aside the point made by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> on the question of the availability of counsel of experience knowledge and good standing to attend meetings of the legal aid board that will depend mainly upon the times at which they are held <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor pointed out at the committee stage the board will under the terms of the bill as it stands have power to establish regional committees and presumably area committees too <e> <s> to my mind it is unthinkable that they could discharge their duties without a great degree of decentralisation <e> <s> i should have thought that that is so plain that it would be unnecessary to write it into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that there is a simple lesson to be learnt from this namely that when against the advice of the lord chancellor a simple amendment is carried which looks all right in itself it may give rise to a very complicated set of purely technical amendments in order to correct the matter <e> <s> i must confess that i was not present on that occasion when the government were defeated by only two votes <e> <s> however i somehow feel that had it been realised that there were to be these consequential technical amendments the amendment that was passed might very well not have been passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords motive in moving the amendment <e> <s> i have been trying to follow through its effect in relation to the bill as it stands and in relation to what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said when replying to the debate in committee on a previous occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has no doubt unintentionally brought me to the very next point that i was going to make <e> <s> we have to be very careful as my noble and learned friend on the woolsack said on a previous occasion not to have a duplication between part ii and part iii <e> <s> also i should like boldly to go a little further and say that we have to be careful not to have a contradiction between part ii and part iii <e>", "<cs> my lords i just wish to say a word about the mental health tribunals because i have been involved in this subject for many years <e> <s> i helped to pilot the home office clauses of the mental health act which are really the foundation still of the present law <e> <s> when we had the more recent mental health act in your lordships house i think in the last parliament i took a close interest in the details of the legislation <e> <s> i also happen to be the president of mencap and i was chairman for a number of years before that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have doubts as to whether it would be wise to leave out paragraph b because one might have a successful unassisted party in the proceedings who happened to be a very rich man <e> <s> the costs in which he might be involved would in relation to the circumstances be a fairly small matter <e> <s> in those circumstances it is difficult to understand why public funds should bear the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some doubts about amendment no <e> <s> but on balance the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i hope i have not wasted time <e> <s> i understood that we were also discussing the other two amendments tabled by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> in that case i must now sit down but hope to return to the point <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may strain at the leash without leaving my kennel i should like to say that it seems to me that judges are going to find it difficult in many cases to decide whether there has been severe financial hardship <e> <s> in any event i think it is too stringent a test <e> <s> however the expression appreciable financial loss would enable the justice of the case to be met in most circumstances that one could imagine <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not also the case that these regulations will not create any rights for individuals <e> <s> they are the administrative machinery for asserting rights that have been granted elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the difficulty with the amendment especially in relation to the <e>", "<cs> my lords the greatest help we can give to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is to try to arrive at a scheme which will ensure the full co-operation of both branches of the legal profession <e> <s> without their full co-operation this new scheme with its many fundamental changes will fail to give that public service which all your lordships hope that it will provide <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble and learned friend i think that that is a point which my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor would wish to argue <e> <s> those words are in the bill whether or not the amendment is accepted and we just have to take them as being there <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the use of the word number in the bill makes the amendment unnecessary if i may say so with respect <e> <s> bearing in mind that the word number of barristers and solicitors undertaking the work means that for us to add <e>", "<cs> my lords purely as a matter of drafting i think that the bill is capable of improvement upon the point which the noble lord lord benson has mentioned <e> <s> perhaps i may weary your lordships for one moment by reading out the relevant words and the sequence in which they will come now that two amendments of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor have been agreed to <e> <s> it will read as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i too read the article in <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding has been after only eight years in your lordships house that on report stage the main convention is that we may only speak once except with the leave of the house <e> <s> the mover of an amendment has a right of reply but even after the government spokesman has declared the government case the matter is still open for debate <e> <s> indeed it may be in the interests of the government that further views should be heard <e> <s> sometimes they are invited <e>", "<cs> it is not the practice <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to what the noble lord lord wigoder said i think we should bear in mind that although inevitably a good many statutory instruments will be made as a result of the powers given by the bill if there were fewer statutory instruments there would have to be many more clauses in the bill <e> <s> for better or worse the view has been taken in the past that when there is a good deal of detail which may have to be altered from time to time it is better done by statutory instrument than by having to alter the principal legislation <e> <s> for that reason although i was a little alarmed when i found that there were to be more than statutory instruments the reality of the situation with regard to the bill is that it is inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords the other place cannot amend statutory instruments <e> <s> it can reject them <e>", "<cs> and detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this amendment <e> <s> i shall do so very briefly <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale speaks with all the knowledge and experience of a former financial secretary to the treasury <e> <s> i fully endorse <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that nearly eight years ago the then secretary of state my noble friend lord jenkin announced the governments policy of trying to remove many mentally handicapped people of all ages from long-stay hospitals so long as they could be cared for in the community <e> <s> towards that end the government have given a great deal of help to voluntary societies including the royal society for the mentally handicapped and in recent years the process has been working satisfactorly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate my noble friend lord granville on his maiden speech and express the hope that he will drag himself away from the western isles in order to be with us from time to time in future <e> <s> i also wish to thank my noble friend lord cranbrook for the excellent way in which he laid the foundations of this very important debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the members of these agencies and the people recruited by them be subject to the official secrets act and to the usual duty of confidentiality <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point of substance i do not think that the noble lord lord irving or any other noble lord need worry about the fact that the police are having their powers added to <e> <s> local authority officers can also do that work <e> <s> there are many precedents <e> <s> law enforcement is often shared between local authorities or indeed other authorities and the police <e> <s> in any event the police have a general duty of law enforcement <e> <s> with great respect there is nothing in that point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will allow me to intervene <e> <s> by not resigning the member concerned would keep the various other rights which the union may have granted <e> <s> for example he may have been a subscribing member to an injury fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i have so often heard the noble lord lord graham of edmonton speak in a constructive vein on various subjects and i hope he will not mind my saying that i found his speech just now rather a disappointment <e>", "<cs> my lords knowing his great experience of trade unions i was hoping that we would have some more relevant criticism of the contents of the bill <e> <s> perhaps he will forgive me if i do not follow him much in what he has said except to remind him that the bill is mainly a manifesto commitment on which the government were elected and it was preceded by the well-known and very constructive green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not challenge that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>

chairman that there should be purpose clauses <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord simon and others have frequently pressed for purpose clauses and this is one of the first that we have seen of a comprehensive kind <e> <s> i attach great importance to the fact that it is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor himself who has had it drafted and has moved it before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept the explanation of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> indeed one could reinforce it by saying that when there are definitions in any clause it is often referred to as an interpretation clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend to whom we are all grateful for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i have some doubts about the amendment <e> <s> i agree that the proceedings before the social security commissioners can sometimes be complex but so can many other proceedings <e> <s> i should have thought that within the general framework of the bill if one may dare to use such an expression it would be wrong to make an exception just for that particular type of proceeding <e> <s> we are here talking about advice and assistance not

be a good reason for that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the comments made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale your lordships may think that the less i say the better it will be <e>

of the purpose clause which has just been accepted <e> <s> i should also like to acknowledge especially in view of what the noble lord lord meston said that the lord chancellor has provided that there should be not less than two members of the bar on the legal aid board <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord <e> <s> lord allen of abbeydale i have had doubts about this clause <e> <s> i have

african asians came here <e> <s> we supported him <e> <s> however there it is <e> <s> we are accused of having no soul <e> <s> that is an unfair comment and i am sorry to have to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we have a large number of commonwealth people and people from all over the world entering and leaving this country all the time <e> <s> of course there is an outflow figure but most of the people who come to this country for settlement remain to settle here <e> <s> their children born here are rightly british subjects and they stay here as do their children and their grandchildren and great grandchildren will be here <e> <s> we cannot get away from the fact that there is still a large degree of immigration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to give way yet again <e> <s> i will have given way three times altogether if i do <e> <s> i have spoken for minutes though i had hoped to speak for only <e> <s> i still have a little more to say and i hope that the noble lord will reserve his further controversy for the committee stage <e>", "<cs> i hope that my old friend the noble lord lord molloy will not take it amiss if i return to the amendments <e> <s> however before i do so perhaps he would just allow me to follow up something that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has just said and remind him that in our election manifestoes of and we gave a very clear and good forecast of what we intended to do to modernise trade union legislation and indeed to ensure that an element of real democracy was brought into that legislation in the sense of restoring to union members the power which should belong to them over the decisions taken in their name <e> <s> if the noble lords want to have the most recent example of that no doubt over the weekend he will have heard of the decision taken by ballot of the national union of mineworkers to end the overtime ban which mr arthur scargill and other trade union leaders no doubt wanted to continue <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am not begging the question that the noble lord has quite rightly put when i say that the nature of the order must depend upon the circumstances <e> <s> it must depend upon for example the distinction that my noble friend made an actual breach of contract or an inducement to breach of contract <e> <s> it must depend upon that to some extent and the court can take cognisance of that <e> <s> there is no problem there <e>", "<cs> however what has that to do with impeding the flow of ideas <e> <s> i do not understand <e>", "<cs> that is an admirable way for the noble lord to proceed <e>", "<cs> at first sight this amendment has something to commend it because obviously nobody wants to go to the trouble expense and delay of court proceedings if it is found that there have been second thoughts by those in the union who were responsible for the act complained of <e> <s> it is worth noting that in the original version of subsection which we arc replacing with subsection the possibility of repudiation is mentioned that is to say on page line it states <e>", "<cs> subject to what my noble friend may say i consider that the noble lord has given answers to each of the questions and they may be the right answers <e>", "<cs> the only point i wish to make is one that i have already made in a minor way it relates to presentation <e> <s> it seems to me that this large batch of amendments in the name of the minister are all amendments to clause <e> <s> they replace a great deal of what is already in clause <e> <s> it would be much easier for us all to follow if instead of their being tabled as individual amendments we were simply asked to leave out clause and insert a new clause <e> <s> we would then all know far better where we sat instead of having to put metaphorical wet towels around our heads <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot support the noble lord on this amendment <e> <s> in the first place he ought to consider the drafting a little further if i might suggest it <e> <s> if this amendment is accepted instead of <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he may be interested and perhaps reassured to know that the term industrial action appears in section of the employment protection consolidation <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me <e>", "<cs> may it not be that some of those members who did not comply with their unions request paid great attention to the freedom of the press and that that was why they decided to take the action that they did <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not mind if i attempt to answer his point about the lady and the golf club which is quite different from the position of a union member <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord acknowledges that <e> <s> she does not have the same loyalties to a family and she is not dependent upon membership of the golf club for her employment or for her livelihood <e> <s> she is not performing a service for children as teachers are and as nurses may do <e> <s> these examples could be multiplied by others <e> <s> that is an entirely different situation and if i may say so it is a false analogy <e>", "<cs> the situation created by this group of amendments is rather interesting from the legal point of view <e> <s> as i read it under the clause as it stands the <e>", "<cs> in the course of the further interventions by the noble lord lord wedderburn he has not mentioned the vital precondition of all this that we find in the opening words of the subsection <e>", "<cs> i assume that noble lords opposite accept that clause is desirable and are trying to improve it <e>", "<cs> not so i am surprised at that in view of the strong arguments put forward in the green paper for making unions accountable to their members <e>", "<cs> in other words the noble lord accepts the principle that there should be some right of inspection by union members <e> <s> that means that the unions must keep the accounts in such a way that they reveal what needs to be revealed <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the committee for jumping the gun <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with the four paragraphs of the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may comfort the noble lord to reflect that nearly all our legislation is passed not in order to govern the actions of the best but to ensure that those people or bodies who fall below the standards of the best reach the standards of the best <e> <s> that is one of the main purposes of this bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i point out that he was quite wrong about our not being a revising chamber here today <e> <s> goodness me he and i were overwhelmed by the number of government amendments intended to improve clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows more about the organisation and the structure of trade unions than i i have no reason to challenge the factual description that he has given the committee of the holding of property by unions and by branches <e> <s> it is implicit in what he said that both unions and branches have separate accounts <e>", "<cs> in that case i believe it is a relevant factor for the committee to bear in mind <e> <s> it may be that in the light of what the noble lord has said and the fact that section does not refer to branch property paragraph a may on reflection by the government need amplification <e> <s> i hope that if the government consider that to be so they will not depart from the proposition that branch accounts should be open to inspection by branch members <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> even if the government have not got the matter right and fulfilled their own intention of enabling branch accounts to be inspected would the noble lord not agree that branch members are more likely to be interested in the inspection of their branch accounts rather than union accounts <e> <s> therefore their right to do so should be made abundantly clear <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can explain one thing <e> <s> he has said that clause overrides the rule book <e> <s> he is therefore suggesting is he not <e> <s> that the rule book should dominate the law <e> <s> he is suggesting that it should take precedence over the law <e> <s> that is the natural consequence of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> is he going the stage further <e> <s> is he saying that if a law is passed which a union does not like it has only to alter its rule book and then the rule book would take precedence <e> <s> that would seem to be the corollary of what he is suggesting <e>", "<cs> i join with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in making this request to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> there are two difficulties that i see about this provision <e> <s> first the addition of these apparently innocent words broadens the scope of the subsection very much indeed <e> <s> secondly in doing so i can imagine cases in which there will be a wrangle before the courts as to whether a matter was incidental to the carrying out by the committee of its functions or was not incidental <e> <s> i do not think that we should be legislating in such a way as to give rise to that situation <e> <s> there is a very strong case for my noble friend to consider further amendment no <e> <s> of the noble viscount lord hanworth <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend the minister will not accept the amendment <e> <s> it seems to be manifestly a way of overcoming the provisions of the new subsection a by changing the rules of the union <e> <s> that goes back to the speech which we had on the first amendment which we considered today amendment no <e> <s> when the noble lord lord murray of epping forest was asked by me at the end of his speech if he would give way <e> <s> i then put to him the point that when he complained that the clause overrides union rules he was suggesting that the rules should take precedence over the law <e> <s> he came back at me with a plea for natural justice <e> <s> he quite rightly mentioned that the rules can be approved or disapproved by the courts when there is a change if necessary <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the noble lord understood the noble lord lord murray and i noted down the words of the noble lord lord murray at the time <e> <s> he complained that this clause overrides the rule book and therefore i believe that the noble lord lord rochester has it wrong <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby wisely said that if we are to have postal ballots we had better do the job properly <e> <s> although he did not expressly say so i hope that it was implicit in all that he said that he agrees with the amendment <e>", "<cs> in fact they voted by means of tokens <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord concludes i should like to say that i thought that this interesting amendment for which i have some sympathy was a paving amendment for the next amendment for which i also have some sympathy <e> <s> i should have thought that there would be advantages in discussing the two together bearing in mind that before there can be an agreed settlement as envisaged in amendment no <e> <s> there would necessarily have to be consultation as mentioned in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i was delighted when i saw the reference in the bill to the commissioner <e> <s> it seemed to me that the commissioner was to be a kind of ombudsman for trade union members <e> <s> in addition to that he is to have the advantage which the ombudsman does not normally have of having the power to assist in the institution of proceedings <e> <s> i have used my words rather guardedly because i do not wish to give a false impression of the meaning of the powers which are described in the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord wedderburn replies to my noble friend i wonder whether i may make one or two comments on what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i appreciate the point that he has made about anonymity but that will not apply in every case <e> <s> there will be cases in which it may be very important for anonymity to be preserved <e> <s> i can understand that it must be respected unless of course the applicant the member of the trade union says to the commissioner if you feel strongly that you should disclose my name go ahead <e> <s> but if the applicant says no i dont want my name disclosed the commissioner could still consult the union on a hypothetical basis and without revealing the name of the applicant <e> <s> with great respect to my noble friend that was his main point and i do not think that it was a complete answer <e>", "<cs> i have already expressed my views about the advantage of what is envisaged in the amendment <e> <s> although the noble lord lord wedderburn did not ask the government to consider the matter further when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i still say that the government should do so <e> <s> i hope that they will also agree to consider the matter that arises in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to take up time and to be so persistent <e> <s> i feel strongly however that we may be missing an opportunity <e> <s> it is not a question of the court being required to have a settlement made before it it is a question among other things of the commissioner being able to save large amounts of public money by preventing proceedings going to the court <e> <s> it should be an earnest concern of the government to save public money <e> <s> god knows the legal aid fund at the moment is costing hundreds of millions of pounds <e> <s> we do not want to add unnecessarily to the amount of money that is spent on it because that is what it comes to if we can have it clearly understood that conciliation is clearly a function of the commissioner <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that no person body or partnership can call itself a charity unless it has a charitable purpose recognised by law <e> <s> is he also aware that only parliament or the courts can enlarge the definition of a charity as it has been handed down and that the charity commissioners have no power to do so <e>", "<cs> i too am anxious that the commission should have a responsibility with regard to the training and employment of disabled people including the mentally handicapped who are the largest group of disabled people in this country <e> <s> i join the noble baroness lady seear in reading the bill as containing no reference whatever to disabled people <e> <s> perhaps there is some hidden reference which a superficial reading of the bill does not reveal <e> <s> if that is so we should be told what it is but i doubt whether there is one <e> <s> if no responsibility of this kind is placed upon the newly formed training commission perhaps some other statutory body will have the responsibility <e> <s> however i do not know of one <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend would allow me i should like to ask her whether she is suggesting that the manpower services commission was doing all this great work without being placed under any expressed statutory responsibility to do so <e>", "<cs> i agree with what my noble friend said <e> <s> i just add on the last point that requiring an affirmative resolution of each house of parliament before for example an increase in payment could become valid and be made could cause delay because there are occasions especially when there is an election in the autumn when parliament may not be sitting between the end of july let us say and well into october <e> <s> that could be a cause of hardship <e>", "<cs> and it is more usual <e>", "<cs> as i understand it we are discussing only amendments nos <e> <s> c and d <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friend should accept or should be expected to accept the amendment <e> <s> the case that has been put forward by the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord mccarthy seems to ignore the presence in the paragraph of the words without good cause <e> <s> they are in fact saying that even though the young man has without good cause refused or failed to apply for a place or refused to accept one three offers must be made to him before he suffers any disadvantage <e> <s> that situation seems to me if i may use jargon which has been used several times in connection with the bill to be going right over the top <e> <s> surely it is wrong that the officials who have to administer the scheme should when they find someone unto-operative because he has without good cause failed to accept an offer nevertheless have to ensure that on two further occasions an offer is put to him <e> <s> that does not seem to be reasonable <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect that is not relevant <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers that question i should say that we are not talking about jobs we are talking about vacancies on training schemes of which there are likely to be several available <e> <s> surely the provisions of the bill have covered the position admirably <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that for the past years there has been one of the largest american airbases near my home <e> <s> during the s and s i used to visit it frequently and have met hundreds of american airmen of all ranks <e> <s> will be accept my assurance that contrary to what is said in the film they are splendid men to whom we owe a great deal for their preservation of world peace <e>", "<cs> i have been listening carefully to my noble friend but is he suggesting that it is a majority or a minority of families who visit hotels and pubs on christmas day good friday and sundays <e> <s> is it a majority or a minority <e>", "<cs> like the right reverend prelate the bishop of ely i am not opposed to the bill in general but i am opposed to these amendments <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to say why <e> <s> in mentioning families my noble friend mr harmar-nicholls and other noble lords who have spoken <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e> <s> i have known him for much longer as mister and as sir than i have as a noble lord <e> <s> we had adjoining constituencies for many years in fact for a generation <e>", "<cs> of course the circumstances for the community at large are quite different <e> <s> for most people weekdays are working days whereas sundays christmas day and good friday are not <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy for the noble lord lord williams on this amendment <e> <s> my problem arises from the fact that the first line of subsection is so uncertain in its expression and effect <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says that the object is to clarify the law <e> <s> in doing so should we not ensure that the law is clear <e> <s> in view of the statement made by my noble friend that it is not appropriate to insert the words of the amendment namely to parliament between now and report <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up the rather important point just raised by my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> when we have a bill which needs to have a good deal read into it between the lines as it were as happens with clause it is only right and proper that we should refer to the explanatory memorandum although we have no power over its contents <e> <s> however i think in this case we should take note of exactly what the explanatory memorandum says in its first sentence <e> <s> i ask the committee to take note of the following important words <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i think the difficulty which he has expressed and which my noble friend lord nugent and i also expressed earlier could be overcome by there being a purpose clause at the beginning of the bill <e> <s> it would come before clause and its substance would be very much what is in the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum <e> <s> on the legal aid bill recently the lord chancellor himself introduced a purpose clause <e> <s> he had one drafted which helped very much in the interpretation of the bill <e> <s> i certainly think that the same solution could well be applied to this bill <e>", "<cs> although i believe that most members of the committee will understand the intention of the noble lord lord diamond in moving the amendment with which most of us would agree i am afraid that he has used a terribly wide phrase <e> <s> the net assets of the nation are a very large concept and include the gold reserves the buildings in whitehall and every pair of boots worn by every private soldier in the armed forces <e> <s> it is a vast concept and i do not think that such a wide phrase is suitable for use in the context of this subsection <e> <s> i cannot contemplate my noble friends acceptance of the amendment <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not agree that a very large part of the magnificent development which the electricity industry on both the generation and the distribution sides has carried out over the last years has resulted from successive governments giving consent to their public borrowing powers <e>", "<cs> i wish to raise a small point that may prove be a quite big one <e> <s> clause refers to section of the water act <e> <s> the explanatory memorandum states <e>", "<cs> if that were done it would be the next best thing <e> <s> however i would prefer to see it considered sooner <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend in what he has said <e> <s> i speak from personal experience <e> <s> somewhat unusually the house in which i live in huntingdonshire right out in the country has for many years had a metered supply <e> <s> the reason is that it is part of the supply to a farm owned by my neighbour <e> <s> it was found by the water authority by my neighbour and by me that a joint meter would be convenient <e> <s> i have no doubt that there are many of these all over the country <e> <s> the fact that they exist supports the view that conclusions can be drawn from these schemes <e>", "<cs> of course meters ought to function properly <e> <s> but if they do not appear to do so it is only right that the water authority or whichever body is involved must test the meter when a complaint is made <e> <s> it ought to be sufficient to leave the matter there rather than to provide for regular testing in a statute <e> <s> such testing over a wide area containing many people who have meters may be an expensive excess of zeal <e> <s> i doubt whether the amendment is necessary or desirable <e>", "<cs> we do not know about that <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord williams could tell us <e>", "<cs> my noble friend was good enough to say at the start of our discussions on the bill that he would consider a purpose clause <e> <s> probably it needs only to be a purpose subsection to clause <e> <s> i have already attempted to draft one which i intended to hand to my noble friend on monday but in doing so i find that it is not consistent with the long title to the bill <e> <s> i do not think that my purpose clause is wrong <e> <s> i believe that the long title needs to be reconsidered and i ask the minister if he will do so <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord bonham-carter suggests that there is an anomaly in our law between the admission of citizens of the ec and citizens of the commonwealth i wonder if he is really suggesting that commonwealth citizens should all be given the right of entry which under the treaty we have granted to ec citizens <e> <s> if so it would seem to be inconsistent with what he said at second reading <e> <s> he made it clear then that he and his party were opposed to mass immigration <e> <s> if we were to repeal the control of commonwealth immigration that is what we would have <e>", "<cs> that i understand <e> <s> it puzzled me somewhat when the noble lord went a good deal wider than the amendment <e> <s> he has drawn attention to what he considers to be an anomaly but which most of us do not consider to be so <e> <s> most of us do not believe there is an unjustifiable anomaly between the treatment of commonwealth citizens and those of the ec <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he can explain the following <e> <s> his amendment no <e> <s> reads <e>", "<cs> first may i say it really is a joy to listen to the noble lord <e> <s> he is so lucid clear and fair and never seems to refer to a note or an authority <e> <s> he has the advantage over most of us in that respect <e> <s> i particularly appreciated what he so kindly said about me when replying to the government statement on the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has a valid point <e> <s> however my answer is that the words in brackets provide for exceptions to be made in unusual cases where perhaps there has not been a proper clearance from the consulate as the case used to be and i think in some instances still is at the point at which the immigrants or would-be immigrants left their own country <e> <s> to the extent that the children to be admitted are going to join people lawfully already here and subject to the exceptions covered by the words in brackets which i think would be rare a great part of the noble lords amendment is already covered in a law not being repealed <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord lord hylton consider the final point that i made <e> <s> this amendment would allow children of parents living in the commonwealth the parents having the right of abode to come here even though the parents did not want them to do so and would perhaps be alarmed at their leaving home <e>", "<cs> i hope that none of the members of the committee has any doubts about this clause despite the fact that not very many people are affected by it <e> <s> if people want to have the advantage of coming to live in our civilised society i believe they should accept our standards <e> <s> they are the standards of those who practise the christian and jewish religions <e> <s> as regards the moslem religion only today i was told by a high court judge from pakistan that bigamy and polygamy are now unlawful in pakistan unless the first wife gives her consent to the marriage to one other woman <e> <s> it is fact that among hindus and moslems it has become gradually the custom that there should be monogamy among all the better hindus and moslems <e> <s> that is a good thing that we can record <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the noble lords point but i wonder whether it has occurred to him that we have an elaborate and for the most part very efficiently run administration for enabling would-be immigrants to prove their right of abode before leaving the countries in which they were living <e> <s> the arrangements are expensive <e> <s> we bear most of the expense but would-be immigrants make a contribution <e> <s> generally the arrangements work well <e>", "<cs> let us suppose that the person concerned has done his or her best in the country of origin and has hopefully produced all the documents that he or she could lay their hands on <e> <s> is the noble lord suggesting that after the case has been carefully considered by our representatives such a person should still be allowed to enter this country with no better documents than he had before and then to have a right of appeal <e>", "<cs> the hardship may not be that of the government <e> <s> the hardship may be that of the british people because as i think the noble lord lord bonham-carter said in bangladesh there are people waiting to have their cases heard <e> <s> i wonder whether he would explain what he said <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i obviously misheard him <e> <s> one does not always get things absolutely right across the chamber <e>", "<cs> if there are or letters in the home office they are presumably a reflection of the desire of or people or a portion of them to come here <e> <s> that is mass migration <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord be so good as to say whether in the context of this amendment the word child means somebody under the age of or not <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> on the face of it when one saw this amendment one naturally had some sympathy with it on humanitarian grounds as the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> but alas not all families are well united even those who come here and settle <e> <s> without much exercise of the imagination one can for <e>", "<cs> it gives me pleasure to be in agreement with the noble and learned lord for once and i think for the first time on this bill <e> <s> he has made a very important point <e> <s> it is something that should be dealt with in substance and i lean towards the view that it may be better written into statute than left to be dealt with in any other way <e> <s> i say that subject to whatever may be said by my noble friend lord ferrers who may have better ideas on this than any of us <e>", "<cs> as i understand what the noble lord has said the purpose of the amendment is that when an appeal fails because the appellant acted against the law and the rules or did not bring himself within the law or the rules and when there is no case under statute for the exercise by the secretary of state of his discretion instead of dismissing the appeal the adjudicator may consider <e>", "<cs> having heard my noble friend i no longer have an open mind on the merits of this matter <e> <s> i believe that he has made out a very clear case for showing that the amendment is not consistent with clause and that it is to a great extent unnecessary <e> <s> i make a further plea to the noble lord because we have tried to get things right in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord has put that question to me <e> <s> he has put it very fairly <e> <s> however i still say that the fact that some adjudicators take on board the compassionate grounds and others do not is not an answer to the three difficulties which i mentioned just now and which i hope that the noble lord lord mishcon will consider <e>", "<cs> is this point not covered by the long-established rules of criminal practice that a person who has been convicted or acquitted can merely point to the record and say <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that that surprises me greatly <e>", "<cs> surely we should avoid putting into a statute unnecessary words which may again proclaim what the law is <e>", "<cs> the clause changes the law which is explained in the explanatory memorandum <e> <s> it is not a question of declaring the law <e>", "<cs> in accordance with general principles of criminal law perhaps i may now burst into latin instead of french <e>", "<cs> i remember him <e>", "<cs> the illegal immigrant has only to go to ground for three years make sure he does not get into any official record his illegal entry and remaining here not being discovered and he can then remain for ever <e> <s> that is what it comes to does it not <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on this for the reasons which he has given <e> <s> but there is a further reason which would result from this amendment <e> <s> if the amendment were passed it would mean that a person had the right to re-enter this country for the rest of his life if he had once been admitted <e> <s> that right to re-enter for the rest of his life <e>", "<cs> it is not the only objection <e> <s> the hypothetical case which the noble lord has mentioned is not the one which arises <e> <s> i have very broad grounds of objection on which i have already elaborated <e>", "<cs> i have just thought of another very serious objection to the amendment <e> <s> a person who was previously granted leave to enter might have been a member of a commonwealth country with the right to come here <e> <s> he might have been granted leave to enter but meanwhile he might have changed his allegiance <e> <s> he might for example have become a polish citizen <e> <s> for him to be allowed to enter just the same in those circumstances would surely not be right <e>", "<cs> i am one of these who believe that it was right to enter the european community <e> <s> however i do not believe that it was right to have such a generous immigration policy between members of the european countries <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the noble lord when he says that europeans will be able to come here and settle more easily than commonwealth immigrants <e> <s> but to accept his amendment seems to me to be likely to lead to much further immigration from the <e>", "<cs> perhaps the right reverend prelate will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i greatly appreciate the way in which he has expressed his views <e> <s> does he say that racial tensions will be increased or diminished by more immigration from commonwealth countries <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness it is not the heads of families who constitute large numbers it is the wives and children who follow them and quadruple the numbers <e> <s> one really cannot say <e>", "<cs> it is not necessary for me to answer that question <e> <s> it has already been agreed between governments of both complexions and among all parties that our immigration law is based upon family unity <e> <s> however that means that in days of heavy unemployment we do not need more heads of families <e>", "<cs> i think that that is true of many asian people but not of all <e>", "<cs> no doubt my noble friend can confirm that not all commonwealth countries from which immigrants come offer reciprocity with the united kingdom <e> <s> many of them have very stringent immigration rules <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just put to the right reverend prelate that the crux of the matter is that within the european community we have complete reciprocity as regards immigration <e>", "<cs> let me finish the sentence which goes on but in the commonwealth we do not have such reciprocity <e>", "<cs> my lords i also am against this amendment but i rise only to answer the point made by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> it sounded to me as though his argument was based mainly upon his objection to the definition of industrial action in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he explain one point <e> <s> i have a copy of the trade union act section which does not contain subsection c <e> <s> it may be that a subsequent amendment has escaped my notice <e> <s> however i am looking at the queens printers copy and i shall be grateful for an explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am opposed to this amendment <e> <s> it is fundamentally contrary to the purpose the letter and the spirit of clause <e> <s> in the nature of things this clause is intended to protect those union members who as a matter of conscience of judgment or to support a wider loyalty than their loyalty to the union refuse to take

friend would be good enough to explain this point <e> <s> it seems to me from what he says although it is very strange to hear when one reads clause that there is to be no transfer of functions or

lords i am extremely grateful to those noble lords who have supported this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that we are all extremely grateful for the attempt by the lord chancellor to explain the

object of getting a firm undertaking from the government <e> <s> i have been able to find no definition of education in the bill but we must all understand that the word education in this context

that charities could obtain a rebate of rates from local authorities <e> <s> indeed power is given to local authorities to grant such rebates at their discretion <e> <s> however over the country as a

opportunity to raise that point <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers that question perhaps i may just add that it is quite clear from what he said that when the bill comes into operation the treatment of charities by local authorities will be an improvement on the present system <e> <s> however we shall still be left with the disparity of treatment in different parts of the country by different local authorities from which charities suffer now <e> <s> i give the example of mencap with which i have been associated for many years <e> <s> we have premises in various parts of england

very worthwhile discussion <e> <s> i was particularly encouraged by the statement of the right reverend prelate that he would continue consultation with the government over the exact wording of his amendments <e> <s> he suggested that he would consider the matters raised in this debate <e> <s> i hope that that will indeed be so <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> which i moved <e>", "<cs> my lords that is most encouraging <e> <s> i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i put your lordships minds at rest <e> <s> i propose in due course to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>

christians <e> <s> one could have christians who were not qualified as teachers <e> <s> it could be either way round but we would hope to have people who were both teachers and qualified to teach and who were christians <e> <s> that is the obvious situation and quite frankly it is a point that is hardly worth arguing about <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made his point although i have reservations about it <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to my noble friend i think that it would be more accurate to say that faith being the much wider expression covers many denominations

government will support those countries within the united nations that are trying to overcome that exploitation <e>", "<cs> my lords in the presence of my noble friend the chief whip perhaps i may say that i hope he is impressed by the fact that this very important principle has been discussed in only minutes so far <e> <s> i shall take merely a moment or two longer <e> <s> i am very disappointed by the reply of my noble friend although i thank him for the trouble he has taken <e> <s> i find that he has dressed up the same arguments or most of the arguments put forward by my noble friend lady hooper at committee stage but he has done so in more subfusc clothing <e> <s> i am very disappointed indeed that he does not even suggest as i hinted he might that there should be power taken in the bill to exempt special schools from the prohibition of opting out <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly support my noble friend lord thorneycroft especially on the need to provide for people of different faiths other than the christian faith <e> <s> i add just a few comments which relate to the handling of this matter from now on <e> <s> the government and the right reverend prelate have tabled scores of amendments dealing with religion and other matters have been tabled by the government too <e> <s> we welcome the right reverend prelates amendments and even more his willingness to consider whether they can be improved in order to meet the points which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords before the right reverend prelate sits down can be tell us whether when we come to the meeting on wednesday he will be able to <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether he would agree that although a week between the report and third reading stages is customary when we have legislation of such length with a vast number of complex amendments which alter the whole structure of the bill some controversial and many leading to requests for further improvement the one-week rule does not cover the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble and learned friend who i believe will reply to the amendment will regard it sympathetically <e> <s> of course we know that there are famous cases as mentioned by my noble friend lady faithfull where people with great handicaps have been most successful academically <e> <s> i happen to have been taught by a blind tutor at oxford <e> <s> he had great difficulty in achieving what he did and it was only because his elder sister was able to make up for his lack of sight that he managed to get a first and subsequently became of a fellow of balliol <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i did not speak on the matter in committee <e> <s> i concede that there is something a little unusual in that we very rarely legislate in such a way as to say that something shall not be discouraged <e> <s> but in the circumstances of this case i think that it is the right phraseology strange as it may seem <e> <s> we know that our universities have been built up since the earliest times through the generosity either of individuals or as is more likely these days of companies and various institutions <e> <s> it would be a great tragedy to do anything which would prevent that money from coming forward <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may say that i am most grateful to the noble lord lord carter and the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth for their support of these amendments <e> <s> i hope that they are as impressed as i am with the answer which my noble friend gave from the front bench <e> <s> i am completely reassured that the government are seized of these important issues <e> <s> i was interested by what the minister told us of all that the government have already done and are proposing shall he done <e> <s> convinced as i am therefore by the reply which we have had beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is a splendid concession but of course a resourceful and determined person could drive a coach and horses through it <e> <s> indeed anyone who had a motor vehicle of any kind might wish to have been included in it <e> <s> i suppose that there is quite a number of vagrant people with old jalopies as their only residence who would claim that they have as good a case for consideration as other people <e> <s> therefore one wonders whether the words <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i ask him whether he is not stretching the words of his amendment a little far <e> <s> it is only the residential boat which is specifically mentioned as something which is designed or adapted for human habitation <e> <s> it seems to me that if someone has a motor vehicle of almost any kind and he has no fixed abode and that <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the point that the noble lord is trying to make but paragraph c in amendment no <e> <s> which is the main amendment to which he is addressing his mind leaves itself open to varied interpretations <e> <s> the expression wholly or mainly can be quite easily interpreted by registration officers in different ways <e> <s> there is also the expression sole or main residence <e> <s> sole residence gives rise to no problem at all but main residence can have different interpretations according to different opinions <e> <s> while i appreciate the point that the noble lord is trying to make in human terms it is worth making i have some doubt whether the solution he proposes would be administratively workable <e>", "<cs> my lords when the data protection act came before us some years ago my recollection is that the kind of protection that it was intended to give was not the kind of protection which the noble lord seeks in this case <e> <s> when the data protection act was <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage my noble friend lord caithness introduced some fairly lengthy amendments on scottish law which are now to be found in schedule <e> <s> he explained to us that many of the amendments were intended to achieve harmonisation between the laws north and south of the border <e> <s> i find it a little surprising that we should have on this matter not harmonisation but something quite in conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not claim to have mastered the technicalities of this matter to the extent to which the noble lord lord mcintosh appears to have done <e> <s> however i should be grateful if my noble friend lord caithness when replying could explain this <e> <s> undoubtedly originally the attachment of earnings orders under the act which i remember so well in another place because i helped to pilot that through standing committee and report stage referred only to earnings <e> <s> i wonder whether there is any precedent for enabling the attachment of earnings order so-called or an order analogous to it to be applied to any kind of income or income support which are not earnings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am following his argument and it seems to me that it does not lead to his moving this amendment which applies to the use of the order for the attachment of earnings procedure <e> <s> quite rightly it suggests that it should not be applied to social security entitlement <e> <s> the statement by my noble friend lord caithness has made it perfectly clear that that is not the procedure which is being used but what he described as a parallel procedure <e> <s> the amendment seems to be quite irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of our discussion on the earlier amendment on which there was a vote just now amendment no <e> <s> it may help the noble lord lord mcintosh to realise that if he looks at amendment no <e> <s> he will see that the attachment of earnings and deductions from income support are separate remedies <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend rises to reply perhaps i may briefly introduce one or two thoughts which have not so far been mentioned <e> <s> in his strong and convincing arguments in moving the debate my noble friend lord sandford mentioned that from experience at mencap that one could demonstrate that the present system which must be our starting point in all this is not satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving this figure my noble friend has made the assumption that the total non-mandatory relief to charities so far and the relief <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend resisted an earlier amendment because of the cost to public funds <e> <s> before resisting this amendment i suggest that he gives further thought to the effect on the balance of payments to which our bloodstock industry contributes many millions of pounds a year <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down agriculture makes a contribution to our balance of payments by exporting overseas and is therefore in a position no different from the bloodstock industry which does the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish also to support my noble friend lord selkirk <e> <s> perhaps i should make a confession to your lordships before i go any further <e> <s> the committee on the preparation of legislation of which i was chairman recommended that principles should be stated in the clauses of bills but that if it was necessary to add much detail that detail should go into schedules <e> <s> let us examine this schedule for a moment <e> <s> it consists of pages of amendments to previous law <e> <s> the extraordinary thing is that most of those pages and all of the ten-and-a-half pages relating to scotland were introduced late in the committee stage of the bill in this house the bill having taken months to go through the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether in considering this matter further he would bear in mind that ministers are responsible for the contents of bills and that they are not entitled to rely upon the professional judgment of the draftsmen as mentioned by my noble friend lord hesketh <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend accept that the home office has a long-established and well justified reputation for impartiality and fairness qualities which it has displayed within its responsibility for broadcasting <e> <s> would it not be better to allow it to continue to exercise that responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords owing to the rapid progress which i am happy to say your lordships are making this amendment finds me arriving rather out of breath but should like to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to support this amendment <e> <s> those of your lordships who took part in the proceedings on the bill will remember that at that time we all realised that provision for those needing special education was very uneven in all the various parts of the country <e> <s> however we assumed and i think that the act was based on this assumption that eventually all would he well and that there would he opportunities for special education of various kinds before many years passed <e> <s> seven years have passed since then and the provision is still alas very uneven especially with regard to speech therapy if i may say so in passing <e>", "<cs> my lords the only difficulty about that is that if my noble friend replies now under our rules of procedure and our very proper practice those of us who have anything to say now would not have the chance to say it later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the correction <e> <s> i welcome the prospect of hearing my noble friend now <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say not surprisingly that we have had most carefully considered speeches from your lordships and from the noble baroness with very strong reasons expressed so clearly in each speech <e> <s> i have no wish to repeat anything that my noble friend lord sandford said or that i said on report <e> <s> however perhaps i may just remind your lordships that on report i said that i was influenced by the cost <e> <s> i then said that i would not support an amendment which cost million but i would support one which cost million <e> <s> we are in a rather similar position now <e>", "<cs> my lords though i do not accept the explanation that my noble friend has been advised to give this is but a small drafting amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> what i wish to say is only just off the point covered by this amendment and dealt with by my noble friend <e> <s> i can imagine circumstances in which the police might feel that in order to catch somebody who has been using firearms they should have the right to follow that person into any premises where there is reason to believe that firearms are kept and that they are already concerned in the commission of an offence elsewhere <e> <s> there may be other weapons <e> <s> perhaps between now and the report stage my noble friend will consider whether the present powers are adequate to allow the police to enter for what is virtually crime prevention in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> in making his impassioned speech against harassment i have an open mind about the pronunciation the noble lord lord mcintosh of <e>", "<cs> when he says that the noble lord is pointing to the inadequacies of the present law rather than to any inadequacies in the bill <e>", "<cs> i agree with the explanation given by my noble friend but i should be grateful for clarification <e> <s> he pointed out rightly that amendment no <e> <s> does not give an indication of the nature of the rent that would be registered but assummes that it would be a market rent <e> <s> under clause to which he referred which deals with the determination of rent by a rent assessment committee various factors are mentioned which have to be borne in mind and applied by the rent assessment committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord answers that question i wonder whether he can explain this point <e> <s> why is it that in subsection of his amendment the landlord is given the opportunity of making an application when a period of nearly two years has expired but the tenant is given no such opportunity <e>", "<cs> at first sight i was attracted by the amendment but on further thought i am not sure that we should acccept it with great respect to the noble lord <e> <s> admittedly it is now unusual but in the last century there were especially in the north of england and the midlands rows of terraced houses built with practically no garden attached <e> <s> there is sometimes a path or tiny yard at the back of a house and the local authorities or the private landlord as the case may be managed to arrange that there were strips of land to go with each house <e>", "<cs> there is a further point which was just touched upon by my noble friend lady gardner of parkes that is garages <e> <s> sometimes with quite modern houses a group of houses is built with garages placed quite separately <e> <s> there is an example of that just across the river and it is a situation which we should also envisage <e>", "<cs> would it not be a good thing if we were now to hear what my noble friend lord caithness has to say about this rather conflicting argument <e>", "<cs> it is not disclosure of the argument but of the facts in support of it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh has a good point here <e> <s> i am not absolutely certain that it is necessary to specify that the particulars may or should be given <e> <s> however i think that it is a wise precaution <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends on the front bench will regard this sympathetically <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is worth pointing out if somewhat briefly that subsection of the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> fills an important gap in our law <e> <s> indeed it makes a considerable addition to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the objections which have been raised to the commons amendments could mostly be raised also against clause as it stands <e> <s> clause is incidentally if i may say so in passing a mind-bending piece of drafting <e> <s> we are faced with a choice of evils <e> <s> the clause was not entirely satisfactory as it stood <e> <s> one must accept that there are difficulties about the position that will arise if the commons amendment is accepted <e> <s> we are faced with a choice of evils <e> <s> but i prefer the commons amendment and consider it a lesser evil <e> <s> after all if it is to be accepted in principle that the statement of a witness may be read in court because he would be in fear of giving evidence it seems to matter scarcely at all in principle whether or not he is present in court <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must have misheard me <e> <s> i said in passing that clause as a whole was a mind-bending piece of drafting <e> <s> but the argument which i used in favour of the commons amendment was related simply to the commons amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although my noble friend has said that this is merely a drafting matter there is a drafting point to which i wish to draw attention in the hope that in future the same mistake will not be made again <e> <s> in amendment no <e> <s> we find that subject to rules of court we are going to legislate to the effect that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not tabled any motion relating to these amendments and therefore as i understand it there is nothing we can do but accept these commons amendments <e> <s> i should have thought from my rather quick attempt to assimilate them that they were sound and in accordance with what we would have wished had we thought of them when the bill was before us <e>", "<cs> my lords surely we should agree with this new clause <e> <s> however in the last line of subsection as printed in the marshalled list we find the unusual word midifications <e> <s> i do not know whether that is an instruction to those concerned to pursue a middle way or whether it has something to do with followng the advice of the alliance but i think that it is necessary to have the word corrected to modifications <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have my mind on the point <e> <s> i wish to make a comment with regard to amendment no <e> <s> which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assist the noble lord <e> <s> in england i cannot speak to the law in scotland it is a criminal offence but one which is triable only summarily if i remember aright <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord morton of shuna is just as lucid and persuasive when he is speaking from the back benches as when he is speaking from his position on the front bench i cannot think that there was no room for him to speak from the opposition front bench on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so <e> <s> in my ignorance i fail to understand that <e> <s> the noble lord is not criticising the commons amendment so far as it goes <e> <s> he is merely trying to add to it but trying in a way that i find rather unusual <e> <s> the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i see a difficulty <e> <s> if the words beyond reasonable doubt are not included it would mean that the secretary of state would merely have to consider whether <e>", "<cs> my lords we are invited to make a considerable addition to the commons amendment which we have already welcomed namely the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> although i appreciate the desires of the noble and learned lord i seriously wonder whether the amendment he has tabled is either necessary or altogether sound in the way in which it is expressed <e> <s> it starts off by saying quite naturally and properly that <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether she could clarify this point on the obligation to which she has referred with regard to homeless people <e> <s> i understand that the local authorities are obliged by statute to provide immediately temporary accommodation for the homeless <e> <s> however then the homeless go on to housing lists and have to wait their turn on housing lists before they can move from temporary to permanent accommodation <e> <s> is that not right <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble lord for not having been here at the beginning of his speech introducing these amendments <e> <s> however i have read the amendments and i heard the last part of his speech <e> <s> therefore i hope that i may be forgiven for what i am about to say <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should declare a contingent interest <e> <s> although the family property to which i shall refer is in scotland and part i of the bill does not refer to scotland i am very much afraid that if this amendment is accepted it will create a precedent for scottish law which i believe would be unwelcome <e>", "<cs> that may be the motive behind the amendment but i am speaking of the effect of the amendment which is as i have said <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not accept this amendment because it is quite unnecessary <e> <s> housing authorities have powers to appoint whatever officers are needed to fulfil their statutory obligations <e> <s> if we accept this amendment it is purely administrative and we shall create a precedent <e> <s> the statute book will be cluttered up with one section after another in acts of parliament placing responsibilities on local authorities and telling them to appoint officers to fulfil those duties <e> <s> i hesitate to use the word in the courtesies of the committee but frankly this would be ridiculous <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if mercifully this object does not land on westminster it might nevertheless land in an important farming area <e> <s> is he aware that a report of the agriculture select committee of another place published today contains advice both critical and constructive as regards our handling of the chernobyl incident and its effect on farming <e> <s> can the minister confirm that if there should be this kind of mishap in a farming area the advice of the select committee will be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords i voted for the amendment of the noble baroness lady robson when it was previously before us <e> <s> i did so in the spirit which i think nearly all of your lordships on all sides of the house show when they are asking the commons to think again about a bill we have received from there <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down in view of what he said i think that i should point out that there is a material misprint on the marshalled list against the reason numbered <e> <s> instead of reading that <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to have got on to amendment no <e> <s> b and we even heard amendment no <e> <s> being mentioned <e> <s> perhaps i may point out that amendment no <e> <s> b is not an amendment to the bill <e> <s> it is an amendment to a government motion <e> <s> an amendment to the government motion can have no legislative effect whatsoever <e> <s> from a legislative point of view it is merely a protest it is not an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the worst cause of pollution has been the th <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside the merits or otherwise of the film does my noble friend acknowledge that we are primarily a christian country with separately established churches in different parts of the kingdom and that the queen is defender of the faith <e> <s> will he give an assurance that in this matter the government will rise to the occasion and themselves be defenders of the faith <e>", "<cs> quite apart from the merits of the detail which have been well-argued by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway i should particularly regret the passing of the first of these amendments on the marshalled list because it would remove from the bill words which plainly declare the intention of parliament regarding this part of the bill <e> <s> some of us spend some time clamouring for the intention of parliament to be clearly stated and here we have it most beautifully clearly stated <e> <s> however the noble lord on the opposition side wants those words to be left out <e> <s> that would be very regrettable <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may congratulate him on allowing those words to stand <e> <s> the fact that they are to be allowed to stand indicates that there seems to be no difference between us as to the main purpose of part iv of the bill <e> <s> so be it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down has he borne in mind in making those interesting remarks that this part of the bill applies only to secure tenants <e>", "<cs> is it not unthinkable that a public sector landlord would part with houses or with land on which houses might be built without receiving a proper consideration <e> <s> even if the houses are as the noble lord suggested might be the case in some areas in a dilapidated state and costly to the local authority i should have thought that the district auditor quite apart from the secretary of state the ratepayers or anyone else would have something to say if an adequate consideration is not paid <e>", "<cs> i take the point about replacement value although i did not specifically mention it <e> <s> however even where property is sold below the original cost because of circumstances which have caused a decline councils must still receive an adequate consideration in spite of what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the problem to which my noble friend has drawn attention <e> <s> subject to the use of the expression fee simple estate it is solved by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the replacement of the word freehold by the words fee simple estate does not help him to solve his problem <e> <s> it might be unfair to press my noble friend on this matter at the moment because he may wish to take further advice <e>", "<cs> why pay lawyers to unravel things when a word such as freehold can be used which does not need to be unravelled by lawyers <e>", "<cs> i too should like to express my support for the amendments <e> <s> as my noble friend lord swinfen has said there are many disabled people in this country <e> <s> indeed there was a recent survey carried out the findings of which i must say i find hard to accept claiming that million of us are disabled <e> <s> of course it all depends on what one means by disabled <e> <s> however here we are dealing specifically with the physically disabled <e> <s> it has been acknowledged by parliament in statutes that public authorities have a duty to do what they can to help such people overcome their physical disabilities <e> <s> moreover we have many voluntary organisations working to the same end <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend leaves the point perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> can he say whether that is something which is just hoped and believed that the applicants will do in a way which includes the needs of physically disabled tenants or will there be an obligation to refer to their needs in the course of the statement that will be made <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord carter replies i wonder whether i may draw attention to the following <e> <s> my noble friend has said that guidance given by the housing corporation would be as effective as a statutory provision written into the bill as a result of these amendments <e> <s> speaking for myself i find that rather hard to accept <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment as i believe he will since he has kindly said that he would like to give this matter further consideration perhaps he would bear in mind the paradox which has arisen <e> <s> that is that he as a dedicated socialist is suggesting that money which would often be public money should be paid to <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies perhaps i may say this <e> <s> this is not a branch of the law with which i am familiar <e> <s> there have been times therefore when it has been quite an effort to <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend forgive me for intervening <e> <s> within very strictly defined limits notes on clauses can be helpful in understanding a bill <e>", "<cs> i am sure we all are <e>", "<cs> my lords i should disclose that i am a patron of the greater london association for the disabled and like my noble friend lord campbell of alloway i try on occasions in your lordships house to speak up for the disabled <e> <s> however i am not in favour of the amendment for various reasons some of which my noble friend has expressed <e> <s> there is a fundamental defect in the amendment <e> <s> it would appear to apply to any kind of disability <e> <s> the rather vague words of limitation upon the discretion of the chief officer of police do not resolve that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that these amendments would create uncertainty in circumstances in which parliament after much discussion has decided which lethal weapon shall be prohibited and reasons have been given for that in endless debate <e> <s> the amendments would enable the home secretary to change the law even after all that discussion in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that but i still say that the amendments would create uncertainty for the reasons i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to draw on a personal experience <e> <s> i inherited from my father a german mauser rifle captured from the boers in the south african war <e> <s> this happened for an almost sentimental reason because his name had been carved on the wooden stock <e> <s> i lived with that rifle all my life <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever the noble lord lord mishcon puts before us in a constructive way an idea to do with the law we listen to it with great respect <e> <s> however i wonder whether he is right when he says that the amendment would not upset the generality of the expression no reason <e> <s> i am afraid that it would <e> <s> he has specifically used the words <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have such high learned approval <e> <s> we know from such cases that very often those words are regarded by the courts as words of limitation <e> <s> i am afraid that they might be so regarded on this occasion <e> <s> by specifying those two characteristics it may give them a preponderance in the minds of chief officers and of people who are expressing opinions to them that those are the things that really matter and that other characteristics unhelpful though they may be may not matter so much <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat puzzled by this amendment <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord swansea would be able to give me an immediate answer without breaking the rules of the house <e> <s> i should have thought that every firearms dealer necessarily occupied premises that were rated for business purposes <e> <s> i may be wrong about that but if not it is something that puzzles me <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not present in committee <e> <s> when i first read the amendment it seemed rather attractive but on further thought i came to a different conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords there must be an age limit and therefore i would not be in favour of amendments nos <e> <s> or <e> <s> the important question is what the age limit should be <e> <s> i think that is more realistic <e> <s> after all many of us in the chamber learnt in the otc to shoot with lee enfield <e> <s> rifles <e>

learnt to shoot in the army cadet force at the age of to come home in the easter holidays and find that the law prevents them from shooting rooks with a rifle seems to be quite absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may have the leave of the house to put to my noble friend a point which follows that raised by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> let us take the case of two boys aged who are in the army cadet corps at the same school <e> <s> one boy goes to his own home where he has a firearms certificate <e> <s> his friend is invited to stay for part of the holidays <e> <s> he does not have a firearms certificate <e> <s> they have both learnt to use a rifle in the army cadet corps at school <e> <s> it seems extraordinary that the visitor cannot borrow a rifle to shoot for example rooks <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of what is going to be fair <e> <s> my understanding is that the government are proposing that the person surrendering his rifle should have a choice between a flat rate of which will cover many cases or if it is preferred be paid per cent <e> <s> of the average retail value that prevailed before rd september last year <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is less objectionable than that which was proposed in committee <e> <s> i think that what is proposed is still without precedent <e> <s> if it is accepted it would create an unwelcome precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope this amendment will not be accepted <e> <s> the work of the committee will be at its most intense during its first second or third year <e> <s> after that if the work is done properly it should become less onerous <e> <s> it would be absurd to have the committee carry on indefinitely when its main purpose had been achieved and it had really very little left to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should be chary of extending the affirmative resolution procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that since it has been the governments policy and they have done something about it to get mentally handicapped people out of long-stay hospitals <e> <s> is he further aware that the most satisfactory means of achieving that is to enable the voluntary associations such as mencap to set up small establishments where those people can be looked after as part of the community <e> <s> can he say to what extent the government are helping in the pursuit of that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord caithness has been so splendid in dealing with the hundreds of amendments to this bill in committee and on report that i am very reluctant to make the points which i am about to make more especially as the noble lord lord coleraine with all his professional expertise has revealed that he more or less understands this new schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords have not local authorities two responsibilities <e> <s> one is to clean up the public places in their own districts <e> <s> the other is to institute prosecutions under the litter act <e> <s> can the minister say to what extent local authorities are being reasonably zealous on the latter point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving way <e> <s> this is an interesting point and quite a difficult one <e> <s> however has it occurred to the noble lord that he is giving the courts the power to confiscate property in other words a weapon or weapons in this case even though as a result of their inquiry they have not come to any conclusion against the person concerned showing that he was in any way to blame <e> <s> is that right <e> <s> it is not in accordance with our usual sense of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with these amendments as i indicated on report <e> <s> of course they were then in a slightly different form and were moved by one of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene on the point he has just made <e> <s> he is suggesting that the bill should go in for a large amount of defining detail as to the kind of premises to which the clause should refer <e> <s> would that not be an excess of zeal on our part as legislators <e> <s> is it not better that the clause should be drafted as it is in the form of private premises <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion i earnestly hope that my noble friend will not accept the amendments <e> <s> first i do not consider that they are necessary because the functions are already widely described and secondly i am afraid that the amendments especially amendment no <e> <s> may cause confusion <e>

knowledge of the law <e> <s> he did not seem to be handicapped in that area <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> last week they said there were <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the supplementary question asked by my noble friend lord orr-ewing is my noble friend the minister aware that under the common law all citizens had a <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure us that the contents of the bill will not be decided upon by the government until the white paper has been fully discussed in both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a few minutes in hand and i shall be grateful if noble lords will bear with me while i make one point that is relevant to the debate <e> <s> i apologise for my late arrival which was due to my involvement with a charity of which i am a patron <e> <s> it was important that i should be there <e>", "<cs> my lords who is responsible for the introduction and how is the cost to be borne <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some of our great museums and art galleries have vast numbers of treasures stored underground which are never seen by the public <e> <s> should not the opportunity presented by museums year be taken to do something about that perhaps following the excellent example of her majesty in allowing some of those treasures to be shown outside london <e>", "<cs> the observations of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale have enabled me to shorten my own remarks because i agree with what he said <e> <s> i simply add this <e> <s> the relevant words in the bill are as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords might it help to allay anxiety and recreate demand even in a small way if i ask my noble friend whether she is aware that i was one of the sufferers from salmonella in your lordships house last summer that being an octogenarian i am technically elderly and that i have eaten eggs every single day since i recovered without any further ill effects <e> <s> has there not been gross overreaction in this matter <e>", "<cs> with deep respect to the noble baroness lady david i hope that my noble friends will not accept this amendment <e> <s> the idea behind it so far as i have been able to understand is that the child should have the last word <e> <s> i do not think that the child should be allowed to shift the responsibility on to itself and that the courts should accept that proposition <e> <s> after all there are children and children <e> <s> some children are sincere and good others may be highly motivated in an undesirable way <e> <s> the wishes and feelings of the child even if it has sufficient understanding to make an informed decision about the issue should not be the only consideration <e> <s> this amendment i fear would make it so <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great attention and interest to both the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and my noble and learned friend <e> <s> if the words that the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale wishes to have left out are to be kept in the bill then the amendment of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor should be made <e> <s> i ask my noble and learned friend to consider whether it is desirable that in effect the court should have only the responsibility laid upon it by subsection in opposed cases <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale said the court should be entitled but not necessarily obliged in a suitable case to take note of matters on its own motion <e> <s> bearing in mind the special responsibility that the court has always had in any case involving children and young people to place these words of limitation upon the discretion of the court may not be right <e>", "<cs> i believe that this bill is far better drafted than most of the bills that we have had in recent years <e> <s> if there is a misunderstanding it is one which seems to be shared by several members of the committee in which case the drafting needs to be looked at again <e> <s> whatever decision the committee may take at this stage i hope that my noble and learned friend will consider what has been said <e> <s> he has made the intention at which he is aiming abundantly clear <e> <s> i ask him to consider whether the inclusion of these words that the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale wishes to have left out clarifies that intention or the reverse <e>", "<cs> is there not the further point that an emergency order is essentially an interim matter <e> <s> there is no finality about it <e> <s> it is something that must be done and done quickly <e> <s> the governing words are in clause which says that the court must be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is likely to suffer significant harm <e> <s> it then sets out conditions about accommodation and place <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has said that is quite a different issue from the one which the court will have to decide under clause which involves as he described it going through a stringent checklist <e> <s> it is quite different <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> if there were to be rules of court i do not see how they could avoid repeating the checklist in clause <e> <s> i do not think that provisions for rules of court could add very much to what is already in the bill <e>", "<cs> although i hope that the subsection will not be omitted i think that the noble lord lord kilbracken has done a valuable service in giving us the opportunity to discuss it <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down i wonder whether he would be so kind as to clarify one point <e> <s> he has made it clear that the mother and the natural father could each have parental responsibility <e> <s> could the stepfather also have parental responsibility bearing in mind that he may have statutory responsibilities with regard to the maintenance of the child <e>", "<cs> so three people could be sharing parental responsibility is that right <e>", "<cs> the noble lady has raised a point that i must confess i had never thought of <e> <s> i welcome the amendment because as it stands the clause contains a contradiction in terms and can lead to confusion <e> <s> let us suppose we have parental responsibility shared by three people <e> <s> this has been made clear by my noble and learned friend on previous occasions <e> <s> let us suppose that one of them not all of them the subsection refers to <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble and learned friend for this clarification <e> <s> i had not looked at the matter in this way <e> <s> it is usual for parents who send children away to school to employ people <e> <s> to the extent that it is done the child is in the care temporarily from time to time of the person meeting the responsibility <e> <s> may we assume that when that arrangement is made and i use the concept of the subsection <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend kindly confirm that the person who has been asked to undertake the responsibility for a time has no responsibility to the court <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i do not think that his amendment should be accepted <e> <s> on a previous amendment my argument was invalidated by my failure to consult the report of the law commission <e> <s> i have now armed myself with a copy which means that my speeches will be more accurate and may be a little longer <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has invited my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to find a substitute in ordinary english for the term guardian ad litem might i hazard the suggestion that guardian for the case might be suitable <e>", "<cs> although i appreciate the motives of the noble lord lord meston in moving this amendment and indeed the motive underlying the next amendment i believe that we should bear in mind that under subsection the court is given a discretion to take account of the matters mentioned in paragraphs a and b <e> <s> in exercising that discretion there will be a very wide range of matters which according to the circumstances of the case the court may have to consider <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord lord meston and to my noble friend i doubt whether they are doing either what is wise or necessary in going into the further details which they suggest <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will stand by the answer which he has already given <e> <s> the noble lord lord irvine and the noble lord lord morton suggested that these particular details should be added to the discretion of the court <e> <s> that is already stated in the subsection in broad terms <e> <s> would it not get us into the difficulty and here i can most conveniently shorten my remarks by using a latin phrase of <e>", "<cs> this amendment is i think a convenient moment to say that clause of the bill is a most excellent and helpful piece of drafting <e> <s> it is always to our advantage to have definitions especially of new phrases brought to our attention as soon as they are going to become operative within the bill <e> <s> subsection is ideal <e> <s> it is very helpful indeed to have the enactments concerned listed clearly as they are here instead of being stuck away in a schedule as they sometimes are <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> it is surely right as the noble lord lord meston has said that the other person or persons with parental responsibility should be given proper notice of what is to happen or may happen <e> <s> i agree with the motive described in the amendment <e> <s> but how is it to be carried out <e> <s> such matters would normally go into rules of court <e> <s> we have already passed the point at clause at which rules of court may be made for various purposes <e> <s> i should have thought that this is the detail which would be better dealt with in rules of court than in the primary legislation <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that clause b is included in the bill <e> <s> it requires the consent of every person named in the order to be obtained and i find that a strange prohibition <e> <s> i do not believe that the situation will be improved by the amendment <e> <s> with or without the amendment the provision must he reconsidered <e>", "<cs> arising out of what my noble and learned friend has said and i am sure we are all very grateful to him for his clarification of the policy i am nevertheless a little puzzled and i wonder whether i might ask him this <e> <s> i see the reason for not requiring the consent of the child because it may be that the court considers that the child can be helped by the intervention of a probation officer <e> <s> but supposing the parent the guardian or the person with whom the child is living is also named in the order and just cannot get on with the probation officer and may have had previous experience of the probation officer the help it is intended to give the child could be frustrated by the refusal of consent by the parent guardian or person with whom the child is living <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway deserves credit for his initiative in raising this important matter and for the trouble he has taken to think out a scheme and to draft a new clause <e>", "<cs> although i appreciate the motives of the noble baroness we must bear in mind that there are occasions when children have their own means <e> <s> they may have money which arose under a will and which is held in trust for them <e> <s> their parents may have provided for them <e> <s> a voluntary society may be caring for them <e> <s> we are concerned with public money and it would be wrong for the committee to ignore any other income that a child may have <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried that the definition proposed by my noble friend is too narrow <e> <s> he proposes that there shall be omitted from the clause most of the present definition of disabled <e>", "<cs> it is with great temerity that i ever differ from my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> however the difficulty about imposing an obligation upon local authorities in regard to the various duties which are covered in the relevant subsections is that financial resources are required for performing each of them <e>", "<cs> i hope i did not give the impression that it was merely a question of finance <e> <s> of course finance is vital but with the best will in the world premises have to be found and equipped staff have to be found and sometimes to be trained <e> <s> eventually those things get done but inevitably occasionally and i speak from experience there is delay while such things are done and while the resources are found <e> <s> therefore in order to cover such a situation i think that it is better to leave the bill as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply but is he aware that it is more than marginally unsatisfactory <e> <s> does he accept that the action of district health authorities in cutting family planning services in recent years is contrary to statute and is causing unwanted pregnancies and more abortions <e> <s> when will the government face up to their responsibilities for ensuring that that section of the law is complied with <e>", "<cs> i too am in favour of this amendment but i am not in favour of the exception created by subsection c where foster parents are already looking after the child <e> <s> to make that exception appears to me to be wrong <e> <s> we are perpetuating a wrong <e> <s> i listened to what the noble baroness lady david said and i did not think that the reasons she gave justified making that exception <e>", "<cs> having spoken in support of the noble baronesss amendment and having heard what has been said by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor i should like to make a plea to her <e> <s> a good deal of what was said by my noble and learned friend was not familiar to me and it must affect my judgment on the details of her amendment <e> <s> therefore it would be better to consider the issue further and not be pressed to take a decision now <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a real pleasure as well as an honour to congratulate the noble and learned lord lord goff of chieveley on his maiden speech <e> <s> law lords do not always feel free to speak in our debates as often as we should like to hear them <e> <s> however in congratulating the noble and learned lord on this occasion i am sure that all noble lords will join with me in saying that we hope there will be many chances to hear him in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> there have been speeches five in favour of the change and against i am sorry five in favour and five against <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that those over are now a very large age group in our community <e> <s> these are the days of young old people <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord wishes to make the bench as representative as possible he should have a fair proportion of these old people as magistrates <e>", "<cs> i do not dissent from the amendment moved by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> however it is a little difficult to fit it into subsection <e> <s> it defines voluntary homes and then states that the expression does not include and it lists a number of exclusions <e> <s> the first one is described as a <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to my noble and learned friend especially for drawing my attention to the definitions in clause <e> <s> he is attempting to dovetail his new definition which affects children as he says with what is already in the registered homes act <e> <s> that makes the position perfectly clear <e> <s> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who represented oliver cromwells constituency for years and he represented it for about eight years may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that oliver cromwell as a member of parliament was trying to ride roughshod over parliamentary procedures in defending parliament on the battlefield <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments intention which my noble friend has expressed in answer to this question <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that according to the definition which has applied for many years in our country the largest group of disabled people here are those who suffer from mental handicap <e> <s> within this international <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington said will be the subject of discussion in committee <e> <s> i dare say that like me many noble lords were surprised to hear him say that the bill is not a liberalising measure <e> <s> it clearly is a liberalising measure because it does away with the catch-all provisions of section of the act and <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that i have not been a spectator at a first-class football match since attending the cup final at wembley about years ago <e> <s> moreover i have not taken part in the proceedings on this bill until this moment and therefore i hope the committee will agree that i approach this amendment with a fresh and open mind <e>", "<cs> that is a matter of opinion <e> <s> i am judging by the operation of the democratic process by which we vote with our feet in both houses <e>", "<cs> with great respect i do not think that statement is accurate <e> <s> it pays little regard to the excellent speeches made by my noble friends on the front bench <e>", "<cs> matches in which scottish teams play in england are covered by this scheme as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords on that matter would not a small but modest increase in bureaucracy be well justified if fewer offences were committed with firearms <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand that it is the governments policy to reduce their powers in general while increasing their powers over the legal profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i was away at the report stage so i was interested to hear the previous speeches today with which i broadly agree and therefore i shall not repeat what has been said <e> <s> we should be grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for going as far as he has <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is important in that context and i am surprised that it was not grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down could he answer my suggestion that parliamentary counsel should be told in effect that parliament has disapproved of that gambit of modify or repeal <e> <s> we hope

shock to your lordships to hear that i wish to support the noble lord lord kilbracken on this amendment <e> <s> i do not consider that the present definition is in any way felicitous or well drafted

amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel obliged to support the noble lord lord mishcon in what he has just said <e> <s> i have had a great deal of experience of many kinds of disabled children and especially the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i believe that this is not placing a strong enough obligation upon the local authority <e> <s> i wish to see this amendment which is welcome up to a point

authorised person may be <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that people would be able to enjoy better weather for their easter holiday generally speaking in the first half of april than is likely in the last week of march <e> <s> is he also aware that although one accepts the view expressed by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter about the importance of easter as a sacred christian festival nevertheless the christian churches have disagreed on various matters throughout their history without ceasing to be good christians <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for answering many more questions than i asked <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us where brought up to believe that white bread was not very beneficial to health but that wholemeal bread was the best <e> <s> is that a view that is accepted by her department <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a matter in which prevention is better than cure <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has as always put his case before us with persuasion and clarity but i confess that i am not convinced by his arguments <e> <s> indeed i feel that they contain as did the arguments of the noble lord lord jenkins several fallacies of which the committee may wish to take note <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can set at rest some of the fears expressed by my noble friend lord dacre of glanton <e> <s> let us take the lecture that he mentioned or any lecture that he may wish to give in the future <e> <s> within the terms of the clause all that he has to do is obtain lawful authority <e> <s> on the wording of the clause which relates to the disclosure of any information and so on i wish to remind the committee that we were taught and the knowledge of the noble lord in this respect must be far greater than mine derived as it was from only six years experience in the army during the war that security consisted in building up a big picture from a very large number of small pieces <e> <s> any little piece of information could add considerably to the picture <e> <s> there were many little bits of information which <e>", "<cs> at first sight that is a very fair point for the noble lord to have made <e> <s> however we are not dealing here with damage to defence <e> <s> i can well see that in relation to defence disclosure which was potentially damaging can be just as dangerous as disclosure which did in fact damage <e> <s> but in relation to security surely this is not a distinction which ought to be made bearing in mind that all information relating to security is potentially important <e>", "<cs> again a very fair point has been made which deserves an answer <e> <s> i doubt whether i am qualified to answer except to say that that is not a reference to subsection to which this amendment refers <e> <s> perhaps one of my noble friends on the front bench can explain why in subsection we refer to <e>", "<cs> i am sure that this is not intended to be a wrecking amendment <e> <s> indeed the noble lord has given his sincere reasons for moving it <e> <s> however it seems to me that this amendment overlooks the fact that the whole purpose of notification is to bring within the scope of subsection those people who are not members of the intelligence and security services but whom may have helped those services in obtaining valuable information or who may quite by chance have been instrumental in providing it <e> <s> to say that it therefore shall not apply to such people defeats the purpose of the notification procedure <e> <s> i should have thought that this amendment harmless though it would seem to be is something that we should not accept <e>", "<cs> this amendment is not entirely unreasonably i grant that <e>", "<cs> it is harmless and quite unnecessary <e> <s> it would merely increase the administrative effort that will lie behind the administration of this notification procedure <e> <s> the last few words of subsection say <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would consider that if one inserts four years that is likely to become the norm and in practice it will destroy the flexibility already in the clause <e> <s> there may be many cases in which the notification could be revoked well before the four years but people might say well it has to be reconsidered anyway in four years <e> <s> let it stand for four years and then we shall see <e> <s> is it not better to have the flexibility in the bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can set the noble lords mind at rest <e> <s> i shall try to do so <e> <s> even if the prosecution does not have to prove that an activity was lawful if it transpired either in the course of considering the case for trial or after the trial began that the so-called breach of security arose out of an unlawful activity is it not unthinkable that the prosecution could proceed <e> <s> further if the case came somehow before the high court for judicial review and in the course of its investigation it was found that the problem arose from an unlawful activity that also would be an end of the case <e>", "<cs> i do not think a judge would behave like that <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord hutchinson on the first two amendments to which he referred although i cannot support him in his reasons for proposing the third amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> clause a is very broadly drawn indeed <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord hutchinson replies or the noble lord lord mishcon gives us the advantage of his wisdom on the matter perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> i fully accept the motive which the government have in mind as described by my noble friend <e> <s> as he rightly said confidences in international relations must be protected <e> <s> his object is achieved by the combined effect of subsection a subsection and subsection but i would also include subsection b and subsection <e> <s> i am afraid that i have rather bounced this on to my noble friend <e> <s> i have given him no previous warning of it <e> <s> he may wish to consider this purely as a matter of drafting because that is all it is between now and the report stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that i and he agree entirely <e> <s> i must confess however that i agree with only about two thirds of his argument <e> <s> i was grateful for the extent to which we did agree <e> <s> however i plead with my noble friend lord belstead and with the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> we have had a debate on

we do not have this exactly right <e> <s> i plead with the noble lord lord hutchinson not to press his amendment but to withdraw it <e> <s> i make a further plea to my noble friend lord belstead to take this away as several of us have suggested because it is worth further consideration <e>", "<cs> i can hardly resist taking part in the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord hemingford was once a constituent of mine my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was my best man and the noble lord lord mishcon is claiming me with some dubiety as anally <e> <s> therefore i have no option but to say a few words <e> <s> i believe it is perfectly plain that jeopardises simply means endangers the two words are synonymous and they are meant to be so in the clause <e> <s> to replace that simple proposition

respectfully agree with all that my noble friend has said <e> <s> in the course of his remarks he used the word endangers <e> <s> in the context he clearly meant it as being synonymous with jeopardises <e> <s> i think all jurymen and jurywomen would know what endangers means but there may be some who do not quite understand what jeopardises means <e> <s> therefore it may be for consideration at report stage whether the word jeopardises might be replaced by endangers <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend would care to think about that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has done a service in inviting us to consider this subsection <e> <s> he is right to point out that when a case comes to court the judge would have to direct the jury <e> <s> i must confess that i would not envy the judge and in days gone by i have directed juries in a number of cases in a lower jurisdiction as a recorder and chairman of quarter sessions <e> <s> with this subsection there would be a number of questions of fact which the judge would have to describe to the jury <e> <s> if he were wise he would give a list of them in order to make quite sure that the jurors applied their minds to each of the questions of fact separately and clearly <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly invited us to do it is right therefore that we should decide whether we are asking too much of the judge and jury <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that interjection <e> <s> of course that is so but i should have thought that it was self-evident and the judge would perhaps be wise to mention to the jury that it was self-evident <e>", "<cs> at the end of the subsection we find the words <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord is reasonable in asking my noble friend to consider the drafting of this between now and the report stage <e> <s> i also hope that he will consider one of the points i made but i cannot complain that he did not deal with it <e> <s> in the first line of the subsection we see the words if he discloses <e> <s> we do not know what in the circumstances the word discloses means <e> <s> to whom <e> <s> to his wife <e> <s> to anybody else <e> <s> to a person also in authority <e>

person in the circumstances <e> <s> it is a difficult concept but it is one which as the noble lord lord mishcon was good enough to say has to be covered otherwise there will be a gap in the bill <e>", "<cs> the defence proposed in this amendment overlaps with the public interest defence which was the subject of a long discussion at the opening of our committee stage <e> <s> this amendment can be dealt with more shortly because it provides a defence for a person charged with an offence under this bill <e> <s> however the offences under this bill are limited to offences relating to security and intelligence defence international relations and crime and special investigation powers and some ancillary offences which arise out of those principal offences <e>", "<cs> in spite of what the noble lord lord hutchinson has said i hope that the government will not accept the amendment <e> <s> the definition as it stands has the great advantage of removing any doubt as to whether parting with possession amounts to disclosure <e> <s> in some circumstances it could amount to disclosure <e> <s> therefore i believe that we should keep it in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that other noble lords are glad that the noble and learned lord lord bridge of harwich mentioned the position of the inns of court in our system <e> <s> it is upon the collegiate life of the inns of court

consultation that there has been <e> <s> it is sad that it does not satisfy noble lords opposite <e> <s> surely however we must apply our minds to whether the words and wales should be kept in or left out <e>", "<cs> and the scots <e>", "<cs> my lords that is somewhat extending the issue before your lordships <e> <s> we are concerned whether wales should be treated separately from england <e> <s>

attend any of them <e> <s> there are clubs altogether <e> <s> i should have thought it an act of discrimination against the english if we are to insist on the three welsh clubs being left out <e> <s>

that he used i might have been offended but knowing him as such an old friend it does not worry me one bit <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment deserves consideration again although we touched upon it in committee <e> <s> i should be interested to hear what my noble friend the minister has to say about it <e> <s> i see one or two problems with it <e> <s> first amendment no <e> <s> would as has been pointed out enable international matches at wembley to be excluded from the operation of the scheme <e> <s> we know that for the most part international football matches do not create trouble but as i understand the working of the scheme it is not particular places we had this of course on the last amendment in relation to wales with which we should be so concerned as with who would be attracted to particular places if they were exempt <e> <s> hooligans in one place could easily be attracted to exempted grounds merely because they would then be free to go and make a nuisance of themselves at that ground <e> <s> that point needs to be considered <e> <s> even in relation to international matches we should bear in mind that as i understand it about police officers were considered necessary to protect wembley stadium during the england/holland match last year <e> <s> we must be careful about this although on the face of it the proposal seems reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the speech of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that the noble lord lord harris has raised a very important matter <e> <s> the whole of the scheme is unprecedented <e> <s> it represents a new departure and it is only right that parliament should have the opportunity of seeing how it proceeds <e> <s> in connection with this bill there are a number of occasions six are mentioned in the amendments grouped with amendment no <e> <s> and a further occasion arises from the governments new clause making seven in all on which matters would have to be considered by parliament or parliament at least would have to be given the opportunity to consider them in connection with the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is right parliamentary days <e> <s> if nothing is done within those days the order comes into operation <e> <s> therefore there may be quite a long period before there is any discussion but in the meantime the order is in operation <e> <s> if nothing is done within days the opportunity lapses and the order stands <e>", "<cs> my lords that is interesting <e> <s> that would enable me to curtail my remarks so that we could hear what my noble friend on the front bench had to say <e> <s> that is perhaps the crucial situation <e> <s> i merely repeat that we must be jolly careful about this matter <e> <s> leaving aside the usual prejudices for and against affirmative resolutions according to whether we support the government or are in opposition i believe that this is a matter upon which we should take the governments judgment seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords when we fix a maximum penalty in a bill we do so in order to cover the worst type of case that is likely to arise not the most typical <e> <s> it is rather remarkable that we have here a scheme that will require some sanctions or penalties to make it work <e> <s> the penalties that are placed at various points in the bill are for the most part not very stringent although there is the provision for two years <e> <s> otherwise they are very mild penalties <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the purpose of report stage is to enable matters to be dealt with which were not resolved in committee or did not then arise <e> <s> if it is to become a practice that any decision made in committee can be reconsidered discussed and voted upon at report our business will be seriously delayed <e> <s> with deep respect i believe that to say that the issue was not dealt with in committee is merely a quibble <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting there are any but i should be surprised if there have never been any <e> <s> surely the government cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> first we must remember that it would create an administrative loophole because many women have the same first names as men <e> <s> the names evelyn and robin are used as christian names by both men and women <e> <s> therefore there would be confusion about whether a man or a woman was applying for the card or on whose behalf the application was made <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may declare an interest <e> <s> i have a retirement pension and have had for many years <e> <s> i concede that more weight should be attached to the arguments that have been advanced in favour of this amendment than to some of the previous amendments in which i did not think there was any substance <e> <s> if people are to be exempt but still want to attend football matches they would have to prove that they are exempt <e> <s> old age pensioners do not normally carry cards around with them saying that they are old age pensioners <e> <s> one can obtain a concessionary rail warrant but i can never find mine when i want it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that the noble lord has made a valid but silly point <e> <s> to prevent the minority of undesirable people to whom we have referred as hooligans from entering football grounds we must have the irksome business it is an irksome business of making all those who want to go to football grounds have the right sort of authority to do so <e> <s> i am not sure that old people <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister inform the house to what extent the existing school places are occupied by children of immigrants and how many immigrant children are at present awaiting places in those schools <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever any of my noble friends said at committee stage about the matter

envisaged in this amendment that demand should be limited to inspection <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> if there has been a theft at a football ground and a person who is followed up after he has left the ground gives the police a false name in order to evade his responsibility the fact that he cannot be asked for his card may be a serious impediment to the police in their inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather hope that my noble friends will consider the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that they will wish to accept it in its present form but i believe that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is quite right to suggest that there should be some differentiation in the way in which the sentences for the various offences are described <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> this is all mixed up with what comes into clause <e> <s> i confess that that is what led me astray <e>",

improvement on the one that we had in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps he would care to correct one statement <e> <s> he said that the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth was referring only to civil servants <e> <s> i am not quite certain whether that is so but in any event the amendment refers to those in the security and intelligence services as well <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the same public interest defence stated in plainer terms and indeed in wider terms and leaving the matter much more open for the jury to decide than that rather elaborately defined public interest defence which was the subject of our first discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful not only to my noble friend but also to the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and

the bill will go on to the statute book with an inherent defect <e> <s> that is very unfortunate <e> <s> however i have done my best <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords

civilisation but one cannot have liberty unless one lives in a country that is secure <e> <s> goodness knows in our lifetime and some of us are fairly old we have lived through two of the worst wars in history and have known our country under threat in time of peace as well as in war <e> <s> these days we also have to deal with terrorism <e> <s> while accepting that liberty is a fundamental principle we must realise that liberty becomes a nullity if there is not security <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes a fair point <e> <s> one should bear in mind that at present as he says the land is owned by the water authorities <e> <s> however for the first time we are to have a national authority at any rate for england and wales which is to become a very big owner of what will be and the

noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i have counted the number of pages in the bill dealing with pollution <e> <s> as near as possible there are and a half pages in addition to the control of

experience is that the larger the body the less the responsibility or share of responsibility taken by each individual member of it other than the chairman <e> <s> really seems to me to be far too numerous <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend allow me <e> <s> i cannot have made myself plain <e> <s> i said that i had grave doubts as to whether we should have a representative body but if we had to

government have put it in the bill as they put it into most bills <e> <s> this bill of pages is prolix enough without having to go into that sort of thing which could perfectly well be covered by departmental arrangements short of legislation and the cost of it carried in the ordinary way on the estimates of the department <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> surely it is very important in planning matters that there should be continuity and that when parliament is changing the structure of a public service that nevertheless the planning functions <e>", "<cs> i

this <e> <s> yes i have often said that we should not be selective when there are a number of factors to be borne in mind if we bring out one in particular we are emphasising that at the expense of the others <e> <s> however there is an exception to every rule <e> <s> i say that this particular factor of obtaining a reasonable return on capital makes an exception and one which justifies its being an exception <e>", "<cs> i must agree with my noble friend lord caldecote about the need for continuity in planning arrangements <e> <s> we had a discussion about that last week <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat the argument that i and others put forward <e> <s> the obvious need for continuity is that you do not get adequate protection <e>", "<cs> each of these amendments has approximately the same objective namely to place upon those who are given powers or duties under the bill the obligation of carrying out the powers and duties conferred upon them irrespective of all other factors however important from the public point of view and however unavoidable those factors may be <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i wonder whether my noble friend lord arran would make it clear that in the code of practice there would be a reference not only to the danger of acidification but also to the threat this does not apply everywhere but only in certain circumstances to the availability of water if large conifer plantations are established <e>", "<cs> this amendment overlaps with subsection which it follows <e> <s> if i may say so with respect to the noble lord it does so in a rather confusing way <e> <s> for example he says that the authority must ensure and so must every relevant body <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has done a good service by

river great ouse and at least as far as peterborough in the case of the river nene <e> <s> if so we must bear in mind that the nra will have to assume that responsibility for managing those waters

statutory or otherwise to make representations to a minister <e> <s> indeed if there were to be anything written into a bill although it is quite unthinkable in these circumstances it would be a power to prevent them from doing so <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> the answer to the noble baroness lady seear is that if the secretary of state declined to consider the representations made there would be the most awful political row <e>", "<cs> no we are not <e>", "<cs> the act to which reference is made in this amendment was the one on which the prime minister made her maiden speech in another place when moving the second reading of the bill which became the act <e> <s> therefore i do not know whether members opposite realise that in moving this amendment they might be currying favour with the prime minister <e> <s> that would be quite a good thing for them to do anyway <e>", "<cs> i shall let that point pass <e> <s> i think that the noble lord might regret in view of what i am about to say a suggestion that he might withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the resources which the armed forces now have and will have will enable them to help local authorities in major peacetime disasters <e> <s> the armed forces now have large quantities of transport catering equipment fire fighting and earth moving equipment and so on all of which can be put to good use and good training use in helping local authorities <e> <s> can the minister give us some idea of the freedom that the armed forces will have to give that help <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey would enable the local authorities to share with the secretary of state the responsibility for enforcement <e> <s> at present under clause of the bill it is the secretary of state upon whom that responsibility is firmly placed <e> <s> of course one sympathises with the noble lord lord mcintosh in wishing to help the local authorities because he has had valuable experience on a local authority in the metropolis <e> <s> indeed all of us have had good reason to feel in certain circumstances but not all that local authorities should be given responsibilities and rights in matters which affect local people <e>", "<cs> i hope that it may help noble lords opposite if i say that the noble lord lord mcintosh in moving the amendment dealt with the matter very strictly <e> <s> he pointed out this amendment was intended to operate on clause <e> <s> clause has the very important purpose of enabling the secretary of state to ensure that the companies which are to be the undertakers of water supply in the future abide by the conditions which are attached to their opportunity to do so <e> <s> he did not at the time refer to later clauses clause to but they have come into the picture and i do not complain of that in speeches which have followed <e> <s> but i should have thought that we need to consider clause on its merits and the later clauses on their merits because they have a different purpose <e>", "<cs> for once the noble lord lord mcintosh has a proposal which i find attractive <e> <s> i shall not put it higher than that <e> <s> earlier i complained that the first amendment which we discussed today would have caused duality of responsibility <e> <s> another noble lord said that it caused confusion <e> <s> i am glad that we won the division <e> <s> i think that this is a useful suggestion for avoiding confusion and duality because if i dare mention it prematurely the local authorities have certain responsibilities under clauses to and if they were kept informed of what the minister is doing under clause it might even save some administration <e> <s> i rather hope that one of my noble friends will give a word of encouragement on this matter which is well worth considering <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend be so good as to elaborate a little on what he means by performance <e> <s> i can see the importance of performance in this context but it could mean one of several different things <e> <s> could he explain what he means by the performance of the companies in this context <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment perhaps i may ask my noble friend to seek advice between now and the report stage on an entry which was against the commercial interest of the particular person but which nevertheless would be in the public interest to include in the register <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lady strange <e> <s> i join noble lords opposite in congratulating her on the way she moved the amendment <e> <s> a customer service committee is somewhat analogous to the users consultative committees that were set up under the nationalised industries legislation <e> <s> each of those committees used to publish an annual report <e> <s> there was never any question about it <e> <s> they were required to publish an annual report <e>", "<cs> of course we all want to ensure that we get water supplies of improved quality in the years to come but i must confess that i drink tap water all over the united kingdom and have done so for years without so far any visible ill effects <e> <s> this is important and it is dealt with in clauses and <e> <s> the side note to clause states <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i wonder whether it would help if i point out that it is clear from the terms of the subsection made even clearer by the statement of my noble friend lord hesketh that the regulations will not prescribe compensation <e> <s> in other words damage does not have to be proved before the entitlement and i must call it this because it looks as though it will be so to a contribution by way of penalty arises <e> <s> if the noble lord introduces the concept of compensation into the scheme that is in the subsection he may sometimes be depriving people of a contribution by way of penalty that they would receive if there were no reference to compensation <e>", "<cs> whatever else may be said in the bill about preserving the rights of compensation and so forth in the courts i feel bound to remind the noble lord and he made a most interesting speech from his experience as a lawyer of the rule of interpretation <e> <s> it is a very ancient and constant rule <e> <s> it is that you cannot take away peoples rights under the common law or their rights of action without express words in an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> with great respect to my noble friend lord lauderdale it seems to me that it is the mover and supporters of the amendment who need to take another look at this because it is perfectly clear that they and the government have the same objectives <e> <s> i shall come to that in the bill in a moment <e> <s> but it is just a question of whether those objectives are to be achieved by means of the provisions of the bill or as stated in this amendment <e>", "<cs> the four amendments deal with separate points <e> <s> i do not complain about their being grouped together because it may save a little time and effort <e> <s> however it means that one must deal with them separately when addressing members about them <e>", "<cs> i am relieved to hear that that is so but in that case i wonder why we are having this sort of debate <e>", "<cs> one could discuss that on clause stand part and that is a very compendious way of doing it <e>", "<cs> that is very courteous of the noble lord <e> <s> i am perfectly happy that we should have our main debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am trying to follow his argument but he must realise does he not that atomic energy does not produce carbon dioxide or sulphur dioxide which are the two main causes of damage to the ozone layer <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> if there is no increase in the greenhouse effect caused directly by atomic energy is the noble lord saying that it is simply the heat generated in the atmosphere by atomic power stations which causes the greenhouse effect <e> <s> atomic energy stations do not produce acid rain and do not attack the ozone layer because they do not cause carbom dioxide or sulphur dioxide to be emitted <e> <s> why is it that he says that atomic power stations have no advantage compared with fossil fuels <e>", "<cs> we have had as i am sure the whole committee will agree a most valuable debate <e> <s> we have been virtually unanimous about what needs to be done to protect the environment and the other matters that were mentioned <e> <s> the differences between us as to how these matters are to be achieved do not appear to be very serious <e> <s> perhaps i may say how grateful i am to all those noble lords who have taken part and how especially grateful i am as i am sure is the whole committee to my noble friend lady hooper for a very full and if i may say so impressive and helpful reply <e>", "<cs> of course we are all in favour of encouraging these things but i do not think that the object of legislation is to encourage <e> <s> it is to make enforceable laws <e> <s> i very much doubt whether this clause would be enforceable if it were added to the bill <e> <s> as to the secretary of state having power to help i very much doubt whether it is necessary <e> <s> i should have thought that he may have a discretion to help under other legislation <e> <s> if it is for a business purpose the ordinary allowances against tax would enable the cost of these experiments to be met <e> <s> even when they go beyond the scope of experiment help may possibly be given <e> <s> however having said that i think it is an excellent idea but i doubt seriously whether it should be the subject of legislation <e>", "<cs> in our language the word secure has several different meanings <e> <s> i think a better word here would be safe <e> <s> one should always choose the word of anglo-saxon rather than of latin origin and the short word rather than the long word <e> <s> safe is therefore better than secure <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the soviet government the only one still to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons <e> <s> could this not be pointed out to mr gorbachev as something on which the sincerity of his intentions is at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that chief justice warren burger during his many years as chief justice of the united states paid a number of visits to this country had discussions with the judiciary here and became thoroughly familiar with our own laws of civil procedure <e> <s> therefore he was in a uniquely qualified position to compare the two systems and draw the conclusions he did <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lady blatch <e> <s> anything which reduces bureaucracy more politely called administration is worth doing <e> <s> goodness knows there will be plenty of it when the bill comes into operation <e> <s> any mitigation that we can introduce will be an advantage <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to anticipate the amendment which i shall be moving next which is on a somewhat different point but i feel obliged to point out that paragraph b of subsection provides that <e>", "<cs> yes i am sure that my noble friends and i are grateful for that assurance <e> <s> i should like to thank them and the minister for the consideration that they have given to this rather difficult matter <e> <s> before withdrawing the amendment perhaps i may say that i hope he will bear in mind the following three points first the point made by my noble friend lord radnor that we must be very careful not to interfere with existing agreements to which of course the local authority was not a party and of which it might have been quite ignorant when it made its decision <e>", "<cs> we ought to have outgrown the era of having sea outfalls for sewage at all <e> <s> it is a most appalling way of disposing of sewage even if the pipes extend a long way from the land <e> <s> if we had a proper sewerage scheme for every place that still has a sea outfall that problem would no longer be necessary <e> <s> but alas we do not yet seem to have reached that enlightened state of progress <e> <s> i hope that we shall do so before many years have passed and certainly before this government ceases to exist <e> <s> i hope that that situation will not occur for many <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps he can tell me whether i entirely misheard him <e> <s> i can hardly believe it but did my noble friend say that there are still thousands of sea outfalls <e>", "<cs> noble lords will see that the next amendment on the marshalled list is also an amendment to add words at the end of line of page <e> <s> i think that logically speaking that amendment ought to be considered although it is not in the order to do so before the amendment about to be moved by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i say that for this reason my amendment deals with an extension of the power to make regulations <e> <s> his amendment deals with general matters covering all types of regulation and therefore would come naturally at the end of the clause rather than in a subsection preceding mine <e> <s> however i am entirely in the hands of the committee in this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that interesting comment on the situation <e> <s> we shall naturally wish to consider it <e> <s> i would hope however that this rough sea of contradictory decisions by the courts is something which we could smooth out by one simple provision in this statute <e> <s> it would be a splendid thing if we could <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that frivolous comment is a little bit beside the point <e> <s> however i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i shall further consider the matter as i am sure he will and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is it really necessary for the committee to write such details into this already lengthy statute <e> <s> if the seeking of tenders is to be published the local authority has only to look out for the advertisement and to tender <e> <s> if tenders are not to be published i believe that it will be simple for the local authority to let the sewerage undertaker know that it would like to tender if the need for tenders should arise <e> <s> surely it is better to leave it to those two alternatives than to have to write this further detail into the bill <e>", "<cs> surely it comes to this that the two parts of the noble lords amendment are interdependent <e> <s> i seem to have turned his amendment into a sort of curates egg <e>", "<cs> is not this amendment rather restrictive <e> <s> for many years i have had a metered water supply and that is more common in rural places than elsewhere <e> <s> next door to me is a farm where the water is metered in several different places and in several different ways <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a is the operative one and the amendment actually being moved by the noble lord is merely a paving amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i misheard <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made a very informative speech for which we should be grateful <e> <s> he has convered an interesting and quite controversial topic in a succinct way <e> <s> i tend to agree with him that for many people that is people of modest means compulsory metering could be a bit of a burden <e> <s> but on the other hand we do not want to go to the other extreme which this amendment would do <e>", "<cs> i certainly believe that for domestic consumers there should be a flat rate in each area and i do not see anything to stop it <e> <s> as regards industrial and other users i can see that if it is a very distant place from the main places to which water has to be supplied the cost of taking it to that very distant place may be considerable <e> <s> for a particular industry factory or undertaking the consumption of water could be quite considerable <e> <s> even so as regards domestic consumers even though it may be a long distance away there should be a flat rate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has referred to clause <e> <s> i have looked back to it but i cannot see anything in the clause which specifically carries out the obligation to have what i can only describe as even dealing between different types of consumer in the same locality <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that we could see no harm in the amendment indeed i think we all agree with the objectives behind it <e> <s> but if we look at clauses to we find that they contain elaborate provisions for carrying out just what the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey would like to be done <e> <s> listening to his speech it seemed to me that he has used the amendment as a peg on which to hang a discussion of the allegations which were made in <e>", "<cs> i should have added that it is a point in favour of what the noble lord said although it does not make his amendment any more necessary that however good the state of our rivers becomes unfortunately we find them polluted from time to time by chemical discharges <e> <s> there have been two serious discharges of aluminium chemicals in the west country causing a great deal of harm and consternation and making the water supply undrinkable <e> <s> however that there are such discharges does not alter the fact that there has been a general improvement in the state of our rivers over the years <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that he and his noble friends are anxious to ensure that the detailed provisions of clauses to are carried out as a general duty <e> <s> if he will look at clause he will find a general duty there expressed as strongly as any general duty could be expressed in relation to those clauses in almost the same words as his amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord cranbrook replies i feel bound to express some anxiety in this matter <e> <s> by having the -mile limit for which we negotiated very strenuously internationally we are imposing on foreigners a duty not to come within our -mile limit <e> <s> thereby we are protecting our fisheries and placing an obligation <e>", "<cs> i feel difficulty on this occasion about what is proposed by my noble friend <e> <s> he knows as well as i do that with the great ouse the fresh waters do not begin until nearly miles inland when you reach the seven holes sluice at earith it is tidal until then <e> <s> the river thames is tidal until it reaches teddington <e> <s> moreover the thames at high spring tides is largely salt water for a long way up it is not fresh water <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will give sympathetic consideration to the amendment unless he can give very strong reasons for saying that it is not necessary <e> <s> if members of the committee look at the earlier paragraphs of the subsection they will see that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies to that splendid invitation may i ask my noble friend whether he will bear in mind the sense of using the word proscribed rather than prescribed <e> <s> i know that prescribed is something described in regulations as a rule but it also means recommended like a doctors prescription <e> <s> here we really need proscribed i think <e>", "<cs> i too hope that something will be done along these lines for the reasons given by my noble friend lord cranbrook <e> <s> of course there is a slight complexity due to two factors <e> <s> first we tend to keep our criminal and civil procedures entirely separate <e> <s> however there is a great deal to be said for those trying criminal cases to have the power to issue injunctions <e> <s> the second problem is that under the general common law which still prevails unless altered by statute if there are both civil and criminal remedies which are concurrent the civil court cannot deal with the matter until the criminal court has done so <e> <s> therefore an absurd situation could arise in which although an injunction is obviously necessary the criminal court has no power to grant one and the civil court cannot deal with the matter until the criminal court has done so <e>", "<cs> i tend to support my noble friend lord cranbrook on this matter <e> <s> as for the point raised by my noble friend lord mottistone i feel bound to point out that the pollution of the norfolk broads which has caused such trouble and anxiety was partly and i believe considerably due and my noble friend lord cranbrook can say more about this because it came within the area of the anglian water authority to discharges from yachts motor boats and so on which were on the norfolk broads <e> <s> i think that we must be most careful before we give <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that pollution is pollution whatever the cause and we should try to be consistent in the laws that we pass <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may detain the committee briefly on this matter <e> <s> this lengthy clause contains a very wide sweep of exemptions from prosecution in cases that would otherwise be offences of pollution and contamination under the bill <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me whether there is any power given to the secretary of state to amend this clause by <e>", "<cs> i could offer another explanation of all this <e> <s> it is an explanation also why this bill is nearly pages long <e> <s> i think that if he were to inquire although he would never be able to reveal the result of his inquiries my noble friend would <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord onslow for raising that point <e> <s> i think that i should point out that this is the only reference so far as i know in the bill or in the amendments to the <e>", "<cs> for my part i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in a bill of nearly pages we can both be excused for not noting every phrase that is in it <e> <s> but now he has put it right in the record and my anxiety is relieved <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this question relates entirely to radioactive waste <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams has raised a very important matter <e> <s> whether nuclear generation is carried out by a public authority or under the powers contained in the bill by a private generator surely it must be paramount that it is carried out safely and in a way that does not endanger the public <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord would be so good as to answer this point <e> <s> if the secretary of state is to bring this matter under his own control whom does he expect to do the work bearing in mind that his own department consists of civil servant officials who do not have the experience and expertise or indeed the knowledge to deal with these highly technical matters <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he will answer the question which i put to the noble viscount lord hanworth and which is fundamental to his amendment <e> <s> i refer to the amendment which states <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord considered whether it is right to compel the secretary of state to hold an inquiry bearing in mind that some of the objections may relate to very minor matters or may be trivial or even frivolous <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend and i hope that he will make many more such small points which too few of us dare to make <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend on that <e> <s> i would merely add that surely it is only fair that the supplier of electricity should know what voltage is going to be required <e> <s> that is the important information <e> <s> the maximum power must be expressed in voltage and watts and i should have thought that that is the right way to do it <e> <s> the types of appliances for which it is required may vary very much in the power that they use and may vary from time to time so it is only fair on the supplier that he should know the watts and voltage to be required <e>", "<cs> i too wish strongly to support at any rate the principle of the amendments <e> <s> i do not know whether technically they achieve exactly what my noble friend requires <e> <s> surely it is essential that in each area there should be a common tariff for all domestic consumers <e> <s> there always has been so far as i know <e> <s> if it can be done by the north of scotland hydro-electric board which has about as widespread a disparity of domestic consumers as one could find almost anywhere in europe it should be easily done anywhere else <e>", "<cs> i think we shall have to consider very carefully what my noble friend has said especially as he is relying upon existing legislation <e> <s> i am not at all sure that the existing legislation will serve in these new circumstances <e> <s> we shall have more competition <e>", "<cs> i wish to follow up the point about the existing law <e> <s> the fact that it is not being used under the existing law does not mean that it would not be used under the new law <e>", "<cs> there are so many different levels of understanding in the community and i suppose that those who are born very clever have a reasonable opportunity of understanding even though something is gibberish <e> <s> the average person may find that something which is necessarily technical may be rather difficult for him to understand <e> <s> in the very nature of things for every person of average understanding there are a great many people with less than average understanding <e> <s> the question is whose understanding is it that the noble lord lord peston is trying to get at <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with my noble friend as regards this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that what he is suggesting would be desirable if it were truly practical <e> <s> the trouble is that it is fairly rare for the work of connecting to one house to be identical to the work of connecting to another <e> <s> premises and subsoils differ <e> <s> there are obstructions and rock formations under the soil and these differ <e> <s> having said that i believe that my noble friend has made a case which the government should answer <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams with great aplomb has widened the debate into a discussion on clause stand part whereas i was merely dealing with the simplest possible drafting point of the unnecessary use of the word economic <e>", "<cs> my noble friends reply has opened all sorts of vistas about rules relating to damages awarded by the courts <e> <s> these are cases which will come before the courts <e> <s> i can only speak with regard to the courts in england which would lean against what is known as remoteness of damage indirect <e>", "<cs> the list is rather odd <e> <s> as i understand it my noble friend is moving amendment no <e> <s> which is on the list of groupings with amendment no <e> <s> only <e> <s> but it is refreshing to find that we may dispose of so many other amendments at the same time especially at this late hour <e> <s> however perhaps my noble friend could speak very slowly so that we can tick them off and understand what is happening <e>", "<cs> i find this a somewhat confusing clause and i believe that the amendment would add enormously to the confusion <e> <s> subsection states <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises a very short point and it is a good point <e> <s> i do not know why it could not have been expressed in about half a minute <e> <s> the point is this in the previous discussion as my noble friend on the front bench said it was revealed that working days is quite unrealistic and working days is much nearer the point <e> <s> some people have to go into hospital and those who live alone perhaps do not have anybody left behind in their flat to pay the bills or perhaps somebody may have to go abroad on business <e> <s> people sometimes even go abroad on holiday <e> <s> i went away for five weeks to new zealand earlier this year and i was terrified that when i got back i would find that my supplies had been cut off because i had made no arrangements for somebody else to pay my bills <e> <s> so working days is quite absurd <e> <s> let us have days <e>", "<cs> the making of a statement to parliament is quite a palaver <e> <s> we do not have an unlimited number of statements made to parliament by ministers <e> <s> but if the noble lord lord ezra has in mind merely for example the answer to a written question then that would be a different matter <e> <s> however i should have thought that it would be unusual to have this sort of consultation <e> <s> if anyone feels that the secretary of state has acted in a way in which he should not have done the right thing is to raise the matter in parliament in the usual way <e> <s> there are various ways of doing that <e> <s> one is by means of a question

naturally favourably disposed towards both of these amendments <e> <s> it is right that we should legislate to cover the position of disabled people in regard to meters <e> <s> however i must confess that i prefer amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how the amount of electricity supplied by france compares with the amount of electricity which britain has supplied to france <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh is inviting us to do something that we have already done <e> <s> he is inviting us to put into the beginning of the bill a responsibility a very laudable responsibility for the national rivers authority on the control of pollution which is set out very fully indeed in part iii of the bill and in particular in chapter i of part iii on page <e> <s> indeed the noble lords own amendment refers to part iii and states that the national rivers authority shall perform the duties which arise under part iii <e> <s> the amendment would be an unnecessary piece of repetition <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will look at clause he will see that it does just that <e>", "<cs> my lords i take a completely

them <e> <s> the noble lord wants the consent of the treasury to be obtained for a loan for emergency measures in pursuance of these functions of flooding control <e> <s> goodness me my lords the treasury can take a long time <e> <s> it therefore makes matters worse <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i agree that it would be less harmful if the consent of the treasury did

should be continuity of pension rights between those who have been contributing to the water authorities superannuation fund and the people who will take over responsibility as employers in the future <e> <s> i do not know whether the amendment is technically the right way of achieving that <e> <s> all i say is that it is an object which must be achieved <e> <s> on the face of it this looks a rather sensible way of achieving it but i do not know <e> <s> in any event i hope that my noble friend will be able to give either a sympathetic response or an undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords

lord lord mcintosh is quite right in saying that at the committee stage my noble friend lord onslow moved an amendment which would have had the effect of placing upon the nra duties relating to consultation regarding planning and environmental assessment matters as defined by article of the general development order <e> <s> that is so and i supported that proposition <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh is suggesting that under the bill no more than per cent <e> <s> should be earned on the capital to be raised by the water and sewerage undertakers <e> <s> he has been very ingenious

has to be raised with fixed dividends <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i support <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish first to deal with the matter which has been so rightly raised by the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> we are being asked to consider i estimate amendments or amendments to amendments covering a very wide field <e> <s> i think it is for consideration by the procedure committee of this house which i hope will take note of what we have been saying that there are advantages in the procedure used in another place when a new clause or a new set of provisions is being tabled which had not been considered in committee <e> <s> in those circumstances there is a procedure called re-committal which enables virtually a second reading debate to take place on the general principles involved in either the new clause or the new group of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i commend the magnanimous nobility displayed by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i am sure that the government are grateful to him <e> <s> perhaps they will be very grateful on some other occasions too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i have not followed the noble lord because he spoke rather faster than my mind works <e> <s> i did not catch the number of the amendment to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we should write into primary legislation every single bit of administrative procedure that will be carried out but the noble lord makes a fair point <e> <s> i doubt whether we need to write that sort of thing into every act of parliament <e>", "<cs> due to a slip of the tongue the noble lord referred to clause when he meant amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords when starting to move the amendment the noble lord lord mcintosh graciously conceded that in his opinion it was not very well drafted <e> <s> i think that it is strange as it may seem <e> <s> short sentences and full stops are well regarded in legal drafting including statutory drafting <e> <s> long sentences and commas are not well regarded <e> <s> this is inevitably and unavoidably a longish sentence <e> <s> however i do not see how it could be made much shorter or that there would be any advantage in having a full stop and turning it into two sentences <e> <s> from the purely drafting point of view i should have thought that the noble lord was criticising his drafting unnecessarily <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord has said in reminding me of what i said in committee i must say that i feel bound to regret the leaving out of subsection <e> <s> but i think that something on the lines of amendment no <e> <s> is highly desirable <e> <s> i suggested an alternative at the committee stage and i very much hope that we shall obtain from my noble friend a sympathetic reply indicating either that the government accept amendment no <e> <s> or that they will deal with the matter in some other agreeable way on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords normally i would agree that purely declaratory legislation should not clutter up the statute book <e> <s> there is a bit of it here and there in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see how my noble friend can accept the amendment <e> <s> its purposes are fairly laudable but it would cause a tremendous breach of the law of trespass of england and wales <e> <s> it is sweeping <e> <s> it goes much too far <e> <s> even the ramblers association with its desire to have a great deal of access to land for the purpose of following footpaths and so on does not say that the law of trespass should be completely ignored where there is no right of way at all <e> <s> quite frankly i do not believe that this is acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an extraordinarily unusual amendment <e> <s> it would introduce a legal fiction that the relevant bodies the water or sewerage undertakers shall be deemed to be the owner or the occupier of land simply by the nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord norrie <e> <s> this is a bill in which there is a great deal of overlapping between different parts <e> <s> if we are going to overlap it is best that we overlap consistently <e> <s> my noble friends amendments would enable that to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords do not coal-burning power stations have an unfortunate effect on this matter and should not we therefore be aiming to reduce and eventually eliminate the coal-burning power stations as and when economic circumstances permit <e>", "<cs> my lords clause is very important <e> <s> it is the clause which enables enforcement of the bills provisions <e> <s> it is therefore right and realistic that as regards subsection a degree of flexibility is introduced as has been so clearly explained by my noble friend lord nugent who speaks with such great experience of these problems especially with regard to rivers <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important matter which has had an interesting evolution in our proceedings <e> <s> it began when my noble friend lord stanley of alderley supported from both sides of the house tried to achieve a greater uniformity of charges throughout rural areas <e> <s> for example it would mean that all farmers factories and so forth must be charged the same for thousands of gallons on a metered supply <e>", "<cs> my lords for the sake of accuracy i must make it clear that i was suggesting that it was amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord stanley which should be accepted by the government if it was practicable because i feel that the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh is in the wrong place in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord to deal with the point that i raised namely that if this matter is to be dealt with on the face of the bill by means of either of these two amendments surely it will be better to amend clause than clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the prospect of ones water supply being cut off even for an hour or two is not to be relished <e> <s> however it seems that it happens quite often <e> <s> i am thankful to say that i have not experienced it to any great extent <e> <s> clearly when it happens the local authority should be informed and in reasonable time <e> <s> i see no objection to my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> i think she will find that it is a rule of interpretation of statutes that they are assumed not to have retrospective effect unless the opposite is stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not accept the amendment <e> <s> the administrative effort involved in adding the information to the demand for charges will add marginally to the administrative cost <e> <s> if the water is already wholesome to use the word contained in clause there is no need to state it <e> <s> if it is not it should not be supplied and the water undertaker will be in breach of his duty if he does so <e> <s> the word wholesome is not used in the amendment <e> <s> i do not complain about that because it refers to section where the word is used <e> <s> i cannot find the word wholesome defined in the bill <e> <s> if water is heavily chlorinated in order to kill bacteria for example does that make it wholesome <e> <s> i am not sure <e> <s> if water is so hard that it interferes with ones dishwasher does that make it wholesome <e> <s> my general feeling is that this amendment should not be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we are grateful to my noble friends for the consideration that they have given to this matter since the committee stage and for letting us have a letter containing their views <e> <s> what was suggested in the letter was acceptable up to a point but i should have thought that it was better to write into the bill the words of this simple amendment which is much shorter than the one we moved in committee <e> <s> in saying that i ask my noble friend to bear in mind two matters in particular without going over all the ground we covered fully in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps on one point it is possible to set at rest the mind of the noble earl <e> <s> there is no need to put provision for breach of contract in the bill <e> <s> all breaches of contract are actionable at common law whether put in a statute or not <e> <s> we do not need anything in the bill in terms of this amendment so far as it affects the right of breach of contract <e> <s> but the noble earls amendment does more than that <e> <s> by leaving out the newly written section c of the act he abolishes the power to prosecute for a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it right on this occasion too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords will greatly appreciate the undertaking which my noble friend has given and for which we are deeply grateful <e> <s> i am sure that the national consumer council which inspired my noble friend lord wise and myself to move this amendment will also be appreciative <e> <s> i look forward to third reading <e> <s> if my noble friend wishes to discuss the matter with me and the noble lord lord mcintosh between now and then i am sure we are at his disposal <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a complex matter and it is one it seems to me the solution to which must depend to a great extent on scientific advice <e> <s> speaking for myself i do not have that at my disposal but i should have thought that it would be a mistake to do away with the well-established system of look-up tables <e> <s> i think that whatever else we do we ought to keep those <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the need for it arises from the ancient rule that when criminal or civil proceedings are both possible the criminal proceedings must be disposed of first unless statute provides otherwise <e> <s> however in a case such as the one which this amendment covers we could find that there may be a delay the usual kind of delay which i am afraid takes place in criminal proceedings and therefore we must bear in mind that there may also be a time-lag <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about the amendment <e> <s> i should like to hear what my noble friend on the front bench has to say <e> <s> i must point out that if it were accepted then on third reading we should have to make some consequential <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord balfour has raised the very important point that we must be consistent in the bill <e> <s> what most impresses me about the amendment is that it carries the name of the noble lord lord ezra with his tremendous experience of the mining industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord norrie on both these amendments but especially on amendment no <e> <s> k to which i have added my name because it has been pointed out to me on behalf of the royal society for the protection of birds that it is an amendment which is essential to the act in order to bring it up to date in the light of the bill <e>", "<cs> where my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment does not appear to be necessary <e> <s> i say that because of the very wide terms of clause as they already stand <e> <s> i need not read them out because noble lords can see them <e>", "<cs> my lords one can but sympathise with the motives which have been supported in various quarters of the house and which have inspired the amendment <e> <s> however frankly i am rather worried <e> <s> i think that it could create an unreal situation <e> <s> in the public interest water and sewerage undertakers must have power to lay or relay pipes as necessary in order to maintain the system <e> <s> in the words which are proposed to be deleted the clause requires reasonable notice <e> <s> i believe that that covers the actuality of the circumstances which are likely to arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very doubtful whether in primary legislation we should have as much detail of an administrative kind as we find in schedule <e> <s> the amendments add to that detail and so far as i can follow them they add somewhat unnecessarily to it <e> <s> there is one point that i have to confess does not arise strictly regarding the amendments <e> <s> i hope that i am not out of order in referring to it <e> <s> when we come to page and paragraph c we find that where an application for an order has been made under section that enables rights of way to be interrupted or abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords the reference is page paragraph c <e> <s> the result is that if an application has been made for an order by an undertaker and a notice of objection has been received by the minister from any person on whom a notice has been served or and this is the point i am coming to <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a in amending a previous statute refers to water unfit for human consumption <e> <s> we find that in new subsection of what will become section c of the previous statute <e> <s> if we turn over the page of the marshalled list in subsection a we find that we have a reference to water that is fit for human consumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i thank him also for having drawn my attention privately only yesterday to what clause <e>", "<cs> that is because we have not yet had the regulations and will not receive them until some time after the bill is enacted presumably <e> <s> then we are in the difficulty as regards the schedule relating to scotland that two different expressions are used which so far as i can see have the same intent but to which the courts will be obliged if they can to attribute different meanings <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether he would be good enough to answer the specific point that i raised <e> <s> i accept that his explanation shows that english and scottish law would be consistent with each other <e> <s> it is also clear from what he said that the expression on the one hand of wholesome or unwholesome and the expression on the other of unfit for human consumption will appear both north and south of the border <e> <s> is he saying that water can be wholesome but unfit for human consumption or vice versa <e> <s> with great respect although wholesome has not yet been defined in regulations it does not seem to me to make sense that we should use the two different expressions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships will wish to accept these amendments for the reasons which my noble friend has given <e> <s> but i think that we should note in passing that in schedule we are amending the primary law of scotland in relation to control of pollution and we are doing so in <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the other virtues of the amendment may be it is alas inconsistent with what has gone before in clause <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord i had overlooked his paving amendment he is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that we have a green belt policy which surrounds london with open fields or at least to a great extent are we really to abandon the open spaces in london itself as easily as this <e>", "<cs> these amendments are so obviously well intentioned that i hope that any criticism i make will not be considered unhelpful <e> <s> quite frankly i have read amendment no <e> <s> several times and it may be due to the limitation of my intellectual capacity but i cannot make it mean anything <e> <s> perhaps i have missed the point but as expressed it does not seem to me to be even grammatical <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will consider the wording because it does not seem to express the intention which he had with regard to it <e>", "<cs> i was at the ministry of power when the decision was taken to have a nuclear power station industry at all <e> <s> that was years ago <e> <s> we were faced with all kinds of uncertainties <e> <s> we did not know how long the fuel elements which were costly would last <e> <s> we did not know how long the reactors would last and therefore we could not assess the length of life of the reactors upon which the cost depended <e> <s> we did not know although some thought had been given to it how much it would cost and what uncertainties there would be in disposing of the nuclear waste of which we have quite rightly heard a good deal today <e> <s> if we had been deterred by those various uncertainties we would not have a nuclear power industry today at all <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend but it is worth mentioning that far more lives have been lost through accidents in coal mines in spite of all the efforts made to achieve safety than have been lost through nuclear accidents <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies or decides to withdraw the amendment i wonder if i may now at last do something that i have been longing to do ever since we embarked on the discussion of part ii that is to express wonder and surprise that the secretary of state who is after all a cabinet minister responsible to parliament is made to share his responsibility and to get the consent of the treasury in every step that he takes throughout part ii <e> <s> it really is extraordinary <e> <s> i think that the most remarkable example is in clause which states <e>", "<cs> this is a very small drafting point <e> <s> it is arguable in my opinion that the amendment is not necessary but it would be much better if it were made <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that immediately before could mean two seconds before <e> <s> there is no difference and cannot be any difference in logic between saying that and saying at the end <e> <s> it is quite ridiculous in my opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the principal matter to be considered at the inquiry be whether the site proposed for the reactor is in every way suitable <e>", "<cs> the amendment does not place a duty upon anyone to carry out the proposed review <e> <s> the treasury supplement which is to be abolished by clause would not be revived by the amendment because it makes no provision for that <e> <s> neither would the review revive the supplement <e> <s> that would require primary legislation which we have before us <e> <s> it is just as well that the noble baroness said that her amendment is probing because i am sure she does not wish the committee to divide on the issue <e>", "<cs> this amendment gives rise to a fundamental problem which i cannot believe has been considered by those noble lords who have so far supported it <e> <s> it is a point that has not yet been mentioned and it is this namely that if we pass the amendment we shall create a statutory contradiction or conflict <e>", "<cs> i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am happy to say that i am a past president of mencap <e> <s> also i have a daughter and in the words of the amendment i have to describe her as suffering from <e>", "<cs> before members of the committee opposite intervene let me ask my noble friend to clarify one or two points that were not quite clear to me though they may have been clear to some others <e> <s> in the early part of his speech he seemed to be suggesting that even under the present law the mobility allowance as a matter of discretion and circumstances can be granted to people who are deaf-blind <e> <s> as i mentioned in the case of my own family it can be granted to those suffering from severe mental handicap if they cannot walk or if they have to be held up too long <e> <s> that is already the case under the present law <e>", "<cs> as regards amendment no <e> <s> i am afraid that it is not practicable to suggest that the appeals must be heard within days <e> <s> let us suppose that the chairman of the appeal tribunal is taken ill on the morning of the case <e> <s> what will then happen <e> <s> i appreciate that there must be some flexibility but these cases should not take a long time <e> <s> however just to enact it like this i am afraid would not be workable <e>", "<cs> that is so if the person is available <e> <s> however that is not always the case <e>", "<cs> i am sure we all agree that it is better if possible for overhead lines to be placed underground if that is not a contradiction in terms <e> <s> so that members of the committee will understand exactly what i mean some years ago i had experience of this matter and was involved in a good deal of controversy on behalf of people with whom i had great sympathy who wanted enormous sums of public money spent on putting the supergrid underground <e> <s> if we can remove these vast overhead lines and the tremendous pylons which support them so that they do not spoil places of natural beauty then that will of course be a great help to the environment <e> <s> but we have to keep a sense of proportion and realise that it can be enormously expensive <e> <s> moreover in some of the national parks where there are rock formations it becomes even more expensive and physically more difficult <e> <s> therefore although naturally we have sympathy with the noble lord lord ezra i assume and hope that this is a probing amendment rather than one which he insists should be applied in every case <e>", "<cs> during earlier exchanges in committee both sides have agreed that safety should be one of the principal responsibilities of the secretary of state and of the various electricity authorities <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston and my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil have been clear that we should insist upon safety <e> <s> the twelfth schedule goes to the heart of the whole question of safety <e> <s> i should perhaps remind members of the committee that among the threats to safety which have given rise to public anxiety both at home and abroad are the reprocessing of nuclear fuel and the treatment storage or disposal of radioactive waste <e>", "<cs> i see the purpose of the amendment but the wording of it perplexes me <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made his intention clear but i do not think that his amendment expresses it <e> <s> however in my opinion even if the purpose of the amendment were acceptable because of the way it is expressed which is so vague and does not relate specifically to the regulations as originally laid we should not accept it as it stands <e> <s> it would have to be amended at a later stage even if it were added to the bill now <e> <s> i do not say that it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords on the other hand <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make so hold in my short speech as to confine myself to the terms of the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh and i am one of those who admire his spirited efforts during earlier stages of the bill made an impassioned speech which was not really justified either by the terms of the bill or by our legislative practice <e> <s> perhaps i may deal with each of the six points in turn <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord caithness and we should all be grateful to him has done splendid work in this bill in trying to protect the environment <e> <s> he has very nearly got it right and this amendment would just about perfect it <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend proceeds any further it seems that he has departed from the grouping <e> <s> i wonder whether he could give us any help as to how that arises and what will happen to the amendments which have been grouped differently from the way in which he dealt with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will not accept the amendment <e> <s> the question of water being unfit for human consumption arises in some peoples minds <e> <s> i must confess that for years i have drunk tap water all over the united kingdom and have reached the age of without any ill effects <e> <s> on the other hand some people take one sip of a glass of water from anywhere and say oh dear <e> <s> this is not fit for human consumption <e> <s> we must tell the local police <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see how the government could reasonably accept these worthy amendments <e> <s> the motive behind them is sound and sensible but their content is already covered in effect by the terms of the bill <e> <s> if i may give an example in clause under the side note <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to express my great thanks to my noble friends on the front bench for moving the amendment <e> <s> it has more significance than appears at first sight <e> <s> not only does it remove an injustice <e> <s> it is also refreshing to find that in this case at least the government are not using the excuse that the provision is already contained in the present law as a reason for perpetuating it <e> <s> the amendment removes an injustice it removes too from this voluminous bill lines of quite unnecessary detail <e> <s> for that we rejoice <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will explain why it is that having been persuaded at an earlier stage of the bill to include a power to designate an area he or the government have now changed their mind <e> <s> there may be a good explanation and i think that we deserve an explanation <e> <s> in any event apart from that point if the amendment were to be accepted it would have the advantage that the proposal concerned would have to be one or could be one for which the secretary of states consent or authorisation is required <e> <s> for those two reasons i think that my noble friend lord norrie is entitled to a full answer from the government on the important case that he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords there are strong practical reasons why reasonable notice should be given before there is entry on land for any of the purposes envisaged in this schedule for example growing crops the presence of cattle and various other work being carried out on the land <e> <s> that is in addition to the ordinary courtesies expected in a civilised society <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a brief word from these benches <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said my noble friend lord caithness has had a most formidable task <e> <s> he has performed it with tremendous efficiency and courtesy <e> <s> he has shown i hope that i shall not be mistaken if i say this nearly always very good judgment <e> <s> we are grateful for such concessions as he has been able to make <e> <s> he has been ably assisted by my noble friends lord hesketh and lord arran <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not quite wrong that a few thousand people in public service should hold the whole community to ransom <e> <s> in considering the need for legislation on this matter will the government bear in mind the desirability of making it a clause in contracts of employment that in the event of disputes on wages there should be compulsory arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords as there are eight years between now and and a great deal could happen during that time is it not premature for detailed discussions with other countries or the making of firm decisions <e> <s> could not that tactfully <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that whether your lordships agree or disagree with the noble and learned lord lord denning we are glad to find that he is here for the first time for many months since his th birthday expressing matters with his usual vigour and great clarity of mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that interruption and correction <e> <s> the most reverend primate has helped me in a way to clarify my case <e> <s> we shall have tightly drawn procedures leading to the exercise of an absolute discretion <e> <s> that discretion is in no way limited <e> <s> this measure would have the effect of making the archbishops responsible for limiting the application of the law of the church so far as concerns ordination <e> <s> however great a regard one may have for each of the most reverend primates for all the bishops and all who may come in the years ahead i do not think that we should turn them into law-makers to that extent or place on them the responsibility of limiting the application of what is a legislative provision but so widely drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords on the water bill i was glad to support my noble friend lord stanley of alderley and was very glad of the outcome of the persuasion which he and others exercised on that bill <e> <s> but if i remember rightly it was not just a measure advanced to protect those in rural areas taking the country as a whole <e> <s> the purpose and the result of the amendments which he moved and the government accepted the last of them at third reading was to ensure that there should be no discrimination within each area <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships may remember i take a different view from that expressed by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i have expressed that view so often that i do not wish to weary noble lords again except to say that both the chancellor of the exchequer and the secretary of state and incidentally the chief secretary are all members of the cabinet <e> <s> they all have collective responsibility <e> <s> that we should have to write this into the bill would merely be a reflection of the failure of the machinery of government <e> <s> it is sheer nonsense and i hope that one day the treasury will drop it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this subsection should be considered again by the government <e> <s> we are dealing here with consumers committees <e> <s> we ought to ensure that it is consumers who are represented <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention here is sound and it is welcome <e> <s> the machinery is very complicated <e> <s> in addition to the question asked by the noble lord lord williams i wonder whether my noble friend will explain this to me <e> <s> it arises on subsection a and b <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not your lordships agree with privatisation i am sure that we all wish progress to be made as soon as possible when the bill has reached the statute book <e> <s> but my great fear with this amendment is that in fact it will delay matters very badly <e> <s> placing a responsibility on each of the the water undertakers in effect to obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships would agree that we do not legislate as a rule especially in detail in a way to prevent the unthinkable from happening <e> <s> to me it is absolutely unthinkable that there might be discrimination <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there could be discrimination against fossil fuel generating stations once this bill is passed <e> <s> we have so much in the way of provisions here to encourage and require them to be given a proper run and a fair crack of the whip that to add this point as well seems to me to be quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords are grateful to the noble lord lord shepherd for raising this important question of generation by tidal power <e> <s> i should have thought that the bill probably enables the secretary of state to take steps to see that somebody does this if public money is provided <e> <s> as the noble lord says it is a huge sum <e> <s> i do not think that it would come from private sources <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two words in these amendments that give rise to a great deal of trouble and ambiguity <e> <s> in the new subsection which incidentally i do not think is necessary anyway because i think that all major capital projects will be and always have been the subject of planning inquiries the words outcome of a planning inquiry are a little ambiguous <e> <s> does that phrase mean the inspectors recommendation <e> <s> does that mean the secretary of states decision or if it is a matter that does not go to the secretary of state but to the local authority is it its decision <e> <s> what is the outcome <e> <s> that is my first point <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i said <e> <s> in every major capital construction there would be a planning inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend can answer much better than i but as i see it the answer is this <e> <s> formerly subsection as drafted said that the regulations under this section shall and then it sets out several things which are now to be left out <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not having been present when my noble friend baroness hooper moved the amendments <e> <s> i welcome them especially those which amend schedule <e> <s> i cannot refrain from being nostalgic because paragraph of schedule is taken word for word from section of the act <e> <s> that is a section which i moved at the report stage in another place in that year <e> <s> i am glad to see that the concept which we put forward then has stood the test of time and is now being embellished and strengthened <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lords amendment serves his purpose because regularly could mean for example one a year and from time to time could mean four or five times in the course of a year but at irregular intervals <e> <s> i am not sure which way he would rather have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it is in order for me to intervene at this stage <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord williams is on to a point which requires explanation <e> <s> if it cannot be given today i hope that perhaps it might be given at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming that we are taking amendments nos <e> <s> and together for discussion although they may have to be moved separately and we know that they do i wonder whether without causing him any embarrassment and without trying myself to seem the least bit clever i should invite the attention of the noble lord lord williams of elvel to the fact that in amendment no <e> <s> he refers to the <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are to accept the amendment of the noble lord lord williams it is important that we should know the implication of the use of the word overall in relation to the efficiency of power stations <e>

efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may point out to him that referring to power stations in the plural inevitably means that we are not referring to particular power stations but to power stations in general <e>", "<cs> my lords whether my noble friend withdraws the amendment or not i hope that he will not apologise for having moved it <e> <s> i believe he has done a valuable service in doing so and i support him <e> <s> when we enact laws we assume that they are laws that have to be obeyed and that can be enforced <e> <s> i do not know how we can ever be sure <e> <s> i did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend because he has mentioned something that has escaped me <e> <s> i wonder how we can be sure that he has made himself aware of the matters that are contained in the words that my noble friend wishes to have omitted <e> <s> how can those words possibly be enforced <e> <s> they are not fit for law-making and that being so as he said they should be taken out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has raised a most important matter and made a very valuable suggestion <e> <s> i do not remember there being a statutory central users consultancy council for electricity but there was a body which we in the department when i was there used to know as the electric women <e> <s> they were i think called the womens national electricity council <e> <s> they were really representatives of housewives using electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope and believe that on this amendment we have got into a realm of non-controversy a realm quite different from the one which we suffered on the previous amendment <e> <s> clearly the amendment moved by the noble lord lord williams has a great deal to commend it <e> <s> i am sure that the government would wish to fulfil the purposes stated but it is a question of how <e> <s> it seems to me that subsection a is covered by clause and the ninth schedule especially as amplified by my noble friend either at the committee or report stage i cannot remember which <e> <s> at any rate the first subsection may well be covered already in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wish to make one short point before my noble friend replies <e> <s> the reference to the amplification of the ninth schedule to which i referred my memory let me down temporarily is to be found towards the end of our previous sitting on th july at cols <e> <s> and of <e>", "<cs> my lords one appreciates the sentiment behind this amendment <e> <s> however i wonder whether in order to comply with the bill it would be possible to calculate the accumulated realised profits except by reference to generally accepted accounting principles <e> <s> one wonders therefore whether it is necessary to write this quite obvious concept into the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee a very strong case was made for this amendment but the noble lord lord carter withdrew it because there were various uncertainties felt on both sides of the committee there was uncertainty as to the numbers involved there was uncertainty as to the cost to the treasury there was uncertainty as to when the review about which the government told us would be reported and we hoped that that would certainly resolve the uncertainty about the numbers involved <e> <s> there was also uncertainty as to when there would be legislation to deal with this obviously hard situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord that clarifies the point and removes the uncertainty in that respect <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords are also grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i notice that he has studiously avoided answering the question which i put to him which was will the government give an undertaking that having gone through all this negotiating and consulting process they will deal with the matter one way or another in a social security bill in the next session of parliament <e> <s> because speaking for myself a lot depends on that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first say that the statement is very welcome although one will need time to consider the details of it because as statements go it was very long <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend can give some broad idea as to whether the proposals will lead to a reduction in the number of mentally handicapped people i am not talking of the mentally ill but the mentally handcapped in long-stay hospitals of whom there are still several thousand <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the noble lord has praised the amendment with faint damnation perhaps i may say that i believe that the government should earn our gratitude for having listened to the many representations made during committee and report stages <e> <s> those were to the effect that we should make it even clearer than is already stated in the ninth schedule to the bill that those concerned will have a duty to protect the environment <e> <s> we should be glad that it has been put as members of both sides of the house suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have not done the noble lord an injustice so far as concerns the origin of the amendment <e> <s> however i was <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not go on trying to put the remarks of the noble lord into the context which they deserve <e> <s> i shall simply say as i was saying that i am very glad that in addition to what has been set out in the ninth schedule to the bill from the start we now have this clear statement of a duty together with other duties in clause <e> <s> for that i should have thought we could unanimously rejoice <e>", "<cs> my lords we all welcome the addition of the national consumers consultative committee <e> <s> it will be more important than each of the regional committees <e> <s> i do not see why its work needs to be considered in any greater secrecy <e> <s> therefore i would have thought that this amendment has a good deal to commend it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was much impressed by the reasons that the noble lord gave in reply to noble lords opposite <e> <s> however in order to clear ones mind and to get this absolutely straight can we be sure that if there is not this amendment or any amendment like it that the national consumers council will be free to call a press conference or to hold a public meeting <e> <s> if that is so then my own fears would be dispelled <e>", "<cs> my lords i take a different view of the bill from that expressed by my noble friend lord peyton for whom i have had such a high regard for so many years <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the government on this historic bill <e> <s> the act i see some of us who voted against it in one place or another was an experiment <e> <s> it was a brave experiment in nationalisation <e> <s> it was done monolithically <e> <s> ten years later when i had the privilege of being a junior minister at the ministry of fuel and power it was found that it was not working to public satisfaction and so we embarked upon another experiment the act which i am glad to say established the area boards for the distribution of electricity <e> <s> i am glad to say that the functions of those boards will remain somewhat similar under the bill <e> <s> we shall still have the grid with an area board responsibility for it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that his acknowledgment of the part played by the bar council during the consultation period was well justified <e> <s> is he also aware that the bar council has in fact for the past two years been working on various changes in the profession which he would find welcome <e> <s> would it not be better therefore to study the effects of those changes instead of of embarking upon the legislation to follow what we understand to be in the white paper which is bound to be controversial on many points <e> <s> in particular is he aware that although he seems now to be placing this in the hands of the profession the statement he made about multi-disciplinary practices and about partnerships possibly for the bar to be in hands of the profession will be controversial and that he may well wish to reconsider those matters before legislating <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i think obvious to all of us that the strength of your lordships house lies in its capacity as a revising chamber and its <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the figure of given to us from the front bench during the third reading debate is quite unreal and that i hoped we would not hear that figure mentioned again from the front bench <e>", "<cs> as this is the first time i have ventured to intervene in discussions on this bill perhaps i may say how surprised i am that parts i and ii contain so much purely administrative direction to local authorities <e> <s> that is especially true of clauses and <e> <s> with all the experience that local authorities have gained over the years i should have thought that it was unnecessary for parliament to take up its time with so much purely administrative detail <e> <s> i have looked through the later parts of the bill to see where enforcement of these provisions is set out <e> <s> i cannot find it <e> <s> perhaps we can be told how these provisions will be enforced <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend if he will be so kind i hope that i am not being unfair as to deal with the point i made when we dealt with the amendment that has just been withdrawn <e> <s> we have here a great many administrative instructions but as i said i cannot find where in the bill there is a reference to what is to happen if as my noble friend lady blatch said something which is illegal or unconstitutional is done or not done <e> <s> fortunately we always have the process of judicial review <e> <s> the jurisdiction is always dependent upon the exact wording of the statute <e> <s> judicial review can sometimes be used and sometimes it cannot <e> <s> apart from judicial review is there anything to which my noble friend on the front bench can point which will assure us that the provisions in clause can be enforced <e>", "<cs> why not <e>", "<cs> i am sure we should all be grateful to my noble friend for that reply including what he called his lecture on interpretation <e> <s> i must say that i greatly welcomed it <e>", "<cs> it may be that with increasing longevity i failed to take on board the ever increasing richness of our language <e> <s> but i must confess that i am unable to tell what is the difference in the statute between a provision and a core provision <e> <s> it may be that i have missed something out <e> <s> i ask this question rhetorically to see whether any member of the committee can give an answer we are after all only at the committee stage <e> <s> has this become a term of art in our statutory language or is it just an attempt by the noble lord who is always trying to help to add a new concept to local government law <e> <s> what is the difference in statutory effect between a provision and a core provision <e> <s> that is my first comment on these amendments <e> <s> quite frankly i doubt i shall not go into detail at the moment whether amendment no <e> <s> is necessary bearing in mind the provisions we already have in clause and elsewhere in the bill where we find the power on the part of the secretary of state to make regulations <e> <s> i would very much doubt whether it is necessary to add this further power <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we are very grateful to the noble lord lord graham for giving us the reason for his ingenuity <e> <s> but i do not think with great respect that his analogy is quite correct because there are so many different kinds of provisions <e> <s> if we start saying that some are of greater weight than others and some are more central than others i should have thought we would be getting into very fine and artificial distinctions whereas on <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is perfectly clear that there is a broad consensus and in effect an agreement in principle that this site should be preserved would it not be best for us to leave the details to the planning authorities <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh has raised a very interesting point and one which deserves our careful consideration <e> <s> although i have not been a member of another place for ten years my own recollection no doubt i shall be corrected if i am wrong but i still think i am right is that the register of members interests in another place was a register compiled by the voluntary action of members <e> <s> indeed a member could refuse to submit his interests <e> <s> i remember that one well-known member did refuse <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will bear this point in mind <e> <s> i speak from years experience of parliament altogether <e> <s> never once as a member of parliament have i had to take part in a decision as to who should be awarded a government contract except when i was serving as a minister and even then it was a very rare thing indeed <e> <s> those decisions were nearly always taken by officials although ministers were responsible for them <e> <s> but private <e>", "<cs> we are in a rather unusual position <e> <s> we are discussing the possible omission of two clauses clauses and and doing so on a necessary paving amendment to clause <e> <s> we cannot complain about that however we should be clear about what we are up to <e>", "<cs> my lords what we really have to decide on this motion of the noble lord lord williams is whether we should proceed this afternoon with the consideration of the commons answers to our many amendments <e> <s> we submitted hundreds of amendments for another place to consider and they have made very few changes in them <e> <s> however the principal point is that the statement made yesterday about the magnox stations does not affect the issues that are before us this afternoon on those commons answers <e>", "<cs> which numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave way to the noble lord and i shall now try to answer the point that he raised <e> <s> he referred to an amendment with which the commons disagreed <e> <s> the reason they give for disagreement is that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is another point in favour of the government <e> <s> whether it is a party point is a matter of opinion <e> <s> the point that i shall make is this thank goodness we have a government who are candid and honest enough <e>", "<cs> my lords when facts have been brought to light the government have come to both houses of parliament as soon as they could having required the accountants concerned in the industry to go more deeply into matters <e> <s> as a result we are now faced with the statement that we were given yesterday <e> <s> the government deserve to be commended on the way in which they have handled the matter <e> <s> it is far better that we should get on with the implementation of the bill and not have an adjournment of consideration of the commons responses which would delay royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord the problem that has arisen is an old problem which relates to the past <e> <s> strictly speaking from the outset and all governments of the last years are to blame for not having insisted upon it the future cost of disposing of the fuel and of decommissioning the power stations should have been borne to a much greater extent by consumers from time to time <e> <s> that was not done <e> <s> and that is where the trouble lies <e> <s> all parties that have been in power are to blame for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will permit me to intervene <e> <s> the order as was mentioned yesterday will be subject to affirmative resolution of each house <e>", "<cs> although by nature i am one of those people who like to see things left out of bills i regret to have to say that on this occasion it would not make sense to leave out these three insertions of the word substantially <e>", "<cs> first i should like to offer my congratulations to my noble friend lord arran on the new appointment he has been given in the government which he so richly deserves <e> <s> it is rather sad for me to have to express a little doubt about the amendment which he has moved and those which are grouped with it <e> <s> i am not sure that it is sound in principle whatever has happened in the past for the trustees of a superannuation fund or of a trust fund to be allowed to use that fund presumably for purposes which have nothing to do with the superannuation or the trust but for the purpose of the local authority <e> <s> certainly if the trustees of any other fund were to use the money for a purpose which was not within the objects of the superannuation or the trust fund they would be in for a good deal of trouble <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me those answers at short notice <e> <s> although i am a lawyer i am not always impressed by precedent <e> <s> i do not find that the precedent in this case is a very happy one bearing in mind that all of us in our experience have found that local authorities have sometimes overspent their revenue <e> <s> the tendency to dip into superannuation funds or other trust funds to which they themselves admittedly have contributed is not one which i find very inviting <e> <s> however i do not believe that we can pursue this matter further now <e> <s> i certainly do not wish to obstruct my noble friend in view of his valiant attempt to justify what he has moved <e>", "<cs> i am not alleging that there has in the past been any kind of frequent breach of the obviously necessary obligations which arise <e> <s> all i am saying is that i doubt whether it is necessary or desirable for us to give power to perpetuate the practice which has gone on in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is not on the list of speakers but i hope that i may have your lordships indulgence to speak for a very short time <e> <s> i understand that the changes the government intend to make will require an act of parliament <e> <s> meanwhile i believe that we should regard this as a consultation period of which i hope the government will take good note <e> <s> the changes that they propose are controversial and in my opinion they are not generally welcomed <e> <s> if they are a sop to scottish and welsh nationalism that of itself it not a good reason <e> <s> i speak as one with a foot on each side of the border <e> <s> i am kind of anglo-scottish migrant at different times of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the present government in their early years succeeded in repaying vast overseas debts incurred by their predecessors <e> <s> that is a factor to be borne in mind by the government when considering the present adverse conditions of the balance of payments which we hope are temporary <e>", "<cs> my lords would there be any power to enforce any finding of the commission following any such prosecution <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord graham for what he has said in both his speeches <e> <s> i am also grateful to all those noble lords who have unanimously supported the view which i expressed when moving the first of these amendments <e> <s> i had read the outcome of the home office review <e> <s> i had read the home secretarys two speeches since then <e> <s> i must say and it would be hypocritical of me if i did not say it that i found the outcome of the review and the speeches very disappointing <e> <s> it was with a view to obtaining something more positive more urgent if you like and to filling a serious gap that i put forward these two amendments today <e>", "<cs> first we should acknowledge that clause is very helpful <e> <s> it is something that perhaps we may have borne in mind to the limited extent to which it is relevant when discussing the previous amendments just now <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord graham replies perhaps i may add this <e> <s> first we should be very grateful to my noble friend for the open-minded way in which he has responded to these amendments <e> <s> i hope that it is not irrelevant for me to mention that whether or not these amendments are accepted the clause removes any financial excuse there may be which local authorities might use for not making provision for emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords who will be answerable to parliament for the activities of this new welsh environmental body <e> <s> will it be the secretary of state for the environment or the secretary of state for wales <e>", "<cs> that is my feeling too and i should also like to add one or two points to the telling remarks of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> first i had the honour of serving on the royal commission <e> <s> it was in fact the commission on the constitution <e> <s> and it lasted not for three years but for more than four years <e> <s> so far as i know there is no precedent for establishing a royal commission by act of parliament <e> <s> royal commissions have always been established by royal warrant hence the expression royal commission <e> <s> that is the first strange point about amendment no <e> <s> which should be emphasised <e>", "<cs> there are occasions when the power is given to ministers to order the repeal or amendment of existing statutory provisions but they have generally been very minor amendments and that has generally appeared from the context in which the power is given <e> <s> when we have given that power we have nearly always said that the order shall be in the form of regulations laid before parliament and there is no suggestion of that here <e> <s> i suggest to the committee that if we are to give this power which is precedented to the secretary of state then in the particular circumstances the better judgment which we should exercise is to require the repeals or amendments to be made by regulations which need to be approved by parliament <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am very surprised to hear the noble lord say that in this field of legislation relating to employment and the trade union laws close to it we have been hard hearted <e> <s> the main effect of our legislation has been to restore power to the members of trades unions <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all of us everywhere in this place should rightly be vigilant and therefore i do not complain that the noble baroness moved that we should discuss clause <e> <s> we should be vigilant about anything which might weaken the protection given to young people at work <e> <s> we know that some of the earlier legislation applied to children at work when the school age was low but we are now presented with the proposition that it is those below school-leaving age to whom we should particularly address our minds <e> <s> school-leaving age could one day be raised <e> <s> there is no proposal for doing that at present but in our democracy it might be a natural evolution in some years time <e> <s> the clause anticipates it <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that it is right for us to respect the sikh religion and this part of it on wearing turbans <e> <s> we have been over this matter on previous occasions when we exempted sikhs from wearing crash helmets <e> <s> that situation has existed for some years and it has not aroused the emotions referred to by the noble lords lord stallard and lord houghton of sowerby <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the strong and unanimous representations that have been made this afternoon and in spite of the doughty effort of my noble friend to defend the indefensible will he invite the attention of the chancellor of the exchequer to what has passed in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to the first of the amendments set down in my name namely amendment no <e> <s> f <e> <s> this amendment stands also in the name of my noble friends lord mersey and lady blatch <e> <s> it is a simple amendment to the governments amendment <e> <s> it would have the effect of putting beyond doubt that the fcdas would have the power which the government say they ought to have think they are giving to them and which we all want them to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said nothing in relation to all these amendments so far <e> <s> i voted with the government on the amendment of my noble friend lord stanley and i voted with the government just now on that of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> it seemed to me that the amendment moved by my noble friend lord vinson had as the noble lord lord mcintosh pointed out virtually no time limit <e> <s> the power which it contains can be carried into the future and it seems to me to deal with the crux of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am glad to support my noble friends bill <e> <s> one thing about it which attracts me apart from the merit of substance of it is that it gives a discretion to the courts to do what is right or appears to be right in circumstances which may vary considerably <e> <s> we should i suggest do this more often instead of trying to cover every hypothetical contingency <e> <s> we never do that successfully because we nearly always omit some contingencies which actually arise in practice when the bill comes into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that despite what was said by the noble lord lord hatch there is strong evidence to support the view that nuclear energy reduces the risk of acid rain and of damaging the ozone layer <e> <s> will her majestys government therefore uphold their policy of encouraging the nuclear power programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for intervening now as i was not present <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope this intervention is in order if the noble lord gives way <e> <s> the point i wish to make is that the principal councils have no responsibility they have only a discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that amendment no <e> <s> a would be wrong in principle simply because if you pick out one kind of emergency you are thereby emphasising it in the statute and ignoring other emergencies of equal importance which might arise <e> <s> it is a fundamental principle that we do not pick out one aspect when others may be relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for referring to the report of the committee of which i was chairman but i do not wish to pursue that part of what he said <e> <s> however i think we should bear in mind that never in the <e>", "<cs> my lords he reveals an intellectual distinction which enables me to say that i have no regrets about using that phrase <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend the leader of the house should now consult the leader of another place with a view to completely overhauling our legislative process so that in a future session we are not again confronted with a mass of amendments such as those now before the house many of which involve important changes of policy <e> <s> in the nature of things we shall not have a full opportunity to discuss them <e> <s> therefore i hope for a favourable answer from my noble friend on that suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an amendment that really should be welcomed <e> <s> the first clause of the bill as printed contains some welcome but rare statements of principle <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale pointed out earlier it can be done and we are doing it again to great advantage <e> <s> these are the kinds of precedents to be followed as regards the mass of detail that we shall have to consider later <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a case reported recently in the press about this matter <e> <s> i understand that it may be subject to appeal in which case we ought not to attempt to discuss the merits of the case now <e> <s> however i think that this is a matter which we should keep open so far as is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether we are wise to legislate on this point <e> <s> the second part of the amendment especially subsections and deals with administrative matters which the authorities concerned would deal with as a matter of course <e> <s> subsection states <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal first with amendment no <e> <s> which adds a new clause to follow clause <e> <s> clause is fortunately very widely drawn and contains various statements of principle <e> <s> if we compare the two closely enough we find that all the details mentioned in the new clause can be said to be covered by one or other of the subsections in the existing clause <e> <s> therefore it does not seem to me to be necessary to have the new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should take special note of this group of amendments <e> <s> it is a very unusual way for us to be legislating <e> <s> the matter starts on page with clause which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a good deal of sympathy with what the noble lord lord prys-davies said in moving the amendment <e> <s> however i am particularly concerned because amendment no <e> <s> shifts the burden of proof from the prosecution which is the usual case to the defence as regards whether the direction was reasonable <e> <s> normally we should not shift the burden of proof in that way <e> <s> it would have been perfectly possible to draft the provision in such a way as to keep the burden of proof upon the prosecution by enacting in the second line of subsection the word reasonable <e> <s> that subsection of the amendment would then read <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very small point and purely concerns the drafting <e> <s> we find that the expression voluntary homes is defined in the definition clause clause to be found on page which states <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down perhaps i may say i am grateful to him <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> clause refers to registered childrens home and this amendment refers to childrens homes <e> <s> however do i understand that under an earlier amendment which i missed the reference to registered in clause has been struck out <e> <s> if so the matter is undoubtedly in order though there would have to be an alphabetical re-arrangement in order to put the words childrens homes back where they belong in alphabetical order <e>", "<cs> my lords with the amendment to the long title we say farewell to this important bill <e> <s> we should bear in mind that we are also saying farewell to pages of commons amendments which will double the length of the bill <e>", "<cs> for the skill and patience with which he has discharged what i regard as a thoroughly undesirable task <e> <s> we admire his clarity of mind and speech <e> <s> we are grateful for the way in which he has shown consideration during this rather lengthy and hard-going handling of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the economics of building operating and decommissioning nuclear power stations have from the outset and continuing right up through the past years been fraught with uncertainties <e> <s> in view of the forbidding new cost factors which have now come to light and to which my noble friend refers should not the government be congratulated on their sense of realism in the decision which they have taken <e> <s> is it not rather strange that noble lords on the opposition front benches should instead of rejoicing at the decision complain that the government have decided not to do what they always said should not be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships will agree that the noble lord lord soper has performed a valuable public service by saying what he has about so-called religious charities <e> <s> there are some charities which call themselves religious but their purposes are so bizarre and sometimes dangerous that they should not be given charitable status <e> <s> bearing in mind the important position that the noble lord holds in his own church and the reputation that he has for being outspoken i think we should be very glad that he said what he did <e> <s> there is no need for me to embellish it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but the noble lord misheard me <e> <s> i said that we should try to persuade as many qualified lawyers as possible to work in the charity commission <e> <s> a great many work with charities either voluntarily or otherwise <e> <s> if one may dare to be egoistic in your lordships house perhaps i may say this <e> <s> i returned to the bar in since when i have become involved in unpaid work for various charitable organisations <e> <s> i have been fully involved as have many other lawyers both solicitors and barristers <e>", "<cs> my lords is it accepted that there are some east european countries which need aid more than others and deserve it because of their quicker transition to democracy <e> <s> since he has mentioned poland does he agree that the case for poland is perhaps the strongest of all <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true to say that even the invisible earnings figures are firm in parts because the earnings from banking and insurance are not merely estimates but are based on actual takings <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that much of the overseas aid granted by this country in the last years was intended not only to relieve poverty and to overcome drought problems but to stimulate production in the third world countries <e> <s> therefore it is not realistic to think in terms of maintaining a particular percentage of our own gnp for overseas aid <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend proceeds will he clarify one point <e> <s> when he uses the expression junior ministers can he assure us that he has particularly in mind lords in waiting <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in addition to their commissions and sometimes instead of their commissions some stockbrokers make fixed charges and use the financial services act as an excuse for doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord byron gave us the benefit of his experience in the city of london in the light of his training as a barrister <e> <s> we are very grateful to him for his maiden speech <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to try to correct three assumptions which are made by lay people we have heard mention of them today <e> <s> these assumptions are fundamental to an understanding of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may have overlooked the fact that the solicitor advocate like the barrister advocate will need a member of the solicitors firm in court with him <e> <s> he will need the services of such a person <e> <s> that person sitting behind the solicitor advocate will also have to be paid for by the lay client <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend elaborate on her very satisfactory answers by giving your lordships some idea of the total number of hospital beds that will be provided by these hospitals which have been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say to what extent the homeless in london are young people sadly from broken homes a long way away who have come to london in the mistaken belief that once there all will be well <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although the bill is indeed an enabling bill the way in which the minister could exercise his powers under the bill is very fully and precisely described <e> <s> he will not have much discretion except to say whether or not his power should be used at all <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord brightman has raised a very important point <e> <s> however with respect to him i am not quite sure that we can deal with this by leaving it to report stage <e> <s> under our rules there is no report stage unless the bill has been amended in committee <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i shall be happy to be corrected <e> <s> i was borrowing from experience in another place which perhaps does not apply here <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to hear that correction <e> <s> it shows that procedure in this chamber is more liberal and shows a better understanding of circumstances than the procedure on this point in another place <e> <s> it is therefore not necessary for the amendment to be accepted this evening in its present form <e> <s> it can be put right to remove the ambiguity <e> <s> i was very glad that the noble and learned lord drew attention to it <e> <s> i was puzzling in my mind whether it meant six weeks altogether or four weeks plus six weeks making weeks <e> <s> we have to get the provision right <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mishcon with his usual grace and persuasion <e> <s> it is felicitous that the first amendment to this bill is one upon which barristers and solicitors can easily agree <e> <s> indeed the noble lord

governed almost <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this further discussion <e> <s> i wish <e>", "<cs> yes but we have to move a stage further <e> <s> supposing that parliament has altered the law in the way that my noble and learned friend suggested under this clause the lord chancellor could again make another order repealing that statute which is nonsensical

intended to obtain is he saying that he will receive the resources for them or that he knows that there will be staff trained and available <e>", "<cs> i am in sympathy with the broad concept of the speech made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> however as to his amendment i find it strange that there should be a report to the general public <e> <s> generally when we ask ministers to report progress upon the exercise of powers given to them by parliament we require that the report should be made to parliament <e> <s> on reflection the noble lord might think that that would have been a better way to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend replies i wonder if he would make it quite clear that he has in mind that it would be a report to parliament <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to point out that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor very wisely but after much persuasion said on several of the amendments to clause that he was prepared to consider the arguments made <e> <s> i merely wish to ask him particularly when considering clause in the light of our debates to bear in mind the very powerful speech made by the noble lord lord rippon of hexham <e>", "<cs> therefore i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> and as suggested in the groupings also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> as my noble and learned friend said and as is clear procedure provision under the definition given in subsection of the new section and subsection of the new section refers to any statutory provisions <e> <s> surely there are procedure provisions which arise from time to time under the rules of court <e> <s> therefore it would mean that if there were a procedure provision which arises from a rule of court it would by implication presumably be excluded by the definition which limits the meaning only to statutory provisions and not any provisions made under rules of court <e>", "<cs> that is very interesting and helpful <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that we should finish part i today <e> <s> we should have no difficulty in doing so at a reasonable hour provided that we do not make our speeches too long <e> <s> when my noble friend says that we shall finish in five days i assume that he means five days starting from today which would mean six days altogether <e>", "<cs> i also agree <e> <s> the method proposed by the noble lord lord hacking for amending this provision seems to me to be preferable to that contained in the amendment to which i have put my name <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the amendment proposed by my noble and learned friend undoubtedly represents better drafting than that which appears in the bill <e> <s> he has explained why there is this difference between the powers of the high court and those of the county court as a result of this amendment <e> <s> however the reason is technical and results from what is contained elsewhere in the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i am sure that he is right <e>", "<cs> one effect of the amendment would be that the expression officer of the court which is in the bill at line on page would disappear and be replaced by the expression registrar or clerk <e> <s> i am trying to find whether the expression officer of the court is defined in the bill <e> <s> it does not seem to be <e> <s> if it is not and what is meant is a registrar or clerk then it would be better to express it so <e>", "<cs> i too hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will regard the amendment with great sympathy <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon said in moving it that he was necessarily going to have to do so pretty fully <e> <s> therefore there is no need for me to repeat his arguments which i entirely support <e> <s> i would simply add the following <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down can he elaborate on an important point that he made <e> <s> it concerns the internal appeal within the local authorities <e> <s> the governments homelessness review was published in december <e> <s> it contains no suggestion or indication of any discussion concerning the right of appeal in such <e>", "<cs> i find clause in its present form most unacceptable for the reasons given by the noble <e>", "<cs> in the further consideration which my noble and learned friend is going to give he may care to consider making more sense of the last line and a half of subsection and make it clear that it is limited by the terms of subsection by adding at the end of the third line of the subsection such words as as mentioned in subsection <e> <s> that would make it clear that subsection is limited by the terms of subsection <e>", "<cs> this is a wide-ranging debate on a rather limited amendment <e> <s> as i understand it we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall no doubt be corrected <e> <s> i wish to take up the point made by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale in referring to his own amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there seems to have been an assumption that anything in the civil justice review should be acceptable <e> <s> i do not think that we should necessarily make that assumption <e> <s> it is relevant to our discussion to find what was said in the civil justice review but we are not bound by it <e> <s> if we find that when translated into legislation some of it appears to be unsatisfactory we should depart from the civil justice review <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that explanation <e> <s> if he is able to give us any further indication at report stage i am sure it would be appreciated <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> i stress that if lay people are to be brought in who have uncertain qualifications or none at all it is essential that the judge should be able to stop their <e>", "<cs> the main point that noble lords on both sides of the committee have in mind is the fear that the county courts time will be wasted by people who mean well but do not know what is relevant to the matter in hand <e> <s> it would help a great deal if my noble and learned friend would consider inserting in the bill a measure to stop timewasting <e>", "<cs> to follow what the noble lord lord grantchester has said the statute book is already littered with that phrase and phrases like it <e> <s> sometimes it is with the approval of the treasury sometimes with the consent of the treasury and <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend for his lucid explanation <e> <s> i do not find it convincing <e> <s> it would be perfectly satisfactory as part of the internal arrangements of the government for it to be provided by direction from the chancellor of the exchequer that two lords commissioners of the treasury should sign the document which the lord chancellor has passed over to them <e> <s> it is totally unnecessary to write it into the statute book <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies perhaps i may briefly mention that when we come to clause the noble lord lord meston and i will move an amendment to make the lord chancellors department or any official of it subject to the jurisdiction if that is the right word of the ombudsman <e> <s> i feel and i think that probably the noble lord lord meston also feels that it would be far more appropriate if the parliamentary commissioner for administration were to have that responsibility <e> <s> i mention this point simply because from the most interesting and acceptable statement just made by my noble and learned friend i am not quite sure whether when he considers this matter and brings a proposal forward at report stage there will be anything said in what he proposes about the administration of his own department <e> <s> i think that it would be helpful to know that at this stage <e>", "<cs> it should certainly not be or <e> <s> if it is not or it should be and <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend agree and he must know it from his own knowledge as a former head of department that instructions for the draftsmen are not given by ministers <e> <s> they are given by civil servants within the broad and rather vague ambit of policy laid down by ministers <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend replies perhaps i may add to what my noble friend lady elles has said <e> <s> there is an increasing commitment on the part of both branches of the legal profession in this country to practise on the continent of europe <e> <s> that will increase still further as the years go by <e> <s> my noble friend has made an important point which i hope my noble and learned friend will consider sympathetically <e>", "<cs> when my noble and learned friend refers to having a consistent approach would he agree that it is a consistent approach within the government where there is cabinet responsibility <e> <s> is he saying that that consistency cannot be achieved without asking parliament to write this into the statute <e> <s> will he also answer my question which is a quite serious drafting question <e> <s> what is the difference between consent and approval <e>", "<cs> we have dealt with this matter only briefly at this late hour <e> <s> i shall go on trying to get some sense in this matter and in relation to other matters written into statute which are part of the internal administration of government <e> <s> having said that and having made the point again briefly tonight i beg leave to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that i shall come back to it time and time again <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down in the presence of the leader of the house i wish to say that by sitting at this late hour we are merely piling up business for the report stage <e> <s> if we sat in committee at a more reasonable hour and had <e>", "<cs> in what my noble and learned friend said the operative word is tailored <e> <s> when the advisory committee has pointed out to the bar council or to the law society that the people say in norfolk will lack certain specialisations what is it expected that the bar council or law society will do about it <e> <s> will they merely draw attention to this give publicity to it and hope that somebody will then go to norfolk or that some of the people in norfolk will start up the specialisation <e> <s> if so it may be useful advice which might be acted upon <e> <s> but if the word tailored is to have effect it would seem to indicate that maybe some kind of financial help in establishing chambers or in the case of solicitors in taking on staff to help to pursue the speciality would be needed <e>", "<cs> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend as i am sure is the committee for the clarification and assurances that he has given <e> <s> it is satisfactory to know that the matter can eventually be dealt with in this bill <e> <s> i believe that he has got the matter right <e> <s> it is better that the parliamentary commissioner should have this responsibility rather than that we should try to fasten it on the ombudsman <e> <s> with those assurances i am very glad to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the pictures which do not see the light of day is it not possible for two or three of them to be spared to brighten up the barry room <e> <s> can the minister say whether of those pictures there are some that will probably never be on display <e> <s> in that case does the minister not agree that it would be in the public interest from several points of view if they were put on the market <e>", "<cs> i am so glad to find myself in agreement with my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his further offer of consideration and beg leave to withdraw

business to get through today <e> <s> i understand that questions may be asked about a statement but that speeches may not be made <e>", "<cs> i too have been told that this amendment has the blessing of at any rate the officers of the general council of the bar <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for saying that he will have this amendment looked at by parliamentary counsel <e> <s> it would be surprising but very exciting indeed if parliamentary counsel found that our wording was acceptable <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment refers only to trials on indictment and not to the magistrates court at all <e> <s> for the reasons so fully given by the noble lord lord hutchinson in his powerful argument i too support this amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> i think that his argument is increased by the fact that on indictment there is a jury to be considered but that is not the position in the magistrates court <e>", "<cs> and charge a fee for doing so as they do <e>", "<cs> i shall stand up and make the point again <e> <s> the solicitor advocate in addition to charging a fee for the preparation of the case in the usual way will also charge an advocates fee <e> <s> at present that would go to a barrister <e> <s> but the solicitors advocates fee might be higher because the solicitors overheads will be higher than those of the barrister <e>", "<cs> i too should like to show my appreciation of the open-mindedness on this matter of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> when he says that he does not go along with the idea of consultation with authorised bodies i assume that he refers to the new subsection a which is to be seen on page of the marshalled list <e> <s> that is very simple and clear in its terms and does not impose much of an obligation upon anybody <e> <s> however as my noble friend lord

with a situation in which as he says the master of the rolls remains with statutory responsibility for the working of the solicitors branch of the profession while clause gives the lord chancellor jurisdiction with regard to conveyancing services carried out by solicitors and other people <e>", "<cs> i tabled a notice in the formal way saying that i would be opposing clause <e> <s> however i can assure the committee that my purpose is merely to probe and to discover exactly what it is that the government are getting at in bringing in the director general of fair trading <e>", "<cs> i

the bill <e> <s> i join with the noble lord lord mishcon in making clear that we are not discussing the type of contingency fee which involves taking a share of the damages if one is acting for the successful party <e> <s> we are discussing a matter which is not very far removed from it namely a conditional fee agreement under which in accordance with the clause the solicitor and barrister or the solicitor and advocate acting for the lay client will only be paid if they win the case <e> <s> i suppose as a slight compensation for the risk they will be paid a higher percentage of fees than normal for a case of that type and for the issue involved <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble and learned friend will be so kind as to allow me to interrupt <e> <s> i think that we should be quite clear about this matter <e> <s> what he has just said about this not following the event no pay no win does not seem to be consistent with what is in the white paper <e> <s> paragraph which refers back to the green paper states <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend replies there is one matter which i find rather <e>", "<cs> in order that we can be constructive as well as critical i suggest that the words or ought to have been could be replaced by the word reasonably <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has drawn attention to a clause which could have been expressed much more succinctly <e> <s> several of the subsections overlap <e> <s> i should have thought that the draftsman would be well advised to consider a complete revision of the clause without altering its meaning or effect <e> <s> it is one of the few clauses of the bill which i favour <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hutchinson is not wasting time <e> <s> an extraordinary situation arises under the clause <e> <s> i did not understand it until i read the notes on clauses <e> <s> under the heading policy objectives which follows the detailed explanation of the contents of the clause its aim is set out <e>", "<cs> we can again take refuge in the notes on clauses which are absolutely clear and succinct <e> <s> they state that the intention of the clause is to extend the immunity to new classes of authorised advocate and authorised litigator and to those exercising rights of audience or the right to conduct litigation by virtue of directions made by the lord chancellor under clause <e> <s> i should remind the committee that that clause is in part i and it is the clause which deals which people who will be given the right to pursue small claims on the part of creditors <e> <s> that is what the notes on clauses states <e>", "<cs> this is a most important matter <e> <s> the formation of multi-disciplinary partnerships by members of the bar is against the public interest <e>

qualified of his thinking that his only duty is to oppose bail by all possible means <e> <s> we do not want that to happen because that is not justice <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may very briefly say that i support this amendment <e> <s> it is only right that somebody on the government side should make that clear <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to say that those of us who at mencap over recent years have had

accused by the ombudsman and in effect refuses to comply with what the ombudsman has recommended should then be told by the ombudsman how to publish the fact of failure and then to provide his reasons

learned friend and congratulate him on his sportsmanship <e>", "<cs> my lords we all respect the tremendous expertise in patent trade mark and copyright work which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has acquired in his practice as a barrister i stress as a barrister <e> <s> however what he suggests goes beyond the present structure of the bill namely that two non-legal professional organisations if i may describe them as such should become authorised bodies under the bill and be selected when there are a good many other non-legal professional organisations which are not mentioned in the bill but whose claims to become authorised <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> i need only add that on the previous occasion we noted that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor made clear that the existing rules of the bar council that is those which existed when the bill came into force would receive deemed approval <e> <s> however it is not clear whether members already called to the bar whether practising or not will have the right of audience <e> <s> that point also arises and needs clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords although i did not add my name to the two amendments of the noble lord lord meston i should like to support him <e> <s> i do so not only for the reasons he has given but also because it appears quite clearly that the main purpose of clause is to maintain the status quo as at the time the bill comes into force or the th december as the case may be <e> <s> we are more likely to give the impression of trying to maintain the status quo if instead of putting this in the negative as the bill now does we allow the assumption that the provision has been approved unless the lord chancellor and each of the designated judges determine otherwise <e> <s> that is more consistent with what has gone before and i hope more consistent with the intention of my noble and learned friend as i am sure it is the intention of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i look forward either to hearing from him or perhaps he will send me copies of any amendments

chancellor for uttering a word since i had not heard much of his moving of the amendment <e> <s> however having heard the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale i feel bound to make three comments <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down does he not agree that when his admirable response involves tabling a new schedule which is four pages long that should be the subject of recommittal which is possible within our procedure although very rarely used rather than being submitted on report subject to the very strict rules which we then have for discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the first of my noble and learned friends amendments that the conditional fee agreement should be in writing is certainly an improvement but when he says that the lord chancellor should be able to prescribe various requirements unspecified in this new and highly controversial departure from the previous practice and etiquette of the bar in england and wales i must say that i do not find his second amendment so welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend replies i must intervene as i shall not be able to address your lordships later <e> <s> i now rise to make the rather simpler point that i was about to make when i wanted the noble lord lord mishcon to get in before me <e> <s> first i am opposed to there being any kind of uplift percentage increase <e> <s> secondly although it is not stated in the clause i assume that this means a percentage increase over what would otherwise be scale fees as costs on taxation <e> <s> but in any event i think that if there is to be an uplift the maximum permitted percentage should of course be limited if necessary by order as the amendment of my noble and learned friend indicates <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that if we are to have uplift which i am strongly opposed to subsection is rather necessary <e> <s> it follows therefore this is the sanction to enforce subsection that if there is to be an uplift if the uplift is exceeded it should be unenforceable as described in the proposed subsection of the amendment of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i say without prejudice to any discussion that we may have at a later stage on whether there should be a maximum permitted percentage that if there is to be one the proposals of my noble and learned friend ought to be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords on a matter of procedure i understand that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has power to move the amendment himself if he wishes in order to accept it <e> <s> if he does not i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords to me it is absolutely unthinkable that a barrister could enter into such a <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to respond to the generous offer made by my noble friend the leader of the house <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration of amendment no <e> <s> be adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> there is one technical point which i should mention <e> <s> at the end of the second line of the amendment the word board should be replaced by the word corporation <e> <s> that is a very small point which can easily be dealt with by a manuscript amendment if the new clause is acceptable to the committee <e> <s> i hope that it will be acceptable to the committee and especially to my noble friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to say i am grateful to him for giving way that under present law it is already a planning matter <e> <s> it is also the responsibility of the british coal corporation <e> <s> both those considerations will remain but the purpose of the new clause is to to show both the planning authorities and the corporation that parliament really does expect enforcement <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord norrie decides perhaps my noble friend lord ullswater will be kind enough to consider two matters <e> <s> first there is nothing in the amendment which excludes the planning procedure <e> <s> i agree that there must be a planning procedure as there has been for quite a long time <e> <s> the minister has not dealt with the point raised by my noble friend which is a very important one namely that it is only if an area is as large as st jamess park or larger that the proposals in clause of the bill would bite at all <e> <s> that cannot be a satisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords when the report stage of the bill was adjourned last week we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> moved by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may thank him for correcting me <e> <s> we discussed this matter on clause stand part in committee but the point which arises on these two amendments was not then discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his reply although i do not find it totally helpful <e> <s> naturally one will need to consider this <e> <s> if it be the fact that without any reference to part ii of schedule arid without any reference in fact to clauses or the bar council would be on firm ground in altering its rules and <e>", "<cs> my lords the practicality of this provision is that it arises rarely but unexpectedly when there is a shortage of counsel available in a court perhaps a distant court <e> <s> i remember that for a few months there was a shortage of counsel even as near to london as rochester <e> <s> the point is that when that happens the matter needs to be dealt with reasonably expeditiously <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with those who have already opposed this amendment and i wish briefly to add two points <e> <s> first the chairman of the bar asked me to state that the bar council wishes to dissociate itself from the amendment <e> <s> secondly this is simply a thought of my own which in one way has been made by others but i should like to put it like this it is essential that the legislative the executive and the judicial roles of the government and parliament should not be separated <e> <s> in order that they may effectively be performed they must impinge upon one another <e> <s> i therefore regard the lord chancellor as a vital link man <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the overwhelmingly powerful case put forward by the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> to my mind what is at issue on this amendment is public confidence in the higher ranges of our judiciary <e> <s> if it turned out that people were reaching that part of the judiciary without being capable of doing what is required of judges it would indeed be a very bad day for justice in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend the leader of the house replies perhaps i may say that i support the motion moved by the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> in doing so i should just say in order to remove any misunderstanding that those of us who have tabled amendments have done so selectively <e> <s> we have not tabled amendments to cover every point that we might have raised we have dealt only with those points which we considered relevant and worth discussing and worth discussing at a reasonable hour when there are a reasonable number of members of your lordships house present <e> <s> it so happens that we have not gone far enough tonight <e> <s> the motion deserves sympathetic consideration from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i also will occupy the time of your lordships house for only one minute <e> <s> perhaps i may say that when i saw this amendment on the marshalled list i found it rather surprising that it came into this bill at all <e> <s> it seems to me a new departure and one which normally would require very considerable and detailed thought and consultation with outside bodies <e> <s> frankly speaking for myself i have not had the chance of that consultation <e> <s> but there it is <e> <s> at minutes past at night we have this new departure of some importance bringing about quite a considerable change <e> <s> i suppose that we have to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very briefly to support the amendment partly because i do not understand exactly what it would imply <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this matter in committee after oclock in the early morning <e> <s> we are now discussing it at minutes to midnight <e> <s> liberty of the subject is involved <e> <s> i must say that i did not know the statistics produced by the noble lord lord hutchinson but i think that we should take them very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble and learned friend will allow me <e> <s> i am not conscious of having described the situation in that way <e> <s> i certainly did not intend to do so <e> <s> i intended to suggest that there were some members of the crown prosecution service who might feel that their future success within the service depended upon their success in opposing bail <e> <s> that is a different matter and i think that that is how i put it <e>", "<cs> my lords we should acknowledge what my noble and learned friend has done with the amendment which is obviously wise and necessary but on page to which the amendment refers there is a strange little misprint <e> <s> it refers in the left-hand column to section <e> <s> in fact there is no subsection to clause <e>", "<cs> it is on page <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> i had not seen the correction <e> <s> i thank my noble and learned friend <e> <s> that puts the matter right <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord norrie deserves congratulation on his initiative in moving the amendment in committee which was supported by a substantial majority in spite of the advice then given by my noble friend lord ullswater on the front bench <e> <s> he was afraid and his reasoning was understandable that as there were already planning and licensing procedures for <e>", "<cs> having listened carefully to the whole debate it seems to me that the two amendments that we are discussing do not alter the terms of the bill or prevent the government from doing what my noble friend has said that they intend to do <e> <s> the bill refers to eligible students and defines them as those <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord that the word maintenance used by itself implies that it does not cover tuition fees and so on <e> <s> i do not have a copy of the white paper with me <e> <s> can my noble friend tell us how tuition fees will be paid for by those who do not have the means to pay them <e> <s> will they be paid for by grants as frequently happens at present or in what way <e>", "<cs> it is always wrong as the noble baroness said for us to legislate in retrospect if we can possibly avoid it <e> <s> it is especially wrong in financial matters and it may be harsh on students who for example have done two years of a three-year course and who are just coming up to their final year which is the most anxious of the three years <e> <s> for them to find that the financial foundation of their studies is to be changed in a way that some of them may find less agreeable is something that we should avoid <e> <s> i shall be interested <e>", "<cs> one understands and has some sympathy with the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> but it is beyond the scope of the long title of the bill beyond the powers given to the secretary of state in clause and beyond the scope of schedule to which the amendment is attached <e> <s> in the circumstances i do not see how the committee can possibly accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is nothing in the bill to prevent what the noble baroness wants to have done <e> <s> however no doubt she is anxious about what may or may not be in the regulations <e> <s> that is the point we are on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord irvine of lairg dealt with the effect of the legal services part of the recent bill upon legal aid because it enables me to shorten my speech to <e>", "<cs> my lords has it come to the notice of the government that a great deal of trouble at football matches is caused by organised gangs of people who seem to indulge in a rival sport of fighting each other <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that so long as that situation prevails it will be very difficult to achieve the right relationship among all those concerned with football <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the powerful case that has been put by the noble and learned lord in moving this modest but important amendment <e> <s> there are two dominant features of this matter <e> <s> the first is that the advisory committee in the nature of things will be london based <e> <s> secondly court work is mostly indeed overwhelmingly not taken in <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down will be be good enough in the light of what he said to make clear that he has in mind that the judge appointed to serve on the committee will be a judge who during his service is gaining experience of what happens outside london <e> <s> in that connection perhaps i may mention that the south-eastern circuit includes the whole of the eastern and south-eastern counties of england <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon may have had much more experience than i of the operation of the law relating to defamation although i have had some experience of it <e> <s> it always seemed to me that qualified privilege had the great disadvantage of uncertainty <e> <s> there was often uncertainty on the facts and the various defences to it gave scope for a tremendous amount of argument <e> <s> i should have thought that in the circumstances in which the advisory committee will be operating and the duty that it has to advise the lord chancellor and the designated judges that it is much better that the position should be clear and that the matter should be cut and dried <e>", "<cs> my lords with deep respect to the noble lord the circumstances are completely different and the two situations are not wholly analogous <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the amendment will be supported and that it will be accepted by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> it removes what i suggest is a serious defect in the bill <e> <s> it is almost unbelievable and quite without precedent <e> <s> subsection of clause could compel a person to defame himself publicly and to publish his own libel against himself and would require him to pay for doing so <e> <s> we really cannot legislate in a way that has that result <e> <s> i would take a very serious view of the matter if the subsection as drafted remained in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he imagine a more effective way of creating bad relations between the ombudsman and the two branches of the legal profession than the method that is put forward in subsection <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are to use the language of the ballroom i should like to say that on his amendments to schedule my noble and learned friend has been a real dashing white sergeant <e> <s> i should like to thank him for the attention that he has given to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to support the amendment for the reasons given by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support this amendment for the reasons given by the noble lord <e> <s> i simply add that it would be a very strange position if the lord chancellor making regulations under clause were obliged to maintain fair competition but the board doing its general duty under clause were merely required to maintain competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for meeting the simple point that i made in so far as i understand that he has met it <e> <s> however i feel obliged to say that he does it by the most unbelievably complicated piece of drafting <e> <s> i most earnestly hope that when the bill reaches another place he will have the whole of subsection looked at with a view to eliminating some of the double negatives and reduce some of the occasions on which the words only and unless occur <e> <s> it is not the happiest way to draft legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> it is regrettable that yet again this important and highly controversial matter of conditional fees should come before your lordships house at such a late hour <e> <s> i find that there are fewer than of us in the chamber <e> <s> the legal aid advisory committee whose report was discussed yesterday criticised the conditional fee agreements in the bill and did so in general <e> <s> one is entitled to an answer to the questions why was there no uplift in scotland although this scheme has operated in scotland we are told for generations and why is there no mention in the scottish bill of the possibility of a percentage uplift <e> <s> why should scotland and england and wales have different ways of applying that extremely controversial practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may have the leave of the house to make a correction to what i said just now <e> <s> it has been pointed out to me that there is in the scottish bill an opportunity for percentage uplift <e> <s> but it will be arranged not by the lord chancellor or any other member of the government but by the court <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will allow me to intervene i should say that if he reads on to paragraph he will find a further elaboration of the committees views <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that explanation <e> <s> in the light of it i certainly do not wish to press this amendment <e> <s> i take some comfort from the terms of subsection of clause to which he referred which is somewhat wider in its terms than i was given to understand and wider than i understood from what he has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene to say yes that is so but the bar council and the law society are entitled to limit respectively in relation to their own numbers the right of audience or the right to conduct litigation if they are linked with multi-disciplinary practices <e> <s> it is true that i did not read out the whole of that subsection but it is necessarily part of the scenario which will be before them on each occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> the matter is quite important in practice because it affects the immunity of acting magistrates and those acting outside their immediately authorised jurisdiction <e> <s> in view of what my noble and learned friend has undertaken to do i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would not wish to turn this session into an all-night sitting <e> <s> but there are a few words that i should like to say <e> <s> first i should like to endorse the praise so felicitously expressed by the noble lord lord mishcon about the way in which my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has handled the bill <e> <s> on numerous matters of detail and drafting in this excessively complex and detailed bill he has enabled us to help him to improve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i did so before being called to the bar <e>", "<cs> my lords when will that important but costly programme be completed <e> <s> will it be paid for by the consumers or the taxpayers or a bit of each <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that this is a probing amendment because quite frankly it adds nothing to the bill <e> <s> the government already have power to decide on other conditions that they may prescribe by regulations <e> <s> however sympathetic one may feel one should bear in mind that whether or not the amendment is accepted the government have power to enact the provisions anyway <e> <s> they also have power to ignore the provision in the amendment if they so choose <e>", "<cs> my lords these two amendments present a dilemma <e> <s> on the one hand as the noble earl has said we want to legislate in a way which avoids family hardship <e> <s> in that connection we have to bear in mind that there are various allowances under the social security system <e> <s> on the other hand each of the amendments will have the effect of providing an incentive to young people to marry in haste and to have a child as soon as possible or even to do so without marrying <e> <s> on balance the government should not accept these amendments because they present real difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i have reflected on this matter since the committee stage and i am glad that the noble baroness has raised it again through these amendments <e> <s> i am reminded of the case of my own father who had a most unfortunate illness between the ages of and <e> <s> his entry to university was <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i think he would wish to be accurate as he always is <e> <s> he stated at the start of his speech that the amendment would enable the secretary of state to do what is suggested <e> <s> however the word shall is used so that he would be required to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand what has been said about the bill being rushed through <e> <s> it was brought from the house of commons on th february that is nearly five weeks ago <e> <s> it spent about the same amount of time in the other place <e> <s> the point that we are now considering is really rather a narrow one to understand which does not require a great deal of study or research <e> <s> as i see it the issue is simply this <e> <s> the reality of the situation is that the bill will receive royal assent and there will be student loans <e> <s> if there are to be student loans it would be unjust to deprive that very small minority of students who are under the age of years of the advantages of the loans scheme <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend can explain a point to me <e> <s> he said that the chairman is not to be a lawyer <e> <s> what sort of person do the government have in mind to have appointed as chairman <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the real point that arises here is whether or not the government intend that there should be a right to compensation <e> <s> if there is to be a right to compensation and i should have thought that that was the justice of the matter we should get the wording correct so that we make it clear <e>", "<cs> it may be that i have not been sufficiently thorough <e> <s> i have looked for the new clause relating to the advisory and supervisory functions of the director <e> <s> it is not grouped with these amendments <e> <s> it would help to know where to find it <e>", "<cs> a great deal of new material such as the lengthy new clauses fails to have the advantage of an explanatory memorandum <e> <s> on a printed bill as sometimes brought from the commons to your lordships house we have the benefit of the explanatory memorandum <e> <s> therefore it is all the more important that we should obtain the fullest possible explanation from the government <e> <s> i am surprised that amendment no <e> <s> a was not grouped with amendment no <e> <s> h <e> <s> our attention would have been drawn to the issue and under our rules we should not have been prevented from discussing amendment no <e> <s> h separately as it arose <e> <s> we should have been helped by having the forward reference <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord could explain one matter <e> <s> it seems to me as a mere english lawyer who is not very familiar with the workings of the scottish courts that the joint effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and would enable judicial review to take place whereas if we do not accept those amendments that judicial review would be out of place because the matter would turn on what the secretary of state considers appropriate <e>", "<cs> is the intention of the secretary of state also that there shall be judicial review or that judicial review shall be excluded <e>", "<cs> i have listened to this very interesting discussion and what worries me a little is the lack of qualification of the word solicitor in both amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be quite in order for the conveyancing practitioner to obtain his own solicitor a tame solicitor or the building societys solicitor and ask him to advise <e> <s> if that happens it would comply with the requirement of the amendment <e> <s> therefore i suggest that perhaps this amendment needs a little more consideration between now and report stage <e> <s> it needs to be amplified a little <e>", "<cs> of course one agrees with the aim of the amendment but i am rather puzzled as to how it is to be carried out <e> <s> presumably the board itself will not have solicitors or staff to complete the unfinished work <e> <s> the board will have no compulsion over any other solicitor <e> <s> earlier this evening we heard that there are parts of scotland and i am conscious of this where there are not many solicitors or conveyancers for that matter available <e> <s> it would very much help if my noble and learned friend the lord advocate could tell us how these arrangements will be carried out and indeed enforced <e>", "<cs> when my noble and learned friend says nominate another solicitor does that mean that it is compulsory for the other solicitor who may be the only one available for miles around to do this <e> <s> is there some convention of the profession or requirement of law of which i am ignorant which requires the nominated solicitor to complete the job <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that an increasing number of foreigners especially from the ec have been bringing their money to this country in order that they may obtain justice in the high court in london for which they have such admiration <e> <s> will that increasing factor be borne in mind as part of the invisibles earned by this country <e>", "<cs> as this is the last of the amendments that we are considering to these four consolidation bills on planning we should not let the occasion pass without acknowledging the formidable task that the draftsmen and the officials had <e> <s> as members of the joint consolidation committee found they had a most punishing exercise to carry out <e> <s> though all consideration is necessary and welcome and it was particularly so in these instances it was made the more difficult because of our rather strange methods of legislation <e> <s> those concerned deserve great credit for what they have done on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down is there not a difficulty there <e> <s> unless an amendment goes to another place which enables the matter to be put right whatever view his noble friend may take it will be too late for the matter to be put right unless we do something now <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that a part-heard case in almost any court should have very high precedence indeed <e> <s> if orders of precedence are being arranged there should be a provision to ensure that counsel and/or solicitors involved in cases which for one reason or another become part heard should have a prior obligation to attend to finish those cases <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend replies perhaps i may say that the difficulty that i as an english laywer find is this <e> <s> subsection at the bottom of page raises a situation which would conflict with the situation envisaged in the governments new amendment which has now been added to the bill amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> in that amendment we talk of precedents in certain courts <e> <s> here we find that comparisons are to be made with the work in the sheriffs court <e> <s> here we have a reference to directly or indirectly inhibiting the freedom of a solicitor to appear in court or undertake <e>", "<cs> i naturally respect and am grateful for the intervention of the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e>

noble and learned lord lord emslie i find subsection in itself very difficult <e> <s> i should not go so far as to say that it is incomprehensible but the working of it will be difficult <e>", "<cs> four agencies will have to take decisions or at least be consulted before finality is reached as to the way in which a solicitor in scotland is to exercise a right of audience <e> <s> i have had to deal with many solicitors in scotland in their ordinary advisory capacity and helping to deal with estate matters and i find them admirable people <e> <s> i should not have thought that it was fair to impose upon them this tremendous palaver <e> <s> it is fair enough to involve the council of the law society that is their governing body which is democratically elected by them and is i hope a trusted body <e> <s> then there is the lord president <e> <s> it is right that the chief judge of scotland should have the opportunity of approving the rules and no doubt he generally does so <e> <s> but then after that they must go to the secretary of state who may not be a lawyer at all <e> <s> fortunately the present secretary of state is a member of the bar and understands everything <e> <s> then the director general of fair trading must be consulted as well <e>", "<cs> my lords if the english method is to be copied perhaps i may say that it is not a desirable precedent <e>", "<cs> does my noble and learned friend agree that he is the governments spokesman in this house <e> <s> there is collective responsibility of the cabinet of which my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland is a member <e> <s> it goes without saying that this is a scottish bill which the secretary of state as well as my noble and learned friend the lord advocate is responsible for

great respect i think education should come before training <e>", "<cs> on a financial matter of this kind one would expect to find some reference in the explanatory and financial memorandum under the heading financial and manpower effects of the bill <e> <s> although the extra cost expected under various other clauses is mentioned there is no mention of the extra cost to the secretary of state the director general of fair trading or indeed the lord president as a result of the two clauses which the noble and learned lord mentioned namely clauses and which will establish a very considerable administration <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that my mind does not always register as quickly as my noble and learned friend speaks <e> <s> for that i apologise <e> <s> however having listened to his explanation and having read the clause twice and i believe carefully i am trying to find out who has the last word in this matter <e> <s> i am trying to find out whether it is the lord president or

obligation to harmonise our laws <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one brief point <e> <s> when we were discussing the courts and legal services bill it was found necessary to include a definition of a barrister in england <e> <s> this clause refers to barristers in england <e> <s> i therefore suggest that a similar definition should be included <e> <s> i can tell the committee what it should be <e>

product of which is not needed by the public shall no longer take place <e> <s> subsection is based upon the assumption that a polluting process may by the procedure set out in the amendment be

the public interest to produce shall nevertheless be brought to an end at once <e> <s> that is what ought to happen <e> <s> having listened to my noble friend and looked at the powers in the bill it seems to me that we were much more likely to achieve that objective without subsection of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords of those various government initiatives which have been so helpful in

debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has made a very general statement about the laws of all the other european countries <e> <s> quite frankly it is a mistake to generalise in that way

bill and dovetailing this new clause with what is already in the bill will take several parliamentary days of great endeavour <e>", "<cs> i am a little puzzled <e> <s> i would have thought that if the amendment is sound in principle it should not be confined to wales but it should apply equally to the nature conservancy councils for england and for scotland respectively <e> <s> however i doubt whether it is necessary because the secretary of state when making those appointments will choose people who are capable and useful at advising on the responsibilities stated in the bill <e> <s> it would therefore rather surprise me if my noble friend on the front bench were to advise that the amendment should be accepted <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has made clear that his amendment is intended to refer to private bills but not to any public bill <e> <s> perhaps the position should be clarified so that the amendment refers to private bills instead of merely bills <e>", "<cs> can my noble

the meaning of the words in this context have regard to any advice <e> <s> i suggest that it means that the councils are obliged to receive and consider any advice given but that they are not obliged to follow it <e>", "<cs> this group of amendments is the most complicated and difficult to follow of any group of amendments that we have had to consider under the bill <e> <s> although i tried hard

party in those days made common cause with us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady phillips wondered why the cost of implementing the amendments had not been mentioned when they were before

junior minister on his behalf it was a discretion which had derived from the exercise in earlier times of the royal prerogative <e>", "<cs> i am anxious that the noble lord should not come to a conclusion until i have suggested to him and to my noble friend that there may be a bridge which will enable the two points of view to be reconciled <e> <s> that bridge depends upon whether my noble

perfectly right in saying my noble friends on the front bench will not dispute it that the grant of nationality and of a passport are not only matters that have always been at the discretion of the secretary of state but because the decisions are founded on the exercise of prerogative no reasons for them have ever been given <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord irvine was perfectly right in saying that for that reason the courts have never entertained appeals against such decisions <e>", "<cs> i cannot deny that that is so but that leads me to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they are

nationality citizenship or the issue of a passport <e> <s> however as my noble friend pointed out and as i said earlier it is still open to the courts to entertain an appeal on the ground that the method used the procedure followed was not correct <e> <s> it would have required express words which are not here to exclude the judicial review of those matters <e> <s> what is the noble lord worrying about <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not accept the amendment <e> <s> the proposal to take more people into this overcrowded country of ours with in places heavy unemployment

<e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord mishcon moved the same amendment at the committee stage i thought that he had done a useful service and i said that the argument that he put forward then deserved careful consideration <e> <s> i said that because i was anxious as he is still lest the secretary of states discretion to grant or refuse citizenship should seem to be taken away or impaired <e> <s> since the committee stage the noble lord and my noble friend lord ferrers have had time to consider the matter in the light of what was said in that debate <e> <s> so have i <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down there is one point that we should clear up if we may <e> <s> the question of the grant of nationality or citizenship has been governed by statute for many years

not <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble baroness as i missed her speech <e> <s> however i have a query on the way in which this amendment is drafted <e> <s> it states in the penultimate line of its first paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be so bold as to remind your lordships that this is not a committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will resist the amendment <e> <s> it seems to be a mandate for indefinite delay involving vast cost for <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness said this is entirely a question of the burden of proof <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will point out why the burden of proof should not be upon the employer <e> <s> in circumstances of that kind i should have thought that <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble lord will forgive my intervention <e> <s> i did not say that the tribunal would have no jurisdiction i said that the burden of proof at that stage would he upon the employer but that it would be within the tribunals jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at the attitude of the noble lord lord rochester because i have always understood that he joined us some years ago in legislating to ensure that the wishes of the majority of the members of each trade union should prevail <e> <s> unofficial action after the various ballots have taken place is the will only of the minority <e> <s> if one believes in democracy within the trade union movement then one must regard clause as a natural part of the step-by-step approach in the evolution of trade union law to ensure trade union democracy <e> <s> to remove clause would destroy one of the main purposes of the bill <e> <s> it was approved by another place after much consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that i am within the rules of order as the noble lord lord rochester was in prefacing his words with before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> my answer is this <e> <s> there must be some sanction to ensure that unofficial action does not go unimpeded in any way within the law <e> <s> i should have thought that clause which is carefully phrased and which gives certain rights to the employee as well as to the employer is the right consequence of parliaments recognition that unofficial action by the minority of people in a trade union after a ballot should be controlled in the way that clause controls it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not find this amendment complimentary to trade unions <e> <s> under this clause there has been a definition and an enlargement of the powers of trade unions which we should all welcome <e> <s> i should have thought that the so-called crotum that is a new expression in our statutory language as described in the amendment should be able to proceed on the assumption that the trade union concerned had taken full advantage of the powers given to it and that its procedures had been exhausted <e> <s> it is rather strange if the trade union is not prepared to take full advantage of the opportunities given to it by parliament <e> <s> we know how insistent trade unions have always been on their rights in the past <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that the amendment was not only unnecessary but uncomplimentary <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot speak with any authority from the ministerial point of view and i am not much of a consumer <e> <s> but i should like to say that in our primary legislation we go into far too much detail <e> <s> when such detail is found to be necessary as the noble lord lord mason pointed out and we should pay tribute to him as did the noble lord lord bruce for the initiatives that he has shown it is gratifying to find that a statutory instrument secondary legislation can bring forward such detail and that it is acceptable to noble lords on both sides of the house <e> <s> it is a lesson to us all that although we must have detail in some but not all matters on which we legislate it is better to have as much as possible put into secondary legislation as happens on this occasion rather than take up time with endless amendments trying to get the detail right in primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords does it not come to this a massive reduction by the soviet union of conventional weapons would be a much greater contribution to world peace than any reduction on our part of our modest nuclear artillery <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness seeks to amend an important provision and one understands that she considers that such matters should receive attention <e> <s> however with respect the provision in lines to on page of the bill is clear <e> <s> i doubt whether the issue is made any more clear by the proposed amendment <e> <s> indeed i fear that it introduces an element of uncertainty <e> <s> as the amendment seeks to insert the words where that person has ceased to hold that authority the question arises at what stage has that person ceased to hold the authority <e> <s> everything depends upon the stage at which that happens <e> <s> unless that issue is made clear we should do better without the amendment <e> <s> more <e>", "<cs> my lords surely one of the governments greatest achievements is what we have done over the past years by way of restoring democracy within the trade unions and declaring the rights of trade union members <e> <s> i hope that those concerned will not mind my drawing attention to this fact but the liberal democrat party so ably represented by the noble lord lord rochester and the noble baroness lady seear has tried to explain and excuse its change of attitude by saying if i understand the arguments correctly which i do not always find easy that it is necessary to obtain a good balance between the rights of employers and employees <e> <s> but this bill does just that <e> <s> this can be seen if we look at the plain words of the first two lines of clause of the bill <e> <s> it is worth emphasising this point and putting it on record <e> <s> the clause begins with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i do not have to take up too much of your lordships time by reminding the noble lord of the appalling circumstances which existed especially in the years from to <e> <s> they were years in which through the efforts of one man namely red robbo the nationalised british motor industry was said to be losing about million a day <e> <s> i mentioned this during a debate some years ago and in any event it is all on record <e> <s> it is quite absurd to attribute the fall in unofficial strikes to something which happened before we came into power <e> <s> it is due to the results of our legislation there is no doubt whatever about that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord lord clinton-davis said based on his own interesting experience about an environmental agency is most fascinating <e> <s> however with great respect to him it has nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> the amendment deals with an entirely separate situation namely ministerial responsibility within the united kingdom government for the matters in this bill <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord lord mcintosh i suggest that not only is his amendment unnecessary but it could be counter-productive in part for the reasons mentioned by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am ashamed to say that the noble lord is right <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships <e> <s> i hope that i shall not have to repeat the same speech when we reach amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope to do better as the session gets under way <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to resume and conclude the speech which i prematurely and mistakenly made on the previous amendment <e> <s> i shall not repeat what i said but i wonder whether the noble lord lord mcintosh has realised that the days when parliament legislated to define the responsibilities of ministers and their designation the responsibilities of junior ministers and so on passed about or years ago <e> <s> now the prime minister decides and sometimes changes the designations <e> <s> i believe that certain appointments have to be confirmed by order in council but in parliament we no longer purport to control these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh has raised a very important matter <e> <s> when we hear the reply from the front bench i hope we shall learn that there is no great disagreement between him and the government on this matter <e> <s> i do not know whether the method he suggests is technically the best one <e> <s> however i see no reason why the matter should not be dealt with in this bill <e> <s> if it is not dealt with in this bill it will have to be dealt with in some other primary legislation in a later session <e> <s> in this bill we purport to be dealing with integrated pollution control and air control by local authorities <e> <s> therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down and perhaps i may say that i welcome what she has said can she make it abundantly plain that there is already statutory power to make such a regulation <e> <s> is there a statutory obligation to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way and for his kind words <e> <s> does he not remember that our country is a member of the ec and is bound by directives issued by the ec and by regulations made by the council of ministers and approved by the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with the purpose of the amendment of my noble friend lord norrie <e> <s> the circumstances are unusual <e> <s> it is not often that one sees in a statute a power given to a minister to make plans <e> <s> it is generally assumed that ministers will make plans without having to be given the power by parliament <e> <s> here it is merely an optional power to make plans for the purposes stated in paragraphs c and d of subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords while not disputing the wisdom of the decision may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that the fire service college has not only provided training for members of the fire service but also that it has been at the forefront of technical progress in methods of doing so <e> <s> will he give an assurance that that important part of the colleges work will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords as such a large part of the world problem arises within the commonwealth would it not be worthwhile considering what the commonwealth secretariat might do in order to spread information about how to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> however one must not blame the noble lord lord clinton-davis for trying to ensure that we are creating a criminal liability in this connection <e> <s> in my opinion we do so quite clearly by the application of subsection to the duty described at some length and very fully in subsection <e> <s> therefore with respect to the noble lord i say to him that amendment no <e> <s> a is not necessary <e> <s> moreover even if it were it would be most unusual to include therein the words <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment involves a purely administrative instruction to the secretary of state to take certain action which he is likely to take in any event as the implementation of the scheme evolves in future years <e> <s> i think that we are sometimes over-zealous in trying to cover every conceivable administrative possibility <e> <s> the purpose of legislation is to make laws for the better ordering of society in the hope that people will obey them when the instructions in them are quite specific <e> <s> but for us to continue on many occasions indicating in the legislation the follow-up action that ministers should take is i believe over-zealous to put it mildly <e> <s> it is unnecessary because we can always question ministers and raise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me it was the custom in another place to refer to queens counsel as being learned but here in your lordships house one is not considered to be learned if one is merely a queens counsel <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e> <s> i find it a strange proposition <e> <s> after all the chief inspector is appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> as i understand it he will be an official of the department <e> <s> it is unheard of for ministers who are given power or responsibility for issuing codes of practice to do so other than on their own behalf and on their own responsibility <e>

lord clinton-davis may be surprised and happy to know that on this occasion i believe him to be on a somewhat better point <e> <s> however i do not think that the exact way he has proposed to do this is appropriate <e> <s> if the amendment had read <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend will not accept this amendment although i appreciate the motive behind it <e> <s> the noble lord is really saying that we have to write something into the bill to say that what is going to be done has got to be well done <e> <s> surely we always intend that whenever we give a power or require something to be done in the public interest <e> <s> it must be well done <e> <s> that is all that the amendment states <e> <s> it would constitute a sheer waste of words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend for making that clear <e> <s> he very courteously wrote to me during the recess to say that the government would table an amendment which would require the waste regulation authority to consult the nra when dealing with closed sites which are likely to cause pollution of water <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will allow me to intervene <e> <s> one of the most frequently used excuses is that a programme is drama or fiction <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that the presence of my noble friend lord byron on these benches is very welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the part of the valley of the great ouse in huntingdonshire where she lives there are very large pits which were excavated for sand and gravel and that strangely enough they are now remarkably full of water <e> <s> can she say whether those pits are or will be under the control of the newly-formed water companies so that those pits can be regarded as

would take away the amendment and rectify the drafting as regards that word then i am sure that that will give a great deal of satisfaction not only to my noble friends but also to a very wide circle of people interested in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a member of the cpre and i normally support amendments moved in this house which that organisation has drafted or inspired but i regret

instinctive feeling that my noble friend lady blatch will accept the amendment <e> <s> if that happens we can then be delighted that the first attempt to improve government legislation by my noble

affirmative resolution of parliament <e> <s> such a departure should be the subject of primary legislation if it is to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords clause to which my noble friend referred gives power to the secretary of state to give effect to community and other international obligations <e> <s> however clause to which this new clause in the amendment moved by the noble lord lord clinton-davis

however it is only right to place on record that nearly all of the commons amendments result from criticisms and representations made by your lordships when the bill was before us and further representations made in another place <e> <s> the government were very responsive to the representations made in another place <e> <s> however much one may regret the style of drafting and the mass of amendments to be considered it is only fair to record on behalf of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and others in the government who have co-operated with him that in substance we shall welcome nearly all the amendments <e> <s> the amendments to the amendments are of a very limited character which shows that for the most part we should be able to welcome them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how much i welcome amendment no <e> <s> because i was one of the first to draw attention to the dangers which could arise especially with oppressive debt collectors <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has dealt with that in such a way that that difficulty is removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement made by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor when moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i broadly agree with it <e> <s> as to the points made with great sincerity by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway i do not see the difficulties that he has attempted to describe arising from what was said in another place at report stage <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general answered various questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been looking for some guidance as to what is a registered foreign lawyer <e> <s> it is not set out in the general definitions clause at the end of the bill nor is it in clause <e> <s> can my noble and learned friend enlighten us <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend replies i should like to endorse what the noble lord lord hutchinson said <e> <s> i am particularly concerned by the words or in part <e> <s> that could mean a very tenuous and very slight degree of employment <e> <s> the idea that somebody can be brought in perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i put on record that from the point of view of the bar this is a very necessary and welcome amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are considering about amendments on this occasion <e> <s> we have found a group of amendments which merely place into legislation matters which have always been understood as matters of tradition integrity and honour <e> <s> it surprises me that it is necessary to legislate at all for these issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that those who raised this matter with me are grateful for the immense amount of trouble taken in getting it right <e> <s> i should like to add their thanks to mine <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand amendment no <e> <s> a little better having listened to the speech of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that explanation <e> <s> however he may find that administratively it may be as well for his department to give some guidance so that the way back through the bill can easily be found <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very important clause <e> <s> i draw your lordships attention to new subsection as proposed in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> paragraph a refers to sections and and describes them as <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house naturally i had considered that as a possibility <e> <s> but even working that through i cannot find that any of the clauses including the new clauses and relate to discrimination by or in relation to barristers or to discrimination by or in relation to advocates <e> <s> the present clause will be renumbered and will come after clause <e> <s> therefore there is something rather odd <e> <s> it may be that when the matter goes back to another place simple renumbering can be carried out <e> <s> however we must get it right and it does not appear to be right at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i hope only that my noble and learned friend is right <e> <s> we must get it right and if it is found not to be right it will have to be adjusted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington may wonder as i do how subsection of the amendment will operate <e> <s> i would not have expected it to be written into the provision but i would have hoped that my noble and learned friend could let us know whether the power he is given to direct that crown prosecutors may have rights of audience in particular crown courts will be exercised after consultation with professional bodies including the law society the bar council and perhaps the criminal bar association and the leaders of the circuits <e> <s> it would be highly desirable for there to be such consultation before there is an extension of the rights of appearance of crown prosecutors <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has been on or at the woolsack for nearly seven and a half hours <e> <s> i think that is something that has to go into the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all enjoy documentary programmes <e> <s> i should have thought that there is no difference between any of us on that <e> <s> the question is whether the two words and documentaries must be written into the bill having been deleted by members of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord has said although four specific subjects are mentioned in the clause i ask him to bear in mind that there is nothing in the clause which precludes other matters in broadcasting being dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in various ways the prime minister has shown herself to be a better european than some of her opposite numbers on the council of ministers <e> <s> to give several examples i mention her initiative with regard to the cap her attitude on the uruguay round and her insistence earlier that restrictions on capital movements should be abandoned before <e> <s> bearing in mind the words of the noble lord lord ezra is my noble friend aware that this country is not bound by treaty to have a european currency which excludes the use of sterling <e> <s> will he tell us the length of notice that the prime minister was given before these proposals for the future of monetary union were considered and decisions only preliminary decisions of course were reached upon them the other day <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord jenkin has pointed out that the main problem is that of stray dogs <e> <s> surely he must realise that the people who have owned strays are the irresponsible ones who will not register them <e> <s> therefore the registration scheme does not deal with the major problem <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend assure us that the steps that she has mentioned will be <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed surely the important point is for example that there should not be rats or other wild animals on goods trains or vehicles bringing rabies into the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the present right honourable member for huntingdon is my successor <e> <s> may i assure your lordships that any undertaking that he has given can be relied upon <e>", "<cs> my lords while fully accepting what my noble friend has said would there not be an advantage in this country setting an example to the rest of the world in this matter as in some others <e>", "<cs> my lords who exercises the prerogative of mercy at present <e> <s> who would exercise it or advise upon it under the proposed new constitution <e>"]
