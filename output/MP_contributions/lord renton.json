["<cs> my lords may i as the parent of a handicapped child and as chairman of the national society for the mentally handicapped thank my noble friend for the statement she has made <e> <s> in doing so i should like to say that in the national society the fact that the government have accepted our views on the warnock report is greatly welcomed <e> <s> one can understand that the present education bill would not be a suitable vehicle for wide implementation of the warnock report but i hope that my noble friend will heed the suggestions made for a limited implementation of it in particular with regard to parents rights <e> <s> parents of mentally handicapped children <e>", "<cs> my lords although to my mind there is a good answer to the case put forward by the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble lord lord mishcon i think it would be better if the answer to it came authoritatively from the front bench instead of less authoritatively from me <e> <s> therefore i wish to confine myself to the point made by my noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> on the assumption that the driver is going to remain liable under this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i concede as my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has said that this is a very narrow point indeedi can envisage and perhaps other noble lords would do so as well the rare case in which it was said that the accused although he had taken such steps as were reasonable in the circumstances had not done all that he might have done <e> <s> the imagination of the tribunal might be used even at the suggestion of the prosecution to think up something else he might have done and did not do <e> <s> the use of the word all would give rise to just that situation in an admittedly rare case <e> <s> that being so i do think that the plea which has been made to my noble and learned friend to take this away and consider it again would be better than having a division upon it <e> <s> i do therefore appeal to my noble and learned friend not to close his mind at this point and force the house to a division but to say he will think about it further <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some reluctance that i intervene at this stage because it is said that we are dealing with minor and consequential amendments <e> <s> nevertheless the rehabilitation of offenders is a matter which can be of very great importance to individuals <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords again one is grateful to my noble fiend lord mansfield for his explanation <e> <s> here i am able to praise the draftsman because in these very complicated amendments he has used the textual method of amending rather than the non-textual <e> <s> but on the drafting of it i wonder if i may just seek information on one point it arises at the last line of page of the marshalled list where we see the words shall cease to have effect and at the second line of page where those same words appear and they appear again three times towards the end of page <e> <s> i have always understood that the words cease to have effect do not have the result of actually deleting those words from the statute which we are seeking to amend <e> <s> in other words we are saying those words shall remain in the statute but shall cease to have effect <e> <s> that is not repealing <e> <s> but the intention here seems to he to repeal <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be convenient if i make a few brief comments following what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has said <e> <s> he suggested earlier that the government might very well provide notes on clauses or at any rate enable us to see them in the library <e> <s> there are good precedents for that <e> <s> i think that when the noble and learned lord lord gardiner was lord chancellor he broke with precedent and made notes on clauses available whether in that way or in some other way i am not sure <e> <s> but it is certainly very helpful especially during the committee stage of a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will agree with me when i say that my noble friend lady pike has done a great service by telling us in great detail of the work of the wrvs work which we greatly admire under her distinguished chairmanship <e> <s> think she came very close indeed to saying and i hope that she will not mind my pointing this out that in addition to the work which traditionally has fallen upon the wrvs they should also take on the work which used to be done by the civil defence organisation <e> <s> she seemed to me to come very close indeed to that <e> <s> i shall be coming back to the part to be played by volunteers but before i go any further i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lord murton of lindisfarne upon his maiden speech <e> <s> i am delighted that he made it on this occasion bearing in mind his very distinguished service as an officer in the territorial army <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that clarification and i am sure the true position is as my noble friend has stated it <e> <s> the noble lord lord shinwell said that we want a vast army of volunteers <e> <s> i think that is a slight contradiction in terms expressed in that way <e> <s> we assume that the opportunities given the needs of the moment the building on existing societies will produce a lot of volunteers but each of the volunteers must have a specific job or jobs to do and only the local authorities can ensure that that happens <e> <s> therefore we get back to this proposition that whatever the degree of independence of each of the voluntary bodies may be there has still to be some kind of direction and that direction has got to come from the <e>", "<cs> my lords a further reason for supporting this amendment is that if we turn to clause we find that the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster when referred to in this bill is to be considered to be the chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house to speak again i think that the noble lord lord reigate <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take that advice but i think my noble friend will have to reconsider what he said about the effect of the use of the words chancellor of the duchy of lancaster <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the further progress of the bill in this house as well as in another <e>", "<cs> i beg to differ from my noble friend lord eccles <e> <s> in doing so i speak as chairman of the national society for the mentally handicapped in which so many members on both sides of this committee have taken an active and helpful part <e> <s> i do <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all your lordships have been impressed as i have by the sincerity of my noble friend lady young and her desire to help <e> <s> one particularly welcomes her undertaking to give further thought to clause relating to information <e> <s> however to the extent that the crux of my noble friends argument is that the effect of accepting this amendment would be to place contradictory duties on local education authorities i wish to take up the point made by lord stewart <e> <s> it seems to me that there will be no simultaneous contradiction if the job is properly carried out <e> <s> in other words in this bill we are assuming that the provisions with regard to special education and handicapped people in the act are to remain until the warnock legislation comes on to the statute book <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i have been through this report pages of it but i have not read every word <e> <s> however i have been through as one does the summary of recommendations and i cannot find anything in that summary which deals with parental choice as a specific recommendation or parental right of appeal <e> <s> i cannot find the equivalent in other words of clauses and of the bill <e> <s> it is implied in the discussion in various parts of the warnock report that parents should be consulted and properly informed <e> <s> to that extent the provisions of clause are anticipated by warnock <e>", "<cs> i should like to remind my noble friends on the front bench that the royal commission on legal services in its report last year recommended that there should be mandatory grants for those who wish to study for the vocational training for the bar or the solicitors branch of our profession <e> <s> i am sure that the desirability of having a broad social spread of entry to both branches of the profession is one which would commend itself to your lordships in the public interest <e> <s> i am glad to say that for many years we have had a fairly broad social spread and some of our very distinguished judges in the higher judiciary have come from fairly humble social backgrounds <e> <s> nevertheless recent times have shown that it is not easy for all those who might do well in the profession and ultimately make fine judges to find the wherewithal to go through with the professional training which necessarily lasts some years <e>", "<cs> i wish to ascertain the governments intentions with regard to the provisions of milk in special schools <e> <s> at present under the education milk act all children at special schools get free milk whether they are in maintained or non-maintained schools and so do children under years of age <e> <s> i think there is some confused and sometimes rather political thinking about the supply of free milk in schools <e> <s> a few children including some handicapped children have an obesity problem and may be better without milk <e> <s> then there are some other children who are allergic to milkthey simply do not like it and will not take it <e> <s> but most children including handicapped children do need milk and benefit from it <e> <s> i am concerned to see that all those children who are at special schools get it if they need it <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend be so good as to answer the point i made about special schools <e>", "<cs> it was not on the drafting point it was on the question of what is to be the future of supplied milk to special schoolsthat was what i was asking <e>"]
