["<cs> my lords as chairman of a major british shipping <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to comment on the bill on behalf of the united kingdom shipping industry <e> <s> i speak not only as chairman of a major shipping company but also as a past president of the general council of british shipping <e> <s> but before doing so i am pleased to be the first to congratulate the noble and learned lord lord renton on his admirable and very learned maiden speech <e> <s> i feel i am in a good position to do so having waited for over years to make my maiden speech about five years ago <e> <s> in view of the noble and learned lords years service in another place and as an eminent barrister clearly it was not the ordeal for him as it was for me and we look forward to his future contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a tradition of this house that those taking part in a debate should declare an interest <e> <s> to do so in a debate on defence is surely unnecessary for all citizens have a vital and proper interest <e> <s> but i should declare a particular interest as chairman of a large shipowning company and of an international trading group as well as a director of oil companies <e> <s> this means that i have an important interest in and responsibility for a wide range of merchant shipping of all types and of trading activities throughout the world which would be devoted to the national and nato effort in time of conflict <e> <s> these include cross-channel ferries container ships general cargo ships bulk carriers tankers oil rig supply ships and passenger ships which i only mention to remind your lordships of the wide variety of merchant shipping operations for which defence is required <e> <s> it was surprising that in the recent debate in another place little was said about merchant shipping specifically <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to comment on the bill on behalf of the united kingdom shipping industry <e> <s> i speak as a past president of the general council of british shipping and declare an interest as chairman of po <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the british shipping industry in which i declare an interest i should like to support my noble friend lord lyell in his rejection of the amendment <e> <s> in theory all shippers organisations representatives of shippers and where practicable individual shippers all demand consultation <e> <s> the designating process is intended to reationalise and simplify the consultation procedure <e> <s> clearly the regulation that empowers the secretary of state to designate in this way must be carefully worded so that it does not exclude from the consultation process those parties which have a legitimate and substantial interest in the trade concerned <e> <s> it is to be hoped that normally their interests can be adequately represented by the british shippers council and other similar <e>", "<cs> i welcome clause which will provide very useful aid to the shipping industry <e> <s> all aid for training is welcome when times are hard and all expenditure that is not vital to the running of a ship has to be cut back <e> <s> in the short term training is not vital and times have been very hard <e> <s> now there is a growing shortage of trained officers coming through and this aid should stimulate increased training efforts by companies <e>", "<cs> i should like to welcome this clause as an aid for the industry <e> <s> repatriation costs will particularly help companies whose ships are permanently trading abroad <e> <s> crews have to be repatriated for leave every four to six months <e> <s> costs of flying them back from say japan or australia and flying crew replacements out to the ship is very substantial <e> <s> as in the previous case how the governments scheme will work still has to be explained to the industry <e> <s> in principle this clause will provide help similar to that provided for many years to norwegian danish and swedish owners by their governments <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment of my noble friend lord mottistone which as he said will effectively repeal section of the merchant shipping act <e> <s> i do not want to repeat all the points made by my noble friend but merely add that between and there were short ferry stoppages often involving several ferries in each port <e> <s> in many cases though not all the section procedure was used <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> as he said this clause will form part of the criminal law and so it is important that those at risk should know precisely what matters they are liable for <e> <s> subsection paragraphs a b and c are already comprehensive in scope <e> <s> subsection d would merely give a secretary of state or the director of public prosecutions a catch-all or as my noble friend said a safety net that they could use <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the shipping industry does not seek to avoid proper responsibility for dangerously unseaworthy ships <e> <s> but is seems right that liability for the severe penalties provided by the clause should only fall on those who are responsible that is those who have failed to discharge their obligations and who are aware of it <e> <s> shipowners frequently enter into demise charters or management agreements which place the entire operational responsibility on the charterer or ship manager <e> <s> if the owner knows that those responsibilities have not been properly discharged he must ensure that the ship is made safe <e> <s> often he cannot know because the ship is physically far away <e> <s> overloading or undermanning can happen on just one voyage with disastrous consequences <e>"]
