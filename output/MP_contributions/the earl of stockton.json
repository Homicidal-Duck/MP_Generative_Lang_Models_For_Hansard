["<cs> my lords as i rise to make a maiden speech in your lordships house i ask for the forbearance and sympathy which is traditionally extended to someone in that position <e> <s> i cannot help recording that it is just years since i underwent the same ordeal in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will not be thought impertinent of me as a very new boy in your lordships house to

got over that hurdle <e> <s> he can certainly feel happy that both in matter and in manner he has made a most distinguished contribution to our debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank your lordships for the debate and the interesting speeches that have been made <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> why not <e> <s> it has been for years <e>", "<cs> i must say frankly that i do not like this bill at all but we settled that point at second reading <e> <s> i do not like it out of a traditional feeling that we are sacrificing by what i can only call a sort of pakistani relief act a very old tradition because that is the chief object of the bill to make a lot of small shops legal which are now illegal <e> <s> we are sacrificing a very old tradition <e> <s> we are making another move in the gradual secularisation of our people and in abandoning the old principles which made our forebears great and kept them powerful <e> <s> however that is not the point now we have done that <e>", "<cs> it is rather a pettifogging argument to say that the drafting stops at the age of <e> <s> i should have thought that there would have been no difficulty about a phrase that made it clear that the provisions covered the whole of a persons working life <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel myself to be something of a usurper in your lordships house first because the sound of the name that i am proud to bear will evoke memories of one who despite his sadly short stay on these benches displayed such a master of the art or craft of speaking that his successors will perforce be in his oratorical shadow until those memories have faded and secondly because were it not for the untimely death of my father who was known and loved by many of your lordships in another place he would be here in my stead today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the government on the bill before your lordships house <e> <s> the general re-shaping of the law of copyright into a logical framework and in plain clear language is welcomed by all connected with the creation dissemination and protection of intellectual property <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his assurances and i bow to the weight of noble and learned opinion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his assurances and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am rather unhappy to hear the minister dismiss typeface in such a cavalier fashion <e> <s> it has long been established that typeface has a particular and extremely concrete quality <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lords grandfather who made his fortune out of the use of typeface in its most concrete form would probably have agreed with me <e> <s> i support the point made by the noble lord lord morton of shuna but i do not care to delay the committee any further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord morton of shuna for proposing the amendment standing in my name <e> <s> i think that this must be an oversight on the part of the government one in which they have a vested interest for both the stationery office and the ordnance survey claim copyright in maps and the hydrographer royal in charts <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend can sort out the matter in dispute in this area as ordnance survey maps extend down to the low tidemark and the hydrographer royals charts up to the high tidemark <e> <s> could it be that this strip of shingle seaweed and crabs is the source of a great territorial dispute <e>", "<cs> i beg to differ with my noble friend the minister <e> <s> his comment on maps and charts implied that they are always generated from a third party who would be the copyright holder <e> <s> in many cases particularly in the provision of such material in educational books they are generated by the publisher of the original work and should attract the same copyright as the rest of the typographical arrangement <e>", "<cs> it will come as no surprise to my noble friend that i am in support of him and not in support of the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> in the case of the publisher as opposed to the designer of typographical arrangement we are of course referring primarily to the question of the person employed in the publishing house <e> <s> clearly it is of paramount importance that the copyright in work produced within a publishing house remains with the employer <e> <s> for example i have the honour to have published a number of novels by the noble lord lord willis <e> <s> obviously the copyright in his manuscript is his <e> <s> however it has been the occasion that my noble friend lord hardinge has been employed by me to write what is called the blurb on the inside of the jacket <e> <s> it has also been the occasion that i have found lord hardinges praise of lord willis skills and acumen insufficiently adulatory <e> <s> i have chosen to amend it <e> <s> this amendment would <e>", "<cs> very wise <e> <s> but hypothetically this amendment would imply that the copyright in the blurb would he vested simultaneously in my noble friend lord hardinge and in me and in the publishing company which is clearly an absurd situation <e>", "<cs> we have to draw a clear distinction here between employees of inventing companies and the employees of other companies <e> <s> an inventor is employed to invent <e> <s> publishers employ their staff to assist the author in the necessary transformation of his manuscript so that it can be read and appreciated by a wider public and in doing this the copyright material is created <e> <s> but this is purely incidental to their employment <e> <s> it is a good estimate to say that only per cent <e> <s> of the authors in this country are employed whereas more than per cent <e> <s> of the inventors are employed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord willis and a number of other noble lords appear to have confused the position of authors and employees <e> <s> nobody is in contention with subsection of this clause <e> <s> however the employee is in a different position to that of the author <e> <s> the employee receives a regular salary he receives holiday pay sickness benefit pension entitlement and a regular review of his salary <e> <s> therefore his or her work belongs to the employer <e>", "<cs> it is the practice of the industry that the copyright in the jacket is held by the artist <e>", "<cs> this is an area where we are attempting to fix the ground rules for the first two decades of the next century <e> <s> if we think of years ago what we now know as the information or the communication revolution was no more than a match head in the white heat of technology <e> <s> colour television was just with us the first led watches had just arrived glowing red the long playing record reigned supreme and car radios were just that <e> <s> hi-fi was for experts with soldering irons and the only pocket calculator was a slide rule <e>", "<cs> secondary acts normally require a guilty knowledge and in the act this was the case <e> <s> i can see no reason why infringers should be given this loophole by the government which would make the task of protecting copyright more difficult <e> <s> therefore i am pleased to support the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord williams <e>", "<cs> in the second reading debate i expressed considerable reservations about the clause <e> <s> as i forecast the minister retreated behind the bulwarks of the european communities act <e> <s> in supporting my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i should like for the convenience of the committee also to speak to amendment no <e> <s> in my name and in so doing draw to the committees attention an error in the marshalled list <e> <s> it should read <e>", "<cs> i should like to remind my noble friend the minister that the reassurances he has given as far as the other european community countries are concerned ring a little hollow in the ears of some of us <e> <s> there is for example no great austrian publishing industry threatening to flood the german market with cheap editions nor do the french canadians loom over the french publishing industry but we have a rival in our own language uniquely among the community countries with a home market of million people not only ready but actually waiting for the opportunity to import cheap american editions into this country <e>", "<cs> fair dealing while not defined in statute is an expression which is both well known and clearly understood both by the professionals and by the lay persons involved in it <e> <s> as an example of a rather less esoteric case than that quoted by the noble and learned lord lord denning there was the case of coles notes <e> <s> some of the members of the committee may have had occasion to refer to those notes in the weeks prior to their final examinations <e> <s> in that case mrsillitose had an action against mcgraw hill in in which the rules for fair dealing as regards those kinds of dealings were laid down <e>", "<cs> we alluded to this issue at an earlier stage of the committee and on second reading i bored the members of this place at some length <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord williams of elvel excludes publishers of learned journals from the list of commercial firms <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord howie for having outlined the operation of such firms <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the word systematic is not identified in the bill but it has been in common use in the publishing industry <e> <s> systematic single copying was the practice in some schools with copies of a copyright work being made for an entire class or for an entire group of students <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i had not considered the british library interlending practice <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for those assurances and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fear that while all right-minded people must be sympathetic with the broad-brush picture painted by the noble lord lord peston i am extremely concerned that the effect of his amendment would be not only to include the red cross and the police but any home or company premises <e> <s> if his amendment stands what is to stop me claiming that my reading of extracts of his economics books in my office is part of an educational process for me <e> <s> it undoubtedly would be if i understood them <e> <s> but neither he nor his publisher would be especially happy about that <e>", "<cs> during the debate on this clause we have as yet had no convincing exposition of the governments intentions towards the whole question of copying by educational establishments <e> <s> the only explanation that i can come up with is that the negotiations referred to by my noble friend lord dundee were the outcome of some historical internecine struggle between the department of education and the department of trade <e> <s> the clause makes no sense at all and is in direct contravention of article section of the berne convention <e> <s> i ask my noble friend the minister whether he can give an undertaking to have another look at this clause and see whether he can settle the dispute between his department and that of my noble friend lady hooper who i am pleased to see in her seat <e>", "<cs> this is the sort of proposal that on the face of it seems eminently reasonable hut in fact could do considerable damage to the publishers of learned journals and more importantly to the writers of the original articles <e> <s> i am aware that the noble lord lord peston does not write for any other motive than increasing the sum of human knowledge and perhaps for glory <e> <s> however i can assure him that any diminution of the margins of learned journals would mean that his articles probably would not be published at all <e> <s> therefore it is important that short-term loan of a journal or an article placed in the library for students to read must be licensed and paid for <e> <s> this proposal has been agreed by the publishers of the learned and professional journals with the committee of vice-chancellors and principals for an experimental year with the universities operating the licences <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister is not going to throw out the experiment before we have at least had the time to evaluate it <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his assurances and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> a flying saucer <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reassurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on the one or two occasions when i have had to enforce copyright not in this country but under very similar circumstances the mechanism by which i have done it is where i have been informed there are copyright or piracy provisions to go into the shop and purchase a copy of the offending material <e>

morton of shuna has exaggerated the volatility of the representatives of the book trade and other trades in this country if he thinks a breach of the peace is likely to happen here <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord cullen of ashbourne goes a long way to being interference in the contractual relationship <e> <s> it is tantamount to compulsory licensing <e> <s> is it up to the tribunal to think fit <e> <s> surely it is for the parties to the voluntary agreement to think fit <e> <s> does the tribunal need the very

able to firm up the assurances he gave the book trade that there are no plans at the moment to bring books magazines and newspapers within the net of vat <e> <s> surely with a surplus estimated at
