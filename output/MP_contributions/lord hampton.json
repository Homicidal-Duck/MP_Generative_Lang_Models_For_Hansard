["<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to take this opportunity to congratulate the noble lord lord elton on his recent appointment at the northern ireland office <e> <s> i understand that he is to have special responsibility for education and we know that this is a subject in which he has no little interest and much valuable experience <e> <s> the way in which the young are brought up today will critically influence the relations of the two communities tomorrow <e> <s> we wish the noble lord every success in his challenging but eminently worthwhile task <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be held in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> is that a sufficient answer for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> that is right my lords yes <e> <s> i shall now briefly deal further with what should i believe be both tactical and strategic aims for the province <e> <s> fortunately there is much accord between the three main political parties on this and this is one point which gives me grounds for hope <e> <s> i am glad that virtually all to use the secretary of states own words in the other place and the noble lords words in your lordships house of the recommendations of the bennett report are to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is little that i should add on this point <e> <s> we feel that we must support the inclusion of the inla in this order <e> <s> it goes against the grain for we like to support the liberty of the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to thank the noble lord lord elton for repeating the statement <e> <s> we accept that unfortunately there is no magic solution to the problems of the province and that the secretary of state has needed time for consultation and discussion with the various parties over there <e> <s> we now look forward to studying the consultative document planned to serve as the basis of a conference and certainly would not question its stated aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord dunleath for putting down this important question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount allow me to intervene <e> <s> if i take him aright i think he is suggesting that proportional representation would be a dangerous method to use <e> <s> but it would be a very different result if it were a -member constituency covering the whole of northern ireland <e> <s> may i make that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all welcome this debate on northern ireland so ably opened by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i should like to say how good it is to have the noble baroness lady airey with us tonight <e> <s> of course it is right that we should consider the grave economic and social problems of the province but i believe at the same time that we should not forget those factors that give grounds for hope <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour and following a long and informed debate i hope your lordships will bear with me if i make just three points <e> <s> as my noble friends lord wigoder and lord barrington have done i am putting my personal views and not speaking for my colleagues <e> <s> as a liberal i should like to dissociate myself from that horrible wordliberalisation an ugly word i submit as used in this context for an ugly process <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we must thank the noble lord lord dunleath for opening a debate on northern ireland and its problems and for doing it so ably <e> <s> among such a distinguished list of speakers with so much personal experience of the problems under discussion i shall only speak briefly to put a liberal view <e> <s> at the moment in general we support the government policy <e> <s> we seek only to offer criticism that is constructive <e> <s> i do not see any value in the maxim that the duty of an opposition is to oppose where opposition is considered a merit in itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i might ask the noble lord lord elton one question about article which is headed restriction on removal of a child from northern ireland <e> <s> this starts <e>", "<cs> my lords i will speak only briefly in support of the bill and i speak for two reasons <e> <s> first i was a member of the committee which first vetted this bill before leave was given for it to be introduced in your lordships house <e> <s> secondly i do so in order to attempt to refute the implication that was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that it was a noble friend and colleague of mine lord grey who asked this question because i think it is a matter of much greater importance than the short list of speakers might suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for repeating this statement <e> <s> we shall of course read the command paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that a forerunner of the sports council was the central council for physical recreation and in fact that body was set up during the recession of the thirties <e> <s> is the noble lord convinced that in the present situation of unemployment and with greater leisure in the future this is not a false economy and a retrograde step <e>", "<cs> my lords i like the comment that no one who isnt confused really understands the irish problem today <e> <s> it gives me hope <e> <s> as i talk with more men and women from ireland and especially from the north i find them delightful but sometimes contradictory even of what they themselves said earlier <e> <s> only a few days ago someone said to me that the security position in northern ireland had greatly improved over the last few years but later <e>", "<cs> my lords following the change of timetable for today at a fairly late date i hope the house will excuse me if i cannot be present at the end of the business for northern ireland <e> <s> i too would like to thank the noble lord lord elton for explaining the situation and i have listened with interest to what both noble lords have said <e> <s> i shall speak only briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords the ulster prison officers who are much respected for the courage they show in fulfilling their arduous and often dangerous duties work a different shift system and are paid differently from their colleagues in england and wales <e> <s> should not a further appeal be made to convince them that they would not breach solidarity by continuing to perform their duties as usual and that their first loyalty should be to the community <e> <s> there might otherwise be a much greater risk in ulster than on the mainland through the present tensions and the fact that a much greater proportion of prisoners in northern ireland are committed for serious crimes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house must join in hoping sincerely that the present industrial action by prison officers in northern ireland will be speedily brought to an end <e> <s> as has been said they are not in disagreement with the authorities on the issue which has caused the dispute in england and wales but at present are taking action purely in sympathy with their colleagues over here <e> <s> we must all hope that those in northern ireland may speedily see fit to resume their duties in full in the execution of which they have earned so much respect <e> <s> in the meantime i cannot see that it is profitable to oppose this remand temporary provisions order for the province which has to be renewed a month at a time <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord elton for his introduction of it and i was also interested to hear what the noble lord lord blease had to say and the questions he asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for going over this somewhat complicated order <e> <s> i wish to speak very briefly <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to what the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for explaining this order too <e> <s> i had anticipated that my noble friend lord beaumont would be speaking to it because of his experience on education and his interest in northern ireland but unfortunately due to a tragedy in his family he is not able to be here <e> <s> i am glad of course that the charges for transport were dropped as the minister said and that he feels that what is happening in relation to nursery schools does not mean that they are being downgraded <e> <s> we have listened to the noble lord lord blease who obviously has a very different view of things <e> <s> i can only express my own view that nursery schools are extremely important perhaps particularly important in northern ireland and i trust the government will do all they can not to downgrade them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for the way in which he introduced the order <e> <s> i listened with great interest to the critical questioning by the noble lord lord blease and i was surprised that at the end of his speech he said he supported the order <e> <s> i thought he was on the other side <e>", "<cs> while not disagreeing with that policy my lords is the noble lord aware that all i am saying that we should give credit where credit is due <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should again like to thank the noble lord lord elton for introducing this order and i welcome very much what he has said <e> <s> i should also like here to refer briefly to the subject which is so much in the forefront of the news today the hunger strikers in the maze prison <e> <s> i want to add my support and the support of my party to the way the government are handling this matter <e> <s> with my <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i have visited the maze prison and have been very much struck by the high standard of the conditions there for those prisoners who co-operate and that i do not think that the government should concede special privileges to terrorists <e> <s> it will be a tragedy if any of the hunger strikers dies just as it was a tragedy that their victims died or were maimed <e> <s> it is all part of the turmoil in northern ireland today <e> <s> does the minister not agree that the strife between the two communities will be healed but that it is going to need a great deal more patience coupled with a determination to see genuine wrongs righted and grievances sorted out <e> <s> i do not think these grievances and wrongs fall into the category that might be suggested by the question asked by the noble lord lord brockway <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for introducing this somewhat complex order <e> <s> i have listened as always with interest to what the noble lord lord blease has said <e> <s> the only thing i should like to say at this point is to congratulate the noble lord lord elton very sincerely on his promotion <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite catch what the noble lord lord blease asked but i should be grateful if the noble lord would explain whether this is any different from the rest of the united kingdom i beg your lordships pardon i realise that is what the noble lord lord blease said <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for explaining so fully the statement and i too should like to commend the order <e> <s> i wonder whether i might ask the minister this am i right in believing that the museums in northern ireland will be receiving no additional funds from government sources but at the same time no less <e> <s> am i right that any increase in funds is to be left opti <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> it is of course good to hear that people are giving up the dirty protest <e> <s> at the same time it is serious that one man has declared himself to be on hunger strike <e> <s> i think that it is part of the attitude in northern ireland of treating life cheaply whether it is ones own or that of other people <e> <s> i just hope that he can be deterred <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord the minister just one question to which i am sure he can give me a satisfactory answer <e> <s> it has been said by some prisoners that the government have gone back on terms that they have agreed in past cases <e> <s> if the noble lord can deny that i shall be very happy to hear it <e> <s> apart from that from these benches i can only add that we wholeheartedly support the government in resisting this demand for political status <e>", "<cs> my lords following that powerful speech by the noble lord lord underhill perhaps i might briefly once again draw the attention of the house to the critical unemployment situation in northern ireland consequent upon what the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for his explanation of this order and for his courtesy in supplying information in advance <e> <s> ever since i heard that these two orders for northern ireland had been held over to today i have pictured the plane-loads of ex-prime <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my great pleasure to be the first to congratulate the noble duke the duke of portland on his distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> he spoke with brevity and with great sincerity and skill and i waited with interest to see how non-controversial he would be <e> <s> the noble lord lord sudeley is to be congratulated on getting so many peers to put their names down to speak in this debate including the two maiden speakers better known still for their eminence under other names <e> <s> we shall look forward to hearing both of them in further debates in your lordships house when perhaps they will be may i say it <e> <s> even less inhibited than they were today <e>", "<cs> my lords i will speak only briefly among a list of speakers who have a much more intimate knowledge of the scene in northern ireland than i i support the view that the economy in the province is affected by three main factors first by the economic state of the united kingdom as a whole secondly by the cost of transport and the lack of indigenous energy the problem otherwise termed that of remoteness which was mentioned by the noble duke and thirdly by civil disturbance so sadly to the forefront today with all that it involves by way of terrorism rioting bombing and destruction which was mentioned by the noble lord lord blease <e> <s> all points it seems to me are influenced by one vital question which is whether the people of ulster wish to remain a part of the united kingdom <e> <s> the answer is taken as read that the majority does <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened as always with great interest to what the noble lord lord belstead said <e> <s> i have listened with fascination to the constitutional discourse of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i hope that the house will now bear with me if i concentrate largely but briefly on the bill as it affects northern ireland <e> <s> when the problem of what to do with maze prisoners who wanted to stand for election to westminster first arose i had little doubt that they should be debarred in future by law as was formerly the case and as was referred to by the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> that seemed the obvious course to follow but as i have considered the question more carefully i have come to believe that that is not the right one <e> <s> let me make my case <e> <s> i speak for myself although i trust my noble friends will not disagree with my conclusions <e>", "<cs> if i may i wish to speak only quite briefly <e> <s> i find the noble lord lord mishcon very persuasive and i should support him in the event of a division <e> <s> i cannot accept quite everything that he says but those points may have to be taken up later <e> <s> it seems to me the government have been accused rightly or wrongly of rushed legislation today and here is a case of not only rushing legislation but rushing one stage further <e> <s> the statutory time is four weeks as the noble lord lord mishcon has said and when it is a case of a man appealing against forfeiture of nomination for election to another place or of being disqualified i cannot see that this is not a reasonable step to take <e> <s> i would support the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if we can return to the affairs of northern ireland once again the two orders we are debating today recur unfortunately at regular intervals and there is a danger that it may be felt that one is being merely repetitive in debate <e> <s> at a time like the present the public look for some magic initiative <e> <s> i believe that the government can only carry steadily on for the time being largely as at present and that it would be a sign of weakness to change policy for the sake of being thought to have thought up something good rather than from real conviction <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton referred to the desire for some conjuring trick which alas <e> <s> is not available <e> <s> i do not believe that there is any quick easy solution of the problems of the province <e> <s> i am satisfied that the views expressed in the liberal manifesto for the may election are still sound <e> <s> i speak under the shadow of the death of another hunger striker mr joe mcdonnell to whom i spoke only four weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for so clearly explaining the need for the renewal of this order <e> <s> from these benches i should like to be associated with the praise for the courage and efficiency of the security forces and to say that we support the renewal of this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for his introduction of this order and also for the explanatory memorandum which he was kind enough to send me in advance <e> <s> there are a small number of questions i should like to ask him of which i have given notice <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord lord blease before his considerable battery of questions referred to the need for an advisory council but i do not think this is the time to go into that matter in more detail so i shall not pursue it for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that they are not directly related <e> <s> i was saying that so much is spent on salaries and so little on the environment as a contrast <e> <s> does the noble lord take my point <e> <s> i have been to northern ireland a number of times and i have seen that the environment could be improved in so many ways <e> <s> so much is paid on salaries and so little on the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take my first opportunity in debate to congratulate the noble earl lord gowrie on his appointment at the northern ireland office now quite some time ago <e> <s> over in the province a few weeks back it was obvious to me that he had already by then earned considerable respect particularly by his handling of affairs at the maze prison <e> <s> i wish him together with his right honourable friend the secretary of state every success and hopefully not too many frustrations <e> <s> i too should like to thank him for his introductory remarks this afternoon and for the explanatory memorandum that was circulated a little time back <e> <s> as there are further debates as the minister has said on northern <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble earl for his introduction to the order <e> <s> i have consulted the alliance party of northern ireland before speaking today and i should like to pay tribute to its courtesy and helpfulness <e> <s> some of what i want to say i have held over until the next debate <e> <s> it is certainly regrettable but i believe that it has been necessary that the emergency provisions should be continued by the acceptance of the order <e> <s> so far as possible the burden for maintaining law and order should rest as is present policy with the police with the army held in reserve and to be called on only in emergency <e> <s> internment is very often counter-productive <e> <s> the diplock courts are unfortunately still necessary the minister touched on this aspect and i believe that critics should be reminded that there are i understand no jury trials in the republic of ireland either <e> <s> they have problems with intimidation of would-be witnesses and juries similar to those in the province <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord moyola is to be congratulated on raising this important question with the government so skilfully even as late in pre-christmas proceedings as this <e> <s> i have also listened to the noble lord lord blease with respect and interest as always <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the minister for introducing and explaining this order <e> <s> i think it is a classic example of how complicated legal terminology can become and how comparatively simple the basic aims <e> <s> i am fascinated by the statement under references in enactments article subsection which runs <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for his clear introduction and explanation of the order <e> <s> there are a number of questions i wish to put to him about almost all of which i have given notice <e> <s> i listened to the remarks of the noble lord lord blease with interest <e> <s> my first question is to ask what was the cost to the british taxpayer of supporting the ulster economy for the most recent -month period for which figures are available <e> <s> the order shows that there are many points of outlay but perhaps most in the public mind at present are funds towards the electricity support grant to the de lorean car industry to which lord blease referred to harland and wolff for shipbuilding to short brothers for aircraft construction to the very worthwhile local enterprise development units and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his introduction of this order <e> <s> i would join with the noble lord lord boston in his condemnation of those who make the order necessary by their evil deeds and in his praise of those with the courage to stand up to the unfortunate results <e> <s> i think it is a safe assumption that no one in this house is in favour of terrorism <e> <s> the order is to continue for a further months the prevention of terrorism act <e> <s> therefore it might be assumed that everyone would support it automatically but i have heard it said that if the russians moved into northern ireland then terrorism would very soon be brought under control <e> <s> i believe that this highly improbable situation has an element of truth in it and it illustrates the point that one can feel that the processes of suppression of terrorism can be taken too far <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement for his right honourable friend <e> <s> i think that we are in danger of feeling a sense of anti-climax not only because of the tragic events in the falkland islands which dominate the political scene at the moment but also because on so many occasions the secretary of states proposals seem to have been published in the papers with little tables saying how the catholics react how the protestants react and that we should take no notice of it anyway <e> <s> but it is essential that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to thank the noble lord lord elton for so ably introducing the order and welcome him back to the dispatch box but he has disappeared <e> <s> nevertheless we are grateful to the noble lord for introducing the order in the noble earls absence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about this country at the moment <e> <s> i do not oppose the provisions in this order to check such action <e> <s> at the same time i am sure it is vital that rewards for labour are fairly distributed and are seen to be so <e> <s> that also of course can be the subject of a further major debate <e> <s> in summary i repeat that we believe this order is reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble viscount for this introduction to this order <e> <s> i wish to make only a few points and to put two questions of which i have given prior notice or perhaps i should word that differently and just say that i have given notice of them <e> <s> may i also pay great tribute to the work in this field undertaken by the noble lord lord blease <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister has introduced the bill with his customary skill <e> <s> may i congratulate him on his versatility after his duties last night on the employment bill <e> <s> i have listened with interest and encouragement to what the noble lord lord blease has said and to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge on the social democratic party bench <e> <s> i shall attempt to show why we on these benches and our colleagues in the other place support the aims of the secretary of state in what has been dubbed a package of rolling devolution <e> <s> we believe this to be a brave attempt that deserves every encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords this is entirely consequential on what we have debated and we too would like to support the order <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too thank the noble earl for his introduction of this order and acknowledge the particularly sincere concern of the noble lord lord hylton and the noble baroness who has just spoken <e> <s> in speaking just briefly may i start by welcoming the review of the working of the prevention of terrorism act which has been put in hand under the chairmanship of the noble earl lord jellicoe <e> <s> my party is doing all it can already to co-operate in its proceedings and investigations <e>", "<cs> i should like to say briefly that from these benches we support what has been said by the noble lords lord blease and lord donaldson in support of the government <e> <s> we oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement about these tragic events <e> <s> i am sure i speak for all my noble friends in recording shock horror and sorrow shock that such things can happen in this day and age involving all those who live or work in london more or less closely horror that men can seek to advance their ends by inflicting such suffering on their fellows and horror that anyone should be so filled with hatred as to deceive himself that such action can be anything but counter-productive and sorrow profound sorrow at the deaths and the injuries <e> <s> we certainly join in extending our most sincere sympathy to those who have suffered and to their relatives and friends <e> <s> this is not a time for party <e>", "<cs> my lords this northern ireland bill has been unamended in your lordships house <e> <s> we on these benches welcomed it at second reading and i now repeat that we wish it and the people of northern ireland well <e> <s> explanatory memoranda have suggested little certainty but much possibility as the noble earl has today so graphically reminded us for which i too thank him <e> <s> i quote the memoranda <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble earl lord gowrie for his full introduction of this order <e> <s> if i may i will leave detailed general analysis and questioning to other speakers as they wish <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the noble baroness lady birk for her concern over this matter and for introducing this debate <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the speech of the noble lord lord duncan-sandys <e> <s> i should like to put forward the reasons why i believe that the great majority of my colleagues here and in the other place distrust the use of the special development order procedure <e> <s> in fact this is the first time that an sdo has been used to grant planning permission in such detail on a specific site in an inner city area <e> <s> we fear that the secretary of state might feel tempted to move in on other sites of a similar nature and this was touched on by the noble lord which has been the subject of controversy for some time such as brixton town centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for introducing the order fairly briefly and once again i congratulate him on slipping from bill to order and back to bill with such apparent ease <e> <s> the order is consequential upon the passage of the northern ireland bill which we supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble viscount for introducing the order and i listened with interest to the remarks of the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> perhaps i might take this opportunity the first open to me to wish the noble lord lord blease well now that he is no longer speaking from the front bench <e> <s> he is the sort of person who gives one faith in the future of northern ireland <e> <s> the order is quite technical and when the word consolidation is used even with some restraint i feel inclined to leave it to more eminent heads than mine and i see no reason for not accepting the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl the minister for repeating the statement about the vicious bomb outrage at ballykelly yesterday <e> <s> when i spoke at the time of the london bombings last summer i said that i felt sure the whole house must have reacted with a sense of shock horror and sorrow <e> <s> those attacks were nearer home but i am sure that the feelings of the house must be just the same today shock that such a thing has happened horror at the mutilations the suffering and the agony which has been caused horror that people can so treat their fellow men sorrow and i repeat profound sorrow for all those whose lives will never be the same again to whom we send sincere sympathy at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl the minister for his introduction of this order <e> <s> it seems to be a logical follow-up to increase the number of westminster seats for ulster members of parliament <e> <s> we support the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for his introduction of this

but vociferous band who have proclaimed their opposition in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for introducing the order with which i entirely concur <e> <s>

of this order <e> <s> as we are having a more general debate later on i will confine myself to asking the minister four questions of which i have given him notice <e> <s> first can he give any more information about class ii no <e> <s> <e> <s> he did say something about ledu earlier on <e> <s> can he give more detail of how much is going on account to harland and wolff shorts and lear fan

promoting the tourist industry <e> <s> the amount allocated to this does not seem very large <e> <s> does he think the troubles have a seriously adverse effect <e> <s> thirdly on class iv no <e> <s> is the noble earl satisfied that enough is being spent on recreation considering the great need in a society with such high unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for his brief introduction <e> <s> i see no reason to oppose the order <e> <s> perhaps i might put two questions <e> <s> reference is made to international airports in northern ireland such as aldergrove <e> <s> are other airports planned <e> <s> secondly what is the meaning of the qualification in the explanatory blurb in the words so that to all intents and purposes international passengers departing from a recognised airport in any part of the uk will be subject to the same treatment under the law <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a vitally important question and i thank the noble lord lord hylton for his introduction of this debate <e> <s> i shall listen with interest to what further is said and i hope that the minister can reply with some optimism <e> <s> i was not altogether certain what represents a spiral of violence and i am more familiar with the term vicious circle <e> <s> in relation to the irish situation this term was unfortunately already in use more than years ago <e>

opinions of someone who might be sympathetic to the ira <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his intervention <e> <s> so we are left with the old double minority problem unresolved the present catholic minority in the north and the protestant minority in the whole of ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement which was made by the secretary of state in the other place <e> <s> we welcome the measures as a token of the governments concern for as was said the severe economic and social problems in northern ireland subject of course to further review and consideration <e> <s> in britain we are continually being pressed by those in ulster and elsewhere to do more to help overcome the great distress at present being experienced in ulster <e> <s> now on the advice and representation of the select committee on trade and industry the northern ireland assembly the industrial development board and others we are doing

<s> my party supports the present northern ireland assembly favours its deliberations by elected members and looks forward to a return to power sharing in the province <e> <s> one hopes that this could then be followed by the rolling devolution of powers in place of direct rule from westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble earl for his introduction of this order but although we shall not oppose it my party also is certainly not altogether happy about its introduction at this time <e> <s> i understand that it has been held in some quarters and i quote from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble earl for his introduction of this order which once again is designed to bring affairs in the province into line with the mainland <e> <s> i should just like to ask the minister whether any major differences will remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement made in another place by the prime minister <e> <s> we on these benches both liberal and sdp wholeheartedly support the meeting between dr garret fitzgerald and mrs thatcher <e> <s> it is indeed good news that with the

ireland affairs <e> <s> our task tonight is to consider whether this bill introduced with the most honourable intentions will help to that end <e> <s> as has been made clear the aim is to check the spread of hatred by making incitement to hatred an offence without having to prove that the accused consciously intended this <e> <s> it is worth re-emphasising that this will do no more than bring

good however that there are speakers from northern ireland here today <e> <s> i shall of course pay careful attention to what is said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for introducing these two orders <e> <s> first i deal with the northern ireland assembly dissolution order <e> <s> sadly the word that must occur to us all here is that in present circumstances dissolution is now inevitable <e> <s> as we have been reminded under the terms of the northern ireland act the assembly was given two functions first to consider and report on how a devolved northern ireland administration should be formed and secondly to monitor and report on the policies and activities of the northern ireland department <e> <s> both seemed such eminently sensible and constructive aims that we must deeply regret that the present assembly has lately been discharging neither function but it is important to remember that this order brings about dissolution rather than abolition <e> <s> we must sincerely hope that a reconstituted assembly will before too long be able and willing to discharge its duties to the full <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for introducing this order <e> <s> i propose to raise general points and in the main leave detailed inquiries into the finances to others <e> <s> to some extent they seem to be a recommendation for the medicine as before <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham speaks with experience but i shall be briefer for obvious reasons <e> <s> this is a long and technical order <e> <s> the idea and value of providing financial assistance to those who have brought property and then found it to be defective can hardy be challenged <e> <s> i should have thought that that would have been accepted as fair play <e> <s> i ask the minister just one question <e> <s> the implication here is that bad workmanship is not uncommon <e> <s> is that regrettably the true position <e>", "<cs> my

be brought into line with practice in england and wales and that that is sensible so far as it is practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for introducing this order <e> <s> one point that i should like to put to him is that he said its purpose is to bring northern ireland into line with the procedure in england and wales and he just touched on scotland <e> <s> without too much complication can he clarify the difference in the position in scotland and say why the system in england and wales is preferable <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a fairly technical order which i think there is no reason for us to oppose <e> <s> i should like however to ask for further clarification about article <e> <s> i am not quite clear about the significance of

queries have already been raised by the noble lord lord prysdavies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say quite briefly that we support this order <e> <s> as the minister said the intention is

future northern ireland assembly <e> <s> we are very glad to hear that there is such talk as the noble lord lord prys-davies mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for introducing the order <e> <s> before i proceed to deal with matters mainly of finance perhaps i may reaffirm from these benches our support for the governments stand over the anglo-irish agreement <e>", "<cs> my
